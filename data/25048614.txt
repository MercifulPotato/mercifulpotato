(I have no opinion on whether ASP.NET Core does it correctly.)<p>I do, it was done in a really weird way and I don&#x27;t care for the provided DI Abstractions nor the &#x27;Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration&#x27; namespace.<p>To take the &#x27;common&#x27; object used for configuration, the nuget package for IOptions&lt;T&gt; requires pulling in Microsoft&#x27;s DI Abstraction..<p>That&#x27;s the first sign of a smell. Config and DI can go hand in hand, <i>but they should still be orthogonal</i>.<p>The further you go down the DI stack, the more you can see that it&#x27;s an abstraction has a lot of tradeoffs for front-line devs in the name of using the same abstraction for the underlying framework.')
