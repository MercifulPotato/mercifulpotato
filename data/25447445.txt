There were a few jobs where some of the statistics and math were helpful, but in my long career, I&#x27;ve seen very little overlap between computer science and working as a software engineer.<p>I&#x27;m not challenging your experience, but I am replying to say that mine is the opposite.  I certainly have used quite a bit of theory (over a little more than 30 years), not so much explicitly as to think about the problem I&#x27;m working on before starting to code, or in the process of discussion about some code with coworkers.  Also has helped me look stuff up or learn new things.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;ve used it more than you think, but merely subconsciously?')
