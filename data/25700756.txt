Are you trying to say the cost of fracking is too high, and the US oil production will go down rapidly? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case. The cost of fracking is not constant, it keeps going down due to technological progress. See for example [1]. Also interest rates have come down lately (because Covid and such), and they&#x27;ll very likely stay down for a while. This stimulates industrial activity, and Oil and Gas Exploration and Production (E&amp;P) is just such an activity. More precisely, lower interest rates means E&amp;P companies have an easier time rolling over their loans, and also their funding cost is lower. That funding cost is a component of the &quot;cost of fracking&quot;.<p>To be honest though, there is no such thing as &quot;cost of fracking&quot;. Some analysts talk about this, but if you try to get into details you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s a bit of finger in the air. Here&#x27;s [2] a handbook put together by the OCC (bank regulator) that explains how the lending in this space is done and risk-managed. There&#x27;s no such thing as &quot;cost of fracking&quot;, and you&#x27;d think the oil producers bankers and their regulators would know a bit about this topic.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-oil-electric-fracturing-focus&#x2F;low-cost-fracking-offers-boon-to-oil-producers-headaches-for-suppliers-idUSKCN1VX112" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-oil-electric-fracturi...</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.occ.treas.gov&#x2F;publications-and-resources&#x2F;publications&#x2F;comptrollers-handbook&#x2F;files&#x2F;oil-gas-exploration-prod-lending&#x2F;index-oil-gas-exploration-production-lending.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.occ.treas.gov&#x2F;publications-and-resources&#x2F;publica...</a>')
