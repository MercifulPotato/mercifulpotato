The most major one for me is protocol engineering - there&#x27;s a whole world out there on this. Others would be model based design and its formal verification. Also several problems in state synchronization in distributed systems.<p>In many of these cases, the team I joined had a code base in place that &quot;kind of&quot; did the solution, but was not grounded in any conceptual model - despite phenomenal code quality, peer reviews, etc. Recasting it as an implementation of a well-studied formal model generally yielded a codebase that was one-tenth the size of the original, and with far fewer defects. As I said in the parent comment, if you aren&#x27;t familiar with this kind of stuff, you don&#x27;t know about it, so you don&#x27;t use it, so you find other (suboptimal) ways to do it.')
