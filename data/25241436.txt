You might think &quot;oh that&#x27;s a good thing, they get paid more&quot;. Except they don&#x27;t.

Your _actual_ &quot;purchasing power&quot; remained exactly the same as the day before.<p>What Amazon is doing here, which I find to be a pretty blatant case of a &quot;bad thing&quot; rather than a &quot;good thing&quot;, is they are artificially increasing manual labor salaries by shoveling in money from all their other divisions, such as AWS.<p>The only thing you will see from this, as I had just mentioned, is a price hike to account for inflation, however in the meantime there will be a number of industries struggling to find workers at affordable salaries because companies like Amazon can just keep playing a different sort of game.<p>To give you an analogy, it&#x27;s like VCs shoveling money in to startups to prop them up and keep them on top of their advertising channels and pay for employees, even though the company itself could not possibly survive without that kind of capital.<p>The wages here do not make sense for the labor market, but Amazon has so much money stocked up from all their other channels, and of course, the various shady government kickbacks that you are unaware of, that they just don&#x27;t give a fuck.')
