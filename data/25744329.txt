It&#x27;s how every privacy invasion or abuse of position of the past decade+ has been justified: &quot;we made the product cheaper and better for you, any change will cost a lot and break it&quot;.<p>Because yes, this can be used to justify close to anything that is in the interest of the company even if it&#x27;s to the customer&#x27;s disadvantage. Those features usually bring money to a company so removing them would be a loss. On top of that you can always attach that generic claim that any change will cause the system to implode and will also make your cat feral.<p>Well, some of that may be true but it doesn&#x27;t mean we should use it as a justification to keep doing things like that. Products can be built with the consumer&#x27;s best interest in mind at little additional cost if any. The problem is the consumer&#x27;s best interest usually brings in less money.')
