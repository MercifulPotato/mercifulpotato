All the drives on the desktops are encrypted, all long jobs and services are run on&#x2F;from the desktops, the desktops are on Debian stable and the laptop and tv are on testing.<p>If the day comes that I can&#x27;t get a laptop that I can unfuck, I guess I&#x27;ll just have to work in a remote desktop on a VM in one of the servers. I can always keep the laptop  and devices from chattering through the routers. I do have a real fear that it might become hard to find routers that I can install OpenWrt on, or that OpenWrt might go the way of Firefox.')
