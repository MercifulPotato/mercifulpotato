The 2018 estimate was 205 people, almost all of whom live in a single building, the Begich Towers.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Begich_Towers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Begich_Towers</a><p>&gt; The Begich Towers Condominium is a building in the small city of Whittier, Alaska. The structure is notable for operating like a small-scale arcology, being the residence for nearly the entire population of the city, as well as containing many of its public facilities. This has earned Whittier the nickname of a &quot;town under one roof&quot;.')
