This man wasn&#x27;t in Russia on some clandestine mission. He was there as a CIA agent to meet with Russian intelligence. They didn&#x27;t need to send him a message that he knew who he was, or what he was doing, because his identity and the purpose of his visit was already in all of their calendars. You&#x27;d presume that message was sent when they RSVP&#x27;d the meeting.')
