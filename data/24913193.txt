DeepMind still beat the best humans there pretty comfortably, with similar amounts of training to what allowed it to compete with the best engines in chess and shogi.<p>I&#x27;d expect AlphaZero to hammer the best humans given a similar amount of training (~100,000 2017 TPU-hours) in this shogi variant, so no increased training time at all by that metric. Maybe a more meaningful metric is how closely it approaches perfect play, but we don&#x27;t have a good way to measure that.')
