It&#x27;s C++ and it depends on libraries that aren&#x27;t even shipped by a lot of distributions (folly &amp; fbthrift). And, tbh, I don&#x27;t see much benefit given that FUSE these days doesn&#x27;t seem to be significantly worse in terms of performance.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d need to setup a full build server&#x2F;system though because I need to regularly update them with new modules.<p>Overlay the mounted read-only fs with a read-write fs. Then you can install modules as you like and if you want to start fresh, just throw away the read-write fs. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done in the past.')
