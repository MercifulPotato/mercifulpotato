Our first product is a free Chrome extension that adds Notion or Slack-like slash commands to Google Docs.<p>You can insert things like: \n- Headings: &#x2F;h1, &#x2F;h2, &#x2F;h3\n- Links: &#x2F;link\n- Emojis: &#x2F;emoji \n- Giphy: &#x2F;giphy \n- Unsplash: &#x2F;unsplash \n- Tables: &#x2F;table CxR(ex: 5x2)\n- Lists: &#x2F;ul, &#x2F;ol<p>It&#x27;s 100% private by design. We built the app using React.js, Typescript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL + Apollo + TypeGraphQL, Firebase Auth, and Vercel for deployments.<p>Right now we&#x27;re looking for as much feedback as possible and would love to know what we could build next to save you time in Google Docs!<p>Cheers,\nChristoph &amp; Jer')
