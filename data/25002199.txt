I don&#x27;t buy that argument.<p>For class names it might be true that long compound names are driven by auto suggestions from the IDE. But I&#x27;m wondering if they&#x27;re really as bad as their reputation. Somehow it&#x27;s similar as for variables. You can still come up with more meaningful names if you want but I admit that auto suggestions do more harm there.')
