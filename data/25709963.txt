We permit the government to do some things that individuals are not permitted to do, out of necessity, because we have yet to construct a society that eliminates the need for certain ostensibly necessary evils. We find that delegating those responsibilities to a corporate body that is largely (if imperfectly) answerable to the population as a whole for its actions tends to result in better outcomes than any other alternative that&#x27;s been tried. The actual execution of those responsibilities then gets sub-delegated out to individuals, but they are supposed to only be permitted to do so when lawfully acting on behalf of the government. Again, out of necessity. While it&#x27;s not awesome, anything else anyone has tried so far has ended up working out even worse.<p>As individuals acting on their own behalf, though, nobody should be considered above the norms of civil society. By definition - if it didn&#x27;t work that way, society would not be civil.<p>(I&#x27;d highly recommend reading both <i>A Theory of Justice</i> by John Rawls and <i>Anarchy, State and Utopia</i> by Robert Nozick for two different but equally thoughtful treatments of this sort of thing.)')
