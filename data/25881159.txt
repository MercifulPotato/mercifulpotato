It takes me (at work) 5 minutes to log in; 2 minutes to open a MS office app or email; 5-10s to save a document; 20s to insert a row in Excel. Please send help.<p>The answer to your question depends: For office settings like I described, it may be due to forced network requests, and surveillance&#x2F;compliance software. More broadly, it&#x27;s unoptimized software, and various pieces of software competing for resources and scheduling. A mirror that may be easier to GROK is the web: Web apps can be small and responsive by using targeted DOM-manipulation. Most web apps use layers of frameworks, cookies, trackers etc that make them take up much more space, and make them less responsive.<p>In order to fix this, we may need a new generation of operating systems and software, built from scratch, with a focus on performance (ie responsiveness).<p>This is one of the reasons I&#x27;ve gotten so excited about embedded and low-level programming: You can ditch the OS, and make programs that respond in a way that feels instantaneous.')
