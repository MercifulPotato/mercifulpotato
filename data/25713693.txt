Imagine you not being able to express what you currently wrote - openly, and being modded out, your message never seeing the light of day because someone somewhere could possibly worry that they will lose advertisers who chose to misinterpret it as a call to violence. \nWe are currently there.<p>PS - I believe what you wrote can lead to extreme violence, yet the world has the right to see (and likely not react violently at all but should even the slightest possibility allow censorship?)')
