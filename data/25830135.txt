Item(by='YZF', descendants=None, kids=[25830168], score=None, time=1611032013, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829650, text='You just need enough margin with steppers so you don&#x27;t lose steps.  Particularly during accelerations.  That margin shouldn&#x27;t need to be x10.  It also depends on what screws you&#x27;re using and whether there&#x27;s any other reduction.  You can get huge linear forces from a relatively tiny stepper.  You&#x27;re also going to need margins with a closed loop DC brushless&#x2F;servo system otherwise while you won&#x27;t lose your position you will get a position error.<p>There&#x27;s also systems with steppers and encoders.<p>A common issue though is that the steppers are driven at too low of a voltage.  You also want the right kind of driver that PWMs a high enough voltage to maintain the current at speed.  That&#x27;s because as the speed goes up the motor has higher back-EMF voltage that the driver needs to overcome.  Constant voltage drive really suffers as the motor speeds up.<p>But sure, DC brushless + servos are nice, more expensive, and require more expensive controllers.')
