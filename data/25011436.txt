Why you think it should be the students is a total mystery to me though.<p>The university is irresponsibly forcing the students to come on campus to study (a health risk) so they have to pay rent and is desperately trying to restrict their movement&#x2F;freedoms to decrease the likelihood&#x2F;speed at which the government shuts the whole thing down and sends everyone home.<p>The students certainly aren&#x27;t getting what they paid for. Far from it. There&#x27;s been a material change in the &quot;product&quot; they are getting and they should be released from the contract from it on those grounds.<p>If the university can&#x27;t survive without the rental income and the government wants to save it, then they can do that, but it&#x27;s not the students responsibility to willingly be defrauded to ensure the financial stability of an institution they have no stake in.')
