But anyways, life itself is built on computational processes. Most of these processes are “purpose-built” to accomplish very specific tasks, but in humans the development of a massive cortex created something of a general-purpose computer. Consciousness seems to be the necessary compromise to run such an embodied computer on top of all the other functions of the brain that serve to keep us alive.')
