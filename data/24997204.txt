Some vegetables have a very high yield (potato, tomato, carots). Hens&#x2F;eggs also have a very good yield, most farms used to have hens.<p>It&#x27;s nowhere near self sufficiency though. The amount and the variety of things you eat today is tremendous and coming from many places, you&#x27;re not going to cultivate a fraction of that at home.<p>If you&#x27;re talking bare subsistence, 1-2 acres of wheat should be enough to feed a family in grain&#x2F;bread.')
