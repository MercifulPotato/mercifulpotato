The whole reason for a lockdown is that there are irresponsible and reckless people who don&#x27;t abide by the rules voluntarily, and consequently they are directly and actively spreading the disease.<p>Making these rules mandatory and enforcing them does not have an impact in the attitudes of said responsible and reckless people towards the need to act responsibly.')
