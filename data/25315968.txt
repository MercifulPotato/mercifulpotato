Indeed we must ask if epidemiology is a science at all.<p>Interviewing 700 epidemiologists is a fool&#x27;s errand providing no useful information. One might as well simplify the selection criteria and interview 700 (or better, simply 30) people of above-average intelligence.<p>ree2OSS says<i>&gt;&quot;Physicians are not scientists, they aren&#x27;t supposed to make policy decisions.&quot;&lt;</i><p>I agree with the first sentence but not with the second. Most medical organizations&#x2F;hospitals&#x2F;institutions&#x2F;clinics are headed up by physicians who make policy decisions all day long.')
