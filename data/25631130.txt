I&#x27;d say the CCP is the most powerful group in the world right now. That they can control billionaires like that is impressive and scary.<p>I have to admit, a one party system does seem like the best type of government, on paper. It can be more efficient and do things much faster than anything else. Billionaires can&#x27;t just pay politicians to create&#x2F;modify laws in their favour. And for the average citizen, life&#x27;s the same as in a democracy.<p>But that only works if the party is working for the country, gives people a decent amount of freedom and listens to their needs.<p>When the party no longer keeps the people content (which seems inevitable, looking at history), there&#x27;s practically no way to change it besides a violent revolution. That&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> drawback, and the reason we&#x27;re better off with a slower democratic system that doesn&#x27;t have a single point of (catastrophic) failure.<p>Modern China seems to work a lot like Imperial China. Just with different names for the emperor and his officials, more freedom and rights for the population, as well as more means to keep them in check.')
