Not that there was any reason to be using Excel for this, but it&#x27;s a bit unfair to blame Microsoft for something they never claimed XLS could do, and provided a much better capacity in XLSX 13 years ago.<p>Again, it&#x27;s hard to cry too many tears for Microsoft, but it does seem a bit off-target to blame &quot;Excel&quot; for this...')
