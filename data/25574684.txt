And my phone is even worse! But I often want to journal in bed or write fiction away from my desk. Are there better ways to input lots of text quickly?<p>I hate to suggest you buy things to improve your experience, but I had the same issue earlier this year. The Magic Keyboard really is just that, delivers a 95% equivalent of a computer keyboard that allows me to enter long-form text comfortably on an iPad Pro. My n of 1 and all that but I&#x27;ve found it to be a suitable quick-boot alternative when I just want to write a couple paragraphs down instantly.')
