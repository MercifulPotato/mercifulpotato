I&#x27;d never heard of CircleUp before this, and their slogan &quot;Creating a transparent and efficient market to drive innovation for consumer brands&quot; still doesn&#x27;t tell me what exactly it is that they do.  Obviously they have investors and customers who found it worthwhile, but is it <i>really</i> worth sacrificing your health &amp; family on this altar?<p>That said, I do wonder how Elon Musk, who&#x27;s simultaneously trying to send humanity to Mars, convert the world to electric cars and solar panels, and create direct neural uplinks doesn&#x27;t crack from the pressure though.')
