I know these abstract consultancies have a use, but they seem to target what managers and executives _want_ to hear instead of the truth.<p>e.g.:\n&quot;The promises that were made to executive leadership about the latest technology are not coming to fruition quickly enough.&quot;<p>It feels like he then proceeds to talk about how management can get the developers &quot;organized&quot; to make sure they get the job done. Having a developer doing support for the day kinda sorta seems like a nice idea until you realize that &quot;Isn&#x27;t that what the manager is supposed to do? Understand his team and get what they need&#x2F;negotiate with other teams so that they can just get their work done?&quot; It&#x27;s kinda like he&#x27;s telling managers how to outsource their work to someone else. Pass the buck and live in a fairyland.<p>I know people who idolize Thought Works, Martin Fowler, Uncle Bob, and others in the &quot;consulting set&quot;-- but it seems like they fill a particular niche, and it isn&#x27;t the phenomenal tech experts, it is more of the &quot;how management views tech from an academic level and how we can get these interchangeable programmer cogs to get our project done w&#x2F; the least amount of effort&quot;. They rarely give hard advice, it is more of soft exposure to &quot;new tech&quot; and &quot;here&#x27;s something that works for some people, you might be that person&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;d love to sell you on new tech that will be a silver bullet for all your problems&quot;<p>In any case, I learned some interesting stuff from the article, and I do think it is a valuable read.')
