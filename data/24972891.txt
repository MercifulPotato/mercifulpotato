Between the rear rack, the panniers, and the trailer I can haul a lot of groceries. But you are right that it&#x27;s a good idea to have at least one car in a family. Especially in the US. Although I would check first that it isn&#x27;t cheaper to get a rental or a taxi when you need it. The only reason I still have my current car is because it&#x27;s already paid for anyways and doesn&#x27;t cost much to keep around.')
