Just remember the recent(-ish) Oculus controversy, where they forced everyone who bought their hardware to sign in with Facebook and in some cases (soft-)bricked users devices because their Facebook accounts did not have enough activity [1]. Especially because Palmer Luckey (founder of Oculus) when answering questions about the acquisition in 2014 said that Facebook would not do such a thing [0].<p>I personally am scared because the language being used here is not at all specific to the scenario mentioned here (&quot;hosted clients&quot;). I understand that anything more specific would probably be rejected by their legal team. I am afraid that some 5 years down the line they&#x27;ll be able to do something worse without notifying users because the TOCs and privacy policies are written in this ambiguous language.<p>Regarding alternatives, I can&#x27;t really speak on the security&#x2F;privacy of any of them but from what I can gather, Matrix does have E2E-encryption functionality [2] so I&#x27;m not quite sure how it is less secure than Signal (provided you host your own server and&#x2F;or have a reasonable degree of trust in the server-operator of your conversation-partner).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cgmagonline.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;oculus-founder-facebook-vr-comments&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cgmagonline.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;oculus-founder-facebo...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eurogamer.net&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-10-15-oculus-quest-2s-are-being-bricked-by-facebook-account-merge-issues" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eurogamer.net&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-10-15-oculus-quest-2...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;06&#x2F;cross-signing-and-end-to-end-encryption-by-default-is-here" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;06&#x2F;cross-signing-and-end-to-...</a>')
