For 99% of users, code completion, syntax highlighting, etc are not requirements either, because 99% of users do not program.<p>In retrospect, it should be obvious that Emacs users are heavily weighted towards using org mode, because that&#x27;s part of Emacs&#x27;s value proposition. It makes sense that most VSCode users do not need&#x2F;want org mode, because otherwise they&#x27;d be using Emacs, and not VSCode.<p>In almost every thread about Emacs, I always find the comparisons with VSCode amusing, given that the two programs serve very different purposes.  The bulk of my Emacs usage has nothing to do with coding, so I personally don&#x27;t see the value of comparing it with VSCode, and pointing out that VSCode is better is sort of irrelevant. Of course, this being HN, there is a programming bias. But it&#x27;s the equivalent of saying &quot;mplayer sucks because it cannot do video editing as good as some video editing tool.&quot;[1] It&#x27;s great that you have found a good video editing tool, but that tool doesn&#x27;t do much of what I use mplayer for.<p>[1] mplayer has extremely rudimentary video editing capabilities,')
