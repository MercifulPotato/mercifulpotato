Even if I take your premise that it “barely kills” (and 1.7m people would disagree) the UK health system has a huge backlog of routine operations to get through due to the number of people requiring treatment (even if they don’t die). When we have a virus this infectious, and we have a treatment available, why should we allow someone’s “freedom” to jeopardise the health and well-being of others? Should we allow the option of declining the vaccine but ban the person from using public health care if they catch the disease? Sounds dystopian but seems fair.<p>Edit: I understand this is a topic people have strong opinions on but downvoting simply because you disagree is useless. Engage in debate. Respond.')
