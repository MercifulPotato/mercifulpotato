Before that I was an openwrt user.<p>I admit it was a bit nerve-wracking knowing that I&#x27;d be losing my Internet while the transition was in progress. In the end, it only took 5-10 mins to install OpenBSD itself and another hour or so to configure dhcpd, pf, unbound. Granted, I spent a few hours reading man pages and documentation before hand in preparation.<p>Wireguard took me a little bit longer but it&#x27;s actually part of the kernel since OpenBSD 6.8 which is great. I don&#x27;t think pfsense supports this yet in-kernel, but I could be wrong.<p>I have yet setup anything further than this except for automated borg backup to rsync.net.<p>In the end I&#x27;m extremely happy with my decision to move despite knowing that my apu2d4 won&#x27;t achieve gigabit speeds pfsense on the same hardware is capable of. My Internet is only 200mbps so it&#x27;s not an issue and if I upgrade I&#x27;ll probably get a protectli.<p>While I feel the pfsense project is great, I simply feel more confident using command-line instead of web UIs and also knowing precisely how the system is setup without the pfsense magic.')
