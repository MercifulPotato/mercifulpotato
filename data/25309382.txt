Sounds reasonable to me. There&#x27;s no RCT to definitively prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it will prevent someone who has received the vaccine from transmitting virus to another person <i>under any circumstances, no matter how unusual.</i><p>Remember the claims at the start of this thread were:<p>&quot;They [vaccines] do not—and are not meant to—prevent people from contracting and spreading the virus. They only reduce the symptoms.&quot;<p>Albert isn&#x27;t saying <i>any</i> of that stuff, so why on earth would I disagree with him?<p>Article goes on to say &quot;In November, Pfizer announced that its vaccine candidate had been shown to be more than 90 percent effective at preventing COVID-19&quot;<p>Aaaaaand so we&#x27;re back at my comment before this one. What do they mean by &#x27;prevent?&#x27; Because they&#x27;re saying it &#x27;prevents&#x27; COVID-19, just like the CDC did in the quote I shared that svrb got so angry at me about.<p>You guys are saying the vaccine does <i>nothing</i> to prevent people from getting SARS-CoV-2, but the CDC, and the articles <i>you yourself are sending me</i> are saying that the damn thing &#x27;prevents&#x27; COVID-19, which is an infection with SARS-CoV-2.<p>Is the vaccine magically making people asymptomatic while an infection rages inside of them? Is it preventing a virus that destroys lung tissue from somehow showing any outward signs of dyspnea? Is it somehow blocking a cytokine storm? I don&#x27;t think so, that&#x27;s how Dexamethosone is being used to treat this, not vaccines. Maybe in the long run by shifting Th1&#x2F;Th2 response or something, but that would have quickly become apparent in the routine labs done in the process of clinical trials. Does it magically break up thromboemboli in the bloodstream? How would a vaccine prevent kidney damage from showing up in someone with a raging, yet completely asymptomatic infection?<p><i>What is the mechanism by which a vaccine would allow a raging infection to occur inside of someone, while showing zero outward signs of it?</i> Because if it&#x27;s knocking down levels of active virus in the body by triggering a robust T and B-cell response, it&#x27;s reducing viral shedding, and it&#x27;s reducing transmission. <i>That&#x27;s the same thing that all the papers you have shared with me so far have indicated.</i><p>What do you want me to say?<p>Don&#x27;t sneeze on grandma until she gets vaccinated. I said that earlier.')
