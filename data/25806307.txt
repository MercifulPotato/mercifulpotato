In this case that would probably be a good thing, since the subdomains represent independent sites, but if a site were erroneously added that could be a problem (mail.yahoo.com and groups.yahoo.com should share login cookies, for example).<p>The list was originally created to handle cookies, but more recently it&#x27;s been used for other notions of &quot;site&quot;, like cache sharding.')
