The current subjective whims are clearly not good enough and they&#x27;ve gotten so powerful that human judgment isn&#x27;t acceptable.  I would say the same about Twitter&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Youtube&#x2F;etc.<p>I suspect the hardest part would be defining it in such a way as to disallow Parler but still allow Twitter et al.  Which, kind of proves the point of people who are suggesting Parler is being held to a different standard than the others.<p>IIWM (which of course it is not) I would start with something like, &quot;Platform has a system in place to provide early detection of explicitly violent content at a rate of at least ${x}%.  Platform has a system in place to allow users to report content in violation of the platform, and review of reports is completed within ${y} hours.&quot;<p>Of course what is &quot;violent&quot; is subjective too.  To some people talking about hanging a person is not violent, while to others calling someone by the wrong pronouns is violence.  A common standard would indeed be hard, but I think it is important.')
