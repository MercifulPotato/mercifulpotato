It&#x27;s easy to see that UK excess deaths peaked in early April at a weekly rate nearly 4 times that of the highest pre-2020 peak (2018-01). Ideally, we&#x27;d avoid a repeat of that.<p>&gt; This absolutely seems like a coordinated global action to achieve some kind of strategic aim.<p>Could said aim by any chance be to avoid running out of hospital beds?')
