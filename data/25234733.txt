My recollection is similar to yours. The fix on DOS might be something arcane related to config.sys files or whatever but if you banged at it long enough you could often (though certainly not always) get something to work eventually. Macs were more likely to just work out of the box. But if it didn&#x27;t, you pretty much gave up because there was much less to twiddle with.')
