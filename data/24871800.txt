At that point, it&#x27;s no different than saying &quot;people chase what they value&quot;. That&#x27;s trivially obvious; the chasing of social status is a subset criteria meant to say &quot;people chase what they value, and what they value is social standing defined by their desired in-group&quot;. That can be quite different  because the trivial condition can have people chasing all sorts of non-socially minded goals. Regardless, the original point was that when people can&#x27;t concretely define what they value, they often defer to chase that which their society values.<p>Using a &quot;singular global social order&quot; is a bit of a straw man. It doesn&#x27;t have to global, just like it can&#x27;t be individual.')
