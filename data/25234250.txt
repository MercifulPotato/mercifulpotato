The actual comment is specific about the pattern of problematic comments they observed:<p>* They suggest that Black people are in general SJWs<p>* They attempt to litigate affirmative action rather than the claims in the article<p>* They argue that Black employees passed over for promotion were underqualified.<p>* They dismiss the entire article on the basis of it having appeared in the New York Times.<p>Take issues with any of these specific complaints if you want, but don&#x27;t pretend that the comment simply said &quot;there aren&#x27;t enough anti-Coinbase comments here&quot;, because they didn&#x27;t say that at at all.')
