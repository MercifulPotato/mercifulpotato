(to the extent I understand it. Which might be entirely wrong)<p>The farther we progress techologically the less can be salvaged in the aftermath of a collapse.<p>I have done a bit of manual soldering earlier in my life. \nThis was simple stuff but I switched out memory chips.  Switched out ROMS (only way to update some machines)<p>Primarily, zx81 (that you could get as a kit) zx spectrum and then what I consider my first real computer the Atari ST.<p>I have not performed any such surgery since my ST.<p>Looking at motherboards if various types we have now requires a lot more precision to “fix”<p>If you found 3 broken motherboards for the latest version of an I9 it would I think be difficult to cannibalize. Parts to get one working motherboard.<p>One these old computers it would be possible.<p>I presume that is one of the reasons the author talks about the z80. I am very familiar with the generations Sinclair used.<p>And there are genuinely massive amounts of them in various less sexy roles as controllers for electric appliances.<p>I wonder how far in the Intel PC evolution one could realistically salvage and make Frankenstein computers out of.<p>Storage would be a problem.  \nHard disks are complicated and prone to fail more so after a collapse I am sure.<p>Getting production of floppy drives going is not trivial either<p>Say the collapse hapoens in 20 years there will not be easy to find huge collections of 3.5 5 or 8 disks<p>Casette takes are also getting rare. Though some appear to think it retro and it is making a comeback now.<p>VHS tapes would be nice.')
