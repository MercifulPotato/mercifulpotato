Starts with:<p>&quot;So far, hearing that cyber risks of the Capitol attack were low.<p>* Congress isn&#x27;t one big network\n* Vulnerable machines held unclassified files\n* Hill leaks so much already that truly sensitive stuff is walled off\n* Rioters weren&#x27;t there long enough for thorough, careful access&quot;\n[...]\nFor those wondering about the SCIFs, used for classified files and conversations, their doors were built to withstand embassy sieges, and they’re swept for bugs before every use.<p>We haven’t seen any indication that they were even targeted, much less seriously attacked. Could one of the terrorists have seen a sensitive but unclassified email somewhere? Yes.<p>Could there have been Russian spies in the terrorist mob? Yes.&quot;')
