You will not find clearly actionable data nor systematic rules for figuring this stuff out.<p>That subjectivity doesn&#x27;t stop people from trying to quantify this stuff, like for example, those insipid HR-driven DISC personality surveys and workshops. Some folks dive into minutia about Myers-Briggs classification. There&#x27;s grains of truth in all these approaches, but it never works the way it was intended. HR departments and individuals aren&#x27;t psychometric professionals, and even if they were, what they could actually use this for in a workplace isn&#x27;t at all clear even in the best case scenario.<p>IMHO, the way you identify a destructive leadership pattern is by having experienced it before (as well as its opposite), by being mindful of your interactions with others and with organizational politics, and being self-critical of your own reactions to it. None of that is easy, It can&#x27;t be learned in advance. It takes experience, trial and error.')
