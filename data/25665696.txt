Mostly because the idea that a coup was possible was kind of laughable.  That sort of attitude has given him and his supporters space to sort of play coup.  As in they could say whatever they wanted because everyone, including those saying it, thought nothing would come of it.<p>But this is the end of play time.  It&#x27;s a real world consequence.  And a shocking one at that.  It was a violent attempt to take over the seat of power and prevent the democratic transfer of power.<p>It&#x27;s not a play coup anymore.  Trump and his supporters are an attempting an honest to goodness actual coup.  He needs to face consequences.  IMHO, impeachment isn&#x27;t enough.  More like he can peacefully hand over power or Jan 20th 12:01 PM put him on a plane to Guantanamo until such time it&#x27;s safe to try him for treason.')
