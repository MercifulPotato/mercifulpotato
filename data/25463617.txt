If he was involved there, that ties it all together.<p>I.e., there were not ever, actually, any such experiments, or any of the other obvious BS. There was, instead, an operation to convince people that there <i>had</i> been such experiments. The operation was a success: people do believe it, to this day.<p>&quot;Men Who Stare at Goats&quot; is a terrifying book by Jon Ronson exploring the program. You have to read between the lines to pick up the full consequence.<p>This stuff has all the hallmarks of such an operation. It is hard to imagine what point it could have. What we know that we don&#x27;t know is what they are up to, or why. The patent language is spume blown off the top of the wave. The wave itself we have no information about.<p>Talking about &quot;intergalactic flight&quot; is fundamentally the kookiest bit. What galaxy would you fly to, and why? There are a trillion solar systems a thousand times closer, in our own galaxy. Surely one or two of those would be of some interest? Or a planet, a trillion times closer than that?')
