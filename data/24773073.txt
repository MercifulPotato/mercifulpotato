Even if we extrapolate the verified accuracy of predicting other stuff over to this event, we surely can&#x27;t know we&#x27;re right?<p>The article seems to be suggesting that this can be accurately estimated, but I feel like this would be a stronger claim if they cited something that was predicted and actually did happen...<p>Perhaps I misinterpreted the paragraph?')
