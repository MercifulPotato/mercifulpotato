Why does this have anything to do with discrimination? The cynic in me is getting the world&#x27;s tiniest violin out for a corporate executive who hasn&#x27;t been allowed to have a second corporate executive job, but I do understand how the policy might be unfair (though every contract I&#x27;ve ever signed has had something to the effect that I wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do that, but I&#x27;m in the UK and a peon so :shrug:).
