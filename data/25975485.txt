It’s a state issue. The Central government cannot legislate on the subject, it’s on the state list of subjects. You are criticizing the central government for a law a bunch of state governments passed decades ago!!<p>There is a Hindu Marriage Act and other religious marriage acts. The difference is all but the Muslim marriage acts essentially are very similar to typical western laws other than certain technical details like when in a ceremony a couple is considered married etc. The only exceptions to this are that under the Hindu Marriage Act multiple spouses are permitted with the consent of all spouses and ... well everything in the Muslim Marriage Act.<p>A Muslim woman can choose to be married under the special marriage act but most are not educated, don’t know they can, are pressured not to and it has to be done before marriage. It may forbid triple talaq but other provisions like custody and alimony still apply. And consider what it took to get even that passed. Protests, crazy ones just like for the CAA. And of course it’s repeal was one of the demands of the CAA protestors.')
