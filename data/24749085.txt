Someone asks you to do something, but you don&#x27;t know what they are going to ask. You do the thing that they have requested live on stream, e.g.: Holding up a USB cable. That person who made the request knows that you did not know what they were going to request, so they know that they are watching a live stream and not a recording.<p>However, third parties watching the stream have no proof that this wasn&#x27;t a coordinated trick prepared in advance.')
