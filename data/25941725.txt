But if you can believe this, the very, very largest Wall Street firms, (Citadel, Sigma2, etc.) those with trillion dollar balance sheets got a special exemption from the SEC : rather than having to &quot;find&quot; shares to borrow, they can &quot;manufacture&quot; shares, using their massive balance sheets as collateral. This is how 140% of GameStonk can be shorted. It is this unfair playing field that r&#x2F;wallstreetbets is fighting against.  Since the short exceeds the float, it is possible that there could be an &quot;infinite&quot; short squeeze, that even if they took the company private by buying every available share, there would still be another 40% outstanding they would have to cover.
