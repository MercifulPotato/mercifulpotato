Quite the opposite, commercial PLs like Go, Kotlin, Swift and the .NET CLI family come with extensive and often surprisingly well-considered standard libraries, and even open-source projects do better than JS (the standout being probably Elixir since it inherits Erlang&#x2F;OTP).  The idea that JS&#x27;s ecosystem is the template for future languages seems unsound, which is thankfully a relief since it would also be so disheartening.')
