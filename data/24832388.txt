There&#x27;s literally only two reasons for paid DM&#x27;s to exist - A) they offer said premium experience or B) there&#x27;s a huge imbalance of players to DM&#x27;s. Not everybody wants to pay the money it would require to have a Matthew Mercer as their DM, and if more people just realized that being a DM is not the intimidating&#x2F;tedious&#x2F;boring job they thing it is there wouldn&#x27;t be such a huge imbalance.<p>I guess I don&#x27;t want to say you <i>cannot</i> make a living off being a paid DM, but you will have to be in the top percentiles to justify your price doing so and compete in a shallow market. Everyone else is on borrowed time until the player:dm balance naturally normalizes, and speaking as a DM myself I do my utmost to convince others to give it a shot because it&#x27;s an incredibly enjoyable and rewarding experience.')
