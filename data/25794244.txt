There were live streams from these protests and riots every night, many of which include numerous incidents of explosives being hurled at police and fired being lit.  Its not an issue of trust - the hundreds of archived videos containing thousands of hours of live footage of these many protests and riots is easily available to anyone who wants to examine the proof with their own eyes.  This isn&#x27;t an issue of ideology, its a matter of documented history and objective reality.
