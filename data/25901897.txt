I finished my degree and landed a job at an amazing tech company. It was all awesome - and then I started running into issues focussing at work. My boss was horrendous (my point of view) and the place was insane to work for. I was eventually fired.<p>Introspecting on these events, I realised I had ADHD and I was just never diagnosed as a child. If I&#x27;d only known this before, I&#x27;d make the most of my job opportunity with the knowledge that I had ADHD. The cost of not knowing was close to 2 years of mental trauma for myself, and my family. It was being forced to let go of approx 1&#x2F;3 of the value of my mortgage in stocks. And it is living with the PTSD of having been fired from a prestigious position for performance issues. Well, onwards.')
