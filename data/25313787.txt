This is not imagined -- many people&#x27;s lives have been destroyed because of this. Free speech is not just the First Amendment in the US... it is a tradition upheld in a plethora of ways, public and private.<p>In addition, not everybody agrees with the theory of inherent privilege, as it&#x27;s often used to overlook or devalue the hard work of others with whom one disagrees.<p>Many people of all backgrounds are frightened by what they are seeing of the far-left &quot;woke&quot; view.')
