I&#x27;m biased, sure, but still if you are in such situation you need to stop for a moment and think about such questions.<p>Whenever I went to demonstrations -and, granted, its been a while since War in Iraq started- I made a very conscious decision about this beforehand. Its part of planning, because it might affect your OPSEC (things such as your possessions and your planned behavior).<p>I also believe its not a valid comparison between physical violence and emotional violence (such as threats). I&#x27;m currently reading Ronan Farrow&#x27;s Catch and Kill, and I keep thinking: &quot;now this is a fight worth fighting for&quot;. I&#x27;m at 2&#x2F;3 and I have not read about <i>physical</i> violence [against the reporter, Farrow; not referring to the violated women!] as of yet.')
