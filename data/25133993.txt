Very different from my first 10 years when I was even involved in that kind of thing a couple of times. I&#x27;m on Linkedin. Recruiters seem to have a fine talent to ask me for just about anything involving software spanning the entire spectrum of frontend, backend, embedded. Most of it is for stuff I don&#x27;t even have on my CV. Based on that, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen even a single request for anything desktop based in the last ten years. Plenty of react and other web based stuff. Plenty of Android, IOS, and even Symbian when that was still a thing. Lots of backend in all flavors (even got a haskell one the other day). But not things like Swing, JavaFX, etc. That just doesn&#x27;t happen. Not even rarely.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a parallel world where enterprises still run JVMs on ancient windows XP boxes that are no longer supported where they feel compelled to commission new applications. Just haven&#x27;t come across any such project. It&#x27;s not just less trendy from my point of view but dead as a doornail. Not a thing anymore that people actively recruit for. What little UI I come across on my own desktop tends to be either web based (electron) or native (I&#x27;m on a mac so mostly objectiveC and swift these days).')
