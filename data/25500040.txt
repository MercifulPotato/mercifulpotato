Projects like this make me very happy that I donated to IA this year, and I&#x27;d encourage anyone else who likes them to do the same.<p>One question: are there any plans to sort fiction by author, similar to what is done in real libraries?  A lot of fiction is already available in this tool, filed under DDN 8xx, but the groupings are pretty broad.')
