Are the various trials measuring &#x27;effectiveness&#x27; in the same way? Is there a standard for &#x27;effectiveness&#x27; in these Covid-19 trials?<p>Yes, its true that there were no &quot;severe&quot; cases in the other vaccine trials as well.<p>&gt; This statement seems a big deal: &quot;There were no hospitalised or severe cases in anyone who received the vaccine&quot;<p>It may be. When considering disease severity, we are no longer looking at a pool of people who have been given the vaccine (which is in the tens of thousands for all of these), we are looking at a pool of people who got sick. That means the sample size is reduced to approximately 90-100 for placebo wing of each vaccine, and 30 for ChadOx vaccine arm, and about 5 for Moderna&#x2F;Pfizer vaccine arms each. That&#x27;s fairly small.<p>Seems like the estimated rate of severe cases is around 10-20%. Assuming its 10% (which would mean its harder to identify an actual reduction in disease severity rate from the placebo group), then in the case of Pfizer&#x2F;Moderna, there would be a greater than 50% chance of seeing no severe cases in a group of 5 infected, vaccinated patients, even if there was no effect on the severity of the disease. The greatest benefit to the vaccine is that they seem to prevent infections substantially, but that also means it will take months before enough infections occur to get some kind of statistical significance on if severity is also affected<i>.<p>But with this vaccine, 30 cases with no infections is definitely in the realm of statistical significance. I don&#x27;t have the exact numbers from the trial, but if it indeed is 0&#x2F;30 vs around 10&#x2F;100 between the vaccine&#x2F;placebo wings, it definitely meets the typical thresholds of statistical significance.<p></i> It&#x27;s important to note that, at least according to my understanding, the Pfizer&#x2F;Moderna trials are measuring symptomatic cases, not doing actual tests on their trial participants. This means that it could well mean that the reason the vaccines appear to be so effective is because they truly are reducing the severity of the disease to the point of being asymptomatic. We just aren&#x27;t able to see it yet due to the way the data is being collected.')
