Then they have roughly 270 years to spend it, and on top of that, they can hand some of that wealth off to their offspring if inheritance rules don&#x27;t change.

So any interest paid to the traveler should be calculated at the fraction of time experienced, so 5 minutes to 5 days would be 1 &#x2F; 1440.<p>As for any opportunity cost, well, there really isn&#x27;t any greater opportunity cost than being able to extend your life by that much and wait for interest to accrue. So by virtue of being able to travel at near light speed and dilate time, you&#x27;re quite happy to forgo every other opportunity.')
