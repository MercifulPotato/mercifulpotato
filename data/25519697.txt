The question is, how much pressure the sponsor puts on the researcher not to publish failed or unfavorable outcomes? And, we all know majority of failed research never gets published.<p>Let&#x27;s presume that we accept sponsorship.  What is acceptable level of pressure?  I think this is very subjective.<p>To be clear, falsifying by modification, omission or addition of data is fraud.  Drawing the wrong conclusion is not.<p>The only time I have seen altruistic, &quot;clean&quot; research was performed by individuals as hobby.  Once there are more than one person involved, there <i>will</i> be some preferred outcome.  Nature of humanity.')
