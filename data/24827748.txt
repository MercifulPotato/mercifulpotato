It&#x27;s a small minority of people in any studio who can code.<p>But that&#x27;s largely why I created the course (at the bottom of the posts). I had a lot of artists asking to learn to code, and it was easier to make the course than to do it 1:1 with each of them.<p>With regards to pay and attention, people who can code are definitely more stable in regards to their careers. They are more likely to be kept on after projects, and generally have greater demand.<p>The downside is you&#x27;ll have less attention than artists. You&#x27;re not really creating the final imagery, so you&#x27;re a bit in the background. That means you will be better off in the early and middle parts of a career, but it&#x27;s harder to make it to the really high end jobs like Visual effects supervisors etc...however that&#x27;s usually 10-15 years into someones career as an artist, and only for a select few, so it&#x27;s not really a negative IMHO. Though on the flip side, it&#x27;s easy to jump to traditional tech roles as well, if you find you are hitting a ceiling.')
