Insanely fast (Sometimes same day) turnaround, and you knew when you bought something they had selected the best possible supplier.<p>And my favorite feature: Nearly every part comes with complete data sheet and CAD models on the product page.<p>One anecdote: I ordered a large mounted bearing for an electric vehicle drivetrain, about a $250 part. Upon opening it, I was confused because the bearing didn&#x27;t seem like it was seated correctly -- It was slightly off-axis. I called McMaster and they sent a free replacement the <i>same day</i>, no questions asked. I later realized the bearing was self-aligning and needed to be greased&#x2F;mounted to align properly, so it was 100% my mistake and the first part was completely fine!')
