I tried logging into Coinbase on Friday for the first time in a while, and the 2FA wasn&#x27;t working.  I had been using Authy, and it turns out that Coinbase no longer supports Authy.  It took me a moment to figure out why Authy was giving me a 7 digit code to verify 2FA, but Coinbase would only accept 6 digits.  Fortunately I was able to recover my account by reverifying my ID, but it was super annoying.')
