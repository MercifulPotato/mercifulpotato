IIRC the interfaces and pinouts were different too.<p>I would imagine that for many people, they moved any valuable data on 5.25&quot; disks to 3.5&quot; disks during the roughly decade of overlap of the two drive types.<p>I doubt there is enough of a market demand for legacy 5.25&quot; disks where the data doesn&#x27;t already exist on other mediums to make it worthwhile to offer any kind of modern interface.')
