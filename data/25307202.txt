That assumes that deaths are evenly distributed throughout the year, which at least in the US, they are not.<p>An <i>annual</i> snapshot of &quot;excess deaths&quot; lead to bad intuition. A weekly snapshot is much more helpful, leads to more accurate intuition, and generally is preferred.<p>The second chart is from October, based on the URL, and therefore missed the large spike of deaths in November.<p>Incomplete data leads to bad analysis.')
