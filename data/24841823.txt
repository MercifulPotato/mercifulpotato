That&#x27;s your onboard time.<p>There are no days, weeks, months, years. Just count the seconds and make sure everyone knows the epoch you started at.<p>Now, let&#x27;s suppose you have a permanent settled outpost on Luna. You still use accumulated seconds as your time basis, but for casual conversation, you can talk about any Earth time marking that makes sense to you -- next Tuesday, or March 20th, or &quot;in three months&quot;. You might occasionally care about whether it&#x27;s bright or dark outside, but the tidal lock means that local weeks and months really aren&#x27;t useful.<p>The hard thing is when you actually care about both the time on Earth and the local time&#x2F;date&#x2F;season of a planet you are interacting with naturally. Let&#x27;s hypothesize a terraformed Venus, and while we&#x27;re at it, let&#x27;s change the axial tilt from 2.mumble degrees to 24 degrees. That gives us a 224ish terrestrial day V-year, a 1.92 V-day V-year, and approximately eight seasons per V-year, each being 56 days long.<p>On that planet, you get to go outside and enjoy the fresh air, but you want to know what season it is more than you want to know what month it is:<p>dark-winter, dark-fall, dark-summer, dark-spring<p>bright-winter, bright-fall, hell, bright-spring<p>(Venus rotates backwards, that&#x27;s why the seasons are all funny.)<p>But when you want to know when the next shipment of Earth whisky is coming, you ask a computer.')
