And will be indirect.<p>So - before M1 announce ARM market was reserved for battery devices when huge limitation is power for them. Performance was important, but most important is power consumption.<p>There was also some niche server-side ARM like Marvell ThunderX, Qualcomm Centriq or Amazon Graviton.<p>Actually Apple acquire P.A. Semi company in 2008 and before that they&#x27;re known for PWRficient processors.<p>Now M1 release shock whole industry.<p>First PC manufacturers like Dell or HP - but for now they&#x27;re tied with vendors as Intel and Microsoft.\nSecond Cloud operators like Digital Ocean and Google - only Amazon have their own ARM CPU.\nThird OS vendors like Microsoft - they&#x27;re having a Windows RT in past and need to revive  it ASAP.\nForth are CPU vendors like Intel, AMD that providing x86 and Broadcom, Qualcomm that are ARM - because first can seen how their x86 product line is outperform from ARM products. And other can seen how even their top ARM products are outperform from niche player as Apple.<p>In result - expect shortly a HUGE investments in post-x86 for different chips architectures and as result RPi will be improvement. But not today!<p>PS: Do you remember Russian CPU Elbrus? It&#x27;s VLIW! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PUNJ_tkq2hk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PUNJ_tkq2hk</a>')
