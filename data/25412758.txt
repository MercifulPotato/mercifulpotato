However, now that APT tools have been leaked to the world I think I can still argue that even layered defenses are no longer sufficient.  I listened to security researchers say for years that there was no point in trying to address APT&#x27;s because they were just impossible to stop.  Now APT methods are public knowledge and being used in common attacks.  Some types of APT attacks are still too costly to be widely used, but some that used to be considered very sophisticated (like hiding an MCU in a computer cable) are not.<p>The reasons you list for a weak defense posture don&#x27;t really apply to a government.  Also the GAO has issued a constant stream of reports saying US government agencies have poor security.  It was likely only a matter of time before something like this incident happened.  Similarly it&#x27;s probably only a matter of time until the IRS, Social Security, and other agencies are successfully attacked on a large scale.')
