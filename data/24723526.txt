Every one of them ends up with an underground market despite tremendous repression. Even literal prisons have one. At best, such governments have flare-ups of the condition where they murder in great numbers for a time to send everyone into terror, but in time they tire of it and calm down. The market pops right back up like a weed.<p>The analogy you should be looking at is the printing press, because it broadened the scope of such markets; what a person of higher literacy communicates is illegible to the lower. And such is true of a system of account that renders a larger scope of transactions illegible. The possession of great wealth itself is a concept that assumes a top-down vision of value; the phenomenon of being robbed for cryptocurrency is mostly reflective of the new being imitative of the old. But if they&#x27;re all tokens, and anyone can make them - well, then, that means we increasingly don&#x27;t have a man at the top. If the scrip you pay your police doesn&#x27;t buy them anything at the market, they aren&#x27;t going to be very motivated to take out fingernails for you.')
