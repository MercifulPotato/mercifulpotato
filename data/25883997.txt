Advertisers don&#x27;t like any controversies so they threaten the platforms to pull their money, platforms establish measures to please the advertisers.<p>Another one is: journalists don&#x27;t like their outlets getting outperformed by some &quot;whackos&#x2F;conservatives&quot; on facebook, they go directly after facebook and demand that they downgrade those channels and promote theirs. They demand fact checking routines which are then in part outsourced to outlets that share their values.')
