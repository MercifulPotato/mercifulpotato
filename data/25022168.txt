Whether it helped Trump or not in 2016 (frankly, I think it probably did but it&#x27;s exhausting to debate this so I won&#x27;t) it does represent a gaping hole in America&#x27;s defenses.<p>Until this election, there seemed to be a clear pattern (in the English speaking world anyway) that allowed one to reliably predict the winner of an election by seeing which side the trolls supported.<p>There are no First Amendment protections for Russian&#x2F;Iranian&#x2F;Macedonian click or troll farms. Detecting VPNs and other attempts to conceal traffic is not an insurmountable technical challenge, yet it isn&#x27;t done consistently.<p>The seductive &quot;Arab Spring&quot; approach to letting free speech run rampant on social media turned out to be a mirage. Not only was the Arab Spring reversed in Egypt, based on my discussions with Egyptians, Facebook was turned into a tool of repression after the counter-revolution took hold.<p>(Yes, the irony of posting this from a throwaway account doesn&#x27;t escape me, but there&#x27;s a difference between clearly anonymous speech, and speech that misrepresents its source).')
