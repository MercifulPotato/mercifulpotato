No average user I know uses an email client on their PC, outside of the corporate one. It&#x27;s one more thing to take care of and average users rarely want that.<p>It&#x27;s easier on mobile where people are used with the &quot;app&quot; concept, not really on the PC. This is one reason why Thunderbird doesn&#x27;t enjoy the kind of popularity browser based email does.')
