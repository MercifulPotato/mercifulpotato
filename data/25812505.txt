Rather we did it because the field was new and the actors not consolidated.<p>Creating decentralization after in a mature, consoliditated space is a completely different enterprise. In particular, a lot more attention needs to paid to inefficiency and defense against the central hegemons.<p>It&#x27;s a hard battle, but if won, will be a much more durable victory.')
