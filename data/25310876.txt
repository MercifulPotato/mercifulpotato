Most of the current gen static analyzers&#x2F;compilers linearize into basic blocks and run graph theoretic peephole compiler optimization passes, but that certainly isn&#x27;t the only way to do to it. I guess with the future of hardware heterogeneous this is why data-flow or even more hybrid type of computer architectures are hot instead of mostly control flow-types of checks.')
