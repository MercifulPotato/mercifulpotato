You start pumping them out in your home system, and send them towards some stars - not necessarily the closest ones. You <i>keep sending them</i>. There&#x27;s now a shell expanding at 0.9c that&#x27;s shaped by your production capabilities. Of course, the probes will spend time accelerating and then decelerating towards their destinations. But even as they decelerate, other probes, going to further targets, pass ahead of them.<p>Any probe that lands in a system sets up a facility for building and provisioning more of itself, and sends those to further star systems, adding to the wave. Meanwhile, any technological advancement could be transmitted at the speed of light - so the probes receive improvement instructions as they fly, and the entire shell keeps upgrading itself as it expands.<p>What&#x27;s the aggregate speed of that shell? Less than 0.9c, I think, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s still a high fraction of it.<p>The main warning sign we could look for, assuming there are no crazy unknown physics allowing creation of silent drives, are deceleration plumes and associated thermal emissions. But then, civilizations like ours should be easy to spot from a distance. Don&#x27;t bother with radio waves, just look at the spectral lines of the planets in a system; if you spot high concentrations of chemicals that don&#x27;t have geological rationale to be there (such as oxygen in our case), this implies something is keeping the planet away from equilibrium - likely some form of life.<p>If we go by Dark Forest theory, the standard procedure upon detection of such &quot;life signs&quot; would be to send updated instructions to the von Neumann probe heading towards that system: &quot;don&#x27;t decelerate, ram the planet (or the <i>star</i>) at 0.9 c&quot;. If there&#x27;s anything of use left there, another probe will come later and consume it.<p>So, by the time we spot the evidence of the von Neumann probes, we may just be about to get hit by a relativistic kill vehicle at the vanguard of the expanding shell.<p>(I&#x27;m tempted to build a toy model and play with the parameters to see how much of an advance warning we would have.)')
