It was the first Western I read. I did not think I’d like it because it’s a Western... just not my thing. I was very wrong. I went on to read the other books in the series, but you don’t need to. They each stand on their own.<p>Still not sure I’ll ever read another Western, but this book was a gem. I believe it has been made into films twice, although I did not watch them.')
