Though if it is <i>extremely</i> well targeted and personal it could make sense.<p>However, one thing people don’t do often enough is follow up <i>when the other person has expressed interest</i>. This kind of followup is usually welcome, as inertia and distraction lead to things not happening. This is especially true in commercial context. Eg someone may express strong interest in buying, get busy, drift off, then enthusiastically buy when you ping them a bit later.')
