Virtual meetings, by virtue of being new, gave me an opportunity to push back onto the need of seeing one another. Not being in the office would be met with manager talks.<p>&gt;also, it&#x27;s pretty rude to refuse to let yourself be seen.<p>Are we really doing this? There are so many things that are rude. Not everything has to be met with a resounding &quot;yes&quot; because on a whim, people decide to mimic the work floor to the T without thinking further. I enjoy my visual privacy. To me, it is even more rude to force someone out of their visual privacy for a prolonged time multiple times a day, let alone having to stare at one&#x27;s own face because the app refuses to build in a way to remove your own video feed without closing it entirely.')
