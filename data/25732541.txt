Here&#x27;s how I see things that played out:<p>Twitter and Facebook banning Trump?  Not surprised, they censor conservatives all the time and have been doing so since even before Trump.  Also remember: it wasn&#x27;t just Trump this time, many others have been banned from Twitter and Facebook, and many groups have been shut down.<p>Apple banning Parler?  I was surprised by this.  Apple is supposedly about privacy; clearly, they are not.  Changes my view on their value proposition moving forward.<p>AWS dropping Parler?  Again, this is surprising.  Head scratching even.  Going to make a lot of people think twice about AWS.<p>I&#x27;m also kinda surprised at the HN response to all this, perhaps its because many of the posters here work at one of these Orwellian companies and don&#x27;t see the issue.  I see complaints here about payments companies blocking criminal activity, yet very little relative objections to simply cancelling people the CEOs disagree with.')
