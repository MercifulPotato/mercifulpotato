Kudos for the post, it&#x27;s important for me to know that my nieces and nephews might see computers the same way I did: through an uncomplicated lens.<p>The appeal for me was to give, as you wrote, a simple interface to programming. The Apple RAM II I had was not as easily accessible for programming at my single digit age. QBasic was available on the 486 SX based MS-DOS OS we had, and it opened my eyes. Within a year or two I was reading Herb Schildt&#x27; &quot;Teach Yourself C&quot; and using Borland C for the first time. But at a young age you need that first step to be accessible!<p>Nice one...')
