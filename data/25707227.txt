They have their uses and new successful features they explore get ported back into the boring languages. This is how technological development works. For a non-programming example, anti-lock brakes were used in Concorde jets before they were used in automobiles.<p>Also, one must consider that Java was a &#x27;shiny&#x27; language once.<p>Honestly, if OP knows of many companies that are picking Haskell or Rust over the likes Java or Golang, please post links.
