You would sort your applicants by &quot;Q&quot; and drop everyone below a cutoff. I suppose I would call this the &quot;human resources&quot; view.<p>On the other hand if you have a team of domain experts who are passionate about subject &quot;S&quot;, they don&#x27;t actually care about &quot;Q&quot;. They care whether you have deep interest, expertise and potential in their domain area. They want to know what you can bring to their team. Now, a lot of times a good candidate will be someone with a PhD in &quot;S&quot;, but it&#x27;s not about the qualification. It&#x27;s about &quot;S&quot;.<p>&quot;No degree&quot; hires usually don&#x27;t come in the HR front door as a &quot;fungible human resource&quot;.
