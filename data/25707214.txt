You&#x27;re thinking about what AOM said about AV1 [6], not AVIF; they should not (and in fact do not) make that claim for AVIF -- which builds on HEIF that isn&#x27;t their work -- though you ought to judge the situation for yourself [7].<p>I am not a lawyer, and I realize there&#x27;s a fine line between genuine concern and spreading FUD, but in the spring of 2019 I looked into the patent situation around the HEIF container itself [1] -- the container upon which AVIF builds -- and skimmed through the 5 US patents I found, which cover some techniques that can be used in the format.\nMost of them can probably be avoided for the purposes of an AVIF file, but patent US20160232939A1 [2] in my reading seems to be about in-container signalling to express relationships between a &quot;static media item&quot; and &quot;one or more entities&quot; that together &quot;form a group&quot;, and &quot;indicating, in the file, a grouping type for the group&quot;. The patent appears to be written in a way to allow this definition to encompass, say, a thumbnail and a bunch of frames thereafter, or, say a master image and a set of pictures derived from it, or alternate camera angles of the same thing. Some of these techniques sound like stuff we&#x27;ve seen before, but as is common in patents, the precise wording of claims is often key, and this is where patent lawyers come in.<p>A thorough look of the AVIF specification [3] and the patents registered with the MPEG LA about this format [1] is likely wise before any widespread deployment that makes use of advanced features of the HEIF container; using it to hold exactly 1 &#x27;one-layer&#x27; still-image is probably fine.<p>Additionally, in my reading [5], the HEIF reference software released by Nokia [4] includes a patent grant for non-commercial evaluation, testing and academic research only.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19874321" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19874321</a> [2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US20160232939A1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US20160232939A1&#x2F;</a> [3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aomediacodec.github.io&#x2F;av1-avif&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aomediacodec.github.io&#x2F;av1-avif&#x2F;</a> [4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nokiatech&#x2F;heif&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;LICENSE.TXT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nokiatech&#x2F;heif&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;LICENSE.TXT</a> [5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19874368" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19874368</a> [6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=AV1&amp;oldid=997650749#Patent_claims" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=AV1&amp;oldid=9976507...</a> [7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AOMediaCodec&#x2F;av1-avif&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AOMediaCodec&#x2F;av1-avif&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2</a>')
