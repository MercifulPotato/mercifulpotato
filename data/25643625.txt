As in, why does it exist? I created an account there long ago when the site was new and tried to figure out what problem it was supposed to solve but failed. I remember trying for a short while to use it to collect news clippings on different subjects but that was really frustrating so that can&#x27;t be it. Wikipedia says it&#x27;s for &quot;image sharing [...] in the form of pinboards&quot;, that it&#x27;s &quot;a catalogue for ideas&quot; and that it &quot;inspires users to &#x27;go out and do that thing&#x27;&quot;. What does that even mean?')
