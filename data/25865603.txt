I wanted Brian&#x27;s job, which at that point was the head of the fabs. Got less than one month of training and then told &#x27;all yours now&#x27;. Worked my ass off for like 18 months, made a name for myself in the factory, was literally on call 24x7 by myself for 11 months. Got an annual review were I was told &#x27;we had limited budget for bonuses and raise budget, and we gave it to XX because he has kids&#x27;. Sucked it up, told myself I was playing the long game and to just put my head down and work. Hacked together software that made stuff which never worked work. Worked and worked and worked. Lost a marriage over it...who would want to be 25 and married to someone who works over 100 hours a week and gets woken up by a phone call almost every night?<p>I had been working an issue for months, got no buy in, got told it was no big deal&#x2F;no budget&#x2F;ignored. The fourth time the same thing broke, suddenly it was an emergency. I was supposed to leave on vacation that day...a vacation I had given 10 months notice on because I had no coverage. Got asked to cancel the vacation. I walked out.<p>I&#x27;ve learned, I&#x27;m smarter than that now, I respect myself in new ways I wasn&#x27;t ready to understand. Now when I mentor undergraduates I am laser focused on quality of life mattering and learning to respect yourself beyond how someone else evaluates your work. I still know what my ring tone on my on call cell phone there was...and I know that it still cause anxiety when I hear it (but not panic attacks anymore). The ring tone is in a James Bond movie, I don&#x27;t watch that movie.')
