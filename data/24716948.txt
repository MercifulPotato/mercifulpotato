The second worst part is that some languages are very difficult while others are very easy. The third worst part is that I am isolated from those who speak the new language. The fourth worst part is that the older you get the less time you have left both per day and in absolute terms. I don&#x27;t think it is difficult to learn a third language. It&#x27;s taking years but what many people miss is that a 10 year old child has worse conversational skills than an adult who has been learning and speaking a foreign language for 10 years.')
