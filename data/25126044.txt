While it is obviously not foolproof, and can go bad just as swiftly as no marriage at all, it is still a good signal of commitment in a partner. If your partner desires to be married (not just to please you I might add) then at least at face value he desires commitment. It isn&#x27;t just an idle ceremony but a contract and vows with family and friends witnessing ideally to hold you to account.<p>Best of luck to your friend! ;)')
