I was paying 4500 for a 3 bedroom, nice mid century modern before COVID. After February, I will be paying 3200 for at least another year with an optional 2nd year at the same price. It&#x27;s a good time to be a renter here.<p>The prices are now so low on renting, that my plan to eventually buy a house farther north (Oregon or California) is now put on hold while I muster up a bigger down-payment.')
