If you want a reasonably fair synthetic benchmark to compare NVMe SSDs against SATA SSDs while bypassing any caching the OS is doing with main system RAM, you pretty much have to toggle that switch for at least NVMe drives. Or use Linux, which has actual <i>documentation</i> for its NVMe driver, and the source code is available where that falls short.')
