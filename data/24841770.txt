Someone&#x27;s iPad or iPhone experience can only be screwed up so much and can be reset without losing data. For MacOS the stakes are a lot higher, and users are trained to enter credentials for annoying-to-audit vague permissions.<p>In my view, MacOS is the biggest security hole in Apple&#x27;s ecosystem. Doesn&#x27;t this make you wonder how Apple will handle the health app on MacOS?')
