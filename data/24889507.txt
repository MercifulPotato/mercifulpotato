Item(by='aspenmayer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603656826, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889299, text='The person I replied to said they needed xray(s) to get their replacement tooth made, and worded their reply to imply that Norway has had this tech for some time, implying or assuming that the tech in Norway they experienced is the same as what I described. It is not the same in this key way: the system I described doesn’t use or require xrays, surely not additional ones over and above the ones many dentists already do with new patients.<p>Xrays are potentially harmful and exposure to them should be limited to those medically necessary. The system I described does not require “extra“ xrays or any additional xrays at all, thus my characterization of any xrays the person I replied to received as redundant compared to the treatment plan I was describing.<p>Is that clear? Hard to assume what the person in Norway got from their care but they didn’t get the same thing I described.<p>Edit: I see now you’re the same person I was replying to; I don’t mean to be pendantic, but the absence of xrays in the workflow I described is kind of a big difference, as what I described uses visual 3D scanning with an orally-inserted imaging device with no need for more xrays if the dentist doesn’t otherwise need them.')
