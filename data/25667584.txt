We didn&#x27;t live in a strong two-party existence until relatively recently and we still have (not enough) independent members in congress.<p>Political parties were quite literally decried by the founders and as we have now almost completely been polarized in a two-party system we have reached this level of disfunction.<p>This is unacceptable and both parties have been responsible for shutting out third-party candidates.<p>All people are subject to the rule of law of the land, whether you think it is just or unjust. You have the right to vote for whoever you want but you don&#x27;t have a right to do whatever you want. Democrats haven&#x27;t <i>taken over</i> the federal government. They were voted into office, just as several republicans&#x2F;whigs&#x2F;federalists&#x2F;anti-federalists&#x2F;literally whoever.<p>This is the process. This is the reality. This is America.<p>Choosing to reject both the facts and reality doesn&#x27;t change this.')
