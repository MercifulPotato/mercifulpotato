I mean, you are talking about Matrix being the holy grail of chat and at the same time you do not support the IETF standard for instant messaging (which is also federated, supports E2E encryption, can use bridges to other networks and has several open source implementations)...<p>In general, my biggest issue with the Matrix community is that they chose to build something new, instead of fixing something existing. Granted, at the time when Matrix started, XMPP wasn&#x27;t fit for the mobile revolution. But instead of improving the XMPP standard (which other people did afterward), the Matrix people decided to build something new from the ground up. They took a few different design decisions, but in my opinion, nothing that would justify building a competing solution and splitting the already thin developer community.<p>Now we have too solutions, both failing to find significant adoption. I understand that the matrix people probably built their eco system as a hobby, so who am I to criticize them. I just feel so depressed, seeing so much work being done on a very important subject, not fulfilling its potential due to missing focus.')
