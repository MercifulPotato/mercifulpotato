Item(by='xelxebar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611546100, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25895563, text='Wikipedia often has a &quot;History&quot; section on these large&#x2F;broad math topics. Though sometimes it requires you to be relatively familiar with the lingo to follow along (See the History of Complex Numbers [1]).<p>Specifically, for complex numbers, the problem of finding roots of polynomials is what led us there. Cubic polynomials (ones of the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) gave us the first hints of something like an imaginary unit. Even if the root is just a real number, expressing that number in terms of radicals (n-th roots) usually contains some square root of -1 that isn&#x27;t eliminable. After lots of debate about the &quot;existence&quot; of such things, we eventually discovered the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.<p>For Calculus, you just need to look at Newton, Leibniz, etc. This subject was strongly motivated by physicsists trying to solve hard problems of the day.<p>Logarithms essentially encde a relationship between addition and multiplication, something that has been recognized for quite some time!
