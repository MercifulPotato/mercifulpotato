It seems pretty obvious that the endgame of this product would be just another Amazon. Why would it turn out any differently for the &quot;curators&quot; on the Insight &quot;platform&quot;?<p>Beyond that the author&#x27;s specific arguments don&#x27;t feel very convincing to me:<p><i>&gt; Think about the last time you did some research, e.g. choosing a phone plan.

I also have a degree of trust in Prime shipping and I&#x27;ve never personally had a painful experience returning anything to Amazon.')
