Huge chunks of the colonised world actually had fairly diverse and healthy attitudes towards nudity and sexuality before the era of colonisation. <i>Women with Mustaches and Men without Beards</i> is a great book about sexuality in Iran.<p>But either way today it does seem to be mostly the US which has the kind of influence that Europe had, and I don&#x27;t enjoy it because it seems to affect our culture in negative ways.')
