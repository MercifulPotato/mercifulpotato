Same as if they type &quot;.&#x2F;pwnme&quot; without the command not found handler.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really change anything; you have to be aware of what you&#x27;re typing and what it&#x27;ll do at an interactive terminal.<p>The go one is a vulnerability because &#x27;go get&#x27; is supposed to have a contract that it can&#x27;t execute arbitrary code, while an interactive terminal that a user types text into doesn&#x27;t necessarily have that contract.<p>Also, it will try the path _first_ before command-not-found, so most forms of this vulnerability (a file named &#x27;ls&#x27; or whatever) won&#x27;t cause a vulnerability with this helper variant.')
