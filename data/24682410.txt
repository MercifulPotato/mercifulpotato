Item(by='ajkjk', descendants=None, kids=[24682466], score=None, time=1601847073, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24682305, text='I feel like whatever is happening here is more subtle than being &quot;hellbent on disenfranchising high-achieving Asians&quot;. I think it&#x27;s probably still in the category of &#x27;racist&#x27;, but works via a more complicated mechanism.<p>I can kinda imagine: it is ingrained in people&#x27;s minds that a &#x27;proper&#x27; institution ought to be mostly white, with some small percentages of each minority, and if things aren&#x27;t working out that way the institution seems &#x27;wrong&#x27; and becomes up for re-organization. The mindset is explicitly racist and is some sort of modern rendition of colonialism: that this country is still white society, foremost, and everyone else is here with white approval. But it&#x27;s probably not that the individual bureaucrats (or whoever is in charge of this) is consciously bigoted -- it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s baked into society in a way that they can&#x27;t see beyond.<p>This is an off-the-cuff unqualified theory. Would love to know if anyone with more familiarity of the situation has a more reality-based model.')
