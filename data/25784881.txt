It&#x27;s all highly compressed and basically unidirectional, forcing the participants to take turns talking.<p>The old analog POTS phone system wasn&#x27;t like this.  It had that feeling of almost being in the same room, no latency, true birectional conversation.<p>I was wondering if there&#x27;s anything that tries to get close to this old POTS level of quality, at the cost of higher bandwidth and processing power.<p>Can some of the software mentioned in this thread achieve this?')
