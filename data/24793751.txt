In the history of the US, the transitions from newspapers to radio took roughly the first ~150 years of the country. In just 30 years we&#x27;ve gone from TV-&gt;Social Media. Social media and the internet are just so different from anything we&#x27;ve had before.<p>1. Local newspapers (controlled by few)<p>2. Mail (1-&gt;1)<p>3. Radio (controlled by few)<p>4. Phone (1-&gt;1)<p>5. TV (controlled by few)<p>6. Internet (1-&gt;Millions)<p>7. WhatsApp&#x2F;Texts (1-&gt;Few)<p>8. Social Media (1-&gt;Millions)<p>My first reaction to the social media companies is one of fear that a private type of &quot;ministry of truth&quot; is being setup. However, it would seem that in the vast majority of our history that is the same setup we&#x27;ve had. Of course newspapers, radio and broadcast TV all had small groups of people determining truth and what was worthy news. That gives me some comfort that maybe these problems aren&#x27;t that dire or new.<p>My big fears are:<p>-Internet infrastructure companies blocking access to content they disagree with[1]. While yet that blocking has started with the most egregious content, will they continue to block less egregious content?<p>-The lack of trust in institutions and the differing priorities and truths pushed by different institutions. Why should the people trust any facts coming out of any of these major institutions when they appear so biased? Yesterday (when I looked) on the homepage of FoxNews.com Hunter Biden was referenced &gt;20 times. Completely missing on CNN.com or MSNBC.com.<p>-How can these companies maintain a semblance of neutrality when their employee bases are so skewed and seem to have such a huge level of groupthink?<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;19&#x2F;08&#x2F;05&#x2F;0323200&#x2F;cloudflare-terminates-8chan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;19&#x2F;08&#x2F;05&#x2F;0323200&#x2F;cloudflare-...</a>')
