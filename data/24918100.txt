Let’s be clear about that first. No mention of that tie in the article, which is pathetic.<p>My kids watched the Charlie Brown Halloween special ad free and at their schedule’s whim (aka 2x in a row). Don’t shed a tear for Charlie, he’s fine, this offering is way better. Now If I could only get my wife to let me cancel directv once and for all...<p>I get that the copyright laws should be tweaked and Charlie should be totally free, but I’m guessing that the copyright law has also enabled Disney to spend quite a bit of money on the new Charlie Brown space series, which my kids also have loved.<p>At the end of the day, I didn’t pay any more money to see Charlie Brown Halloween, I saw it ad free, very high quality picture (you can actually see the shadows from the way the cartoon was assembled I think?), I didn’t have to worry if this was some troll version where Charlie pulls out a chainsaw and slices Lucy up, (looking at you, YouTube).
