Sure, it&#x27;s power. It&#x27;s a straightforward extension of the &quot;take-it-or-leave-it&quot; principle you describe.<p>I have the power to tell my boss &quot;I&#x27;m not going to work on that&quot;, and they&#x27;re free to keep paying me to do something else instead. It&#x27;s the same power I use to negotiate my pay and benefits, and the entire reason I developed this skillset and work in this industry.<p>Using that power to form a union and wield it collectively is one aspect of the right to freely associate. If Alphabet workers want to use that collective power to negotiate a legal contract protecting their job if they refuse to work on a project, that&#x27;s their right.')
