I believe he saved her life. Scihub was instrumental in that. I helped a little in checking and challenging his conclusions. I think it&#x27;s unlikely she would have had as good an outcome if we&#x27;d just listened to the doctors.<p>My conclusion is if you want the best medical care be sure to do your own research and talk to many doctors about your findings and treatment options. Do not blindly trust the medical community. They are years behind the current state of knowledge in their field and just do not have the time and energy to spend per patient to get the best outcome.')
