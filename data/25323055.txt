Obviously nowadays is hard to be that selective with the people you add, but you can be with the people you follow.<p>I use LinkedIn for 2 things mainly:\n1) to build reputation, sharing articles I find interesting about my broad area of expertise and fostering some discussions. These articles are not set to create maximum engagement, because I care about my direct network creating a certain view of my experience based on diacussions with me.<p>2) to recruit. I use it actively to search for key profiles (lots of devs) for my team. As my big corporate HR department is very ineffective, I take my time to search for interesting candidates and send them to be contacted by HR for some straightforward filtering (interested in the position, salary, etc). For more senior positions, I contact the potential candidates myself (to avoid HR screwups). It is a very efficient tool for recruiting IMHO.<p>So, if you don&#x27;t like LinkedIn just build your profile and keep track of the inmail for contacts, as people will use it more and more to reach out to you.')
