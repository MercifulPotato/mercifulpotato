The loss of any number of food items can be substituted by an overwhelming number of any other food items without the consumer ending up dead.<p>Healthcare is not as fungible. Most medications have single-digit or even no effective alternatives.<p>For an illustrative example and the flip side of the coin, water is a good example of where unregulated markets do terribly (since you really do need water and can&#x27;t substitute it with something else and it&#x27;s also geographically heavily monopolistic). Potable water production and pricing in all developed countries is heavily regulated for good reason.')
