Item(by='mrslave', descendants=None, kids=[25110723], score=None, time=1605518514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108168, text='&gt; You have a right to go to the Town Square and voice your views if people want to listen, you don&#x27;t have a right to do the same in a Wendy&#x27;s.<p>But what about when the town square has moved on-line? Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s not Wendy&#x27;s IRL, but wendys.com. This is now a public space where people talk. And on top of this, people who don&#x27;t like what you have to say aren&#x27;t following you and don&#x27;t have to listen to you anyway.<p>Perhaps these websites are rather like a pub. People mostly go there in a group of friends, obviously are more likely to exchange with similar people or people with similar ideas, but there are other people there too having their own fun in a social setting. Occasionally very different people also exchange, sometimes politely, but sometimes not. But until fists are thrown, the publican isn&#x27;t looking to kick anyone out.<p>Sometimes the best exchanges are disagreeing people discussing in good faith, if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re in the mood for. Sometimes they&#x27;re just polite enough to talk about something they do agree on, rather than call for other people to be banned just because they&#x27;re unpopular.')
