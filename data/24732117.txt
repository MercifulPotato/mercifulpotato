Their &quot;discovery&quot; was just vague speculation.<p>Darwin didn&#x27;t just say &quot;evolution happens&quot;, he demonstrated it. Before him no one else demonstrated it.<p>Surely, a lot scholars speculated about evolution long before Darwin. One of them was Erasmus Darwin, Charles grandfather.<p>But that misses the whole point: no other scholar was able to embed a theory of evolution into the scientific body of knowledge. More than discovering it, Darwin&#x27;s achievement was the clear and irrefutable formulation of it.')
