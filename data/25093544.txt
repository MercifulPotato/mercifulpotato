Optane is pretty cool, but who will be surprised if they EOL it tomorrow? AVX512 is obviously of certain utility, but 99% of computers lack it. I myself just got access to a CPU with this feature a week ago. They&#x27;ve got a sweet programmable 100gbps NIC that they only ship into the mobile base station market. Why? KNL is a complete joke that nobody wanted or wants. Features that everybody wants, like UMWAIT, only exist on obscure parts you can&#x27;t get. Having a lot of cool hacks isn&#x27;t making a great deal of visible success for Intel.')
