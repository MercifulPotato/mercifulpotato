I am willing to give my data away to Facebook if it shows me ads to buy the things I was checking out earlier... or something related to pages I have liked.<p>And so are many other people. Some are strictly against this idea, which is understandable.<p>There&#x27;s another group who doesn&#x27;t care either way or hasn&#x27;t made up their mind for various reasons. This group will do what is selected or recommended for them by default.<p>Facebook benefits from getting these people to share their data. Apple&#x27;s business depends less on it, but they are not preventing themselves from tracking users, only others.<p>It&#x27;s too valuable for Apple to be not doing it. The biggest problem for Apple is that they&#x27;re not getting a cut out of it. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll implement tracking at a certain point which other apps can pay Apple to use.')
