I had prior hobby woodworking experience, so I didn’t have to relearn shop safety, many of the power tools, patience and the “measure twice cut once” mentality, etc. Anyway, if you make a mistake you can just redo the part. A lot of kit manufacturers divide their kits into subkits you can buy separately, allowing you to space the costs out over many years.')
