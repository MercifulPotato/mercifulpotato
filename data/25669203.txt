It&#x27;s a great lens, and while I&#x27;m not a tech expert, it just has a really different look to any of the standard Canon-fit lenses I have.  It looks a bit like the images in the imax, and it&#x27;s not just that it has shallow DoF because of the aperture (I have a sigma 35 that goes down to 1.4).  If I wanted a &#x27;vintage&#x27; look to a photo, I&#x27;d use it, and it&#x27;s great having a large aperture lens for very little money that you can see in action as it&#x27;s manual.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vintage-camera-lenses.com&#x2F;pentacon-135-2-8&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vintage-camera-lenses.com&#x2F;pentacon-135-2-8&#x2F;</a> - I have the version 2 (less desirable!) one.')
