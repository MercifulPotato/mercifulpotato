I&#x27;m not suggesting you should be routinely breaking these rules with cubic BÃ©ziers. Rather, I&#x27;m saying that if you had a better underlying curve family, you wouldn&#x27;t <i>need</i> these rules, as you&#x27;d get good results even with a freer approach to designing curves. That&#x27;s basically the hypothesis we&#x27;re testing.')
