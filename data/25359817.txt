Item(by='hpoe', descendants=None, kids=[25360454, 25361310, 25360075], score=None, time=1607529079, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25359763, text='So I&#x27;ve always been confused by this argument of just start taxing the money that goes to shareholders because the business will reinvest it and create jobs and what not.<p>What keeps the company from reinvesting in the form of company luxury cars for the executives, a company home that they let the CEO live in, and executive compensation. Essentially redirecting the money that would&#x27;ve at least gone to index holders to the shareholders that we felt were getting too much of the pie to begin with.<p>Can someone explain this to me?<p>EDIT: just to clarify I don&#x27;t mean they actually sign over the deed to the house to the ceo but rather the company maintains the house as an &quot;executive&quot; hq that the CEO just happens to live in, and the company doesn&#x27;t give the execs luxury cars they have company cars that the executive just happen to have they keys to and only the execs. Things like that, the company claiming as corporate assets that are really only used by execs. And I am sure there are baskc laws to try and prevent something like this but there are also highly motivated CFOs to find loopholes.')
