The status of said people is irrelevant - taxes are still paid, infrastructure decisions must still be made, etc., so whether any one side benefits more than the other by sticking to the <i>letter of the mandate</i> is irrelevant.<p>When deviating from the mandate, it&#x27;s important to consider motives. When aligning with the mandate, unless it&#x27;s clear that the mandate is ill-formed (which it isn&#x27;t in this case for the reasons I&#x27;ve given above), motives for enforcing the mandate are, as said above, irrelevant.')
