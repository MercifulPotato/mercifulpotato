In my locale, cars and bikes tend to follow different routes. Cars follow the usual fast congested main roads, while bikes thread their way through the neighborhood streets, bike paths, etc. I commute by bike to my workplace amidst very little traffic. In the downtown area, there are some bike paths and lanes that bypass the worst of the car traffic, thanks to abandoned rail lines.')
