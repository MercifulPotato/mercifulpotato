All current European countries have capitalist economies, they&#x27;re just more regulated in favour of the people than in other parts of the world. There&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of wiggle room between a state-controlled planned economy (traditionally called &quot;socialism&quot;) and 18th century style capitalism.')
