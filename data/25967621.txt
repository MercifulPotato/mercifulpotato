(Everywhere.) I think a couple of things tend to undermine it in the modern day:<p>- Very free movement between regions.<p>- No norm of distrust for strangers. In a traditional society, when someone new shows up, the default is that nobody trusts them to do anything. Any transaction that doesn&#x27;t settle immediately can&#x27;t be done, etc. But modern people are supposed to treat strangers as if they didn&#x27;t just show up because they got ejected from their home. This means exiling people more or less corresponds to screwing over the hapless, trusting society they get exiled to.<p>There is a solution implemented in the US, the sex offender registry, meant to address this exact problem. (&quot;What if someone enters our community, but they&#x27;re not trustworthy?&quot;)  The problem is that the formalization of the sex offender registry (1) is the same everywhere -- not a big problem; the old norm of distrust for strangers doesn&#x27;t differ in that regard -- and (2) <i>supersedes</i> the old system whereby a stranger could, over time, become trusted. You might personally trust someone who once urinated in public, but he&#x27;ll never be <i>officially</i> trustworthy no matter what happens.')
