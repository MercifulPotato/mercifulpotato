Most of the areas where machine learning is currently deployed are somewhat obnoxious. Ad targeting. Face recognition. Behavior recognition. Those are areas where some error is expected, so mediocre ML performance is acceptable. ML isn&#x27;t yet good enough to drive, for example. That has a lower tolerance for errors.<p>All this is &quot;focusing on the human&quot;. In the sense of &quot;Big Brother is Watching You&quot;. Be careful of what you ask for.')
