Spontaneity just changes a bit, it&#x27;s not a boolean choice. You can spontaneously ask a friend to do something, and if they can&#x27;t (because of kids or whatever) then you can schedule it. Is this less spontaneous than going over unannounced as a kid? A bit, yeah. But at least it still feels like fun. Scheduling friendships &quot;like meetings&quot; with &quot;recurring events&quot; is the polar opposite of spontaneous. That just feels like work.')
