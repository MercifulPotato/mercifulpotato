I can understand the author putting every library&#x2F;language&#x2F;package-manager&#x2F;examples in V together and trying to bring out a wonderful experience out of a language, but wouldn&#x27;t it be better if the memory manager is fixed first and foremost.<p>At the moment its still incomplete. And this is the most interesting part of the whole language. ARC, weak refs, autofree also working together needs to be done, only then will this language be of weight. Garbage collection is a difficult problem to be fair and it definitely determines the performance of many languages. Not to mention multi-threaded GC is difficult. I am excited to see how the author pulls this one through. See you again with V 0.3. Till then best of luck!')
