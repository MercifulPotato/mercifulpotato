This is a purely functional argument. When something is sold for its fundamental value, nobody loses. That&#x27;s why its good for society for things to transact at their intrinsic value.<p>&gt; That being said, if you&#x27;re worried about pushing prices away from fundamental value, how about negative crude prices?<p>It was crude <i>futures</i> that were negative. Crude oil has storage costs. Those costs rarely overwhelm the value of the asset, but in particular circumstances they can. That is what happened when crude futures went negative. It seems illogical, but if you actually understand it, it all makes sense and fits neatly inside an intrinsic value narrative.')
