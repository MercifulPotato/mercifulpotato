They&#x27;ve removed USB-A from their laptops close to 5 years ago, because USB-C is the future.<p>They&#x27;ve also removed the headphone jack from iPhone; however, the USB-C is still nowhere to be found.  Why?!<p>The end result is that we can charge a MacBook with a ThinkPad power adapter, but no longer have MagSafe; have been using ugly adapters on MacBooks for close to 5 years now -- with no end in sight, yet still cannot use the same headset for both a MacBook and an iPhone.<p>Ironically, from this perspective, Android is now more compatible with a MacBook than an iPhone is -- my USB-A headphones with the USB-A-to-USB-C adapter can be plugged directly into either my Android or my MacBook, without any extra adapters, other than the permanently-attached USB-A-to-USB-C one.  (Of course, the opposite isn&#x27;t true -- and the USB-C adapter for the headsets from my phone doesn&#x27;t work in a MacBook, but at least the opposite way everything works.)')
