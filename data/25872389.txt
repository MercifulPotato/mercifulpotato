Yes, the full iteration of possible situations you could get into are quite large, and maybe you miss some -- but there are also options for coding in some kind of &quot;reset&quot; quick-switch that doesn&#x27;t require the UI.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure I buy the claim that &quot;things like that are tolerated a lot less&quot;.
