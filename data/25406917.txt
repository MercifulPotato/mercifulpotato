It really breaks down when you put it in boolean form because the &quot;or&quot; implies other actions when true rather than actions if false. Removing the &quot;or&quot; completely is unambiguous but is antiquated English.<p>Examples:\n&quot;Go to college or else work for your uncle&quot;<p>Turn this into boolean form:\n&quot;If you go to college then &lt;foo&gt; or else you will work for your uncle&quot;<p>But the &quot;or&quot; makes the meaning ambiguous:\n&quot;If it rains then I will work inside or else I will work outside.&quot;<p>It is not clear if this means you will work outside if and only if it is not raining? Maybe working outside is another option if it rains.<p>Otherwise is far more clear.\n&quot;If it rains then I will work inside otherwise I will work outside.&quot;<p>Removing the &quot;or&quot; completely makes the statements unambiguous archaic English:\n&quot;If you go to college then &lt;foo&gt; else you will work for your uncle&quot;\n&quot;If it rains then I will work inside else I will work outside.&quot;<p>FWIW - I am very glad they chose else over otherwise...')
