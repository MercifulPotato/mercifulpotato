The energy wasted by braking is quite negligible compared to riding at reasonable speed with some headwind. better invest in a better battery or make the bike cheaper than regenerative braking. At least from my perspective with an electric cargo bike an normal e-bike, and a super expensive speed-pedelc (45km&#x2F;h) Stromer bike with regenerative braking. Because of the regenerative braking my fastest bike is actually the slowest if the battery is dead. Also it is almost impossible to go faster than the speed limit as the bike actively brakes whenever you go over 48 km&#x2F;h. That&#x27;s why I am selling it.')
