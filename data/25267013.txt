If this was just an overlooked bug, which was reported to Apple and which Apple then fixed, that would be the system working as intended.<p>In reality, a very simple bug was reported more than a year ago, and Apple apparently hasn&#x27;t cared enough to fix it. The only way I can interpret that is to conclude Apple doesn&#x27;t really care about the integrity of their sandbox.<p>IMO, this more than justifies the author&#x27;s accusation of &quot;security theater&quot;. My browsing history is among the most sensitive data on my machineâ€”certainly more private than anything in my Documents folder, which Apple felt the need to protect in a highly-disruptive way. I agree that it can be worth trading some degree of usability for privacy and security, but only if those privacy benefits are real. If they&#x27;re not, then we&#x27;re left in the worst of both worlds.<p>It&#x27;s really quite damning.')
