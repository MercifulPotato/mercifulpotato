This level is influenced by external forces, like regulation.<p>So regulators need to step their game way up, but are also time &amp; resource-constrained. How do regulators pull the needed resources? Tax money.<p>How to justify tax money? Have a public that is informed of the danger and criticality of having hospitals operated in the way they are right now.<p>This is of course a big simplification, but the chain goes much further than just &quot;IT that doesn&#x27;t patch.&quot;')
