Give room for people to speak on their authentic experience (without trying to feel any personal offense) and give this forum to people who identify on any side of the political aisle. I happen to take the opinion that this so-called &quot;Anti-Racist&quot; movement happens to espouse quite a few policies that are discriminatory. Its not to say that some of their efforts are bad, but there needs to be room for critique without accusations of harboring racial resentment. The lack of room of express is creating resentment IMO.')
