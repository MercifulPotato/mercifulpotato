A shipment full of batteries or deodorant&#x2F;paint spray cans is not really dangerous if it gets thrown into the sea, but firefighters need to know that in case a fire breaks out.<p>And you don&#x27;t want to place something like pyrotechnics next to tires next to ammonium fertilizer as it was in that warehouse in Beirut.<p>tl;dr: &quot;dangerous goods&quot; classification is most important for on-shore handling and safety considerations, not because of environment concerns in case of an at-sea loss.')
