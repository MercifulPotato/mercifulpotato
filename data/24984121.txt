The last mile isn&#x27;t prohibitively expensive, but enough that you don&#x27;t get any kind of competition, either, and the space isn&#x27;t extremely crowded.<p>By the time Starlink goes wide it probably won&#x27;t be any cheaper than I&#x27;m currently paying, but what I am paying is quite absurd given that it&#x27;s not a network of satellites. It&#x27;s just a fiber optic cable that was long since amortized to zero.')
