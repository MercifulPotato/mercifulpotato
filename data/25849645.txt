Really appreciate your bringing these issues up.<p>Regarding payments, this has been coming up and we’ll need to pick your brain as we develop solutions. For now we are managing payments for companies that hire remotely by wire transferring the funds ourselves. In other words, the companies send the money to our US entity and then we do the transfer. We’ve also been looking at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pilot.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pilot.co&#x2F;</a>  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boundlesshq.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boundlesshq.com&#x2F;</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.letsdeel.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.letsdeel.com&#x2F;</a>. Are you familiar with those? What do you think? Btw Pilot is also a YC company that initially planned to be a full-time remote work marketplace, but switched to facilitating payments because there was such a big need there.<p>You’re right of course that in North Africa (the Maghreb) many don’t speak Arabic nor identify as Arab. When we call it “the Middle East and North Africa,” we also get feedback that it’s inaccurate. I wish there were a better word! We’ll keep iterating until we get it right.<p>PS: My co-founder Iliana has spent lots of time in Morocco and some in Algeria… and can’t wait to go back! She speaks some darija… and picked up a few words of Berber. :)')
