It&#x27;s really just not that good. The action sequences are very low quality. The writing is fairly mundane faux-gritty tropes. Would people like it if it didn&#x27;t have the star wars backdrop? Does the star wars backdrop even make that much sense?<p>I know this one won&#x27;t bother many people but I particularly hated their depiction of the bounty hunter droid, which was orders of magnitude more competent than any other droid in the universe. Droids in star wars aren&#x27;t immaculate AI like other Sci Fi. I hated that they used this as a plot point.')
