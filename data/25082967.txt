In the Anglophone world, the easiest example to think of is enclosure[1] which was a war between the mercantile class on one side and the lazier half of the lords and the little people on the other.<p>If any company, be they Google, be they Apple, should experience total &quot;victory&quot; in the war on intellectual property they would find everyone who is not<p><pre><code>  * An investor\n  * In management\n  * An employee\n  * A temp&#x2F;contractor, or\n  * A happy customer\n</code></pre>\nSet against them and they would fall. Imagine there was a neural network or network of neural networks that could arrange bits into entertaining movies. It would print money and it would not be strategic for whatever company had the resources to do that to hoard the benefits, they would have no customers if they did (I suppose if they had enough compute and memory resources to succeed in such a task they might already have a monopoly on money).<p>I used to understand the CEO&#x27;s job as cheerleader, for the investors, for the employees. I still think that is how they operate tactically, but strategically, I think the goal of a CEO in a Obama-era neo-liberal is to put the whole world in one of those categories above I suppose, with the acceptable additions of<p><pre><code>  * Vendor&#x2F;supplier\n  * Companies in partnership\n  * Competitors who participate in a trade association together in a reasonably civil manner, or\n  * Members of government who are lobbied to advocate for your firm or industry or a strategic need that you hold in common with the broader public\n</code></pre>\nIn the long run the alternative is to perish. Utopia I think may have been inevitable by the 50s&#x2F;60s when people started to believe that some companies really would last forever. On a long enough time scale, it is best to do everything in everyone&#x27;s best interest considered in toto.<p>So all of that to say that I expect one day, maybe 40 years from now, maybe 80, that IP as it operates today will be transformed into an index of ideas that everyone can take and implement who might put them to use beneficially for the citizenry and other residents. It will be nice after all of that work to have a primary key for the ideas that have been created so far, so I don&#x27;t think we the people will burn down the USPTO or the LOC or anything like that.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inclosure_Acts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inclosure_Acts</a>')
