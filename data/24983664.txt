You have to say what you mean two different ways, and those two phrasings have to be reconcilable. This is still a useful guard against careless errors! But it is a different problem from checking whether your software actually <i>does</i> the right thing.<p>The magnitude of change needed in unit tests while changing code is definitely maddening. For example: add an argument to a method. It&#x27;s called only 3 places in production code, but each of those sites has 10 test cases, so there are 30 mock expectations to update now. And the IDE doesn&#x27;t understand those so no automated support.<p>On the other hand, integration and end-to-end tests will go red when (seemingly) nothing at all has changed, because of drift in tangentially related components from other codebases. Usually the fixes are simple, but it requires a willingness to drop what you&#x27;re doing and investigate when they happen. Otherwise they just get ignored.')
