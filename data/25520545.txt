I am sick of people trying to accuse big tech for all the woes of the world. I see it too much ion the media, and, surprisingly, here on HN.<p><i>Big tech is NOT a monopoly. You, the user, are not their customer, and thus you (as a citizen) cannot claim antitrust or wrongdoing. Still don&#x27;t like Facebook and Google? Then delete your FB profile and use duck duck go.</i> [1]<p>You know what industries are becoming monopolies? These:<p>* Financial services [2]<p>* Media [3]<p>* Telecom and ISPs [4]<p>* Airlines [5]<p>* and others I can&#x27;t remember at the moment<p>IMO, the negative consequences of those industries merging together are <i>far more material</i> than FB. You can quit FB, you can&#x27;t quit your checking account or your ISP. [6]<p>Corporate media and their proxy boot-lickers (looking at you, Matt Stoller) have you fetishizing about big tech (for the page views, again looking your way, Stoller) so you are too distracted when ATT acquires Time Warner under your nose, and now you get watch crappier programming (how about that last season of Game of Thrones?) on a crappier internet connection (from ATT), all for the same price, while ATT cuts costs with &quot;synergy&quot; (vomit) and the stock price goes up.<p>Stoller makes a weak attempt at highlighting my point:<p>&gt; As Steven Perlstein noted in the Washington Post, this effort is more than just an attack on Google and Facebook, but a “legal shot across the bow of dominant firms in other highly concentrated industries — pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, financial services — who are now on notice that their nonstop acquisitions and hardball business practices could invite similar challenge.”<p>Yeah...too late.<p>[1] You won&#x27;t, even though you can.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2010&#x2F;01&#x2F;bank-merger-history&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2010&#x2F;01&#x2F;bank-merger-his...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Concentration_of_media_ownership" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Concentration_of_media_ownersh...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Regional_Bell_Operating_Company" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Regional_Bell_Operating_Compan...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;airline-mergers-and-acquisitions-in-the-us-since-2000-2020-3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;airline-mergers-and-acquisit...</a><p>[6] Likely you only have one ISP to choose from for your location. Hint: that&#x27;s a monopoly.')
