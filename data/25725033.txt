So either the FBI was previously lying on the record to make <i>themselves</i> look bad, or officials that won’t go on the record are lying to place the blame for failures on the <i>Capitol Police</i> after the head of the Capitol Police resigned at the request of the Speaker, so that responsibility is on a head that has already rolled.')
