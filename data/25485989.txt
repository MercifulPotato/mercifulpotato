Bad.<p>How many executives and powerful managers are there at CDPR and how many of them have significant development experience?<p>Another aspect is the timing with Christmas.<p>I think it came down to getting $400 million now for a buggy beta version or admitting it&#x27;s not done and either delaying again or offering a partial refund to preorders.<p>So the right thing to do might have been to release a beta version for people who wanted it, say it&#x27;s a beta, and give people back $10 or something.  Because if you say it&#x27;s not finished, people are not going to want to pay the full $60.<p>So I think it comes down to money.  You would need a really strong person to suggest that they do something that could reduce the income by $80 million or something.  Maybe that person doesn&#x27;t exist.  But if they do then I doubt they would be a manager.  They would be a builder.')
