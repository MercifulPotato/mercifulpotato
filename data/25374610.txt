I&#x27;m a person in my 30s. If I got covid symptoms, I would warn everyone I&#x27;ve had close or transitive close contact with -- that is, our nanny, my son&#x27;s tutor, and my son&#x27;s classroom. But I don&#x27;t know if I would bother to get tested. How does knowing you have it help? I guess if I was sure I had it it would be nice to get confirmation so that I could have a strong belief I&#x27;m immune going forward. But other than that I&#x27;m not sure how it helps.')
