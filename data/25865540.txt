I&#x27;m more amazed at how cheap it is, and I&#x27;m a bit worried that employees are not getting paid enough.<p>Costco is probably the more &#x27;reasonable&#x27; one.  They mark up the products probably 5-10%.  So this one I feel that the delivery people are probably being paid ok.. although my nearest costco is 16 miles away (about 25min).. so it kind of feels like a steal to be able to get delivery from them for what feels like not a whole lot more.<p>Walmart is closer, but there are no markups.. and I pay whatever $10&#x2F;mo for free delivery from them.  Order multiple times a month.<p>I&#x27;m honestly not sure I&#x27;m going to go back to the stores as often even when things are normal.')
