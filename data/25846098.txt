And it&#x27;s painless. I mean really painless.  My network is small (Arch Linux, MBP and an android phone) right now but will be adding my wifes machines soon.  \nI am Planning to run dnsmasq (my next project).  Tailscale has &#x27;MagicDNS&#x27; but doesn&#x27;t (yet?) support aliases, which is nice for hosted services (eg photos.domain.vpn)<p>I will be running self hosted services that we use and available anywhere in the world (with a connection) that I don&#x27;t need a VPS for.<p>I am waiting for broader availability of their sharing feature:  my extended family can each have their own networks and then I can expose self hosted services to them (ie photos, recipes, updates&#x2F;posts, etc).')
