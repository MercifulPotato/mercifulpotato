I was ready to update to an RTX 30-series card once they were finally available, but now I&#x27;m strongly considering a RX 6000-series card.<p>Of course, even if AMD&#x27;s benchmarks are representative of how the card will actually perform and even with the lower price, I still have to consider Nvidia for their software features. Shadow Play, G-Sync, and RTX Voice are some nice features. Not to mention DLSS...<p>With the $1000 price tag on the RX 6900 XT, though, I think Nvidia would be crazy to not lower the price of the RTX 3090.')
