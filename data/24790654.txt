I&#x27;d like to turn my current device into a headless server and build a new PC specifically to run Ubuntu well.<p>CUDA is a key use case for me though - I actually use quite a lot of software that depends on it and my understanding is I can&#x27;t do that with AMD graphics. I&#x27;d also like to get in on the RTX 3080&#x2F;3070 action and I think I might value that performance more than being able to run Linux natively.')
