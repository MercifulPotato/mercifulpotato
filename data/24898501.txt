Tasks that are so perfectly well-defined are exactly what this &quot;smart&quot; tech is useful for.  Except that recently, Siri screwed me.  I said &quot;hey Siri, set an alarm for 6:30am&quot; and her response was &quot;Ok, your 6:30am alarm is on,&quot; but what she <i>actually</i> meant was &quot;Ok, I ensured that your standing alarm for every tuesday at 6:30am is on&quot; which meant she <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> enabling the alarm for 6:30am <i>tomorrow</i>, so I overslept.  Very annoying and completely blew my trust in a very useful function.')
