That would include physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, engineering, architecture, agriculture, astronomy, medicine, theology, philosophy, history, etc. Obviously not every last detail but a lifetime of study would allow for learning at least the key points of every major field. Of course even then very few people actually did it, and now we&#x27;re way past that point.')
