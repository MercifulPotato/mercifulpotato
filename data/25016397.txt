Sure, Democrats make missteps all the time, and I&#x27;m more than happy to campaign with you against specific things that the Democrats have done over the years, but I can&#x27;t think of a single good thing that Republicans have done in my adult lifetime. Since Newt Gingrich, it seems that Republican&#x27;s primary purpose in life is to grab more power - the country be damned. I&#x27;m more that willing to vote for a Republican that isn&#x27;t just a party shill, and has reasonable views on things like gay rights, abortion, the war on drugs, military spending, healthcare, etc, but I have yet to see even a single one.
