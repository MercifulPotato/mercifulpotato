Whether you characterize it as prestige, pedigry or whatever... it&#x27;s probably a gross oversimplification of what&#x27;s going on.<p>A corporation is a cultural institution as well as an economic institution, and the cultural side is strong when it comes to these kinds of firms.<p>A lot of the work (or &quot;work&quot;) that these consultancies do relates to board&#x2F;investors and management&#x27;s cultural machinery. Being &quot;external, for example, is a defining characteristic. Their reports and suggestions allow management to do stuff that they&#x27;re having cultural difficulties doing.<p>In any case, I&#x27;d posit two points. Point one is that class plays a major role in these firms, from recruitment to the culture of the firm to the value of the services they provide. This is not surprising considering that their job revolves around confidence from elite individuals. Point two is that humans still respond to class. We all know it, but have a hard time with the moral implications. We excuse. We deny. We point and scream. We create grande theories, new terms and types.')
