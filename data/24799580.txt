Their moat is being able to handle local bureaucracy and pump in the heavy capital required to deploy the network. They like to buy and use proven tech that comes with SLAs and support from large tech vendors. They will wait for FSOC to be mature before they do anything meaningful.<p>We get the largest ROI from FSOC tech simply because we&#x27;re building the network from scratch and are targeting the low cost market that is currently underserved. Most other ISPs are aiming for the premium market.')
