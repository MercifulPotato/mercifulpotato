It&#x27;s primarily using Python or R to build statistical models to do things like:<p>- Predict the likelihood of a customer to churn<p>- Cluster customers into key segments for targeted messaging<p>- Analyze and distribute customer support requests based on their content<p>- Proactively identify bot or fraud activity<p>- Create multi-touch attribution models for marketing touchpoints<p>- Analyze multi-variate tests<p>I think the problem you&#x27;re hinting at is that many organizations say they&#x27;re doing data science, or that they need data science, without knowing exactly what the role entails. As a result, many organizations hire &quot;Data Scientists&quot; that are doing the work of a Data Engineer, Analyst, and BI Developer all combined.<p>I think 2015-2020 saw a huge surge in interest for Data Science, whereas 2020-2025 will have a surge in interest for Data Engineering.... mostly because organizations realized they can&#x27;t do anything interesting with data until resilient, clean data sets are built for the organization.')
