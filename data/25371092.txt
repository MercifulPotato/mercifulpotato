They had pretty hard numbers and reasons for their predictions, but plenty of people were not persuaded.<p>Another example is Ray Kurzweil&#x27;s predictions about the singularity, which also had their reasons, statistics, etc, but plenty of people disputed them and made counterarguments.<p>But least you could tell why they believed their predictions would happen within that timeframe.<p>No such evaluation is possible with the &quot;bioerror&quot; predictions, however, since they didn&#x27;t make arguments for why it should happen by the end of 2020, but instead just expressed their &quot;gut feeling&quot;, as you point out.<p>That&#x27;s absolutely worthless.')
