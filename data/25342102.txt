In 1992, I bought a Kenwood stereo receiver, which I still have in my living room to this day, which you could program your radio station call letters into for your presets, and I noticed that after setting one of the presets to &quot;KNBR&quot; it switched to &quot;KNBB&quot;.  I assumed I made a mistake and corrected it, but a few days later I noticed it happened again.  Assuming ASCII encoding, B is 0x42 and R is 0x52, so the difference is the single bit (and even assuming non-ASCII, the delta of 16 is likely still the same), so I experimented and determined that that particular memory location always eventually zeroed the 4th least significant bit, so all characters from P-Z would be shifted down to the corresponding character 16 positions less than it.  Nowadays I don&#x27;t really use the radio presets anymore, but I still like knowing the flaw is there nearly 30 years later.')
