Item(by='smichel17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610159095, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25692383, text='&gt; It&#x27;s not terrorism.<p>I think you undermine your own argument here.<p>The problem is that &quot;terrorism&quot; does not have an agreed-upon definition. As far as I can tell, the smallest common subset of definitions -- ie, what everyone will agree on -- is  &quot;violent crime that should carry particularly harsh punishments.&quot; If you use the word before agreeing on its meaning, that&#x27;s the definition you fall back to.<p>Historically, western liberal democracy believes in the rule of law -- that the punishment should fit the crime, rather than our opinion of the criminal. Obviously this is violent crime. Without choosing a more specific definition, the only thing left to argue about is whether it deserves extraordinary punishment, given the same set of facts. Treating that as a valid argument to have is rejecting the rule of law.<p>The alternative is to decide on a definition. What makes terrorism different from breaking and entering? Assault? Murder? Mass murder? Rebel? Revolutionary? Etc. If the answer is &quot;nothing&quot;, then use the other word instead. Keep loaded terms like &quot;terrorism&quot; out of the debate unless they&#x27;re needed.')
