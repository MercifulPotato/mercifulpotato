Its overarching point is that Randi was contemptuous of people who spent their time &quot;studying&quot; ESP, precognition, and other nonsense, with a few attempts to smear him with spurious comparisons to McCarthy. Of course James Randi was contemptuous of those people, and of course they hated him for it. But that doesn&#x27;t make merit a vulgar character assassination a week after his death.<p>Plus, the article does precisely what you have just asked me not to do: it attacks the man and his character without making the slightest argument as to why he was wrong to dismiss ESP and occult research.<p>&gt; He was to skepticism what Senator Joseph McCarthy was to anticommunism â€” a showman, a bully, and, ultimately, the very thing he claimed to fight against: a fraud.<p>I find it perverse that someone who makes a living touting the power of positive thinking to reshape reality and make you rich believes he speaks for the &quot;real skeptics&quot;. It&#x27;s tendentious nonsense from the first word to the last.')
