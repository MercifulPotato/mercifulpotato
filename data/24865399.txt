Which makes it really difficult to separate engineering decisions based on current available technology with predictions of future advancement.  At the time people where well aware of all the issues with vacuum tubes, and potentially  based on Quantium mechanics transistors should be able sidestep most of them.   Which is why so much money was spent on improving transistors despite the mature competition and transistor adoption was so rapid.<p>Similarly, many different flying machines pre dated the Wright brothers including balloons, heavier than air gliders, and freaking kites.  The problem was the crap engines of the time, which is why so many heavier than air aircraft so many inventors appeared at the same time.  And why we donâ€™t use anything like the Wright brothers aircraft.')
