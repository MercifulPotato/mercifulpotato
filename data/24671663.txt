So far I wasn’t able to actually opt out of anything. One service resulted in an error, the rest are just links to their policies where I couldn’t find any actionable links to do anything just them explaining that they’ll keep sharing my data. One explained to me how to unsubscribe from their mailing list with a screenful of text. So “Simple” is not what I would use for these links.')
