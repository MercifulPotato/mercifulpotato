It takes place after both my editor and my proofreader have completed their jobs, at which point I don&#x27;t touch the file any more. If you format your own, then you&#x27;re already in an  small niche.<p>Some people may need &quot;special characters&quot; they can&#x27;t type, but I have keybindings for the characters I use.<p>Grammar checking and corrections is my proofreaders job, not mine. It happens after I&#x27;ve converted my document and sent it off.<p>Macros are supported in pretty much every editor I&#x27;ve ever used for plain-text. I use lots of macros, but exactly zero of them for my novels.<p>I don&#x27;t need to send and receive documents with no conversion needed. I do <i>one</i> export when I&#x27;m done with my first draft, and then I edit and do one more export before handing it over to my proofreader. Then, sure, I review those changes in Librewriter. The proportion of my time that takes is tiny. It&#x27;d be nice not to have to, but I&#x27;d take that over having to work in a word processor during writing any day.<p>&gt; No offense but you don&#x27;t sound like someone who writes a lot?<p>As someone who has written several novels, that&#x27;s how your comment came across to me. At the same time I know novelists range from the pen and paper type (e.g. Gaiman, King to give two examples discussed in this thread) up to wanting word processors with all bells and whistles - it&#x27;s very much down to taste.')
