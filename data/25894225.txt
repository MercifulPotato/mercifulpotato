I really like the idea of having a commandline but also an editor you can easily switch to. I have only seen this implemented once before (the BASIC that is shipped with RiscOS).<p>I understand the author is not working on this for fame, but BASIC is really underrated as a learning language these days. This could be a pretty good playground for teaching kids programming.<p>I&#x27;m going to be so selfish as to give two suggestions&#x2F;requests. The first is to have a way to switch to a white background in the editor (I managed to do it in the commandline), since it&#x27;s hard to use for someone with astigmatism like myself.<p>The other is some graphics features. They may exist but I didn&#x27;t find any. Something that I really enjoyed as a kid, learning to program, was to use commands such as LINE, CIRCLE, RECTANGLE etc to draw things on the screen. Being a Commodore 64 user, I didn&#x27;t hey much opportunity to do that until I got a BASIC extension that supported graphics.')
