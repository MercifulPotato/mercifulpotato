Iâ€™ve been following with mild interest.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ve been in Bitcoin for too long, but 2.5 to 44 is cause for this much attention? I guess I&#x27;m immune to that level of volatility these days.<p>I mean I get the amount of security&#x27;s fraud and agencies like the SEC just waiting to justify their inflated salaries and budgets... but with the level of fraud in the stock market and banks <i>this</i> is likely what they would focus on as it they probably don&#x27;t have massive lobbiysists in Washington paying for them to shape legislation to match their grift.<p>I&#x27;ve seen several Gamestops shut down and have going out of business sales for current inventory with long lines, I&#x27;m sure that would add to their liquidity situation in the short term if it was done at scale for recovering investments on outdated&#x2F;old merchanidise.
