There are plenty of real &quot;hackers&quot; who have the right interpersonal skills and self-awareness to be lead teams in a business context and get work done. Unfortunately, there are plenty of self-described &quot;hackers&quot; who use think their intellectual superiority excuses a lot of bad behavior in the workplace, from stonewalling projects unless&#x2F;until they get their way to railing against the corporation.<p>If these hackers want to go off and start their own companies then I&#x27;m all for it.
