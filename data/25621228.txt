I noticed Calendar was showing 2020 had 52 weeks and all week numbers of 2021 were off by one. I changed to en-UK locale and the issue got resolved.<p>Which begs the question: what on Earth week numbering system the en-US locale was using? I am not aware of any US-specific week numbering system, so it would seem logical for the en-US locale to use the ISO system.')
