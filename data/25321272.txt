Here&#x27;s a sample of your odds of dying from a variety of causes as a 15-45 year old, sourced from the CDC [1][2] and your paper, and assuming there are about 45 million Americans in the 15-45 year old age range:<p><pre><code>  Drug overdose: 1 in 1000\n  COVID: 1 in 2000\n  Suicide: 1 in 2000 \n  Car accident: 1 in 2500\n  [any gun-related death]: 1 in 2500\n  Homicide: 1 in 3000\n  The flu: 1 in 20,000\n  Struck by lighting: 1 in a million\n  Terrorism: 1 in ~100 million [3]\n</code></pre>\n(COVID and influenza are infection fatality rates, the rest are rates among the general population.  If you live in a wealthy neighborhood and don&#x27;t have guns in the house your risks from suicide, homicide, and terrorism are basically nil, while if you&#x27;re in West Baltimore they&#x27;re much worse.)<p>You be the judge from that.  Personally I consider COVID worrisome enough to take sensible precautions and endure some inconveniences, but not the end of the world (well, personally.  It may be the end of many societies, possibly even including the U.S).  The #1 health risk that people seem to undervalue is &quot;Don&#x27;t do drugs&quot;, and the #1 most overvalued is the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;.  It&#x27;s interesting how many infringements of our civil liberties and economic life we put up with in the name of curbing terrorism, when median number of terrorist deaths in the U.S. per year is 4, and COVID is 50,000 times more likely to kill us.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;injury&#x2F;wisqars&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_2017-508.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;injury&#x2F;wisqars&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;leading_causes_of_dea...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;injury&#x2F;wisqars&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;leading_causes_of_injury_deaths_highlighting_unintentional_2017-508.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;injury&#x2F;wisqars&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;leading_causes_of_inj...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Terrorism_in_the_United_States#U.S._totals" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Terrorism_in_the_United_States...</a>')
