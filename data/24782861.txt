A little lithography, some selective dissolution like Gorilla glass, perhaps some tricks from the optical fiber industry, and bam, you have a fine coaxial filament which creates a region of 100&#x27;s-of -MPa stress along the length of the fiber. Maybe even GPa, though that&#x27;s tensile-strength-of-nanotubes territory.<p>Certainly it&#x27;s years away but I dunno...This feels <i>possible</i> in an engineering sense.')
