Its first principle is the notion that an app, a machine, a software program, or an algorithm offers the best solution to any complicated problem.<p>Critics of &quot;technosolutionism&quot; as the author calls it often end up committing the same mistake backwards. Why implement an unpopular, slow, inconsistent and&#x2F;or expensive social reform when a perfectly good technology <i>does</i> exist?<p>One example is noise pollution. We continue to build buildings with thin walls where even the &quot;recommended&quot; STC 50 means that you can hear &quot;loud speech&quot; through the wall, to say nothing of music:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;commercial-acoustics.com&#x2F;common-wall-stc-values&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;commercial-acoustics.com&#x2F;common-wall-stc-values&#x2F;</a><p>Then we waste inordinate amounts of time and energy fining noise violations, which fails to actually prevent noise, but <i>does</i> do a good job of making young people hate the cops. After more than 10 years living in what passes for multi-unit housing in the United States, I still lie awake at night wishing for technosolutionism to put a proper wall between me and my neighbors.')
