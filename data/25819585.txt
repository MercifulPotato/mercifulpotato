But there are sufficient common characteristics to trace a lineage in all of them, albeit certainly intermixed with other influences.<p>In the specific case of the Greek mythology, these deities have distinct Indo-European parallels: Zeus (Dyēus, Sky Father), Eos (<i>H₂éusōs, Dawn goddess), Helios (</i>Seh₂ul, Sun god), Castor and Pollux (*Dyḗws Ph₂tḗr, Divine Horse Twins), and more, enough to at least put the Greek mythology squarely in the Indo-European tradition. The quote in isolation gives an incorrect impression.')
