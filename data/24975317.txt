Times Square St has to be the most trafficked station.<p>&gt; and certainly not for the massive overbuild of platform and mezzanine that exists today.<p>Better that than an oversized Jets Stadium where subpar football gets played 8 times a year.<p>I always assumed that Hudson Yards would serve as a terminus for future lines to new jersey. But I guess political will and federal funding is required for that.')
