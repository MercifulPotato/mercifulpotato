Pre-covid, reducing that commute was not an option without paying <i>significantly</i> more on housing. In fact, I don&#x27;t mind working extra hours if it means I don&#x27;t waste time on commuting. Personally I think that&#x27;s a win-win for both myself and my employer, but the company is traditional conservative enough that permanent or even majority WFH is a nonstarter.<p>The only downside is that we live in a relatively small (900 sq ft) condo that does not have a balcony and does not get much sunlight, so my wife and I get cabin fever. We also take the pandemic serious enough that we do not venture out except for absolute necessities. We&#x27;ve decided our next place to live will be detached housing, or at least an apartment with a large balcony.<p>In terms of social life, this isn&#x27;t a problem though since we are both introverts. We only have a handful of close friends, and most of them are also taking the pandemic seriously enough that they are likewise bunkering in at their homes.')
