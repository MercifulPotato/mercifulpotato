Additionally, most of the Linux kernel developers use Thinkpads, so the drivers for Thinkpad are always good. I&#x27;ve never had to download drivers individually.<p>Here&#x27;s a list of things that just &quot;worked&quot; without me having to do anything:<p>1. My bluetooth noise cancelling headphones paired with no issues.<p>2. My desktop display with usb-c just works.<p>3. Old-style plugin iphone headphones worked as did their builtin mic.<p>4. Logitech camera plugging into my monitor and routing to the laptop via usb-c just works.<p>5. I have yet to find a printer (as long as its on the same wifi network) that I can&#x27;t use (granted I barely print anything).<p>6. You can install and manage everything via the GUI.<p>7. Docker just works.<p>Things that didn&#x27;t work:<p>1. I had to install &quot;gnome-tweaks&quot; in order to remap my CapsLock key to Control.<p>In my ten years of using Thinkpad+Fedora I&#x27;ve only encountered one issue and that was during the Wayland transition. The Zoom client (as in video chat) briefly didn&#x27;t support screen sharing, but that was fixed several versions ago.<p>Also, people saying that &quot;M1&quot; is a gamechanger: I totally get it for certain sectors, but for Software Engineers? Memory has always been my bottleneck. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen my CPU choke on a legitimate task.')
