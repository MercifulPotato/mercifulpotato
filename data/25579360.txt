Shareholder capitalism is one-<i>share</i>-one-vote, but those shares can and usually are concentrated under the control of a small number of people. The GGGP seems to be talking about a system of one-<i>worker</i>-one-vote, which would prevent that kind of concentration and therefore have a different dynamic.<p>The distinction you&#x27;re making doesn&#x27;t appear relevant. If you&#x27;re an employee and your company merges with one of equal size, your vote is diluted by half. If you&#x27;re a shareholder and your company merges with one of equal size, your vote is diluted by half. It&#x27;s true whether you own one share or a million.<p>&gt; Also, shareholders tend to monomanically pursue maximization of dividends + capital gains over some time horizon, while I&#x27;d imagine a worker would care a more diverse range of things.<p>=&gt; But being a monopoly provides more resources to tackle those other issues, at the expense of the <i>customers</i>, and why do the employees care about them any more than the shareholders would?')
