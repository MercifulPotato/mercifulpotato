But that is not really a reasonable solution to anything.<p>This is not the goal here. The goal is switch to FLOSS wherever possible and expand FLOSS alternatives. It starts from a small number of apps, but currently F-Droid has most of what you need already. So I don&#x27;t see this a a problem, except for very specific needs (or if you are into Facebook and co).<p>&gt; I find it massively frustrating that these FLOSS projects will not do the same. They will just not even try to protect you.<p>First of all, anbox is already a thing, and it can definitely sandbox your apps. Second, GNU&#x2F;Linux phones are just at the beginning and they are already far ahead of the first Apple or Android phones. Expect a revolution there...')
