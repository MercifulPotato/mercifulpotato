A lot of the &quot;old&quot; media companies saw the &quot;success&quot; of free online content, be it digital-only-ad-based publishers, be it social media, and started to mimic that, and in the process not only desperately pivoted into a market that in fact isn&#x27;t as successful as they thought but also burnt a lot of their reputation in the process.<p>Right now it seems back to paid models for a lot, but I wonder if it&#x27;s too late now with all the damaged reputation and the shift in consumer expectation (that they help create) that news and journalism should be free. I&#x27;d guess for a lot of those newspapers and magazines it will be too late, while a few will survive the onslaught and be able to concentrate the willing-to-pay consumers.')
