The objects are interpreters. I referenced a discussion elsewhere in this thread between Alan Kay and Rich Hickey where Kay talks about the value of interpreters. Rich Hickey talks about data&#x2F;values coming from a seismometer or an IoT device but what he misses there I think is that it&#x27;s not all just &quot;data&quot;. There are also stateful agents. The seismometer (or the earthquake) is a stateful agent and the data is messages that are sent by it. If we had to model a seismometer or iot device (e.g. a smoke alarm) it would be best to do so using an object that encapsulates it&#x27;s state and manages itself. It only communicates to the outside world with messages&#x2F;data (in this case a sound when the temperature exceeds some internal state). I can replace my smoke alarm with another and I don&#x27;t need to understand anything about its internal data or how it interprets it.<p>But for dealing with the historical data from an IoT device it may make sense to use a data oriented&#x2F;functional approach. That time series data is not stateful, it&#x27;s an immutable history of something stateful. Functions&#x2F;transformations work best there usually.')
