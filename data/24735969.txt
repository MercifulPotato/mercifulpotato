I asked an old timer about it he said it was designed to be simple to compile and the compiler was in Assembly. Not sure how truthful this is would love to hear more about how and why its so fast. I would love to someday see FreePascal be just as fast. Its a shame Borland didnt try to make some sort of collaboration between them and FPC. I am sure FPC would welcome some sort of joint effort you help us we help you kinda deal.')
