Your remarks only prove my point. But I am a realist. And I wouldn&#x27;t keep focusing on music. It&#x27;s an easy target. Audio happens to be my thing but I&#x27;m concerned at the cavalier attitude and on a broader level.<p>Let&#x27;s for one minute, expand the remit. It&#x27;s not funkwhale, it&#x27;s carwhale, foodwhale, healthwhale. Keep going. Keep thinking.<p>If all we&#x27;re doing is not creating anew, but instead forging special keys that give you access to anything anyone that made the considerable effort to creative something new - then we treadwater, as a human race. And I see exactly this in so many aspects of human life already.<p>Not creating, not moving forward, not innovating, and only taking (in this case) other people&#x27;s music AND then, here, loudly having the arrogance to declare that all music (or cars, or health, or food) should be free to buy once and you get the right to give it away.<p>Don&#x27;t complain, like I have often read on these pages, how modern music (and cars, and food, and apps, and laptops) all look and sound the same when we have merrily sucked dry the very chances of anything new making its first steps.')
