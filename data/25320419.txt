Item(by='gexla', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607221023, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25320051, text='Right, but my focus is more about making the date tolerable if you don&#x27;t click right away. There&#x27;s nothing worse than being on a long date with someone when you know within the first 5 minutes that you aren&#x27;t interested. And again, you showed enough to get the person to meet you in the first place and that was likely through the exchange of remote messages. Maybe I miss out by not giving the date more time to work, but there&#x27;s an abundance of options. There will always be more dates as long as you are putting in the right effort. That first date is like a quick interview which screens people for a more extensive meeting.')
