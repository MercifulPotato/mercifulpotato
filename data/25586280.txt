What does it matter whether the virus originated from a lab or from a wet market - it isn&#x27;t any more dangerous if it came from a lab, nor does knowing the origin really help dealing with this crisis at all.<p>It is certainly interesting to know where it did originate, and that knowledge could inform a debate on the future of (respectively) wet markets and animal husbandry practices, or BSL facilities, but these don&#x27;t strike me as particularly emotionally charged topics, and in any case the posts I&#x27;m referring to don&#x27;t mention these debates...<p>Anybody care to explain why you would respond so strongly to claims of lab origin?')
