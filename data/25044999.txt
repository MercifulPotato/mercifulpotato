To develop an intuition of what is easy and what is hard with both system design and concurrency design is a matter of years of hard work of trial and error.<p>The actual question is why the complexity is so counterintuitive. I think this is to do with the Dunning-Kruger effect (the less you know the more confident you are).<p>In both cases the solution seems to be to keep beginners away from this and to have the same consistent, peer reviewed, approach across the system, and a process of improving it in a structured way. And of cause prefer higher level abstractions -&gt; computation graph, pipeline, event loop, etc. over just hacking an ad-hoc Frankenstein out of low level primitives (which seem totally &quot;simpler&quot; if you ask a beginner).')
