It seems like you think &quot;anyone talking about the rip off cloud tools&quot; are &quot;exceedingly arrogant SRE types creating piss poor tooling that barely works, whining and complaining that they can’t support generalizing it, sitting in actual data centers, with a burnout mill with constant turnover on all the other teams&quot;. But apart from that, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re a lovely person to discuss with ;) Anyway, I was just saying that senior hackers have more options than you seem to have, also that we tend to find excuses to justify our investments once we are locked in them, it&#x27;s perfectly natural and nothing to be ashamed of.')
