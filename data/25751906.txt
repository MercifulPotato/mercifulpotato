One day, this company decides that they no longer want John Smith to use their toll roads.  John Smith is banned.<p>Maybe John is a terrible person.  Criminal convictions, DUIs, whatever.  Regardless of that, should a private company have unilateral right to ban a customer?  With no recourse?  No appeal, no accountability?  There is no elected official to vote out of office if you don&#x27;t like it.  There&#x27;s no appeals court to hear your claim.  John is just banned.  He now has to drive an extra 30 minutes every day because he can&#x27;t use the high-speed toll roads to get to work.<p>Parler is problematic.  For sure.  And I&#x27;m a big believer in free speech, and that companies, in general, should be able to run their business however they want.<p>However, there are limits.  A sandwich shop can&#x27;t refuse to serve a customer because they are black, for instance.  But cake shops can refuse to serve customers if they are gay, as we recently learned from supreme court cases.<p>I think that much of the issue here revolves around how much of a monopoly a company has.  If my local sandwich shop doesn&#x27;t want to serve me, because I&#x27;m a jerk, that&#x27;s fine. I can just go to another shop down the street.  I&#x27;m not that inconvenienced.<p>But these massive tech companies have enormous ecosystems.  They dominate their industries, and are often the only really viable choice in their markets.<p>I see a constant stream of article about YouTubers that build a massive business with millions of followers, and then one day &#x27;poof&#x27;, Google kicks them off, and they have no recourse.<p>Or the guy on Facebook that spent $47 million dollars in advertising over the years, and one day Facebook kicks him off, banned for life.  No recourse, no appeal, no explanation, even.<p>Apple and Google have absolute say over their app stores, and what is allowed.  Companies can be ruined overnight because some algorithm tipped from the &quot;ok&quot; to &quot;not ok&quot; overnight.<p>This is troubling.')
