The youthful rebellion is a part of the process of finding a worthy boss, or becoming one in the process if all else fails.<p>When an industry expands quickly more people have to rise to the challenge of becoming new good bosses because the demand for good bosses outstrips existing supply. In addition, old good bosses retire rich mid-career, depleting the stock. In this situation you may find yourself thinking there are no good bosses at all, and you&#x27;re the next King Arthur.
