This would throw thousands of evidence about how Erdogan regime worked with terror organisations, including the e-mails that tried to ban social media to stop these evidences be available to public. And also how they declared innocent people as terror organisations with some companies that offered law support. For example, this one <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikileaks.org&#x2F;berats-box&#x2F;emailid&#x2F;35540" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikileaks.org&#x2F;berats-box&#x2F;emailid&#x2F;35540</a> especially verifies a crime - Turkish Airlines Nigeria Weapon transfer as it marks the event as &quot;Government Secret&quot;; The evidence that they talk on this e-mail involves a call where the ministers talk &quot;I don&#x27;t know if they will use it to kill Muslims or Christians&quot;.<p>That specific e-mail does not have DKIM signature (maybe because it was sent his own gmail address? or to an gmail address in general?).<p>I am aware that even if they publish the DKIM secrets, these e-mail will not lose any value since these e-mails was posted before the secrets.<p>But I think using e-mails as evidence should be a thing in general.

If they publish the keys, it would not be possible as you could be the one who forged the e-mail as it were received from somebody else and has been put to your IMAP server manually.')
