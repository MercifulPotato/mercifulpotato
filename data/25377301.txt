(in 2020 they removed Clojure from the options so the data is missing).<p>&gt; I challenge anyone to find a cutting edge CS paper* that is written in their favorite functional language<p>I rarely see papers written in any particular programming language to be honest, they tend to be pseudo-code and math like. And when you write a paper, you don&#x27;t really need to be more productive or more reliable, since you write so little code. Plus any paper focused of low level or raw performance will obviously need something with semantics closer to the hardware.<p>&gt; * - excluding, of course, papers about programming languages themselves<p>What about papers studying functional algorithms, type theory, automatic differentiation, parallel computing, and all that? Do you exclude those as well? Cause they&#x27;re often written in a functional language.')
