But those technologies (a) had a fraction of the upside, (b) don&#x27;t offer partial wins that pay back the R&amp;D (like self driving trucks), and (c) never attracted the same level of investment or talent.<p>Self driving vehicles will save $250+B&#x2F;year in labor costs in the US alone - this is more impactful than the cotton gin and rivals the impact of refrigeration. 3D TVs and cuecat are 3-6 orders of magnitude smaller impact<p>Finally, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that cuecat became QR codes which took off after getting built into cellphone cameras. 3D television didn&#x27;t take off but 4K did i.e. consumer demand existed for richer TV images just not specifically 3D. Projectors remain niche as well even though they promise to take TV from 80&quot; to 130+&quot; - if ultra short throw (UST) projectors come down in price, I could see them going mainstream, especially in tandem with 4K&#x2F;8K.')
