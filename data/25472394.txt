Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608327599, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25470253, text='<i>&gt; I know I can&#x27;t learn everything, but yet it feels like there&#x27;s so much I really _do_ need to know to be a competent developer.</i><p>There really isn&#x27;t anyone on the planet who is truly a &quot;full stack developer&quot; and competent from the front-end all the way down to the OS and bare metal. No one.<p>Most developers stick to a particular layer, and are only familiar with adjacent layers to the extent of being able to have arguments with those developers. A 5x-ish developer is competent in those adjacent layers as well. A 10x developer either has <i>mastery</i> of their chosen layer, adds additional competency layers, adds competencies on the connecting tech between chosen layers (ie. not just front-end + backend, but networking too), has relevant domain competencies, or some combination.<p>So, just pick an entry point, learn as much of it as you want, check out whatever is adjacent, follow your interests, and periodically evaluate whether you need&#x2F;want to change course or dig deeper into technologies, tools, domains, etc. wherever you happen to be. Even if you end up wandering quite far from where you started, the experience and knowledge you gain on the way isn&#x27;t likely to be &quot;wasted&quot;, unless it is mastery of some in-house tech or tool that literally no other organization uses.')
