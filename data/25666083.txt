But if people want to contact me, well, they have to use a mechanism I also use.<p>I know what you&#x27;re asking, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a fix unless you somehow have tremendous influence with them. So you either put up with being coerced by your group, or you don&#x27;t.<p>This is probably easier if you never used the services in the first place. My mom will occasionally whine that she has to open Imessage to talk to me, and that&#x27;s about the extent of it. But of course, I am missing whatever they get up to on FB without me. And that&#x27;s OK with me, but I know it isn&#x27;t with everyone.')
