Pre-pandemic shutdown, I was working on a custom work badge holder that was primarily an eInk display to show my picture and daily work calendar.<p>A little Arduino can easily pull down my week&#x27;s schedule from Outlook, then update the screen for the current day, then put itself in a deep (extremely low power consumption) sleep until it&#x27;s time to update with the next day.  Wake up, update display, go back to sleep - all in a few seconds with minimal battery use.  And any time I re-sync via USB, it updates the schedule and the display, plus charges a small LiPo battery that runs things.<p>Is it super useful?  Eh no, everything it has is on my phone already.  Is it fun tech to work with?  Most definitely.<p>PS<p>Probably most people know this but in case not, once you set an eInk display, it requires no power to maintain the image.  I&#x27;ve got a few small ones I put images on a few years ago that are still just fine.')
