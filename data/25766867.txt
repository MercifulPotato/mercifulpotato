That&#x27;s however is very noticeable.<p>On top of that, just &quot;better&quot; hardware - say, in a decade one can have significantly better screen, more cores and memory, faster storage; makes easier for large software tasks (video transcoding, big rebuilds of whole toolchains and apps, compute-hungry apps like ML...)')
