On my 1990&#x27;s Amiga, I can have a single icon that covered the entire screen if I wanted. (Why? Because I can? hehe) Still more customizable than anything I&#x27;ve seen since (unless you use some sort of third party thing like Talisman on windows, etc.) Sure, there are workstations that might be used by multiple people, in those cases lock the GUI down to something usable by all. But don&#x27;t lock down everything to some committee&#x27;s idea of &quot;productive&quot;. JMHO :)')
