Just because it&#x27;s an ARMv8 chip doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s directly comparable to what&#x27;s in smartphones. (I assume you aren&#x27;t comparing it to Apple made chips for iPhone specifically, since then it wouldn&#x27;t be true that it&#x27;s in &quot;basically every smartphone in the world&quot;.)<p>In particular, this is the first 5nm chip to be widely available, and by most accounts on performance it competes with top of the line hardware at a small fraction of the power use. Most existing ARM chips are designed for the very-low-power market, e.g. in phones, not to be used in a high performance laptop.<p>If there&#x27;s a Dell or Thinkpad laptop with an ARM chip that&#x27;s comparable, by all means, let me know.')
