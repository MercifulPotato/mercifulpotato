One of the vaccines requires that it be kept in a deep freeze, thawed before use, and everyone needs <i>two</i> doses. This is a logistically complicated process that takes much more time to deliver, and will therefore be slower.<p>The Oxford vaccine can be stored in a regular refrigerator, which drastically reduces infrastructure cost <i>and</i> makes it speedier to administer, since it doesn’t need to be carefully warmed to room temperature from subzero.<p>Oh, and it’s cheaper.
