Item(by='piva00', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611728364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25919448, text='&quot;Who?&quot; is a very loaded question for a process that for happenstance ended up designed this way through the decades. It&#x27;s not about a single designer, it&#x27;s about a power structure that has been perpetuated by the elites on this power structure.<p>And I&#x27;m sorry, the moment you use &quot;socialism&quot; to describe the government backing private loans from institutions that are privately held you lost me. This is not even close to a semblance of socialism, this is your government trying to live by the ideology of &quot;free market everything&quot; and patching the holes created by this ideology with a more expensive (and dumber) solution.<p>If higher education was free for every citizen, subsidised by taxes, you could call it a socialist-ish policy. Having to pay &quot;market price&quot; for your education through government-backed loans to private banks is far, very far from socialism.')
