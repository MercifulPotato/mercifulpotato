Item(by='dtwest', descendants=None, kids=[24854740, 24854401], score=None, time=1603333519, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24853069, text='Building such a network is less economically feasible in America compared to Europe or China because of America&#x27;s suburban sprawl. First, it&#x27;ll cost more to build because you&#x27;ll need to clear out a route of suburban housing to get between any two cities. Second, the population density of the US is less concentrated, which makes getting to the station take longer, and improves the relative attractiveness of other transportation options such as cars&#x2F;busses on shorter routes and planes on longer routes.<p>It&#x27;s really disappointing to me as a transit enthusiast that the US doesn&#x27;t have great high speed rail service in the Northeast Corridor, but to do so would involve clearing way for new, less curvy track, and that would be extremely expensive. Even if we did it I&#x27;m not sure it would get the usage rates that occur in Europe. The issue here is sadly more complicated that tax policy.')
