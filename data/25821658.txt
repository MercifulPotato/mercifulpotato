Space is not &quot;clean&quot;.   Something like 100 tons of rock, mostly dust, falls onto earth from space every day.  That isn&#x27;t stuff in orbit, but given the capture effects of our moon there is likely a significant amount that does achieve some sort of stability.  That amount probably outweighs everything we have ever put up there.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astronomy.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;ask-astro&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;space-debris" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astronomy.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;ask-astro&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;space-debri...</a><p>The real problem isn&#x27;t that space is getting full of our junk, but that our junk is in a very narrow band of orbits that we use for very specific missions: Sun synchronous polar orbits used by imaging satellites.  Look at how these orbits all cross paths at the poles.  That&#x27;s the danger zone.  While the military cares deeply about these orbits, civilian infrastructure in space (geosynchronous communications sats, GPS etc) are well beyond any real danger.  Or, at least they are in orbits where danger from natural debris is vastly greater than from space junk.')
