Please consider these as the constructive suggestions that I intend them to be:<p>Think about the story you want to tell. Maybe make an outline or diagram, marking at which points you will introduce which facts.<p>Example: For some reason something called Commonmark is abruptly mentioned, with a link to spec documents that would seem to be of only technical interest. What is this, and how is it connected to anything else?<p>Do enough research so that you know the highest peaks in the landscape. Why describe the foothills and take no notice of the prominent mountaintop right in front of us?<p>Example: the bits about the comics were fascinating. But where is Pandoc? I don’t think I’m guilty, here, of demanding that you write the article I would have written. But Pandoc is <i>the</i> application of Markdown. It turns Markdown into a way to author HTML, TeX, PDF, Office formats, and a lot more. It‘s <i>huge</i>.<p>Anyway, I like the look of your site (but agree with others that you should not hijack browser shortcuts).')
