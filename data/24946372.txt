They require hardware, software, and occasional power.<p>If I decide to unplug an old PC that was acting as say a dedicated game server would I be depriving many people of property? Which would make my own ownership of the server a lie?<p>The only way that would be sustainable would be a contract to pay the host. That is basically existing contract law with a self-aggrandizing name attached to it. It contributes literally nothing new conceptually.')
