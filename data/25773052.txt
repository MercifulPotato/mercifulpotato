(did you watch?) Do you have a high tolerance for grainy texture?<p>Normally, pears must be picked green. If they ripen on the tree, they get a grainy texture that most people hate. They aren&#x27;t like tomatoes; they can ripen just fine after being picked.<p>Ripening a pear is certainly difficult. The skin is fragile. Pears are easy to bruise. It is very common for a pear to rot before ripening. Be really careful. Also, avoid buying pears with any sign of rot already starting at the bottom end, such as white fuzz.<p>To get pears home safely, I place them on top of soft things like bread, and then I place them separately into my car.')
