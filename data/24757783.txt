Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602527631, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24757471, text='&gt; For a while there it seemed like people were getting more and more computer-savvy.<p>&quot;People&quot; in general were never computer savvy. It just wasn&#x27;t a thing. We went from completely clueless in the 80s&#x2F;90s to stumbling and frustrating in early 00s and we&#x27;ve pretty much leveled off at marginally capable for the past 10 years.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s dead now. People don&#x27;t care. They buy a phone because it has a higher resolution screen and then run it in low-res because that&#x27;s the default and they don&#x27;t know the difference. Kids in California fail AP tests because they don&#x27;t know what a file format is and try to submit HEIC images to a web form that only takes JPEG and PNG.<p>Why on earth should people want or need to deal with nonsense like file formats? This kind of nonsense is what professionals get paid to make clear to end-users. That is a huge part of our job. The case you are talking about is a pretty bad failure on the part of the company running the tests, not a problem with the end users.')
