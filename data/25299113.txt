They have such an insatiable demand for labor that it’s much easier to work your way up to more money consistently over time.<p>I guess you just find the level you want to coast at. I haven’t won the start up lottery either. But I have been able to be fully employed as a contractor with a very good hourly rate for quite a long time. Which probably means I’m coasting right now.
