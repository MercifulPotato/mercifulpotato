How do we reasonably get to $0.10 as is the case here?<p>If it were really that expensive for them they could outsource it to a CDN for well under $0.01&#x2F;gb at their scale, which would leave them the ability to get margin. But all of this pricing is in fact completely detached from the underlying physical realities -- they are charging these prices because they think they can get away with it, not because they need to do so to cover costs and have some margin.<p>Bandwidth prices shouldn&#x27;t be going up, indeed they should be going down. 100 gigabit interconnects are a thing now.')
