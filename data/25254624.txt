For consideration:<p>* Both x86 and other ISAs have registers that can&#x27;t be stored to <i>at all</i>, like `k0` for the constant opmask and a whole bunch of read-only MSRs. But they can be read from wholly independently and as discrete registers.<p>* There are lots of cases where registers can be programmed to clobber other registers, particularly in the performance counter and PAT MSRs.<p>Sub-registers are definitely a stretch from the above, since they explicitly share bits in the x86 model. But then again, even the x86 model exposed to assembly programmers is a lie: the underlying microcode dynamically renames a large arena of anonymous registers at runtime, and subregisters like AL and AH have been separated in the microcode (to avoid some cases of partial register stalls) for over a decade.')
