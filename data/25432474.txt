Over 125,000 new items are added each year...&quot;<p>The stakes are lower when money, not privacy, is at risk. I have attempted to argue for years that the MathSciNet catalog of the mathematical literature should be open to all forms of machine learning and mind mapping software experiments. It remains a cash cow for the American Mathematical Society, and they&#x27;re fiercely proud of its human curation by 19th century methods. Meanwhile, mathematicians continue to believe that math remains separated into tribes, with number theorists lobbying to hire their own at departmental meetings. The true connections between ideas defy these ancient categories. I see a generation of potential advances squandered by not letting third-party tools in to study MathSciNet.<p>The right ideas could help here. One isn&#x27;t protecting individual privacy, just a cash cow. The bar is lower.')
