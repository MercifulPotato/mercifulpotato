For instance, Go&#x27;s error handling is entirely reliant on discipline! All of the meta-programming and runtime reflection nonsense requires discipline to not abuse and misuse. The worst codebases I have seen in Rust are significantly better than the worst codebases I have seen in languages like Java or Python, and maybe its because Rust programmers are more disciplined on average, or maybe its because the compiler requiring clean code forces less disciplined developers to produce better code.<p>Perhaps there are two camps here: (1) Reduce discipline by making developers no longer have to consider certain situations (garbage collection fits here) and (2) Reduce discipline by shifting that to the compiler (types fit in here)')
