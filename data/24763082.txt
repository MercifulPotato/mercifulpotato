In the case of SNS, mock a message with the correct SNS signature, or go one layer deeper, stub out SNS validation logic and just unit test the function assuming the response is valid or invalid? In the case of Postgres, you could use an ORM that supports SQLite for dependency-free development but at a compatibility cost... worst case you might need to have your local machine talk to AWS and host it’s own LetsEncrypt certificate and open NAT port... but one can hope it doesn’t come to that...? Even so... that’s not exactly a knock against serverless itself, is it?')
