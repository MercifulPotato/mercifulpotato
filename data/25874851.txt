It can easily add a couple of hours of friction.<p>There are some car clubs in the city I live in. You sign up in advance, give them your details&#x2F;card, and use an app to book the car. They&#x27;re scattered all over the city, and you book it by the hour and pay for mileage. You get a fuel card, and are asked not to leave it back empty. If you pick one up empty, fill it up, and tell the app and they&#x27;ll nag the previous person about it (but I only had to do this once in the 2 years I used it). It&#x27;s great!<p>When I signed up at first it was great, there were 5 cars within 1&#x2F;2 a mile of me. 2 years later, there were still 5 cars within 1&#x2F;2 a mile of me, but the  number of people using the service had increased so there was no availability on a weekend.<p>On my current street there&#x27;s ~100 cars parked on it, and at least 10 of them haven&#x27;t moved in the last week (my own included). If we replaced (even) half of those cars with for-hire cars, it would be a perfectly usable system for me.<p>&gt; 1. I already paid for my car, so I use it kind of for free, except gas.<p>If you&#x27;re not using your car for work, then this doesn&#x27;t apply really. Even assuming you own it outright, maintenance&#x2F;checks&#x2F;cleaning&#x2F;washing my current car are in the region of 30-40 bucks a month.')
