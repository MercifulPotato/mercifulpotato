That&#x27;s a bridge too far for me. You would somehow need to threaten to get their business partners&#x2F;people they have tea&#x2F;hookah with in the neighborhood to think they&#x27;re a bad person to have any leverage (or even more evil but effective when done in public, a bad Muslim&#x2F;Hindu&#x2F;X). You need to understand that these families see you as a cash cow or an object to barter to increase access to resources, preserve resources within the family, or increase social status and plan a response accordingly.<p>Case in point but with an (white) American family. I had a friend whose dad was welshing out on child support for his sisters. My (adult) friend called up a bunch of his dad&#x27;s clients (he was a contractor) and calmly left messages explaining the situation. His dad paid up but also slapped him with a restraining order and they didn&#x27;t talk for a decade. I mean being able to threaten going nuclear like that, not necessarily tapping phones, should be par for the course.')
