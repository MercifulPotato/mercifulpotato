If I want to execute a currency arbitrage strategy, I want to know what is backing the currencies. In most fiat currencies, you can do this by 1) Assessing the current economic conditions &amp; the country&#x27;s history of monetary policy. 1) evaluating the currency supply against the GDP: This is <i>really</i> what a fiat currency is actually backed by. (Or at least one of the fundamental components)<p>You can&#x27;t do this with Tether. A country&#x27;s own economic reports and extensive external analysis by others can validate the financial state of a country &amp; its fiat currency. With Tether, you have to take their word for it.<p>And loans? Doesn&#x27;t that contradict their entire premise-- Mint 1 Tether and sell it for $1 so it&#x27;s always fully backed. Loans shouldn&#x27;t be necessary. Loans could be called in the second Tether shows weakness, which would further destabilize it.<p>And lets face it: If it&#x27;s not actually fully backed $1 for $USDT then there&#x27;s zero guarantee that it can&#x27;t start floating against other coins or currencies. It&#x27;s only worth $1 if you can find someone willing to give you $1 for $1 USDT. People claim if it loses value then Tether will simply buy up enough to drive the price back to the $1 peg. Buy it with what though? Their assets, the money backing it! which means it&#x27;s then backed by even less! The only way a strategy of Tether buying the price back up to the $ peg can work at all is if Tether has <i>more</i> assets backing it that strictly necessary.<p>As for other assets backing it, they&#x27;ll go up &amp; down in value too. Even if it&#x27;s currently fully backed, without transparency those other assets backing it can go down in value and then all of a sudden it&#x27;s <i>not</i> fully backed.<p>All of these concerns might be moot. Tether might be completely sound, rock solid &amp; stable. But anyone who believes that is taking it on faith based on the word of people who are highly biased &amp; highly interested in having $USDT owners believe it, true or not, and it is unfathomable to me at this point in crypto, where shitcoins &amp; pump &amp; dumps and ponzi schemes and all kinds of scams persist, that anyone would take something like this on faith.')
