Did you write a cover letter for those 250+ positions, and if so, I wonder who read it?<p>When I applied for IC roles in the past I put a fair amount of thought into writing a good cover letter. Now, as a hiring manager I am normally just passed resumes by internal or external recruiters.<p>The article has me thinking that it might be worth requesting to read the letter, but I believe it&#x27;s optional, so I worry it might narrow the funnel too much.  Also I am conscious that much, if not the majority of the talent pool in my region have English as a second language, so I&#x27;m keen not to judge formal writing skills excessively, which could exclude otherwise good informal communicators and coders.')
