Or at least it depends on what you mean by going above and beyond. I want to be paid for a job, which I will do. I will do whatever needs to be done, including things outside my “official” duties, but when that clock hits 40 hours, it’s time to stop working. Maybe that’s going above and beyond or maybe not.')
