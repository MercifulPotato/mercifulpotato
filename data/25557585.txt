This isn&#x27;t Koj&#x27;s &quot;Show HN&quot; (expect that soon!), but we&#x27;re doing some interesting stuff, both tech- and &quot;home and living&quot;-wise. Happy to hear any additional feedback for koj.co as well!<p>&gt; I have a suspicion they might start introducing restrictions<p>I definitely think so, unlimited minutes for all public repos can only be sustainable with many many paid orgs buying expensive minutes. If restrictions kick in, I think I&#x27;ll keep the &quot;GitHub issues to status page&quot; part of Upptime and have some integrations with self-hosted monitors or third-party services that then open those GitHub issues automatically.<p>&gt; I see you’re also using TypeScript, so I’m definitely taking a long look at your github-actions-starter (thanks for sharing).<p>Enjoy! We&#x27;re using Svelte and TypeScript everywhere at Koj, we also have some other starters here if you&#x27;re interested: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;koj-co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;koj-co</a>.')
