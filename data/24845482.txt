For reasons I still can&#x27;t decipher, the browser tends to slow any computer I run it on terribly no matter what I do or which version I run. I&#x27;ve noticed this across multiple machines. Yes, I often leave dozens of tabs open but Chrome (combined with Great Suspender) never gives me trouble on this.<p>If anyone can suggest any sort of fix, i&#x27;d love to leave the snooping, prying Google browser behind finally.')
