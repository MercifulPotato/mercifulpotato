For me it involves pasting the IMDB ID into a fairly popular public torrent site (eg. tt0095560) and feed the magnet link to Transmission running on my storage server. When it&#x27;s done, it gets picked up by LibreELEC and is ready to watch. Could my mother use this? No. But you don&#x27;t need a computer science degree to do this either.<p>When Netflix launched in Denmark, I immedately jumped on it. It used to have endless amounts of great content, and was way more convenient than piracy. Now it&#x27;s just filled with trash, and I can never find what I want to watch. Piracy has again become more convenient.')
