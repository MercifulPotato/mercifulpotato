Supposedly I am fine to download when streaming but I am not allowed to retain that downloaded file. Once the stream is in my cache, I can rewind and play it a thousand times without downloading it again, but if I close my browser or power off the PC, suddenly I seem to be legally required to download it again - all of this on a PC that I have paid for, and on a network connection that I also pay for data on.<p>This all seems like a lot of control for a third party to demand over the internal workings of a PC and network connection that I pay the bills for.<p>Legally, would I be able to run a virtual machine with a browser inside, take a snapshot of the state just after caching a stream, and save that to return to later? Why or why not?')
