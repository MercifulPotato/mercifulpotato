But in that case what I actually meant is that majority of <i>time</i> in calls to zipfile is spent in pure C, not in the Python interpreter loop, and if it&#x27;s based on zlib then that agrees with what I meant.<p>(There is an exception I didn&#x27;t mention: if the zip is encrypted then the zipfile module falls back to pure Python code. The difference is very noticeable!)')
