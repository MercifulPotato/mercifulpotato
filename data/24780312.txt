I am constantly dumbfounded when I see articles about Zoom breaking records, and even more shocked when I see their market valuation.<p>A market cap of $129 billion (with a B) with annual revenues of 600 million? I feel like this is a crazy gone bad joke, how in the world do they expect to justify that kind of valuation?<p>Can someone please explain what is their current business plan, and what is their future one? They don&#x27;t have ad space to generate revenue, they don&#x27;t have a viable subscription based model, they are not a real B2B product, and they are not going to keep adding users forever. \nThis was once in a lifetime situation where a majority of people were using it, and they still weren&#x27;t able to capitalize on them in a way of monetizing them.<p>I feel like they hit their peak without reaping the milestones and achievements along the way (except getting out like a bandit from the stock market).<p>Am I taking crazy pills or?')
