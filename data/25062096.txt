This is not hard to do, though many irresponsible people neglect to do so.  And none of this goes out the window even in fantasy &quot;shit hits the fan&quot; scenarios; the rules for how to handle (or, to not handle) guns remain the same.  The rules keep you safe when you follow them dogmatically.  As soon as you start making &#x27;common sense&#x27; exceptions to the rules, that is when you put yourself in danger.  A lot of people have gotten hurt after thinking <i>&quot;I know I shouldn&#x27;t point the gun at myself, but I KNOW I just unloaded it so logically there is no danger...&quot;</i><p>(And anecdotally, I&#x27;ve personally witnessed no correlation whatsoever between military service and taking gun safety seriously. \nYMMV.)')
