If they are non-competitive, they are out. But if they lose their non-sense and compete, they can be around. Also, the people working at the Mandis (Mandi employees), they are also free to start their own company that compete with the Mandis.<p>&gt; what prevents a monopolized market from then strong-arming farmers into bad deals?\nThis law, which prevents monolopy. The current monopoly is the Mandi. How will be farmers be strong-armed to a bad deal if they have options to choose?<p>&gt; This is factually incorrect.<p>My mistake, &quot;But can ONLY sell the produce to the local Mandi at some states&quot;. Punjab is an example of were Mandis have complete power. While in other states like TN, Bihar, MP, UP and more have already changed the rule.<p>&gt; Only about 30% of produce is sold in mandis.<p>that is a bit misleading as Mandis dont have prominence is all states. But in Punjab where they are there, no one is allowed.')
