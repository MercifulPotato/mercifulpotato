People like you or me on HN can stop buying good from China, but what about the majority of poor and lower class people who are extremely price sensitive? China has the ability to keep undercutting everyone else, and people have no choice but to go China or go broke. The west has pigeonholed itself into a situation where it&#x27;s simply unprofitable to do business without outsourcing. So it&#x27;s not that simple to tell people to stop buying from China, unless you pair it with giving your people the economic freedom and opportunity to say no to China and cheap goods. GIVE POOR PEOPLE MONEY - is what im saying.')
