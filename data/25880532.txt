However, Tesla claims that he grabbed a bunch of other things like scripts and was attempting to delete them after he granted Tesla security engineers access to his Dropbox. I think we&#x27;ll need to wait until more information comes out because either the engineer is lying or Tesla is lying, but it should be relatively easy to tell if they have Dropbox giving them information.<p>If the engineer did copy scripts to his Dropbox, that is a serious security violation. Nearly everywhere I have worked, you always get security training that says under no circumstances copy company stuff to a third-party system. Even if you don&#x27;t have malicious intent, security folks have no way of tracking what you do with the stuff after that.')
