Item(by='XorNot', descendants=None, kids=[25197731], score=None, time=1606206288, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25196282, text='This is a Hollywood thing where writers in Hollywood don&#x27;t know how the normal world works: storing the keys under the sunvisor is a thing that is done with studio vehicles in studio lots because the car changes hands a lot and so keeping the keys in it just makes sense.<p>It might&#x27;ve been common in a few American cities Hollywood-adjacent post-WW2 as well, but the accepted explanation is essentially that it&#x27;s Hollywood being Hollywood - probably that it&#x27;s a rite of passage as a junior team member to be unable to find the keys and then have someone show you they&#x27;re in the &quot;obvious&quot; place.<p>Though I suspect at this point it&#x27;s a writing shortcut more then anything else: we all know it&#x27;s a movie, in movie&#x27;s this happens, and in the plot in that moment you don&#x27;t want to deal with &quot;can these characters start this car&quot;.')
