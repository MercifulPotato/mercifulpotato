Regrettably we have the nationally televised words of the president on the matter:<p><i>This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. We did win this election. So our goal now is to ensure the integrity for the good of this nation. This is a very big moment. This is a major fraud in our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. So we’ll be going to the US Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don’t want them to find any ballots at four o’clock in the morning and add them to the list. Okay? It’s a very sad moment. To me this is a very sad moment and we will win this. And as far as I’m concerned, we already have won it.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rev.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;transcripts&#x2F;donald-trump-2020-election-night-speech-transcript" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rev.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;transcripts&#x2F;donald-trump-2020-elect...</a>')
