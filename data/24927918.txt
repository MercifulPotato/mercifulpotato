BNWR was written by Huxley in 1958, 26 years after BNW was published (1932) and 9 years after 1984 (1949).<p>It has been a few years for me, but there were several prescient chapters when I last ready it during the rise of populism around the globe (2015), namely sections IV, V, VI, and VII:<p><pre><code>  Foreword\n  I Over-Population\n  II Quantity, Quality, Morality\n  III Over-Organization\n  IV Propaganda in a Democratic Society\n  V Propaganda Under a Dictatorship\n  VI The Arts of Selling\n  VII Brainwashing\n  VIII Chemical Persuasion\n  IX Subconscious Persuasion\n  X Hypnopaedia\n  XI Education for Freedom\n  XII What Can Be Done?\n</code></pre>\nWould recommend the read to anyone that found 1984, BNW, F451, etc. interesting.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huxley.net&#x2F;bnw-revisited&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huxley.net&#x2F;bnw-revisited&#x2F;</a> (full text)<p>Edit: formatting')
