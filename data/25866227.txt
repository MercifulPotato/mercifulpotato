Call it something else, and just call it compatible with Elasticsearch v(FORKED_VERSION). Their continued trying to associate it to ES is causing most of the issues, and after this situation I don&#x27;t think the name is a valuable as it used to be. AWS have the resources to do a nice clean re-branding as well.<p>Have you seen the names and logos for AWS services. They can&#x27;t brand crap. Amazon can barely Brand anything? They got where they got via customer service not via branding. And now they&#x27;re so big it doesn&#x27;t matter what they do, it&#x27;s got Amazon on it and we&#x27;re all buying off of them anyways.')
