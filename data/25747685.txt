Getting a driver&#x27;s license is more about certifying your ability to drive than your identity.<p>- Signature requirements are tricky because they are very subjective.  You&#x27;re counting on the unbiased assessment of thousands of volunteers to determine if signatures match.

So the key question is, does it actually reduce voter fraud by more than the false negative rate?<p>Everywhere I&#x27;ve lived, the voter rolls and the voting process are designed in such a way that adding a free voter ID to the process would change very little.  It&#x27;s already very difficult to orchestrate fraud without detection.<p>The ACLU put out a fact sheet with some more details on voter ID: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclu.org&#x2F;other&#x2F;oppose-voter-id-legislation-fact-sheet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclu.org&#x2F;other&#x2F;oppose-voter-id-legislation-fact-...</a>')
