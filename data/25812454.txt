While that is somewhat true — at least by the metric of “secure messengers your granny can use”, there are some promising alternatives who are especially focused on decentralizing E2EE communications.<p>So the author readily admits that these alternatives aren&#x27;t actually good enough for the average user.<p>Newsflash: This IS for the average user!
