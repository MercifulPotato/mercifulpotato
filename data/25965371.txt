Most astronomers believe the probability that Oumuamua was an alien visitor is very small. Loeb&#x27;s argument is that the probability may be a bit larger. But we&#x27;ll (very likely) never actually know which it was, so the disagreement is about the unknown likelihood of a <i>single observed event</i>. It just seems obvious that we&#x27;ll have to settle for &quot;probably a funnily-shaped rock, but there&#x27;s a small chance it was something more interesting&quot; and live with that.')
