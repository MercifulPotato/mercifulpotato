It doesn&#x27;t completely cancel out the costs, but having a strategy to get back into focus helps immensely.<p>The worst mistake I see people make is assuming that focus is something that only strikes serendipitously, and is ruined on the first signs of interruption. Once you accept that focus can, in fact, be cultivated and interruptions can be overcome with deliberate effort to re-focus, it becomes much easier to start training yourself to get back into the flow.<p>The other mistake I see people make is letting minor interruptions spiral into an impromptu 30-minute break of checking HN, browsing Twitter, or other distractions until they feel like getting back to work. Don&#x27;t like your own habits amplify existing distractions.')
