These are the registers that are authorized for disclosure in the open-source driver by the AMD employed open-source driver developers.<p>So, it includes many times more register definitions than are ever used (consider there are 8x more register definition lines than actual code lines that could use them) and it includes many sets of 16 or 64 definitions that a software developer would have made one parameterized definition (all the same except for _00, _01, _02, _03, etc). But this is exactly what the hardware guys generated for public release, and it is to be used as-is.<p>IMHO it&#x27;s kinda annoying and sad. The rest of the kernel is held to a higher standard, that&#x27;s why all the other non-trivial multi-arch multi-family multi-generation code in the linux kernel is much more concise &#x2F; less sloppy. It takes a lot of effort to make it that way, and commercial companies pretty much never bother, except when required by the Linux maintainers.<p>But, modern graphics drivers are way too complex and way too much work, and most people do want some proper modern GPU support in the kernel, so compromises have to be made. It&#x27;s not too bad, just a bunch of inert header lines, git and the compiler handle them just fine I guess.')
