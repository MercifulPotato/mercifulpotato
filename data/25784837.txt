Item(by='JakeStone', descendants=None, kids=[25784935], score=None, time=1610668391, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783152, text='Hexagons.<p>There&#x27;s a library available at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uber&#x2F;h3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uber&#x2F;h3</a> that lets you partition the earth into hexagons (minus the required 12 pentagons) at various resolutions.  It&#x27;s spiffy.  I had the hardest (read impossible) time when I first took a look at it getting it to compile into a mobile game.  It worked fine in desktop, but not on mobile.<p>So I punted and converted the whole thing into C#.  It&#x27;s a hot mess currently, but it works.<p>However, the folks who created H3 added functionality and some optimizations that I want, so I&#x27;m rebuilding it, partly with dealing with some of the issues that have come up with my game during development.  It&#x27;s coming along smoothly, though the unit tests are what&#x27;s slowing me down at this moment.<p>Once that&#x27;s done, I&#x27;m going back to my game. Covering the world in brightly colored hexagons as reality starts to crumble around you.<p>So, still...  Hexagons.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m working on.')
