Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25418663], score=None, time=1607893924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25409980, text='&gt; 40 people coming from Mexico is highly unlikely to lead to 230,000 US cases&#x2F;day.<p>Contagions have exponential growth. 40 people coming from Mexico after you&#x27;ve lifted the lockdowns means you need to continue them to keep the 40 from turning into a thousand and then hundreds of thousands. Which means lockdowns of the severity Australia used are useless here because you can never get below the floor necessary to lift them again.<p>&gt; The contention isn&#x27;t that overall funding was cut, it&#x27;s that certain groups within the CDC saw significant cuts, and those cuts reduced readiness.<p>The problem with this kind of claim is that it&#x27;s <i>always</i> the case. Priorities shift, staff gets reassigned etc. Which means that of the 1000 different units, 700 of which grew and 300 of which shrank, you&#x27;ll be able to find in the list that shrank something that sounds like it might have helped against a given problem. It&#x27;s just cherry picking.<p>&gt; Regardless of whether Trump&#x27;s missteps were politicized, they were still missteps. Doubling down on something after someone calls you out doesn&#x27;t make them responsible for your actions.<p>The point is that they weren&#x27;t missteps. Calling out someone for not actually doing something wrong in order to stir up controversy and ratings and politicize a public health issue is contemptible. Defending yourself against a baseless personal attack is not.<p>The problem, which CNN should have been able to predict, is that if you politicize an issue, people take sides, even if there was never any reasoned disagreement to be had. But maybe they <i>did</i> predict it and did it anyway, so that when less savvy political opponents predictably started making less supportable claims, it would give the instigators something to shoot down and mount on their wall. Even if people died.')
