Someone with at least a modicum of influence has to care about the product and drive resources at it persistently so it doesn&#x27;t rot. Google is unlikely to want to go further and build or acquire a stock broker business, so they&#x27;re going to struggle to extract much money out of the category over time.<p>This is Google doing the bare minimum as an alternative to just shutting down another product. I&#x27;m surprised it has survived this long.')
