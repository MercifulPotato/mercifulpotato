I&#x27;m not sure how many videos of alleged ballot fraud are floating around and the link you posted doesn&#x27;t have a link to the video so I can only assume we are talking about the same thing.<p>&gt;&gt; No one told observers they had to leave, and both an independent monitor and an investigator oversaw the vote count, according to state and county officials.<p>The observers dispute this, and reaffirm their claim that they were asked to leave.<p>&gt;&gt; Confusion arose when election workers thought they were done for the night, but then were instructed to continue scanning ballots.<p>Yes, everyone was aware that vote counting was supposed to stop at 11pm but after they got rid of everyone else, this one team continued to count ballots that had been prepped and hidden.<p>&gt; But investigators who reviewed the entire surveillance tape confirmed it showed “normal ballot processing,” according to Gabriel Sterling, a top official in the secretary of state’s office.<p>It&#x27;s normal to do this? Perhaps the problem here is that the actual activities are not in dispute, but one party considers them normal and one party is unhappy that fraud is considered normal.<p>&gt;&gt; After a short period when observers weren’t present, an independent state election board monitor arrived to oversee the scanning at 11:52 p.m., Barron said. A state investigator arrived at 12:15 a.m. Both individuals remained at the facility until the count concluded for the night, he said. The Georgia secretary of state’s office said it was aware of the late-night counting, and confirmed that both its investigator and an independent monitor observed scanning “until it was halted for the night.” The office said it had launched an investigation into why partisan poll observers left before scanning ended.<p>Sounds like we really need to get that investigative report.')
