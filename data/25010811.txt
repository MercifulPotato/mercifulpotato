[1]<p>Apple, Amazon, Homeland Security, and others have all said there was no evidence at all, and called for a retraction.<p>As it stands... Bloomberg were talking about something they didn&#x27;t understand. There were and are some theoretical problems in hardware security. But the story as they broke it is completely false.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;risky.biz&#x2F;RB517_feature&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;risky.biz&#x2F;RB517_feature&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;yossi-appleboum-disagrees-bloomberg-is-positioning-his-research-against-supermicro&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;yossi-appleboum-disagrees-bloom...</a>')
