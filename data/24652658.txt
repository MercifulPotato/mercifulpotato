Item(by='mturmon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601568887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24651457, text='I have transported a bunch of lumber with two Civic sedans, mid-1990s and mid-2010s.  Small cars with seats that fold down, kind of like the Prius in that respect.<p>If possible, I get the store to cut the stock down beforehand.  Works for 4x8 sheets of ply, for example.  To fit in my car, it kind of needs to be less than 36&quot; wide and not much more than 8&#x27; long, but specifics vary.<p>If I need basically a full sheet (4&#x27;x8&#x27; or 5&#x27;x5&#x27;), I put a blanket on my car roof, put the wood up top, and use 2 moderate-duty ratcheting straps (less than $20) to hold it down.  No problem.<p>If it&#x27;s long stuff (for my car, ~10&#x27;) then I either put it up top, or let it hang out the back with a red flag on it.  You can optionally get an accessory for your car to hold the trunk lid partway open so it does not sway up and down throughout the trip home.  Keep the driver&#x27;s window down a bit so you don&#x27;t pull exhaust into the car.<p>Another solution that I&#x27;ve used to avoid delays getting pieces cut down is to take a saw with me.  A basic $25 Japanese-style pull saw will do a great job on mouldings (and is just a good tool in general), and a hacksaw works for thinner metal.  Some people take a battery-powered circular saw -- again, not a bad tool to have anyway, especially if you&#x27;re bought in to a given battery-powered system (e.g., Bosch, Makita).<p>I live in a city, and this means I often have to take surface streets on the way home.  I favor closer lumberyards for that reason.')
