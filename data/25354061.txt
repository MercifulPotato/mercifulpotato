Upgrades that get in dirty states, often as a result of bogus post-install hooks. Having to fork charts to customize the deployment minorly for our mundane requirements. Reading doubly or triply templated files and dealing with bullshit indentation mismatches. I hated things that expected me to install with Helm.')
