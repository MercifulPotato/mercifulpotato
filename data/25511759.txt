It always falls apart for me with the networking.<p>Let&#x27;s say I have a cluster of 8 physical nodes and a management node available in my data center and I want to set up k8s for use by my internal users. I&#x27;m a solo admin with responsibilty for ~250 physical servers so any ongoing management necessary will be very much a task among many.<p>Is this blog post a good guide? Is there a better one?')
