I don&#x27;t worship anything.<p>Where do I draw the &quot;real meaning in life&quot;? I don&#x27;t think there is &quot;a meaning in life&quot;, strictly speaking. I came to be because of laws of nature and biology, and keep living for a while, and then cease to exist.<p>I do think everyone can decide for themselves their personal &quot;meaning of life&quot;. I would like humans to colonize other planets, and eventually other star systems. I think I have contributed to that goal by writing software that is used by a lot of people for information processing. I also like to be happy and enjoy life. Having a family, friends, and doing things I like with them helps achieve those goals.<p>Making an espresso is almost like a ritual, but I am not worshipping the bean, or electricty, water or the heat and pressure that makes it all work. All the steps are required to get coffee at the end, which I enjoy drinking. I am not worshipping the gods of wine and food when I drink and eat. I am not sending prayers to other car drivers when I am driving, or walking across the street. I am not praying for imaginary beings to keep my loved ones safe, or ask for divine help when they are sick. I admire people who have worked hard to achieve great things, but I do not worship them.<p>I do not know everything, and some things which I think I know are probably wrong. And yet there is still no need for religion.')
