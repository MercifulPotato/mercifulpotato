GME is a black swan aberration borne out of current market conditions BECAUSE of hedge funds and institutional players. Retail investors involved in short squeezes like GME are not going to cause a crash.<p>In fact, I would argue the GME episode has made life suck a lot less for plenty of people - some made money but a lot of people have just had  fun laughing, making memes, and putting some money in because, well, what else are you gonna do? The stock market is not F&#x27;d up because of retail investors. What should we do - just sit on our hands and hope the free Ford stock Robin Hood gave us goes up? Why not have fun and dream a little and learn about the market in the process?')
