So that whatever subset of people can&#x27;t get vaccine X, well they can get vaccine Y and Z. And hopefully, this means everyone has at least one vaccine they can take.<p>It also highlights the need for everyone to get vaccinated as quickly as possible. Don&#x27;t procrastinate when the opportunity arises, because there are people around you who can&#x27;t be vaccinated or can&#x27;t be vaccinated with vaccines available to them. You being vaccinated cuts off one more path the virus can take to them.')
