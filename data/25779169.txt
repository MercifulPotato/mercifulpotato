If I find something interesting then I turn it into a weekend project, and if I really love the name and see a lot of potential in it, then I go a step further. My favourite domain that I discovered this past year is Ask.Moe, which I found using my domain name finder tool (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.moe&#x2F;domain" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.moe&#x2F;domain</a>). This approach is perhaps not ideal if your goal is to make money, but if you&#x27;re looking for a fun weekend project that could turn into a startup then I think it&#x27;s worth trying out.')
