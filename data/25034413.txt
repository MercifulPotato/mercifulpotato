Privacy within a voting booth allows such, and any tools which take such privacy away (most commonly using a smartphone or camera) are therefore not allowed in a voting booth.<p>&gt; For example, IANAL but the PA law clearly states that mail-in ballots have to be received by election day.<p>If it clearly states X you might as well link to it.<p>From what I understood they can allowed if the votes were cast in time (which a stamp proves), even if received a few days later (though with a deadline).')
