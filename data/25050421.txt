This partner program was started in the last few years, so I don&#x27;t think they were doing this for Android back when Android development was new.<p>Also, the company I work for spent a lot of time building Android apps for Fortune 500 companies, so I feel like I would have heard about it. Our clients would have benefitted from having Googlers build Android apps and train people!')
