I just went through an apartment search in San Francisco where one of my requirements was electric car charging. Yes of course SF is tech-forward, but most buildings are fifty years or older which makes installation of a charger non-trivial. I just signed a lease for an apartment that doesn’t have a car charger, but the property manager added an amendment which stipulated that one will be installed in a few months, otherwise I’m free to break from the lease. I’d say about half of the property managers I talked to across about 15 tours were amenable to it.')
