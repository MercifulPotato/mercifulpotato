So why is it abandoning desktop web apps, the most powerful alternative to proprietary App Stores?<p>Most powerful? Define powerful here. If we&#x27;re talking about convenience, I guess, but even then, a standard webpage is fine. In terms of amount of things it can do, no way. Not having access to a file system or standard sockets immediately disqualifies it from being the second most powerful option in my mind.<p>Maybe the word &quot;powerful&quot; is being used differently here, but I don&#x27;t know what definition they could be using.')
