I know I&#x27;m not hydrating enough, getting enough sun early, or exercising, so I&#x27;m going to give those a go!  I&#x27;ve only ever half-assed the intermittent fasting thing, so maybe I&#x27;ll give that a real try too.<p>I think my gut bacteria is pretty good. I&#x27;m a nut for fermented stuff, make my own yoghurt, kimchi, saurkraut, kombucha - and eat it all the time. It has been really fantastic for digestion, which had been a problem (pain, irregularity) and now is great. Since starting yoghurt every single day I have a freakin&#x27; Iron Stomach.  I have zero autoimmunity issues fortunately (knock on wood).')
