Reaction to this is almost inevitable.<p>I would like to present a trivial recent example: as you know, USA retired from the climate Paris agreement and, in general, is not doing so much like other nations despite being the worst in per capita terms.<p>Well, it seems that the new president want to go back to the Paris agreements and is framing it like &quot;going back to led the world&quot; in climate change. Going back to led the world? really?<p>I know, I know, this a sentence for internal consumption but still, how do you think it sounds in other countries?<p>I didn&#x27;t touch the little fact of invasions of third countries and military bases all around the world.<p>So, maybe there is something to this fad? Maybe take it like feedback to correct a few things?')
