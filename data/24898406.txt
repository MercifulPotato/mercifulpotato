JS also uses curly braces to mark code blocks, which is similar to Lisp parentheses but at the cost of more complex parsing for the compiler and the mental distinguishing between functions&#x27; argument lists and code blocks on the coder (they are just lists).<p>JS statements use semi-colons, which makes editing them feel like editing lines of codes while editing Lisp statements is editing nodes of a tree, which is a very different experience.')
