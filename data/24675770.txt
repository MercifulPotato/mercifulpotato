Putin is not authoritarian in the degree that China is.<p>It has lots of disadvantages:<p>- You can loose everything you have very fast, including your live and the live of your children, and of course your money or your home. There are kidnappings in China.<p>-Your food is not safe. The air you breath is not safe and if you try to do something, let alone measure it, you will get into problems. They can kill you and make you disappear.<p>- Nothing is true. Have they beaten COVID? You believe so because they tell you so. But the party controls media so you can believe as well in Santa.<p>-The State in China is one of the least efficient things you can think of, and extremely corrupt. The only thing they are good at is propaganda.<p>-Lots of politics in China. Have you seen all the people at the CCP? Lots of factions there fighting for power. Those guys are killing each other or pointing fingers at other factions and sending them to jail with each new scandal.<p>IMO, &quot;check and balances&quot; is not stupid. It is one of the best inventions the West have created.<p>Coming back has made me realize how valuable is what we have in the West. And how spoiled people are taking for granted what took thousands of years to develop.')
