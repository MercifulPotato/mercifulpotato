Item(by='zygotic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608481141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25486073, text='1) It&#x27;s too expensive in the UK to smoke 100% cannabis joints - because it&#x27;s illegal. 2) Alternative cannabis delivery systems such as edibles and vaping are unavailable in the UK - because it&#x27;s illegal. 3) In my experience people smoke significantly fewer cannabis cigarettes each day than tobacco alone, but availability, price, stigma etc. means they reach for the government approved, medically proved to be more harmful packet of 20 - because it&#x27;s illegal. I could go on but I suspect the horse is already dead on this post.')
