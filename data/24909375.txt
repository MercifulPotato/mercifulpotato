There&#x27;s also the case where the mail client is applying it&#x27;s own complex rules and sending responses automatically.  If the message is actually a new one, there&#x27;s not an easy way to detect the loop.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why Gmail for a long time (still?) didn&#x27;t allow you to forward your mail to another Gmail address.  I would argue that for Exchange, where it&#x27;s generally much easier to track down individuals, erroring on the side of allowing administrators to do what they want to block this (whether that be company policy, exchange policy, or whatever) is the correct design choice.')
