Item(by='happytoexplain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611096402, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25839613, text='&quot;Virtue signaling&quot; is usually meant as an insult, implying that they either don&#x27;t really believe what they are saying or wouldn&#x27;t be saying it if they thought it wouldn&#x27;t be a net benefit to business. I don&#x27;t get any hint of either of those. Are you sure you&#x27;re not just using the phrase for its negative connotation, because you don&#x27;t like what they&#x27;re saying?')
