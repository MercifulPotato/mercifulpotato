All animals and organisms must exert some sort of adaptability to their environment or they are DOA. Our brains are certainly fantastic developments, but we also see this sort of emergent intelligence in AI, so it doesn&#x27;t necessarily depend on amino acids. There, we see electronic neural nets achieving much of the same behavior.<p>To me, intelligence is a system. It can be a network of neurons embodied in an individual, a colony of ants, or a group of programmers working on a startup. The system itself has inputs and outputs and needs to be viewed at that level. We can view ant colonies as a coherent system. We can view individual organisms as a coherent system.<p>The main difference between ants and humans is that each node in a human social system is more powerful and the bandwidth of information shared between each node is much richer.<p>A lot of people point out that man can send a rocket to the moon, but really, only a civilization can do that. A tribe couldn&#x27;t do it in a million years. They would lack the industry and the science and the labor and resources and technology to pull it off. Those systems can be viewed as having a sort of emergent, even if ephemeral, intelligence that requires massive amounts of cooperation and coordination to pull off.')
