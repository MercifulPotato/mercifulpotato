Item(by='dig1', descendants=None, kids=[24725502, 24724391, 24723661], score=None, time=1602185220, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24716218, text='ed is still my daily driver when I need to edit stuff quickly, and here are a couple of reasons I&#x27;m keeping it in my toolbox:<p>* Couple of KBs, you can&#x27;t beat that. You can put it almost everywhere.<p>* Runs with whatever terminal you have to use. Unknown or broken termcap, no problem. Even works inside Emacs eshell.<p>* Still unbeatable with terrible connections. Try that with vi&#x2F;vim, and you&#x27;ll cry, even without colors.<p>* Gives you &quot;focused editing&quot; without having to look at the whole file. Just like Ken Thompson said. For example, to read .bashrc ignoring comments, just use &quot;g&#x2F;^[^#]&#x2F;n&quot;.<p>* The only editor you can easily script, the same way as you type in it. That is why we have &quot;script&quot; command.<p>* Very easy to print commands (as the author showed) and give students as &quot;howto&quot; to edit something. Easy to follow and no ambiguities.')
