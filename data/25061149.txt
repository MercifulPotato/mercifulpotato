Their focus seems to be less providing integrations into their hardware, and more providing integrations into their services. Meanwhile, developers increasingly distrust Apple because of bad policies and press around App Store review. It&#x27;s a mess.<p>I agree that Apple could and should help app developers use this cool new hardware. I&#x27;m sure there are good people at Apple who&#x27;re trying. But the company as a whole seems to be chasing other squirrels.')
