Plenty of people get sick on this mountain, it&#x27;s not the norm and plenty of elderly and children climb this mountain, but there&#x27;s definitely a not-insignificant number of people who could not handle the altitude without acclimatisation, among which many who&#x27;re in perfectly fine health. Your personal experience does not refute any of that, just google Mt Fuji Altitude Sickness.')
