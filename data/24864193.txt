Uber and Amazon spending untold billions subsidizing sales while building tech to be market leaders.  At one point it was obviously stupid for Zuckerberg to not sell his company for $1B.  It was obviously stupid for Musk to start a brand new car company in America.  The list goes on.<p>By mocking people for trying, yes that does make one a hater.  Quibi tried, and yes it turned out they were wrong about the product or execution or timing.  But that’s the point of startups.  They start with an “obviously stupid” idea and sometimes it works spectacularly.  Usually not, but sometimes you get surprises.')
