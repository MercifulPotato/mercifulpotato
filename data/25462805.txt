Management gets used to deliver thanks to the developers last moment heroic efforts.\nBut I don&#x27;t think that Cyberpunk fits in a PS4. People are calling for more &quot;optimization&quot; like a magic wand that the developers use to fix all problems. \nThere are limits to what some hardware can do. I hope that improvements can make things somewhat better, but it cannot run a 2020 groundbreaking game into an old PS4.<p>You need 1 year, so I give you 4 weeks, break encryption but make it safe, optimize this game to run like mostly empty games in a PS4. That&#x27;s not realistic.<p>I love this game, it is awesome. And launching it on PS4 without showing images it is a mistake, and probably bad will. CD Projekt Red could have crowned themselves as the best video games company in the world, they got complains instead.')
