Given modern life expectancy, that means you could be alive for at least 60 more years.<p>In order to make 1 million dollars last that long you are going to need to take on significant investment risk. &quot;Normal&quot; investment risk, e.g. from index funds, is not going to grow the money enough -- if you withdraw enough every year to live on, the money will run out. When it runs out, you will probably have been out of the job market for decades, and therefore unemployable.<p>If you are living on a fixed income, predictability of expenses is key. Home ownership is one way to control your expenses -- get a fixed-rate mortgage and your monthly cost of living will be fairly predictable. Property tax and utility costs might fluctuate, but in most places the mortgage will be the largest cost, and you can lock that in at a known monthly amount. However, you just sold your house. If you are planning to rent, you won&#x27;t have the predictability that you need in order to plan for future expenses. If you are planning to buy again, that $1 million is going to shrink by the amount that you pay for your next home.<p>You probably can&#x27;t retire on $1 million. But you can take some time off, like a sabbatical. If you aren&#x27;t happy in your work, you can look for another job, and having that money will let you coast for a while until you find it.')
