Which means I tend to go back to walking alone because it&#x27;s so lighter.<p>One anecdote, 10 years ago, I went to a birthday party, a time where I hated social gatherings pretty much. Yet the day after I felt &#x27;replenished&#x27; of somethings. As if my internal world couldn&#x27;t satisfy me fully and even dreaded parties were benefitial.')
