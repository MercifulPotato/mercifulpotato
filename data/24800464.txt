The latter sees anything beyond legalistic compliance as an unreasonable expectation.<p>Personally I&#x27;m disappointed with the exploitation view, but I also think it&#x27;s an interesting example of how different assumptions lead groups to talk past each other. &quot;AWS was in complete compliance, what&#x27;s the problem?&quot; versus &quot;AWS violated the spirit of the community&quot;. Each camp agrees with the other camp&#x27;s assertion but sees it as irrelevant.')
