I used it to play few games before I got into Shadow, but GFN is better for more GPU heavy games so I&#x27;ll play CP2077 there.<p>The only downside I see is that there is no Linux client (or a browser one, which they promised) and I need to do a strange setup of:<p>1. Starting game on Android<p>2. Connecting bluetooth mouse there (so it won&#x27;t kick me out because I&#x27;m not doing anything on the phone)<p>3. Starting Steam and using Steam Remote Play<p>(Thank you a anonymous user on reddit for letting know that Steam Remote Play works there)<p>(with each step cursing Google for not enabling video out on Pixel 4 USB-C)<p>It is a bit of PITA, but I&#x27;m glad it works (other option of using a VM was even worse).')
