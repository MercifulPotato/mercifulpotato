It&#x27;s challenging to make single servings from scratch without going even a little overboard, and for me at least, it&#x27;s all getting eaten in one sitting.<p>Cooking for me has become viewed more as just a DIY form of JIT-processed food.  It tends to be healthier than food processed by someone else, for lack of preservatives and less salt&#x2F;sugars, and higher quality ingredients, but the cooking process still tends to produce something more calorically dense and unnaturally delicious I have difficulty resisting overeating.')
