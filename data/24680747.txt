Just because my government or even peers have determined that raining down hellfire on villages in the Middle East or has accepted that some of the state&#x27;s population should be subject to capital punishment does not mean I think it is &#x27;good&#x27;.  Moreover, I can be angry because I think it is bad.  It is not simply irrational either - in my framework of moral logic I see someone doing something &#x27;bad&#x27; and naturally react negatively towards that behavior.')
