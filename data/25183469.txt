MacPorts will try to find a precompiled binary on packages.macports.org, then fall back to building from source if a binary is not available.<p>That saidâ€”while I don&#x27;t know whether ARM actually works yet, MacPorts still supports PowerPC wherever possible, so they have a long history of managing multiple architectures. I expect they&#x27;ll have a somewhat easier time with ARM as a result.<p>Edit: MacPorts does indeed support ARM as of the latest release! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.macports.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;macports-announce&#x2F;2020-November&#x2F;000057.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.macports.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;macports-announce&#x2F;2020-...</a>')
