I&#x27;ve wrestled with this for over a year. Bank syncing has to come from my server, which means by doing so you are giving us access to your transactions. No banking provider has any way for clients to contact them directly. I think this is possible with the right encryption, but nobody is working on it. I&#x27;ve given this feedback to Plaid but they don&#x27;t care.<p>The majority of people need the convenience of syncing though. So I plan to launch it, and it&#x27;ll go through my server, and I plan to communicate clearly the privacy that you are giving up by doing so.')
