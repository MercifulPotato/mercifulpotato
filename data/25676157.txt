Massacring a bunch of poor pawns in North Korea doesn&#x27;t solve anything except maybe appeasing some people&#x27;s ideas of revenge. The DPRK hardly cares <i>today</i> about most of population, but in return they would effectively shutdown the US government and possibly put the entirety of the government into a standstill, possibly freezing tons of regular processes. Before any other bomb is launched, people would be more concerned about making sure they are properly secured - after all if north korean terrorists already executed the Senate, your main fear would be that you&#x27;re next; and glassing peasants wouldn&#x27;t prevent that.<p>In other words, your opponent has just taken your all your Rooks, Knights and Bishops and in response you wipe out their pawns while the opponent&#x27;s queen is about to checkmate you.')
