It really seems Apple did not care enough to get especially golang and Rust stuff stable for their hardware release. I can&#x27;t escape the impression that they didn&#x27;t really shower the wider ecosystem in DTKs and software support, although I&#x27;d be happy to be proven wrong there.<p>Oh well, at least Rosetta2 seems to be working really well - you will be able to run a lot of software you need rather well despite not to the fullest potential. The execution on Rosetta2 is really good and that&#x27;s important. But I think it does go to show that the &quot;Pro&quot; in &quot;Macbook Pro 13&quot; does not mean all that much. At least not if they&#x27;re going to ship with the majority of pro software not being native, many popular developer toolchains still months to be ready, and very limited I&#x2F;O and RAM options. The Macbook Air and Mac Mini I fully get for the first releases on new hardware, but the Macbook Pro 13 really feels odd in this lineup if the word Pro is supposed to mean anything.')
