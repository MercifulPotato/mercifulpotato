She came out as skeptical of it during her campaign, but that was hard to believe given that she was responsible for it under the Obama administration.<p>She wanted to strengthen Obamacare, but was against a single-payer option. I&#x27;m sure people will quibble, but I&#x27;m confident health premiums would have gone up faster under Hillary.<p>Hillary Clinton was in bed with Wall St firms. A Clinton presidency would have risked undoing a lot of the regulatory protections that have been put in place after the dot-com and 2007 financial collapses.<p>Compared with Trump, Hillary Clinton is tremendously China-friendly.  She would not have countered Xi&#x27;s expansionist policies.<p>On more niche (but IMHO important) issues like space policy, Trump-Pence has actually been extremely good, better than any president in living memory. Hillary, on the other hand, considered expenditures on space to be a waste of money.<p>-----<p>There are plenty of arguments a reasonable person can come up with for not wanting a Hillary Clinton presidency in 2016, with or without the advantage of hindsight. Only through a deeply blue-tinted partisan lens could you say a Hillary term would have been objectively better on all accounts.<p>As I said way up thread, the DNC is as much at fault as anyone else for continuing to field deeply unpopular and uninspiring candidates, while simultaneously ignoring working class concerns.')
