Its higher then bash, but again, bash sux and when you have 0 features compared to pwsh you can use lower amount of memory I guess. Bash is ancient, memory was much bigger problem then. Its funny that in age in electron apps we talk about memory when your todo app takes more then anything else.<p>&gt; The killer though is a disregard for economy of expression.<p>?<p>&gt; the rich object data model - isnâ€™t actually that useful in practice day to day.<p>Its most useful every day feature for me.')
