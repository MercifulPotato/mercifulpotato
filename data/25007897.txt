Once your language is designed, it becomes hard to change it. You can see that with Java that has half baked generics, horrible primitive types, strange collections, null and so on.<p>I believe, that for new languages there are only two choices:<p>1. Build a simple language and don&#x27;t implement generics _forever_. That is fine! Just stick with it.<p>2. Build generics into the language from the beginning and do it right. If that&#x27;s too hard for you, then don&#x27;t create a language in the beginning. Creating programming languages is damn hard. Amateurs will just fail.')
