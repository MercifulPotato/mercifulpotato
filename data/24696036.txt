Saving 10 minutes here and 20 minutes there only adds up to give you hours to do what you want if you&#x27;re not waiting for some event to let you begin the next task. If you are waiting for something then saving 10 minutes just gives you 10 minutes more dead space in your day to spend waiting. If I have two meetings and I can manage to get the first one done early the only impact that will have is that I&#x27;ll have to wait longer until the second one. I guess that&#x27;s a little more time to spend writing nonsense on HN, but it doesn&#x27;t feel <i>useful</i> to have saved that time.<p>Saving time on tasks to give yourself more time to do other things only works if you have complete autonomy over your schedule.')
