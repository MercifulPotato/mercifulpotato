However, as others have mentioned, it&#x27;s pretty early on the west coast of the US. Unless some engineer was up extra early (perhaps at the behest of an anxious project manager) it seems unlikely to be a release.<p>What it could be is some engineer somewhere coming in after the holiday, noticing a slightly flaky thing, and thinking, &quot;I&#x27;ll reboot&#x2F;redeploy&#x2F;refresh this thing so the flakiness doesn&#x27;t get worse&quot;. Only it turns out the flaky thing was a signal of something else falling over. Or maybe the redeploy was the wrong version because of bad CI&#x2F;CD, or maybe the person just fat-fingered it.')
