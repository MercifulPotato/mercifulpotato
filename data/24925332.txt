The first one is, the economic trade-off doesn&#x27;t exist. Even countries who avoided the lock downs saw significant economic damage often comparable to the countries that implemented lockdowns.

The country doing best right now economically is China, which used by far the harshest but also most effective measures in stomping the virus out.<p>Second point, covid health damage isn&#x27;t just limited to literal covid deaths.
