Google is very much the yelp of the Internet.<p>I understand where you are coming from being an 80s baby myself, however more and more young adults see google as the homepage of the internet, much as many now see Facebook as the internet to the point its where they consume most of their information.<p>I screamed about all this when Google became an ad machine. I screamed about it when Microsoft released paid DLC for the Xbox 360. Some of us railed, but the children...the children grew up thinking it was all normal and now its just &#x27;how the world is&#x27; (SAAS&#x2F;advertising&#x2F;misinformation)<p>That&#x27;s the real danger here. Companies outlast us and mold the next generation to see them as Deities of the world wide web.<p>Also- I do not remember paid search engines either.')
