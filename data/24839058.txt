With Pitch you can just share a link and off you go. IIRC this also applies to Powerpoint: to collaborate you need to upload the documents to SharePoint&#x2F;OneDrive. Google Slides can do this, but for weird some reason (like many of Google&#x27;s online products) it just doesn&#x27;t feel good to use.<p>That said, I have only worked on Pitch for hours so YMMV. Congrats on the launch!')
