Item(by='nebulous1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610141081, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25687415, text='I feel like most people think of what you&#x27;re referring to as trading Tether, and &quot;redeeming USDT&quot; as actually exchanging the USDT for the fiat that is supposedly backing it.<p>Everybody realizes that for the individual turning tether into fiat both of these amount to the same thing, but they are not the same thing for the system as a whole at all.  Ultimately the only way that tether as a company can maintain the peg is by buying their own token with the reserve funds if market won&#x27;t (there are obviously different mechanisms they could use to do this, either via the exchanges or with the seller directly trading with them).  If they don&#x27;t have access to enough reserve funds then the peg will eventually fail.')
