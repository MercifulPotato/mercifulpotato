What are the skills, connections, etc. I need to develop?<p>I&#x27;m in my late 20s and working at FAANG in London (can&#x27;t move to the US). It&#x27;s my first&#x2F;only real job, but I&#x27;ve moved around in a few different teams and I&#x27;m now a staff engineer. While I do enjoy my job, it feels like I&#x27;m having marginal impact on a large number of people, which is not extremely satisfying. So I&#x27;m thinking of leveraging my time here to best prepare for a pivot to startups in a few years. The things I&#x27;m currently focusing on:<p>(1) generic technical skills - for the most part, being a world class expert in programming languages, or data storage or whatever it may be is likely not going to be a good use of my time. So I&#x27;m focusing on generic, translateable skills<p>(2) becoming a great engineer - bridging the gap between technical complexity and business outcomes sounds like a skill that is very useful. I&#x27;m lucky to be in a team that has a lot of such complexity to manage, which means that I can also gain some product management, etc. skills<p>(3) managing people - understanding people&#x27;s motivations and creating human structures to achieve a business outcome seems like a core skill for managing a startup. I can do this both informally (e.g. as a senior&#x2F;staff engineer) and formally (as a manager, at some point)<p>(4) managing a business - this is hard without hands on experience, but there&#x27;s plenty of theory around in books, blogs etc.<p>So far, it looks like the things that are missing are (5) networking and (6) startup ideas. It&#x27;s unclear how much weight I should give to these right now, or if there are other blind spots.<p>So I&#x27;m looking for a validation that I&#x27;m approaching things the right way, advice for better leveraging my current situation, and the HN crowd&#x27;s wisdom on the matter.<p>Thanks!')
