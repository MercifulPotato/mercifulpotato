That would be the HLL2300D and HLL3210CW respectively. The first one is 14.0&quot; W x 14.2&quot; D x 7.2&quot; H, while the second one is 16.1” W x 18.1” D x 9.9” H. So it&#x27;s 2 inches wider, 4 inches longer, and 3 inches taller. Doesn&#x27;t seem that much bigger to me:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;comparesizes.com&#x2F;saved&#x2F;CompareSizes_HLL2300D_vs_HLL3210CW_1605063050.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;comparesizes.com&#x2F;saved&#x2F;CompareSizes_HLL2300D_vs_HLL3...</a><p>&gt; and don’t really save money on toner vs. ink for typical home users.<p>At the very least, toner cartridges drying out isn&#x27;t really a thing.<p>&gt;If you want all that with a color laser you end up with a monstrosity in your house.<p>Your HP OfficeJet 9015 has official dimensions of 17.3&quot; x 20.46&quot; x 10.94&quot;. The Brother MFC9340CDW also has a scanner with ADF with auto-duplex (and does it in one pass, actually), and auto-duplex printing. Its dimensions are 16.1&quot; x 19.0&quot; x 16.1&quot;. So it&#x27;s true that the color laser is taller. However, it has a smaller footprint, which is what matters for most people when trying to situate a printer.<p>One feature that your OfficeJet does not have that I appreciate (and this Brother AIO has) is a manual feed slot, which lets me skip the rigamarole of emptying the paper tray, fiddling with the tray to fit the envelope or whatever custom paper I&#x27;m using, printing, and then reversing what I previously did. That likely contributes at least a little bit to the height.')
