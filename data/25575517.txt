Item(by='s0rce', descendants=None, kids=[25575989, 25575651], score=None, time=1609278918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25574850, text='huh, seems like there are numerous towns visible on the satellite&#x2F;aerial imagery on the &quot;old summer road&quot;. Are those towns cut off in the winter (by land)? Do they have an ice road? Seems unusual that travel is easier in the summer. In northern Canada summer travel is often not possible by land due to extensive mud and bogs. In the winter you can travel across the frozen tundra much more easily (although you need to be prepared if you car breaks down).')
