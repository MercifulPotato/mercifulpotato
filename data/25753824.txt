Amazon said it was unconvinced that the service’s plan to use volunteers to moderate calls for violence and hate speech would be effective.<p>&gt; “Recently, we’ve seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms,&quot; the email reads. &quot;It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service.”<p>I am not an English major, but from a reading of those two paragraphs, it does not seem to me that AWS has claimed that Parler is solely used for violence.')
