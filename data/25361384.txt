Item(by='munchbunny', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607536348, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25361174, text='&gt; Can we really knock the founders of Robinhood for making stock trading so seamless and addictive and amping up the gamification to its highest level.<p>Yes and no. Yes, because they absolutely know what they are doing and the human cost of it. You don&#x27;t get this successful with your product without also seeing primary evidence of the negative effects (lives you&#x27;ve ruined). But also no, because there has to be a baseline of personal responsibility on the part of someone who chooses to take on financial risk by betting on the stock markets.<p>This is a cat that doesn&#x27;t go back in the bag, but I think the way to think about Robinhood isn&#x27;t as an evolution of stock trading, but as straight up gambling, because that&#x27;s what Robinhood is. It&#x27;s giving you an easy way to bet money in a high risk environment where the &quot;house&quot; has a massive institutional and informational advantage, and it&#x27;s gamified.<p>Without knowing more about Robinhood, I think the first question to ask is &quot;what are the biggest footguns that are catching people who don&#x27;t know better?&quot;')
