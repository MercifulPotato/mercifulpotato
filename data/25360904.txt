It&#x27;s quite absurd how many devices have a broken experience in just less than ideal conditions.<p>About 2 or 3 years ago I was looking for some wireless headphones who don&#x27;t suck as much and there&#x27;s an absurd defect that is shared by too many of them, some of them even on the higher end; the loud beep when the battery is getting low, some even had a recurring beep when the battery still has enough battery to keep listening. It makes some kind of sense with how batteries work, but it just breaks the experience so much you have to wonder why nobody thought of simple ways to avoid this behavior, but then you realize that is quite likely that the product was only tested with full battery and nobody on the team uses it on daily basis.')
