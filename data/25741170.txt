I&#x27;d be happy to discuss any specific contacts that you find to be troublesome, though.<p>&gt; Many of you also believed that Hillary was responsible for Benghazi and Republicans wasted millions of dollars and time on that investigation and yet she was not guilty.<p>The Benghazi investigation was undeniably an attempt, in part, to damage Hillary Clinton politically. The question of who was &quot;responsible&quot; for Benghazi is a matter of opinion. The question of whether there is evidence for Trump-Russia collusion is one of fact. That&#x27;s an important difference.<p>Another important difference is the fact that the the lie-de-jour of the right--that the 2016 election was stolen--is currently being panned as anti-democratic, fascist, a danger to the very fabric of our nation, etc, etc., and we&#x27;re told that his is because it is undermining our sacred institutions. Well if that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s odd that nobody seemed to give a shit that the Democrats did the exact same thing four years ago. After all, the lie that Trump colluded with the Russians is effectively the same lie--it&#x27;s simply a different side of the same coin. This is very different from the Benghazi issue, which is, at worst, a run-of-the-mill political hatchet job.<p>&gt; So [Manafort] and many other broke the law and went to jail for that, why is that a bad thing. Why did Trump pardon them though?<p>I never said that it was. Criminals should, of course, be punished. But this has no bearing on my point about Trump-Russia collusion, which is why I specifically mentioned it as a distraction. As for the pardons, who can say why Trump does what he does?<p>&gt; How many people in the US went to jail because of the Benghazi investigations?<p>No idea...?<p>&gt; Mueller did not say that Trump was innocent, why didn&#x27;t he say that?<p>Who cares whether Mueller himself said Trump was innocent? In a system where the accused are innocent until proven guilty, his report said it for him. &quot;[The report] did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple efforts from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d be interested to hear your thoughts on the fact that almost 90% of Democrats were still convinced of the lie that Trump colluded with the Russians, and how that differs from the current right-wing mania about the 2016 election, which affects a much smaller proportion of the country.')
