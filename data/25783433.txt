Why should one of them be able to cut you off on a whim, and the other cannot?  If it is because one of them is more indirectly harmed, such as by the mob attacking them, then why do tolerate such attacks on one but not the other?<p>Fundamentally, I think that a service provider, of any service, should be expected to provide their service to anyone willing to pay for it, <i>as long as that customer does not actively and directly harm the service provider</i>.  Mob actions against the provider are a separate matter, and should be opposed, whether they are calling for all ISPs to disconnect the offender or for all grocers to stop selling them food.<p>Further, I think that even at the platform level, permabans should not be allowed (unless perhaps with a court judgement after multiple offenses).  Temporary suspension for TOS violations?  Sure!  But there should always be a clear and accessible process for appeal, and for the offender to redeem themselves.  Considering what a large and important part of society communication platforms have become, a lifetime ban without trial or recourse is unacceptable and unconscionable.')
