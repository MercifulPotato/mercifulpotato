The        authorisation        of        the        rightholder        shall        not        be        required        where   reproduction   of   the   code   and   translation   of   its   form   within   the   meaning   of   points   (a)   and   (b)   of   Article   4(1)   are   indispensable   to   obtain   the   information   necessary   to   achieve   the    interoperability    of    an    independently    created    computer    program   with   other   programs,   provided   that   the   following   conditions  are  met:</i><p>(a) you&#x27;re allowed to use YouTube, (b) YouTube is undocumented, (c) this only applies to relevant parts of the code.<p>&gt; <i>2.        The        provisions        of        paragraph        1        shall        not        permit        the        infor\xadmation  obtained  through  its  application:</i><p>to be (a) used for other stuff, (b) distributed, (c) used for cloning or copyright infringement.<p>&gt; <i>3.        In        accordance        with        the        provisions        of        the        Berne        Convention  for  the  protection  of  Literary  and  Artistic  Works,  the  provisions  of  this  Article  may  not  be  interpreted  in  such  a  way  as  to  allow  its  application  to  be  used  in  a  manner  which  unreasonably  prejudices  the  rightholder&#x27;s  legitimate  interests  or  conflicts  with  a  normal  exploitation  of  the  computer  program.</i><p>Creating youtube-dl isn&#x27;t infringing on <i>anyone&#x27;s</i> copyright, and the rightsholder here is Google, so it&#x27;s allowed. There&#x27;s wiggle room for arguing – it&#x27;s not as cut and dry as most Big Bold Legal Statements I make, so iamnotalawyerandthisisnotlegaladvice – but I&#x27;m fairly sure this is sound.<p>In the UK, you have unequivocal rights to do this. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legislation.gov.uk&#x2F;ukpga&#x2F;1988&#x2F;48&#x2F;section&#x2F;50B" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legislation.gov.uk&#x2F;ukpga&#x2F;1988&#x2F;48&#x2F;section&#x2F;50B</a>, based on this directive, says:<p>&gt; <i>(3) In particular, the conditions in subsection (2) are not met if the lawful user—</i><p>&gt; <i>(a)has readily available to him the information necessary to achieve the permitted objective;</i><p>&gt; <i>(b)does not confine the decompiling to such acts as are necessary to achieve the permitted objective;</i><p>&gt; <i>(c)supplies the information obtained by the decompiling to any person to whom it is not necessary to supply it in order to achieve the permitted objective; or</i><p>&gt; <i>(d)uses the information to create a program which is substantially similar in its expression to the program decompiled or to do any act restricted by copyright.</i><p>The wording in (d), here, is clearer than the EU directive – unless youtube-dl&#x27;s existence can somehow be shown to be a copyright violation (specifically, if its creation was an act restricted by copyright), it&#x27;s permitted. Not sure whether this would help in an EU court, but if other countries&#x27; implementations have taken the obvious interpretation of the directive, then the other language versions of the directive are probably clear on the matter.')
