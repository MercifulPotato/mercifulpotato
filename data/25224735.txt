They don&#x27;t like what&#x27;s happening. They don&#x27;t need the world&#x27;s permission to say &quot;I can&#x27;t stop assholes from around the globe from being assholes, but I can change the damn name that is their excuse for acting like butts to my town.&quot; and now people think it&#x27;s the townspeople who are in the wrong and not the random assholes from across the globe whose bad behavior they got fed up with.<p>Wow.<p>I think I need to get off of HN for a bit. This is just ridiculous.')
