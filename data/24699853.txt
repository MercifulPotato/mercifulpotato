Wherever smart, creative people live, there will be stuff happening, albeit perhaps at its own pace.<p>I tend to look at the high-wage regions like silicon valley, like they are a different country. Some folks will emigrate to that country, and I&#x27;m happy for them. Those of us who are left behind, for whatever reason, get on with our lives and find what there is to enjoy in our humble surroundings.')
