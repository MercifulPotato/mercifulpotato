You clearly saw a few logic gates and determined that was all there is to know. I would say ASIC design is more difficult than most SW, and you have to get it right first time, no patches or releases are coming to fix a bug you found after the chip is manufactured. As it happens the types of SW that are amongst the hardest are the algorithms that go into Place and Route. There are bitstream formats that have been either opened or hacked, yet there is no open source SW tool that even comes close to the performance or capability of a commercial place and route tool. The reason is its very difficult to create thst kind of SW.')
