JS <i>does</i> make a distinction between a non-existent field and a field containing undefined as a value. Is there anywhere where the JS standard library uses null? I don&#x27;t recall any. In my experience having two null values causes problems, for instance you check for one but not the other. It also remains the one remaining use of the == operator, without null we can expunge == too.')
