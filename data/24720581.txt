Probably a simple task, but you may still need to run some tests again. And if you are lucky, you are done, otherwise, back to step 3<p>Also, if you are rebasing before push, you should be able to keep a clean history. However, if you are merging, and there are good reasons for a &quot;merge only&quot; policy, you are going to have a mess of merge commits every time the previous situation happens.<p>That&#x27;s something you can work around with good management. But the more freedom you give individual teams to push to the common branches, the more that situation will arise, the more you try to control access, the more chance you will have for teams to go in different directions, making the merges infrequent but tricky.')
