Item(by='agurk', descendants=None, kids=[25614516], score=None, time=1609608291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25613244, text='One monitor missing from his list is the Benq PD3220U that hits all of his main criteria although it is fixed at 60Hz so doesn&#x27;t match all his secondary ones (and isn&#x27;t cheap).<p>I have similar requirements to the OP and got this monitor back in March just before everyone started working remotely. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it, and have been pleased with the choice. The separate control unit which can be configured to use the hardware buttons for KVM switching is a small thing but particularly nice to have.<p>The KVM takes a second or two to switch, and it&#x27;d be nice if it would do it (near) instantly. I&#x27;m not sure if its firmware is updatable - it&#x27;s plugged into a Linux machine where I can&#x27;t run their software or a locked down Windows machine where I&#x27;m not allowed to run their software. There&#x27;s nothing on their website to suggest there are updates I&#x27;m missing out on though.')
