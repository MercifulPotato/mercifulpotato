They also had a prime benefit called &quot;actually free&quot; games for fire that effectively gave you a unlimited currency in some free to play games, as well as free access to some paid games.<p>Both of those initiatives were quite nice and improved my view of the prime program. I do wonder what an alternate time line looks like where they had focused on mobile gaming and creating a subscription gaming experience rather than first party stuff.')
