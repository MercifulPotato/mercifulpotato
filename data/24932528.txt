Hospitals are happy with waiting for your next startup idea to become a feature in their next MRI purchase from the same vendor they have had a relationship with for years.<p>One way I can think of to disrupt this process is partnering with a new medical device company which is accelerating sales to hospitals. Last time I had this conversation the promising ones were all Chinese, wanted investment solely for development of algorithms under Chinese jurisdiction as part of terms of investment, and carried all the usual IP theft and legal risks you can imagine.
