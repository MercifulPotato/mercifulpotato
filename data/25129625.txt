Mainstream consumer PC platforms all support dual-channel memory. Dual-channel DDR4-4266 would provide the same theoretical bandwidth as the M1&#x27;s 128-bit wide collection of LPDDR4X-4266.<p>Intel&#x27;s LPDDR support has been lagging far behind what mobile SoCs support (largely because of Intel&#x27;s 10nm troubles), but their recently-launched <i>Tiger Lake</i> mobile processors do support LPDDR4X-4266 (and LPDDR5-5400, supposedly).')
