You release OSS knowing that anyone can come and pick it up. Even if they make a dime off your sweat. Pick your license, fine, but there&#x27;s no reason for the devs to get upset about it because there&#x27;s no lack of information out there.<p>That being said, companies <i>should</i> kick down some love to the OSS projects they use. Especially big companies for which it&#x27;s just a charitable write-off anyway.')
