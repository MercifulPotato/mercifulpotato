It was cheaper than an Apple II, but as far as parents were concerned that was still a lot of money to pay for a &quot;game machine.&quot; Whereas the even more expensive Apple II, with a better selection of educational and &quot;serious&quot; software, was seen more as an investment in a child&#x27;s future.<p>Then why did the C64 sell 22 million units and the Apple 2 only sold 5-6 million if consumers had a bad impression of it.<p>&gt; Obviously a C128 or Amiga would have been better for gaming and writing fun stuff.<p>And pretty much everything else. Seriously, in college, everyone in engineering used TeX. I used TeX on my Amiga. It produced superior output for math and engineering papers compared to the best you could achieve on a Mac with WYSIWYG.')
