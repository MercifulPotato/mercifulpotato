It is that computers can now recognize images, translate language, have conversations, generate articles, make realistic looking pictures, play the game of go, solve protein folding, generate realistic text to speech, recognize voices. All these things were not possible 5 years ago. Every year there is significant progress. I believe that in a couple of years we will see many more applications. This will be as much of a paradigm shift as the invention of the personal computer, the internet and smart phones.')
