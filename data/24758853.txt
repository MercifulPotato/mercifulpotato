I&#x27;ve seen no evidence that stage fright is a significant factor ruling out good candidates. If you are fluent at coding then a coding interview is just like any other interview, if that scares you then a normal interview would hurt you just as much.<p>If you aren&#x27;t fluent at coding then why are you applying to a coding job? Would you apply to an English writing job without being fluent in English? If you just have a few years of English from school doing an interview in English would be extremely stressful and likely lead to stage fright. That doesn&#x27;t mean that making interviews in English is a problem, the problem is that the person isn&#x27;t fluent in English.<p>I remember that English fluency was a big barrier when I originally applied for jobs. Just speaking took a lot of mental power and the interviews were very stressful, but now that I&#x27;m fluent it no longer takes any effort. I went through the same stages in programming as well. I did a technical interview with a few months of coding experience and it was very stressful, now I don&#x27;t even have to think.')
