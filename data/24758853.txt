I&#x27;ve seen no evidence that stage fright is a significant factor ruling out good candidates. If you are fluent at coding then a coding interview is just like any other interview, if that scares you then a normal interview would hurt you just as much.<p>If you aren&#x27;t fluent at coding then why are you applying to a coding job? Would you apply to an English writing job without being fluent in English? If you just have a few years of English from school doing an interview in English would be extremely stressful and likely lead to stage fright. That doesn&#x27;t mean that making interviews in English is a problem, the problem is that the person isn&#x27;t fluent in English.')
