I guess one option is never allowing any call to that even if you know it&#x27;s valid.<p>The trouble comes is in an existing code base if you know 95% of those use are valid but to pass the check you know have to migrate that all and do QA.<p>It depends a lot on the library I guess, does it make it easier to do the right thing or not.')
