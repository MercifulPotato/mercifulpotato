Iâ€™d love to talk with you about your stack. Here are the three biggest problems I ran into.<p>1. Request timeouts<p>Even &quot;fast&quot; blogs sometimes have hiccups or rate-limit scrapers&#x2F;crawlers. The more I scale the more often I see requests timing out. I&#x27;ve tried to mitigate this with retry buttons and trying the request again, but it doesn&#x27;t always work.<p>2. Scaling Puppeteer<p>I saw from another of your comments that this is built on top of Puppeteer. From my experience, trying to scale to even 3 concurrent renders starts to fall apart when you have to spin up a new Chrome instance for each request.<p>I&#x27;ve looked into Browserless [2] but they charge per second of usage, and I&#x27;m not at the point where I want to have that big of an expense.<p>3. Getting a relevant image<p>I love that your tool adds an image to the thumbnail as well! I struggled with searching Unsplash using the text in the title of the article but they never came out that well.<p>I love it when people make these massively useful services stitching together a few simple tools. Congrats on the launch!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mugshotbot.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mugshotbot.com</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.browserless.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.browserless.io</a>')
