Labor would certainly have more dollars to spend across the board. That would give businesses more dollars to spend in turn.<p>People hate on CPI inflation because they simply don&#x27;t understand supply and demand in the labor market.<p>CPI inflation low = low demand for workers<p>CPI inflation high = high demand for workers<p>You want CPI inflation to be at least 2% and a small 5% spike for a year doesn&#x27;t hurt if you have been stuck in a liquidity trap. Runaway inflation is extremely unlikely because we have spent a decade perfecting our economic deflation skills.<p>CPI inflation generally reduces inequality because the price of goods is rising faster than the value of assets because the money is arriving in consumer goods first and only businesses that are productively investing into providing more goods or services are actually getting the inflation money. At current valuations you are hard pressed to find companies that can justify their current market cap let alone further growth that would track CPI inflation.<p>If your wages rise from $15&#x2F;hr to $30&#x2F;hr the only one who is hurting is someone who owns a million dollars in stocks because their purchasing power just dropped by half.<p>The answer? Demand side stimulus. This is nothing new. Just get your government to spend money on domestic industries. Renewables, electric cars, road maintenance, electric grid upgrades are the new Keynesian gold digging. No one is losing money except those who have too much of it already.')
