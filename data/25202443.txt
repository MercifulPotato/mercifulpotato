Say a 5ms delay on any write without a flush, any further write resets the delay, up until a maximum of 20ms.<p>This would seem to reign in the worst of the behavior - developers not realizing they&#x27;re sending multiple packets - without adding a large delay to developers using the system properly but not flushing.<p>And since the penalty is much less, it would be less likely to be turned off aggressively, see the Go example in sibling comments.<p>If the goal is to hand training wheels to developers of shitty apps, it&#x27;s pretty important they actually use them.')
