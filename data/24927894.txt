I&#x27;m not sure whether that can be done automatically when pushing up changes that span multiple commits in a local branch.<p>If I create a branch with several commits where one commit adds a new method with associated unit tests, and a subsequent commit adds several calls to that new method in the code base (while updating any affected tests), then how would Gerrit handle the ordering of those commits.  Even if they&#x27;re in the same topic, I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a way to ensure that the first commit is reachable from the subsequent commit.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gerrit-review.googlesource.com&#x2F;Documentation&#x2F;intro-user.html#topics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gerrit-review.googlesource.com&#x2F;Documentation&#x2F;intro-u...</a>')
