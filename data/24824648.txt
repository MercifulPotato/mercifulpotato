My employer pays for it in lieu of a company car. I only have to pay income taxes on it, which comes out to about 170â‚¬ (200$) a month. For that price, I can use all trains across Germany as often as I want and also get free local transit (busses, subway etc.) in 120 cities, including the one where I live.<p>2020 is my first year with a BC100, so due to Corona I couldn&#x27;t use it that much yet, but it&#x27;s kind of mind-blowing to go to a train station and just be able to hop on any train [2] whenever I feel like it, no questions asked. When Corona has blown over, I will definitely make a habit of just exploring Germany every other weekend.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bahn.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;view&#x2F;offers&#x2F;bahncard&#x2F;bahncard_100-conditions.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bahn.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;view&#x2F;offers&#x2F;bahncard&#x2F;bahncard_100-co...</a><p>[2] There are some rare exceptions, e.g. night trains require a reservation.')
