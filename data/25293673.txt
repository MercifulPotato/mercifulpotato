For many people, being able to access drugs outside of government control (cancer patient victims of the opioid crisis), or receiving donations (wikileaks) is worth a lot more that the small drawbacks.<p>Same as due process and the &quot;fruit of a poisonous tree&quot; legal doctrine - it lets bad people walk out of jail, but overall I think it does more good than harm to society.<p>&gt; Once it has the same constraints as traditional finance it offers nothing of value, and will wilt away on its own<p>Actually, at the bare minimum, it removes political control of the monetary supply, leaving only fiscal policy, which may enable better long term control of public deficit by implementing a Milton Friedman like rule (whether it&#x27;s constant inflation, deflation, or nothing, all is good as long as it remains constant and predictable)<p>Given the long term inefficiency of the Phillips curve, and a lot of economic similar concepts, most economists would think it&#x27;s for the better.<p>See also the founder charter of the ECB, which enshrined similar policies until politicians made it dance to their tune.<p>This shows the problem isn&#x27;t our lack of understanding, but our lack of self control and long term motivation- just like kids with a cookie jar: we can&#x27;t help it!<p>&gt; if you trust your government you donâ€™t need crypto<p>Hackers often fall prey to black-and-white thinking. Trust isn&#x27;t binary, because you can&#x27;t fully trust an organization made of people, regardless of how &quot;good&quot; they are, or which legal constraints they have.<p>If anything, look at HIPAA laws: even without them, you should be able to trust your healthcare provider, but if there&#x27;re things you don&#x27;t want out ever, you better not share them with your health provider regardless of the laws protecting the confidentiality.<p>Because leaks happen, even for whole countries sometimes (look at Finland mental health leaks)<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean you have &quot;0 trust&quot;, just 0.7 or something non binary.<p>We both know the ideal medical file would be encrypted with the patient private key, or would have some other mechanism of plausible deniability - just like how DKIM was denounced recently. It wasn&#x27;t possible or even imaginable before we had the technology. Now that we do, it may take a while to get there, and the world will be a slightly better place.<p>Crypto is a similar small step for finance, and it may also enable most countries to use the same coin (because once monetary policy is out, there&#x27;s little reason to use your own thing)<p>&gt; we all know how 1984 ended yeah<p>It didn&#x27;t end: we&#x27;re right inside.<p>&gt; Whatever. Makes no difference to me, once the harms are mitigated. JMHO.<p>You are so close to understanding, yet so far. I hope eventually you&#x27;ll admit more complexity in your reasoning.')
