Sears took decades to finally die (and if not for some questionable management decisions, might not have). And like I said, it&#x27;s not always absolute. A large company can still continue on as a shadow of its former self. A large shadow, a still influential shadow, but a shadow nonetheless. IBM, Xexox; tiny players compared (and only compared) to what they were a few decades ago. Obviously they are still large, but they&#x27;re not dominate. They&#x27;re not controlling the future like they were decades ago.')
