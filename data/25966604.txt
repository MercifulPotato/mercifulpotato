(open source, decentralized, privacy oriented etc.) </i><p>Absolutely. They&#x27;ve done similar things with similar apps. You just have to pay some attention to see the pattern.<p>Let&#x27;s take video for example. They Kicked LBRY client off Play store not so long ago. (It eventually got reinstated.) They permanently banned BitChute app. Not app-related, but currently Rumble is suing Google for manipulating video search results in favor of YouTube. Look up the details, they are quite interesting.<p>Meanwhile, Google has an agreement with all Android hardware providers that forces them to pre-install YouTube and make it non-removable.')
