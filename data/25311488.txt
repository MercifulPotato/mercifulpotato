Item(by='Sebguer', descendants=None, kids=[25312721], score=None, time=1607139359, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311412, text='I mean, I do own a rubber mallet - it&#x27;s quite good for what it does!<p>But, no, I would buy a tool that fits my purpose. If my purpose is to hit a baseball, or hammer in a nail, I&#x27;d buy a real bat, or a real hammer, because that&#x27;s the purpose of the tool.<p>If my goal was to swing it at a friend, though, I&#x27;d probably go for the foam bat. Just like, if my purpose was to build a piece of software to archive emails, I would build it so as that it is clearly its purpose, and it would be engineered in a way to make it challenging if not impossible to be used to secretly abscond with someone else&#x27;s conversations.<p>You seem to be interpreting my response as &quot;people shouldn&#x27;t build tools that can be used for dangerous purposes&quot;, when instead I am saying, &quot;you should understand, and take steps to ensure, that the tools you create are used for their intended purpose.&quot; Hopefully that purpose isn&#x27;t spying on people, but if it is, be up-front about it!')
