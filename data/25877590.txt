You’re prepaying a company for a service. The transaction is the prepayment. How you use that balance is now irrelevant.<p>Micro transactions to a range of different independent businesses requires using existing payment networks (visa &#x2F; MasterCard &#x2F; etc: relatively expensive; crypto: lack of widespread adoption) or building a new payment network.<p>&gt; If you are willing to trust an intermediary (and most people are)<p>We already do. It’s called the bank. We also have regulation that helps. How many people keep real money in their personal PayPal accounts? How many people can even afford to?<p>EDIT: I retract my Vultr &#x2F; Starbucks equivalence.<p>&gt; At the end of each month, Vultr tells we what&#x27;s due if I exceed what remains in the account. If necessary I load more money in<p>Starbucks will not let your spend exceed your deposits on your card. Your statement suggests Vultr will. Credit accounts are a whole other risk. What happens if you don’t pay off your balance after you’ve already consumed the service?')
