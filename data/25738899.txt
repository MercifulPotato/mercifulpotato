I wasn&#x27;t aware of anything involving Parler&#x27;s lawyers. The mass harassment of lawyers (leading to withdrawal) that I&#x27;m aware of involved Trump&#x27;s lawyers. Perhaps they were retained by a corporation (idk), but I would find the question of corporate personhood irrelevant because Trump could just have retained them personally if he needed to.<p>To be clear, I don&#x27;t think that the Trump lawsuits had any merit or should have been brought in the first place. But they should absolutely have been allowed to go through the normal legal process so they could be convincingly rebutted. Sending hundreds of threats to law firms should not be a political tactic in a democracy. That does nothing but give ammunition and validity to conspiracy theorists.')
