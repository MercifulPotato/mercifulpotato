But this problem can be solved.<p>If you believe in helping people, I believe you should model voluntarism for your kids, nieces, nephews, older relatives, neighbors, etc. You don&#x27;t have to do in a way that says aren&#x27;t I great I volunteer. It can be something like sharing starting with holidays and then expanding to non-holidays. Perhaps encourage a smaller holiday fete at work and direct the resources to something like gifts for a shelter, Toys for Tots, shoe box gifts for homeless shelters, etc. My grandkids, for example, learn about helping others at Christmas buy picking out a toy and donating it to Toys for Tots. This is a super important life lesson and it&#x27;s reinstilled frequently.<p>Or, there&#x27;s the volleyball team. I was new in a job and pulled together a volleyball team to play in a tournament sponsored by an org I volunteered for. We had t-shirts and folks raised money. And it was fun! The team members and board members bonded in an important way on something that was bigger than us and our &quot;issue.&quot; While the tournament sponsor did not get more volunteers out of our team, they appreciated that I was more committed and that they got new donors.<p>There are so many things that prevent people from volunteering&#x2F;giving&#x2F;helping. Very often, people will help, they just need to be asked or encouraged. People don&#x27;t know where to look for ways to participate in some civic something. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;longevity.stanford.edu&#x2F;three-reasons-why-people-dont-volunteer-and-what-can-be-done-about-it&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;longevity.stanford.edu&#x2F;three-reasons-why-people-dont...</a> provides details I can&#x27;t.<p>Interested individuals should still volunteer&#x2F;help&#x2F;do something even if others don&#x27;t.')
