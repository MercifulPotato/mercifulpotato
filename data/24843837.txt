I wish there was an affordable audio &amp; video editor that created and edited transform scripts, with support for offline rendering.  Then I could save the transform script along with the source files.<p>An ancient Premiere project file is unlikely to work in the future.  To re-render or edit those old videos again, I will need to run a cracked ancient Premiere in a VM.  That&#x27;s a poor way to work with archives.<p>With a good transform script format, we could make software that renders the transformation on the fly.  You could save a transform file with a URL to the source files.  To display the transform file, your browser will download the source files, apply the transformations, and show it in real-time.<p>We could also use software engineering process tools on transform scripts: source control, code reviews, integration tests, declarative artifact generation like Bazel, etc.  Do tools like this exist?')
