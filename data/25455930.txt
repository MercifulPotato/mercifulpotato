Rapid most of the time. Though I prefer increment and something like 5+5 is fun.<p>&gt;I am 1930 on lichess blitz (so probably ~1700 FIDE). If I guide the game into lines I know well, I can get both a positional and time advantage since my opponent has to think longer.<p>Early on with chess I memorized a couple openings. I knew all sidelines of Ruy Lopez, queens gambit, and sicilian. My problem was that when my memory fails me or right about the time I land outside this memorization. That&#x27;s when I fell apart.<p>I switched it up and I played only fischer random for quite some time, the goal was to have to figure it out. I became much more principled. So I obey opening principles 90% of the time but the goal is to be constantly adding pressure as opposed to &#x27;if he plays X I have to play Y&#x27;<p>This way I don&#x27;t have to remember anything.
