I.e. if someone attempts to send the same money to multiple different addresses and thus fool multiple people into believing they were paid it can use the blockchain to determine which attempt was the first and ignore all others.<p>Such attacks would happen within milliseconds typically, hence the need for a strong mechanism against them.<p>This is not needed for merely distributing downloads:<p>You already trust the author enough that you would run their code, so you can as well trust them that the number which they say is the latest version in fact is the latest one. That&#x27;s also because they have no incentive to fool you into using an older one, there&#x27;s no money involved.<p>What you&#x27;d want instead is Freenet, the goal of which is preventing censorship and providing anonymity:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freenet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freenet</a><p>It&#x27;s &quot;updatable subspace key&quot; (USK) address type is suitable here.')
