But I think this was bound to happen, just as it happens in pretty much any domain that is no longer a niche. Companies see a way to make a quick buck and move in.<p>However, I see this as something of a new development that didn&#x27;t actually remove what was before. You can still run Linux if you like, just as you could 10-20 years ago. You don&#x27;t have access to UHD Netflix, but... you never had. They didn&#x27;t take this away, it was never given in the first place.<p>Granted, the fact that Apple goes downhill is, I think, a net negative for the computing world. Ditto for the tracking embedded in windows 10.<p>Regarding Linux, there&#x27;s the UEFI &#x2F; SecureBoot situation, but even on &quot;enterprise&quot; HP hardware this can not only be disabled but I can actually load my own keys, so I don&#x27;t perceive this as a threat for the moment.<p>The deeper problem, to me, is that all this works because there are enough people who, for some reason, don&#x27;t care. Maybe they&#x27;re not educated enough &#x2F; don&#x27;t know better, maybe they actually want it, maybe they&#x27;re not aware. But the fact remains that there are many, many people who buy the iPhone<i>, who use windows 10, who use facebook, who buy echos, etc. So, aside from &quot;doing the right thing&quot;, what incentives do these companies have to stop doing what they do?<p>[</i>] I actually do own an iPhone but I treat it like an appliance. I install next to no apps, so I really don&#x27;t care about who can install what on it. I do care that my 4 yo phone got the latest major upgrade and it works as well as the day I brought it home.<p>However, I <i>am</i> pissed that LittleSnitch is unable to filter <i>all</i> traffic on my Big Sur Mac. But I basically no longer use the Mac, so I&#x27;m doing something about it.')
