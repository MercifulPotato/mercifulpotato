If a queue becomes too large then we get the idea that messages are not being consumed fast enough (in near-real-time). In this situation continuing to send more messages is just going to make the problem worse (although this is more like a circuit-breaker&#x2F;fail fast than back-pressure). Also it might be better from a business logic perspective to inform the user of the problem than to apply their input at a later time (eg. a game where user input is unlikely to be intended for anything but the very recent game state).')
