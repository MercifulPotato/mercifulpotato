I have no idea how long time anything should take to reheat in minutes and if I had to do it manually I&#x27;d be bound to mess it up. Requiring the user to know how long time some random food should take to reheat is BAD ui.<p>I just press start on our microwave and it heats it up to an edible temperature. Press the up or down arrows to change the goal temperature. There&#x27;s another button for defrost that goes slower.<p>It&#x27;s 15 years old so not exactly high technology.')
