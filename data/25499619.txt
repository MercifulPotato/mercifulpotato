It would be very interesting to hear some inside accounts about what went wrong there. I wouldn&#x27;t at all be surprised to learn that the mass-produced parts didn&#x27;t quite measure up to the prototypes, whether because of less consistent materials, part manufacturing defects, slightly off assembly, ....<p>To be fair to the designers, the height budget they were working with is an extremely hard target to hit for a part that gets as much physical abuse as a keyboard. I was pretty impressed with how passable the keyboard was for typing on, given the height constraint. (However, I was not impressed with the dropped actuations, double actuations, inconsistent key feel after a few months use, broken keycap that my 1-year-old keeps removing and hiding around the house, etc. Overall it ended up being a catastrophically bad design based on poor reliability.)<p>The biggest problem at company scale was that they couldn&#x27;t revert to something like their previous keyboard in a shorter time frame. The lesson is to avoid completely locking the whole rest of the system design around a brand new untested part for which there is no alternative. It would have been better to test the new keyboard design in a context like an external iPad keyboard where if it turned out to be a dud there would be an obvious path to an alternative, and customers wouldn&#x27;t be left with a broken $2000 machine.')
