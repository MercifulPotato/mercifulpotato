Item(by='partyboat1586', descendants=None, kids=[25131186], score=None, time=1605650798, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25130213, text='&gt;If you split up clauses, having things modify other things across long distances with other ideas in between, it can get complicated.<p>I found this version easier to read. I think because with the other one I have to remember the beginning part of &quot;It can get complicated&quot; and try to apply that to all the conditions that come up throughout the rest of the sentence. I prefer to build up the picture of &#x27;split clauses&#x27;, &#x27;long distance modifications&#x27; etc and then classify this as complicated afterwards rather than start with the classification.')
