My misadventures have been documented really well by the Waybackmachine in archive.org<p>Here is an example -- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20001017145942&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nepalnet.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20001017145942&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nepaln...</a><p>This was a travel and hotel booking website we made using Perl starting 1998.<p>Then there was a Indic text editor tool, based on character map image exchange, that didn&#x27;t go anywhere. As I was building the editor, so was Unicode becoming more common.<p>After that was rating system for anything using Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient. I specifically used it for hotels and universities.<p>Again Wayback machine reminds me that they existed -- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20130513055430&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prjoshi.com.np&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20130513055430&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prjosh...</a><p>In between there were tools for early learners, used goods exchange and even a product demo system where people could give incremental feedback on specific aspects of the product.<p>After 22 years, I have realized that most projects failed because I was more into the programming aspect of them. Once the products were done programmatically upto a level in which I was satisfied I failed to follow through with marketing or even creating basic awareness.<p>With that discovered self-realization I started doing things low tech, meaning requiring very less programming work from the start of 2020. This included making videos on youtube and making what I call a Visual encyclopedia website, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viewpedia.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viewpedia.org</a><p>Now I realize that marketing or awareness creation part is equally hard. I have been trying to get my site ranked on Google and Bing for last few months and haven&#x27;t gotten anywhere. Youtube videos, the highest count is 500 views.<p>I hope to document my projects in last 22 years and my current learnings for marketing in articles that I hope to post to HN later.')
