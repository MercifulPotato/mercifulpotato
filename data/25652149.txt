These are good things to keep in mind:<p>- They are free to resign too.<p>- Their predicament is entirely the fault of the employer, not you.<p>- Employees are often willing to soldier on out of a sense of duty to their coworkers, which gives the employer no incentive to change. To the company, it&#x27;s a case of &quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&quot;.<p>A former employer of mine once had all developers working 60 hour weeks because &quot;this is what it takes to be competitive in the industry&quot;. The staff grumbled and complained, but it wasn&#x27;t until there was a mass exodus of senior developers that they suddenly discovered the value of happy employees. That company is actually quite a nice place to work now. Some executives are incapable of seeing the error of their ways without real consequences.')
