Item(by='eutropia', descendants=None, kids=[25692683, 25692508], score=None, time=1610147664, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691544, text='&quot;Pushing a narrative&quot; is a pretty hilarious way to put it when you also say &quot;the media, all governments, and tech companies&quot; were the ones doing it.<p>It implies a conspiracy to paint the picture differently than it was, which seems like an audaciously high bar of scrutiny to pass when it unfolded live.<p>Could it also be that everyone just reported what they saw?<p>And could it be that what everyone saw was the President of the US tell his fervent supporters to march to the Capitol and &quot;not be weak&quot;?  And that such supporters posted videos of themselves committing crimes in the name of a conspiracy theory which is been more thoroughly debunked than any in modern history?<p>I&#x27;m almost afraid to ask what the competing narrative (the one being covered up or bulldozed by the popular one being &#x27;pushed&#x27;) could be.')
