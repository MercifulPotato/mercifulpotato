He also accused Chinese lending institutions of having a “pawnshop” mentality of using collateral instead of advanced credit ratings and watchdogs of not knowing the difference between regulation and supervision.<p>And on new regulations in draft stage to cover the current gray areas <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;idUSKBN27I1WB" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;idUSKBN27I1WB</a>:<p>&gt; While it made no mention of Ant, the draft comes as regulators sharpen their focus on banks that heavily use micro-lenders or third-party technology platforms like Ant for underwriting consumer loans, amid fears of rising defaults and deteriorating asset quality in a pandemic-hit economy.<p>I derived much of my understanding of Ant not from reporting, but rather, from talking to local sources who are more familiar with the matter. I’m on mobile now so won’t expand on this complex topic... However, if you know the Chinese language you can find plenty of criticisms of Ant’s personal credit&#x2F;loan products (which, for instance, offer unsecured credit and loans to people with absolutely no income and&#x2F;or collaterals, like college students, and coupled with aggressive marketing from online marketplaces including Alibaba’s Tmall, lead to hopeless debt cycles); probably less about risky business loans.')
