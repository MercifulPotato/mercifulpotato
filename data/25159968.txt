It does make Asian representation less likely.<p>Trade with North and West Africa was purely maritime whereas to travel and trade across what is now Russia land travel was required, even if rivers made up most of the distance. This drastically slowed down travel time making it much more likely those Asian merchants would sell their goods on to an intermediary rather than travel all the way to Scandinavia and then on to Britain.<p>On another tack I suppose it also doesn&#x27;t really make sense for an Asian merchant like that to go on to Britain if they were in Scandinavia - I doubt they&#x27;d get better deals on goods or more demand for their goods. And they wouldn&#x27;t return that way. Whereas African merchants would happen upon Britain first and would stop on their way back if they actually did travel all the way to Scandinavia.')
