You can see uneven gaps in the door panels, in the console, in the floor. \nThere are many unfinished plastic pieces that seem to be cut rough and added like that to the car. \nEverything feels like it&#x27;s made out of cheap plastic. Not even remotely close to the finishes of a German sedan, and inferior to the finishes of an everyday American Sedan like the Chevy Cruise.<p>I&#x27;m sure that the car is structurally sound but it was mind boggling how cheap it felt. It was almost like the interior of super low-end model for emerging markets, but with a large touch screen in the middle.')
