But we needed a kitchen, so I decided to get some big box store pine, hinges, drawer slides etc to build some temporary cabinets. I didn&#x27;t know much and I made many mistakes, but the kitchen I built lasted us... 7 years, and is gone now mainly because we&#x27;re  renovating the whole house.<p>All the tools I had back then were a cordless drill, two hand saws, some chisels and a sander. You don&#x27;t need much and you should only buy new equipment if the project requires it. Also I did not &quot;design&quot; anything, just did some sketches on paper then improvised on the spot.<p>Woodworking instantly became my hobby and after watching some Youtube videos - including ALL of Paul Sellers videos - I made a decision to go the unplugged route.<p>If I were to start over I&#x27;d read a book about the basic principles of woodworking and joinery, especially how the wood behaves and how to apprloach it. I sort of got all of this by intuition, however an introductory book would be a better start. Also I should have mastered sharpening way earlier in my journey.')
