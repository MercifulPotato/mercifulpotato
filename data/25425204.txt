You would be able to bring a lawsuit against any police equipment that was used to violate civil rights. Thus if you get pulled for “driving while black”, you can sue the police cruiser for being involved in violating your rights.  If you were a protestor that was assaulted by police, you can sue and seize the personnel carriers, cruisers, riot gear that were involved in the civil rights violation.<p>I think one area this would help is the over militarization. The police acquired a lot of military equipment ostensibly for fighting terrorism. However, with that equipment sitting around, the temptation is to use it for normal police work. If they knew they were risking losing the equipment, they might be less likely to use it when it should not be used.')
