Of course it&#x27;s an utter nightmare with regards to privacy and I&#x27;d be very nervous regarding security and safety when I&#x27;d hand over the controls of my car to basically an android phone. Maybe I skimmed over it but I&#x27;d be interested in knowing which phones they use exactly.<p>So I applaud the engineering but it&#x27;s not a device I&#x27;d buy (and yes I do own and carry around a cell phone).')
