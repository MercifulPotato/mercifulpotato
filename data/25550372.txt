If anything, the top-down or isometric-ish view makes that part relatively straightforward.<p>The requirement for online multiplayer (while dealing with hundreds of units) is the bigger obstacle. Especially if they&#x27;re working with Unity. Pathfinding (in a way that lets large swarms of units move smoothly through narrow choke points) is a non-trivial problem, too.<p>Then there&#x27;s the design problems. How to get away from standard build orders, and how to make a game that&#x27;s more accessible than Starcraft but still allows high-level competitive play.')
