There are severely mentally ill people who literally believe they are in a war against technology devouring people&#x27;s jobs.  Most corporations aren&#x27;t telling people this because it is embarrassing.  There is a growing e-commerce company in NY that was partially taken over and the employees they hired believed that you had to be enslaved (yes, enslaved I&#x27;m not kidding) to people who do no believe in technology in order to participate in technology.  This is a real thing but not a single company is going to admit this is happening because they want everyone to believe they are perfect.<p>The way this works is that they use these departments to control the people in these companies and slow down innovation by creating unusual amounts of frustration and screwing with the advertising and public relations of companies to give technology and people in technology a bad image.')
