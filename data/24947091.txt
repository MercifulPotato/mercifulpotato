RPC makes broadcast easier than HTTP. Individual RPC requests have (much) less overhead than HTTP requests, which is very helpful when tight coupling is acceptable.<p>Trying to run, say, MMO gaming servers over HTTP is an exercise in always paying double for everything you want to do. (Also, trying to run a FPS gaming server over TCP instead of UDP is equally not the right choice!)')
