I couldn&#x27;t quite put my finger on it, but the site felt a bit &quot;meh&quot; to me even though I like the concept.  I like the simple design, but if there were ever a case to be made for a floating header that functions like a menu bar, those categories is it, right?<p>I skimmed a couple product categories that I&#x27;ve looked at recently, mainly gaming keyboards.  The information felt a bit mediocre, but I also thought it did a pretty good job of picking out decent value products.  I can see the value in it as a short list of products to look into, but there&#x27;s not enough info for me to make a choice without leaving the site.')
