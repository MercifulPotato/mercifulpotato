There&#x27;s also plenty of libraries which do this for you, like libuv (but integrating such big libs is often not trivial).<p>Same for string handling&#x2F;processing, there are specialized libraries out there which do a specific job better than the rather generic standard library functions (this is also true for the C++ stdlib), one just has to find those libraries.<p>PS: I don&#x27;t think that a &quot;batteries included&quot; standard library (like python has) would even make sense for C, such a library would need to be opinionated by definition, better to keep (too many) opinions out of the standard, as this road just leads to another C++ ;)')
