We need to <i>de-engineer</i> it - rebalance it in favour of nutritional quality, and away from prioritising yield mindlessly.<p>We already have an obesity crisis. We know that our over-reliance on carbs and demonising of fat is contributing to it, or outright fueling it. We know that our food is poor in vitamins, so basically all urban dwellers must take vitamin supplements.<p>Part of why our Western diets are so calorie-rich and nutrient-poor (while being allergenic for many people) is because we&#x27;ve mindlessly pursued food yield, rather than food yield balanced with nutrition. Most food items are processed or contain processed ingredients, or junk ingredients that bulk up the volume&#x2F;substitute for more expensive ones. A lot of people are catching up to that and trying to compensate, but it&#x27;s a nearly-vertical uphill struggle while you&#x27;re not well off, because good food tends to be more expensive.<p>We need to stop that. We need to bring back affordable, healthy food for the masses.')
