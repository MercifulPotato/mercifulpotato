Don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t take the job. I don&#x27;t like getting my feelings hurt either. I also don&#x27;t like:<p>- The communist Chinese poisoning me with a bioweapon<p>- Burning alive in a nationwide wave of arson across a hundred cities<p>- Rioters beating me to death because I took a wrong turn<p>- Corrupt federal police hitting me with military intelligence weapons made in the aftermath of the twin towers blowing up<p>- Dying in prison just because I&#x27;m not part of the club, whether or not if what I do is moral or lawful, makes everyone wealthy, or is just fun.<p>I fault no one for fighting back. Why take damage just to stay still?  I fault no one for ambition and personal gain. Blue jays squawk and throw stones because they know what cats do to them. And it&#x27;s really rich for Berkeley to say this. Burn down the city and beat people to death in the street. The next morning, write about what a good person they are. Completely forget about the people they&#x27;ve killed. It&#x27;s an old racket and doesn&#x27;t work. You die bitter. Pulitzer did the same exact thing.')
