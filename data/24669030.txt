Anyway that&#x27;s fine if you really need that precision. I just useMemo at the &#x27;hotspots&#x27; and that is enough. Remember also that if vdom diffing doesn&#x27;t pick up a change, nothing is flushed out to the DOM, so whether an object is created or long-life doesn&#x27;t matter in this sense.')
