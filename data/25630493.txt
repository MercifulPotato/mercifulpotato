We have over 60,000 of these messages each day, we have over 2 million subscribers, and so you cannot proceed with this kind of a case against us.&#x27;&#x27;<p>The court said, ``No, no, no, no, you are different; you are different than CompuServe because you are a family-friendly network. You advertise yourself as such. You employ screening and blocking software that keeps obscenity off of your network. You have people who are hired to exercise an emergency delete function to keep that kind of material away from your subscribers. You don&#x27;t permit nudity on your \nsystem. You have content guidelines. You, therefore, are going to face higher, stricker liability because you tried to exercise some control over offensive material.&#x27;&#x27;<p>Mr. Chairman, that is backward. We want to encourage people like Prodigy, like CompuServe, like America Online, like the new Microsoft network, to do everything possible for us, the customer, to help us \ncontrol, at the portals of our computer, at the front door of our house, what comes in and what our children see. This technology is very quickly becoming available, and in fact every one of us will be able to tailor what we see to our own tastes.&quot;<p>Note that the folks Rep. Cox was talking about, Compuserve, AOL, Prodigy and Microsoft were <i>the big boys</i> back then.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure where you get the idea that only the small players were the intended beneficiaries of section 230.<p>To be clear, I have no objection if you (and others) think there should be changes to section 230, then we should have a discussion about what changes should be made and why.<p>I just think we should deal in facts and data and not make unsupported assertions about, well, anything -- especially when it comes to proposed legislative changes.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Christopher_Cox" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Christopher_Cox</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;congressional-record&#x2F;1995&#x2F;08&#x2F;04&#x2F;house-section&#x2F;article&#x2F;H8460-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;congressional-record&#x2F;1995&#x2F;08&#x2F;04&#x2F;hou...</a>')
