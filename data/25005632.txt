You defer defer implementation and architecture completely to your team. Your job is to hire and build that team and set high-level company direction.<p>The more power you have over your co-implementors&#x27; careers -- and the more junior they are -- the less comfortable they are standing up to your architectural or technical decisions. This stifling of collaboration can cause you to make poor decisions you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise, and creates an uncomfortable dynamic.<p>This is why I don&#x27;t believe in TLM (&quot;tech lead manager&quot;) roles, also, fwiw.<p>Wanna code? Do it on your own time, Tobi! :)')
