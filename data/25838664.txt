What could go wrong?!<p>Aside from that, a TV license is £157 a year. Let&#x27;s say a TV lasts three years (which feels conservative, pretty sure I had my last TV for eight), you&#x27;d need to get the buyer to pay an extra £471 when they purchase their TV. How is front-loading such a payment in the interests of the viewer? Not to mention you don&#x27;t have to pay the fee if you&#x27;re only watching streaming services like Netflix.')
