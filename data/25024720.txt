If You Are Not a Conservative at 35 You Have No Brain<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quoteinvestigator.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;24&#x2F;heart-head&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quoteinvestigator.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;24&#x2F;heart-head&#x2F;</a><p>Note: I&#x27;m not conservative and I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with the quote. The point is not that the quote is correct, the point is someone (not me) thought it was the unthinking young person that thought alone liberal lines and the experienced wise person that thought along conservative lines.<p>Again, not agreeing, just pointing out some feel the opposite, that more experience and exposure to the world leads to more conservative thinking for some people.')
