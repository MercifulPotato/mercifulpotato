There were also some similar groups across slave and free states who were empowered in part to guard against &#x2F; control Native Americans.<p>These early slave patrols &#x2F; night watches then fairly organically became the &quot;police department&quot; when that concept became widespread in the mid-1800s. I don&#x27;t think it looks like said spread is really linked to emancipation, but rather (as with the creation of Peel&#x27;s Metropolitan Police in London in 1829) in response to increasing urbanization &#x2F; industrialization. Given that the industrial revolution also fairly-strongly caused the US civil war and thus emancipation, we could say it&#x27;s more a parallel trend than the implied causation.<p>The cities going &quot;well, we <i>have</i> a somewhat organized group of people whose job is to enforce some laws... why don&#x27;t we wedge them into this new trend and have them enforce <i>more</i> laws?&quot; gets us that link.<p>This summary seems reasonable, though I feel it elides the Peelite influence: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;law.jrank.org&#x2F;pages&#x2F;1640&#x2F;Police-History-Early-policing-in-colonial-America.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;law.jrank.org&#x2F;pages&#x2F;1640&#x2F;Police-History-Early-polici...</a>')
