I wonder if there is some kind of legal liability that could apply here?<p>Yes. Both civil liability (under the fairly recent exceptions relating sex trafficking to 230 protection) and criminal liability (section 230 has never applied to criminal liability) are possible, for the kinds of things claimed in the lawsuit.<p>That civil liability is possible is, of course, almost certainly a factor in why the lawsuit was filed; while you can file a lawsuit where there is no available liability, it tends to be a waste of effort.<p>Of course, one would also do well to take claims made in a lawsuit with some skepticism. If those didn&#x27;t often turn out to be untrue, we wouldn&#x27;t need courts nearly as much as we do.')
