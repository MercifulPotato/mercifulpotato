Obviously there are such things. But I do think it&#x27;s an open question to what extent we can compel our friends to keep things private. Of course if someone is really a &quot;friend&quot; you would expect them to keep confidences if requested... that&#x27;s part of the definition of &quot;friend&quot; in my mind.')
