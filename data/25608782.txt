Considering you&#x27;re spending 40 hours a week (1&#x2F;3 of all your weekday hours, and half your weekday waking hours) at your job, the creeping realization that you&#x27;re wasting your life and labor gets unbearable after a short while. It&#x27;s even more miserable when you have to pretend to your boss and coworkers that your job is Making A Real Difference (tm).<p>I think it&#x27;s best to just settle for a healthy medium between the outlooks of &quot;who cares as long as I&#x27;m paid&quot; vs. &quot;my job is my life and identity&quot;.<p>[0] Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber is a great book on the topic.')
