And sometimes it&#x27;s a better choice to drop into Java to provide a shim between the package you&#x27;re interacting with and Clojure to make the interop easier, or when performance matters.<p>Regarding hinting for defrecord fields and deftype&#x2F;reify, do you have references where this has been a problem for you? It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve run into, but that&#x27;s just my experience.<p>As for java.util.function interfaces, I just did this within the past couple of weeks, which worked for my use case:<p><pre><code>    defn ^java.util.function.Function as-function [f]\n      (reify java.util.function.Function\n        (apply [this arg] (f arg))))\n</code></pre>\nFor SAM conversions in general, there&#x27;s <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ajoberstar&#x2F;ike.cljj" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ajoberstar&#x2F;ike.cljj</a> . I haven&#x27;t used it myself, but perhaps the pattern used there would work in you.<p>It sounds like what you&#x27;ve worked on has been relatively performance sensitive, which can definitely a thing. So perhaps some of these interop suggestions won&#x27;t work for you.<p>Again, thanks for taking the time to be more explicit about what you&#x27;ve found frustrating.')
