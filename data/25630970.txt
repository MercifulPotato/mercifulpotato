SQL is the least vulnerable to this. Obviously if you leave SQL for e.g. Mongo, then you could not have picked a more bespoke and unique interface. Notionally SQL is standardized, but who migrates databases anyway.<p>Network latency is the real performance drag, not string parsing.<p>I think JSON support will improve, but SQLAlchemy for example is ok with a common JSON interface over mySQL and Postgres. I am sure this will resolve itself in time, its just a bit new for SQL.')
