But they are entangled, each photon considered separately is not in a well-defined state.<p>You can also prepare two photons in the same state, so the have the same polarization for some direction chosen at that time. But the measurements along other axis won&#x27;t be perfectly correlated (if they are correlated at all).<p>The red&#x2F;blue color example is too simple to be interesting.')
