Logging would (maybe) suffice for that.  It&#x27;s about getting cause and effect right when there&#x27;s more than one computer separated by a distance.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t want to keep a history of all the positions of a character in my game.<p>Sure - not in a single-player game.<p>But can you take the same approach in a multiplayer game?  Grab some players, give them different clocks and separate them 20-150ms apart from another, and have each of them tell the server what happened at the time it happened?  Things will diverge pretty quickly.<p>You end up reinventing the same old append-only log on the server.  That way, when client messages arrive at the server out-of-order, you still have the info necessary to rollback state and issue corrections to other clients.  When that&#x27;s all set up, you can then choose some horizon (200ms?) and garbage collect all events before that.  Or you can keep the events around and show replays and&#x2F;or calculate stats for achievements at the end of a match.')
