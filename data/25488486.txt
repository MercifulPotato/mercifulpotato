The problem isn&#x27;t that some strive for meritocracy, the problem is when people argue that they are meritocratic when they aren&#x27;t. It is pretty easy to argue that there is plenty of merit in hiring women, like adding diversity to teams has benefits and so on, I don&#x27;t see why you need to argue against the concept itself.<p>&gt; The concept of a meritocracy sounds nice on paper, but I think it ignores how humans work.<p>Not really, the concept is nice both on paper and in reality. The most successful companies in the world today are much more meritocratic than most organizations that preceded them, they produce great results using it, the concept works great. And I don&#x27;t see why you think it wouldn&#x27;t, we humans have two signals, merit and bias. Without merit we just go by our biases. The problems you describe doesn&#x27;t come from focusing too much on merit but too little on it.')
