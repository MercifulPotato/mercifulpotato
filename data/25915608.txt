Item(by='avianlyric', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611668277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25915249, text='&gt; It is entirely legal for a company to charge different prices in Germany and Greece, except if they&#x27;re a phone operator. How is that fair?<p>Except this isnâ€™t true. The EU mobile roaming rules have the concept of a home country. If you spend too much time outside of it then the operator is allowed to charge roaming costs. So it not really possible for a customer to take out a contract in Greece and then only use it in France.<p>The only exception to this rule exists for people living near borders. Where is quite likely they commute over that border, or their phone will randomly connect to towers on the other side of border.<p>Given the most of the EU is part of the Schengen Area, and living and working in different countries is not only common, but encouraged. It makes sense that EU enacts laws to prevent citizens from being economically punished for exercising their rights.')
