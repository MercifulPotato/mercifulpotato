I can control the autopilot, but it can also control me, especially by promoting desires for porn, weed, sugar, videogames etc; this quickly becomes impossible to ignore, and then the autopilot takes over completely. Since then I noticed that this wasn&#x27;t a creation of the drug, it&#x27;s there all the time, I just never thought about it, and thought it&#x27;s always just myself (mostly because I really did hate school, that wasn&#x27;t just an urge). My whole life was a fight between myself who wanted to make cool software, do my school work and be physically active, and the urges of my autopilot - and the autopilot mostly won, except for a few extremely stimulating cases. Now I can control myself, and the person other people see and interact with is me, not my autopilot; and it&#x27;s me enabling the autopilot when I need it, not the autopilot enabling intelligence when it needs it.')
