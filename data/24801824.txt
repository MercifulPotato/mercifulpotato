Compare desktop Word and those desperate and ugly attempts to reproduce it for browsers.<p>3. &quot;app users&quot; - you or me consuming modern applications, Slack, Skype, etc. That <i></i>must<i></i> be lightweight desktop apps, IMO. Sciter.JS (as does Sciter) is the best candidate for such cases.<p>Groups #2 and #3 are smaller but proportional to #1. As soon as #1 will grow as #2 and #3 will grow too.<p>So the need for desktop UI will definitely not go away in foreseeable future - only grow.
