Up to the root! \nThis means two things:\nYou can&#x27;t debug this mess as any method in the template or onchanges hook in the ancestors will be triggered and console.log() so the Devtools are flooded with unrelated changes.\nIf you call a store on the template the store debugger will be flooded too.<p>And all those calls affect performance dramatically which is pure unwanted nonsense.<p>This non Scoped reactivity might have usefulness for 0.1% of cases (or for 0%?) but even at best, it should be totally opt-in. \nBut the situation is worse, you cannot opt out. \nOr you can, with changedetection.onpush which disable any reactivity (you must manually trigger it in 2020, can you imagine?)<p>This nonsense made us stay on Vue and everybody in it&#x27;s right mind should avoid Angular until this fundamental issue is fixed.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@vyaron&#x2F;point-of-vue-part-2-facing-angular-e4e9ee65161d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@vyaron&#x2F;point-of-vue-part-2-facing-angula...</a><p>Unrelated: the second huge limitation of angular is that it has no official devtool integration and that the community devtool is mostly unmaintained and doesn&#x27;t work on angular &gt; 9')
