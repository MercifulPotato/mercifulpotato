I&#x27;ve been a fitbit user for a few years. I&#x27;ve contemplated hard between an Apple Watch and Fitbit. I decided to stay with the Fitbit for a few reasons:<p>* Longer Battery Life<p>* Sleep Tracking<p>* Smaller device on wrist with the Charge 4 vs Apple Watch.<p>Can people suggest alternatives to Fitbit? My favorite feature is the sleep tracking (but who knows how accurate it is). Does Garmin or Apple have comparable features to Fitbit, especially with sleep and battery life?')
