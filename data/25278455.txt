Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606928609, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25277752, text='&gt; Am I being cynical in thinking there are probably plenty of enterprise suppliers out there providing similar creepy &quot;user insights&quot; information to dodgy managers, but just aren&#x27;t in the spotlight like Microsoft?<p>I would be highly surprised if there weren&#x27;t.  However, it&#x27;d far worse if Microsoft provided such features, because that would mean there&#x27;d be much less friction for an enterprise to adopt them (since pretty much all of then already license Office).  At least with those other suppliers, a company would have to have decided it wanted worker surveillance and seek it out, rather than getting it out-of-the-box by default.')
