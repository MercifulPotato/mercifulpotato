I had a similar idea, but for spending instead of investing. It seems likely that, post Citizens United, directing your spending towards companies that are supporting politicians that you also support is probably more effective than making small donations or writing letters. When you buy a product, the political activity of the company that sells it are part of what you are paying for. If companies are going to play politics then let&#x27;s have some transparency and let them compete partly on that basis.')
