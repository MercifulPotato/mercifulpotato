I know that Hyundai at least has demonstrated a true level 4 system in Korea.  It hasn&#x27;t made its way to any production vehicles yet, but I suspect that&#x27;s partially because the regulatory regime is still up in the air.  Part of the real risk with releasing something right now is that you&#x27;ll end up with a system that is not compliant with whatever the regulations eventually require.')
