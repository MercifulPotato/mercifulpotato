For one thing I find interacting with bc to not be so interactive as gnu calc—you have to type one line at a time and it is hard to see intermediate results or make modifications. For a second thing, I don’t think bc includes:<p>- differentiation<p>- symbolic&#x2F;numeric integration<p>- equation solving&#x2F;manipulation<p>- unit conversion<p>- graphing<p>- vectors and matrices<p>- functional array operations like map&#x2F;reduce<p>- statistical operations<p>- a detailed manual<p>Personally my main use of bc is:<p><pre><code>  ... | paste -s -d+ | bc</code></pre>')
