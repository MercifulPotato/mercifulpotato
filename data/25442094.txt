Well, let me try to fix them then, and ask some questions.<p>In Clojure, how do you usually approach problems that are shaped in an object-oriented way? In object-oriented languages, this usually includes either some sort of method calls (and therefore mutable state) or message passing (which usually involves actors, like Erlang processes). Passing all state around as function arguments is one way, but it becomes somewhat tedious as state grows large.')
