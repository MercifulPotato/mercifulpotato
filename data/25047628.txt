What <i>exactly</i> do you mean by &quot;security&quot;? You&#x27;re concerned zoom servers are recording your video - on purpose or because theyre compromised? thats too much data to dragnet (even for the NSA), so you think the servers are recording and theyre targeting your meeting specifically? the threat model here is very small and very specific.<p>who are the ultrasecret sensitive information folks buying the newest, shiniest, unvetted tool for use where infosec matters? i bought zoom because the ui has simple, big, colorful buttons for my unskilled users where g2m et al. are just a little too complicated.<p>if i needed an SLA specifying encryption models because of &quot;security&quot;, I&#x27;d have a contract I could sue over. yes, zoom was wrong. they did a wrong thing, but the outcry against them has just been disproportionate.')
