If someone reports a bug that affects only them (e.g. edge cases) then that ticket benefits only them. The -vast majority- of tickets files on large projects are for the benefit of single users. The tertiary benefit to users that might come along later with that same edge case or edge feature need are moot. It doesn&#x27;t benefit the maintainers. If someone reports a bug and leaves out critical info because &quot;they know better&quot; than the maintainers, and that causes additional work for the maintainers that creates burden. Maintainers are already giving their time freely to produce something for users to use freely. The scales are always tipped in maintainers&#x27; favor.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;liberamanifesto.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;liberamanifesto.com&#x2F;</a><p>We owe you nothing.\nYou owe us nothing.<p>Play by the rules set in the project, fork, or don&#x27;t play.
