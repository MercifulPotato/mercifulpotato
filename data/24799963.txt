If people acted as if they were held to the higher standard, we would not need licenses. People (especially when they&#x27;re not acting alone, e.g. corporations) act in their monetary interest, most of the time. Hence, stick to the license that&#x27;s least restrictive that still ticks all the boxes you feel are important. If you feel attribution is important, choose a license that makes it legally binding.')
