Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607820826, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25402865, text='&gt; but I had a history professor who said that when a company made an argument that it had equal protection under the law from the 15th Amendment,<p>That seems...implausible:<p>Section 1<p>The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.<p>Section 2<p>The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.<p>&gt; they managed to hire the only living writer of the amendment as their lawyer. Given that it was written under secrecy, his word was all anyone had to go on.<p>The Court (and courts in general) don&#x27;t tend to look to <i>authorial</i> intent as the original intent that matters, but <i>legislative</i> intent (the intent of the body&#x2F;(-ies) adopting the provision.) So, the word of the “only living author” wouldn’t be the only thing anyone had to go on; they’d have the records of legislative debates. And an authorial position (even if well-documwnted) that wasn&#x27;t actively considered in legislative debate would probably not be considered to have much weight.')
