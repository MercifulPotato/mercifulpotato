It was a real boom time for the West...California in particular.  A lot of folks came from back East or the Midwest...<p>Not many tried to explicitly recreate their East Coast&#x2F;Midwest life in the West...in fact they made a point of trying to create a unique California “lifestyle”.  That new California lifestyle was <i>the</i> hot US cultural trend from, say, 1960 to 1990.<p>May happen again, but in the reverse direction, Californians creating a new Montanan&#x2F;Utahn&#x2F;Ohioan&#x2F;etc. culture by engaging in the roots of their new not-California and building something better, bringing their creativity while leaving behind their California.  Of course, if they try merely to graft a California-lite onto their new rootstock...well, they could be an important new source of protein for the locals...<p>I don’t think this creative dynamic could happen in other “tech hub cities”, because, frankly, there is no essential culture there to work with.  Austin may be nice, but it seems more parasite on Texas culture than symbiont.<p>(Which has been a slam against California over the years too.  What’s the difference between California and yogurt?  Yogurt has an active living culture.  More people outside of California believe that than you might think.  It’s been 30 years since CA has been a dominant nationwide cultural thing, Hollywood as almost a metaculture notwithstanding.  Silicon Valley?  That’s getting onto 25 years old now...that’s senescent in US cultural terms.)')
