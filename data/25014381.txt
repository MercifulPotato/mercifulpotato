People are willing to trade freedom for stability.<p>&gt; When people spend time together, they become more similar. Is that &quot;horizontal totalitarianism&quot;? Or is that just a very obvious observation of human behavior?<p>There is a difference here. I think the article isn&#x27;t so much talking about totalitarianism, as much as censorship. It used to be top-down, but now it&#x27;s either peer censorship, or even bottom-up.<p>In your example, I don&#x27;t think that is truly the case. People manage to fit their own rituals better. They don&#x27;t become the same.')
