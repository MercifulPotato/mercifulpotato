There are a few big companies capable of providing apple with enough manpower&#x2F;production capabilities. And even though it&#x27;s a low skill work, workers still has to be trained, and more importantly have to have high work discipline(which could be considered a part of a skill set) Most countries don&#x27;t have that at least in large enough numbers for companies like apple(and its contractors) to use.')
