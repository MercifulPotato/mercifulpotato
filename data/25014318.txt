But a lot of the time it&#x27;s just where the founders are from. In the 80s when the home-computer revolution was kicking off, a lot of the kids&#x2F;young adults that got good at making games and made a fortune off the nascent industry then went off to set up development studios.  They were often from the shires, because it was a wealthy&#x2F;middle-class pursuit, or was at least easier to get going when the family support machine was backing you.<p>The low pay thing I think is a misnomer, I worked in games from 1995-2005, and although yeah the pay wasn&#x27;t great compared to other industries, it wasn&#x27;t bad, and I worked full-time for three different London based studios and contracted for another two.  It was certainly enough to live in London (at least then before the property market went crazy)')
