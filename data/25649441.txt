My tank range was 160 - 180 miles, and I was doing around 115 for the round trip. In theory I could alternate fuel stops between morning and evening, stopping on every third trip, but I never like to run the tank that low in case - for whatever reason - something happens that means I need more fuel.<p>The net result was between 2h40 and 3h05m of travel time every single day. And that&#x27;s with filtering through traffic. If I weren&#x27;t doing that you could probably add another 30 - 45 minutes on to both trips, which would mean spending up to 4h35m commuting. That&#x27;s on top of 8 hours in the office.<p>Riding a motorcycle is much more tiring than driving a car. Partly this is because it <i>is</i> more physical, and you are of course exposed to the elements so your body will be burning more energy to stay warm even wearing proper winter gear, but also because you have to concentrate a lot more and be a lot more aware of your surroundings because you&#x27;re so much more vulnerable.<p>That amounts to an 11 hour day where you&#x27;re &quot;on&quot; - i.e., basically working. You&#x27;re probably more &quot;on&quot; during the commute than you are in the office because, believe me, you cannot afford for your attention to waver for a second. This in itself suggests the commute is too damn dangerous and you probably shouldn&#x27;t be doing it. A couple of minor incidents, and one that was more serious where somebody drove into the side of me, brought this starkly into focus, and also contributed to me moving on.')
