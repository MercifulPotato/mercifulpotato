The analogy that comes to mind is the idea of letting kids play outside. People try to justify today&#x27;s overprotective culture by bringing up things like cars (they existed back in the 70s too) or candy-wielding abductors (really?) or whatever, but the overall theme is this pervasive idea that we can&#x27;t handle scary things (be it the outdoors or media megacorps) and therefore we should be artificially shielded from them.<p>Instead, wouldn&#x27;t it be better to teach critical thinking in school such that when you&#x27;re faced with the realities of the world, you have at least some preparation? The idea of imparting civic responsibility principles from a young age seems to work well for example with classroom cleaning duties in Japan.')
