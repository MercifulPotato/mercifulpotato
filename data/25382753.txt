SIGv4 signing itself is request-level, and is incredibly simple with a tiny pre-authorization TCB. IAM policy is a full and expressive authorization language with a rich grammar. They&#x27;re then paired with an ecosystem of features like CloudTrail and last-use-of-credential that give meaningful controls that avoid trade-offs between availability and security.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be AWS, but I do think that solutions in this space really have to be operational services, and not just technologies or standards. It has to be someone&#x27;s full time job to look at this stuff and make sure it&#x27;s working and secure, and that&#x27;s just very hard to match. If I quit my job tomorrow and was building a startup, I&#x27;d use AWS API Gateway&#x27;s SIGv4 and policy support and leave it at that.')
