Then you must support the results of the election, whether you like the election results, or not.<p>THAT is the basis of Democracy: the peaceful transfer of power based on the votes. If you do not respect the votes, then Democracy falls apart. You literally cannot have a Democracy without votes (while we had a Democracy through WW2 despite the &quot;Office of Censorship&quot;).<p>We have a very, very large group of people who are now using free speech to destroy our trust in the election. We are now left with a decision: Free Speech vs Election.<p>My gut says that elections are more important than free speech. Historically, we have had times without any free speech what-so-ever (WWII &#x2F; Office of Censorship). Its a luxury we can do without in times of crisis.<p>We cannot afford to lose faith in the election process. Period.')
