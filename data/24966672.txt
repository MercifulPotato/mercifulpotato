Interactive Fiction is not always text-only, adding images is a popular enhancement. Extending that to 3D seems a logical consequence to me.<p>Is this more like a proof-of-concept, or do you plan to enhance and develop it more?<p>There are a few things I could think of. For example, more IF-related features (concept of passages&#x2F;knots, tracking which got visited, etc. Think twine, ink and alike). Or a way of handle the transition between user-handled camera and a scripted zoom&#x2F;movement taking over. Just what I got in mind trying out the demo :)')
