It works great when your systems are homogenous. It rapidly becomes a pain when you need to make customizations that only apply in a particular network, or on hosts with a particular OS version, etc.<p>My bashrc has basically just become a monstrosity to control what files get sourced for this particular host. Answering why a particular env car is set to what it is ends with me trying to trace what files get loaded, what they set, and the order they get loaded in.<p>Much more painful than separating the concerns and having Ansible template out my bashrc.')
