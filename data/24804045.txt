It seemed more like &quot;hmm, you&#x27;re not dying, go home&quot; was the general rule.  And not unreasonable, either; unless you need to be in a hospital, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be.  Never felt like we were getting pushed out, but they definitely encouraged us to go home.  Excellent insurance, so that wasn&#x27;t the issue, and there were several multi-day stays, including post-surgery.  Pre-covid (but within the last three years), so space wasn&#x27;t an issue either.  [And the person&#x27;s doing great now.  +1 modern medicine.]')
