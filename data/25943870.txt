Item(by='tylerhou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611849535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25943757, text='&gt; pretending the judge&#x2F;bureaucrat can peer into somebody&#x27;s mind<p>But historical cases don&#x27;t peer into people&#x27;s minds. They look at evidence, such as texts in chat rooms that show clear intent to manipulate. See the Libor scandal chats [1], where one trader wrote &quot;its just amazing how libor fixing can make you that much money&quot; and &quot;its a cartel now in london.&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s unlikely that the SEC will be able to successfully prosecute WSB traders, though, due to lack of evidence. It&#x27;s also probably not even worth their time.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buzzfeednews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;matthewzeitlin&#x2F;why-banks-want-to-get-their-traders-out-of-chatrooms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buzzfeednews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;matthewzeitlin&#x2F;why-bank...</a>')
