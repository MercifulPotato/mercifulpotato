Steve Ballmer didn&#x27;t write Microsoft Office. But they owned stock in a company that employed people that did (and all the various other labor that goes into building software products). Why did they make so much more money from it than the people who were more directly involved?<p>This dynamic is reducible. If Person A starts a software company, Person B, C and D build the product, and then Person A gets $10,000 while Person B, C and D each get $1, something is off there.<p>The capitalist defense of this is more or less, &quot;B&#x2F;C&#x2F;D agreed to those terms&quot;, but this ignores the context. If every B&#x2F;C&#x2F;D wanted to be As, there would be no B&#x2F;C&#x2F;Ds to build things. And it&#x27;s not always possible to choose to be an A--it usually requires a fair amount of privilege to start a business. But nonetheless, their work is <i>equally important</i>, and even if it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s certainly not the case that A&#x27;s work is 100,000x more important.<p>We need to recognize this kind of bonkers concentration of wealth is a huge problem, and fix it with profit sharing and taxation.')
