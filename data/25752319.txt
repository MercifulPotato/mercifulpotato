I am saying I would like to see evidence they were intending to do violence. It is possible most were being hyperbolic with their words.<p>Do you believe that BLM rioters who chanted at politicians and cops and had various weapons intended to murder them? BLM rioters broke through barricades and smashed windows as well. Some BLM rioters killed multiple cops as well.<p>If I saw a BLM riot break into a building with politicians I would hold the same view I hold with these people. They may do violence, but we don&#x27;t know for sure.<p>When people broke into the Wisconsin capital years ago over act 10 I didn&#x27;t assume they were going to murder people.<p>I don&#x27;t like to assume entire groups are going to do violence. When some individuals do violence in a group I don&#x27;t assume the entire group wants to do violence.')
