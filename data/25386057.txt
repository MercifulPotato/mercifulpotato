There are benefits for the disabled that some technically qualify for that are meant for those worse off than they are.<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t know how to draw the line - that is why it is possible to abuse the system: some who need the benefits may seem better off than others who don&#x27;t need them. This same argument prevents some who really should take benefits from taking them! All I can say is be careful and please don&#x27;t cheat the system - everyone who cheats is evidence that we need to tighten the rules even at the expense of not giving benefits to those who need them.<p>It is a hard problem.')
