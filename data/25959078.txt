That might be the case according to the Popular Narrative (that the Hedge Funds phoned them and said &quot;shut it down&quot;), but reality is that they couldn&#x27;t front the deposits for the customer&#x27;s trades, due to the insane volatility. In that case it&#x27;s less violating their customers&#x27; trust and more having a product that couldn&#x27;t handle extreme circumstances well. They are a <i>discount</i> brokerage after all, some compromises had to be made.')
