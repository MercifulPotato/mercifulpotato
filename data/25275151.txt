I think that kind of programming forces you to focus on what&#x27;s <i>actually true</i> about computers, and about programming concepts.  As programmers, when we talk about design patterns and best practices, a lot of what we talk about actually comes down to opinion, philosophy and aesthetics.<p>When you are really forced to get the right bits to the right place as quickly as possible, it focuses the problem of software design in a very specific way.  It&#x27;s interesting to observe that for Carmak, that appears to be in the direction of removing as much abstraction as possible.')
