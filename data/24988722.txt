For example, the separate problems of finding empty shelves and restocking those are much more complex if you try to solve them together. Do it with a ground-moving robot, competing for floor space with humans and it may be hopeless.<p>But if you aim for just finding empty shelves you can probably do so with a few high-res ceiling mounted cameras and algorithms. This also allows for incremental enhancements. If the system initially detects missed inventory at 80% of the shelves it is a good start (there are now fewer shelves for humans to check).<p>Incremental improvement usually beats trying to solve complex problems in one go.
