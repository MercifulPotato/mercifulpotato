You bought their product so presumably maybe you&#x27;re interested in what their products are? That you&#x27;re one of their customers their trying to cater to (when you&#x27;re actually not)?<p>&gt;Does this really need to be said? Of course it is! Why would I state someone else&#x27;s opinion?<p>Great we established it&#x27;s an opinion, and not a fact!<p>&gt;This is a straw man argument. I already mentioned that I preferred Apple under Steve Jobs to Apple under Tim Cook. They&#x27;re not the same. Jobs said, &quot;the computer is the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with. It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.&quot; For Tim Cook, though, computers seem more like a bike lock for the mind.<p>It&#x27;s not a straw-man unless you want to have a separate argument over what Steve said &#x2F; didn&#x27;t say.<p>&gt;Again, I&#x27;m comparing Macs today to Macs literally only 10 years ago. Those products existed. It&#x27;s historical revisionism to claim that current Apple is exactly the same as past Apple. It&#x27;s not. Not at all.<p>So what if they&#x27;re different today? They&#x27;ve outlined what their products &amp; terms are today just as they had in the past. How are they being a jerk when you can freely agree to or walk away from them?')
