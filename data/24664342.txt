Great job destroying Portuguese industry at the behest of UK capital though.<p>As Joan Robinson put it<p><i>“but in real life Portugal was dependent on British naval support, and it was for this reason that she was obliged to accept conditions of trade which wiped out her production of textiles and inhibited industrial development so as to\nmake her more dependent than ever”. She further notes that: “What Ricardo was really concerned about was to abolish the Corn Laws so as to lower the real cost of wage goods and\nraise the rate of profit... When accumulation is brought into the story, it is evident that Portugal is not going to benefit from free trade. Investment in expanding manufactures leads to technical advance, learning by doing, specialisation of industries and accelerating accumulation, while investment in wine runs up a blind alley into stagnation”</i><p><i>“Ricardo took the example of trade between England and Portugal. He argued that England, by allowing\nimports of wine from Portugal, would expand the production and export of cloth to pay for it. Ricardo, of course, was thinking of the English side of the exchange but the analysis is perfectly symmetrical; it implies that Portugal will gain from specialising on wine and importing cloth. In reality, the imposition of free trade on Portugal killed off a promising textile industry and left her with a slow-growing export market for wine, while for England, exports of cotton cloth led to accumulation, mechanisation and the whole spiralling growth of industrial revolution”</i><p>As I&#x27;ve always said, this sort of economics is linear regression in service of the ruling class rather than anything resembling science.')
