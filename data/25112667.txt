And of course it&#x27;s hard to even make a living when all your competitors are allowed &quot;differentiation&quot; and you&#x27;re not.<p>Which is what happens when a government sails in and starts granting monopolies.<p>Copyright is an artificial monopoly. Patents are artificial monopolies. There are a bunch of weird people out there who call themselves &quot;libertarians&quot;, but somehow favor the government creating such restrictions on people&#x27;s liberty. They&#x27;re confused and should be ignored.<p>Trade secrets are perhaps slightly less artificial, but they are clearly destructive in an enormous number of ways.<p>If, as lawgiver, one were to totally eliminate all imaginary property and outlaw commercial secrets, one could arrange a society where a lot of people could make a very nice living. It might be harder to become a tycoon. Which would be all to the good.')
