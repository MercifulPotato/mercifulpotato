Item(by='Ace17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602315585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24737053, text='&gt; You should never compare two floating-point numbers for equality.<p>... when their values come from an arithmetic computation.<p>Here&#x27;s a counter example: Quake&#x27;s collision code makes extensive use of `if(trace.fraction == 1.0f)`, which basically means &quot;could the whole move be done without colliding?&quot;. This makes sense, because `fraction` is explicitly initialized to `1.0f`, and gets potentially overwritten with lower values in case the ray intersects colliders.<p>This could also make sense when dealing with clamped values, e.g:<p>```\nconst float ratio = clamp(some_computation, 0.0f, 1.0f);\nif (ratio == 0.0)\n{\n  &#x2F;&#x2F; ...\n}\n```<p>In both cases, the zero or one being compared to isn&#x27;t a result of an arithmetic computation ; it comes from an assignment with a known constant (e.g inside `clamp`).')
