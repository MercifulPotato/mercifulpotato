In reality, only a few companies could compare. (Not everyone can work at a startup, etc.)<p>- That tech companies are wildly different in terms of culture and philosophy. In my experience, tech industry culture is hyper normalized and you see the same problems everywhere.<p>So it&#x27;s not like a selfish &quot;have their cake and eat it too&quot;, but more like they actually can&#x27;t gain what they want by moving, so the remaining path is change from the inside.')
