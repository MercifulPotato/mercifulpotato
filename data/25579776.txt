I see that more as simply a reality which is always constrained by resources.<p>I agree it is a cliche, but it is a very observable one over the last decades. \nRegarding resource constrains. I argue it&#x27;s just the other way around. If we were resource constrained we would not build huge administrative bodies to check that the scientists are actually doing what they are supposed to. \nTake an example people here are likely more familiar with: in startups there are generally much less administrative processes, those come only in once companies get to a certain scale. Startups can simply not afford to pay lots of people to administer their &quot;progress&quot;.<p>&gt; Humanity can not afford to spend all their energy and resources for scientific research. We have many things we need for survival, and some for entertainment, etc. Obviously we do want to invest some amount of resources and human energy into research - but the question is how much is enough and which fields should we invest more or less ?<p>Considering the amount of energy we spend on things that are not needed and are actively hurting the planet and our survival, I would say we can&#x27;t afford not to spend more on science.<p>&gt; I claim that these questions are fundamentally unknowable &#x2F; unsolvable. So we guess blindly (and very occasionally with a tiny bit of very myopic foresight), and mostly end up unwittingly relying on various historical accidents.<p>&gt; This is a very, very difficult question for humanity overall, and we&#x27;re never going to get &quot;right&quot; amount of funding or &quot;right&quot; structure as there&#x27;s no right answer. &quot;MBAs&quot; do and can hinder progress unnecessarily, but not always - they do exist for a reason and they represent society&#x27;s collective attempt to avoid waste or runaway spending.<p>MBAs are quite ill equipped for this tasks though. That&#x27;s the my main gripe they try to apply a process that has problems even on the scale of a business (the problem of focusing on short term gains instead of long term sustainability) and try to apply it to society at large, even though there is no evidence that it would work.')
