I think it has to do with subjective taste as well as what kind of app you&#x27;re building (ie. how much HTML are you templating out?)<p>Edit: I will add that I have some experience working on apps that do both ways - React mixing HTML and CSS into the JS code (JSX) and Vue with its strange template language which extends HTML for somewhat the opposite approach. I don&#x27;t really like either one that much. I still actually prefer the string templating library era as cleaner but not without its flaws.')
