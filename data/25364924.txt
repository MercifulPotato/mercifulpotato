It might. It might not. Right now there&#x27;s no real evidence that VR will <i>actually</i> become a big deal, and Facebook could argue that this is a niche offering that can&#x27;t be anti-competitive because there&#x27;s no real market yet.<p>2) The feasibility of VR technology independent of major vendors. There&#x27;s a strong possibility that without a huge R&amp;D budget VR will never overcome the hurdles that might keep it out of the mainstream. Facebook could argue that removing Oculus would doom VR to failure in the market.<p>3) The Sirus&#x2F;XM merger removed 100% of satellite radio competition (there&#x27;s only one vendor left after the merger), but both Sirius and XM successfully argued that the market isn&#x27;t big enough to support multiple vendors. Facebook could argue a similar case, that for the health of the VR market there should be <i>fewer</i> competitors.<p>I&#x27;m not a lawyer so I don&#x27;t know if any of those would be winning arguments, but based on previous anti-trust cases I&#x27;ve followed that would be the strategy I would expect. And it might be why the FTC didn&#x27;t go down that path.')
