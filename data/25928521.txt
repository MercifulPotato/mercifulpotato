If a stock isn&#x27;t issuing dividends, it&#x27;s either profiting and storing large amounts of cash or losing money. If there&#x27;s profiting and storing cash (the Apple model), you purchase the stock on the thoughts that the board can be replaced with a board that will take that cash and dividend it out. If the company is just losing money, you purchase stocks on the thought that they can turn it around become profitable for either dividends or for stashing cash.')
