Budgets are a convenient objection but not actually important.  Like you observe there are people who would gladly spend <i>more</i> money to make the problem <i>worse</i>.<p>What you unfortunately need to realize is that there are far too many people who need to know that there are others suffering <i>&quot;because they deserve it&quot;</i>.<p>You will never understand the debate around homelessness[0] as long as you assume everyone agrees it should be solved or that people just haven&#x27;t discovered the right way to allocate resources.<p>[0]: You can swap out homelessness with a few other political hotbutton issues as well.  I&#x27;ll leave those to your imagination.')
