On Pornhub, it&#x27;s all available to the public rather than in private messages, which makes the problem a lot more evident and visible, and arguably more damaging (e.g. if you were raped as a child, you potentially may find it more damaging if one million people see the video compared to ten people).<p>If Facebook hadn&#x27;t taken appropriate measures, Visa and Mastercard certainly <i>should</i> have investigated them if they were in a position to.<p>Another issue here is Pornhub is directly profiting off of the CSAM and non-consensual porn by plastering ads all over the page displaying the content and encouraging premium account registrations. Facebook isn&#x27;t directly monetizing that content.<p>Of course I know Pornhub isn&#x27;t doing this deliberately, but 1) they&#x27;re not financially incentivized to take things down too aggressively (due to loss of ad revenue and premium registrations), 2) even if they were incentivized to do it, the problem is too big and too evasive to tackle with just blacklisting, manual reporting, and a small team of moderators. The only workable solution at this point is a whitelist, which sensibly seems to be the approach they&#x27;re now taking.')
