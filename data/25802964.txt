E.g. clearly manufacturing capacity is some limit, but if you started a program to build even more new factories now, how fast would that be, and how much does that depend on the money available? Same for distribution.<p>I have no clue what the answers to those questions are, but depending on how large&#x2F;small the possible adjustments are, helping to fix other urgent issues that arose out of the current situation might very well be worthwhile or more viable to do.')
