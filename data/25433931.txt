Then they call the police and tell them you stole their car. I would call that a little disingenuous...and not fraud.\nThey helped him book his seat and buy the one next to him using the ticket unlimited miles they sold him and their booking service. I think I would at least call AA a party to the fraud they were accusing him of. So, if they were defrauding themselves as agents of themselves, shouldn&#x27;t they be mad at themselves. If you call BestBuy and order a widget and the BestBuy employee gives you 10% off a $100 item, should they be able to sue you for stealing $10?')
