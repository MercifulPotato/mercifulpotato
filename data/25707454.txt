Many people reading this will think “but these cynics are mistaken. Those who invested in bitcoin have seen massive returns”.<p>Not so. The paper value of bitcoin is up, but unlike a stock, you don’t own anything.  You need someone to actually buy the bitcoin in order to gain value.<p>Whereas as long as a company has profits, there’s a floor on things. The shares will have real use value so the price can’t fall too low.<p>Meaning buy bitcoin at $200, own now at $41,000. Only has value if you sell. If everyone tries to sell and no one is buying there’s no floor, none.<p>Whereas bought Apple at $20, own at $132. The price could fall, but there’s some kind of floor below which it could not fall based on current profits and dividends, and that floor is almost certainly above $32.')
