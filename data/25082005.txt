They could pour over every detail captured on camera taking note of locations, any products seen the background of your shots, the types of clothes you and your family&#x2F;friends wear, who wears or doesn&#x27;t wear makeup, etc) then they can use facial recognition to identify everyone in your pictures (photographed intentionally or not) and determine their relationships to you and each other then update everyone&#x27;s dossiers with whatever new information they managed to gather from your pics.<p>Or they could just jerk off to your nudes.
