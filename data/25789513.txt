Item(by='jacobolus', descendants=None, kids=[25790458, 25790499], score=None, time=1610709395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25789400, text='&gt; <i>Why does one riot at the Capitol deserve such condemnation when dozens of nights of rioting in Portland are waved away?</i><p>For one thing, the MAGA insurrectionists&#x27; stated goal was to kill members of Congress and the Vice President, and overthrow the government. Their ranks included a bunch of highly trained ex-military and law enforcement people who were apparently prepared and equipped to carry out that plan.<p>The demonstrators in Portland had the goal of telling cops to stop murdering people, and then later also wanted federal authorities to leave their city alone. Instead of letting them tire themselves out shouting in the street and then go home, the cops shot rubber bullets and tear gas, violently rushed at them, and beat people up night after night.<p>Note again that a bunch of the most violent incidents in Portland were directly perpetrated or instigated by white supremacists.<p>Seeing how poorly their statements matched the situation, it seems likely that federal authorities directing officers in Portland (and perhaps the local cops as well) <i>wanted</i> to provoke an unending stream of violent clashes for the benefit of TV cameras.<p>&gt; <i>Why not blame the DC cops for not “diffusing the energy”?</i><p>The capitol police, DC police, and national guard (under the direction of the DoD) deserve a ton of criticism. Their leadership screwed up about as badly as can be imagined, and the result was a complete shitshow. A lot more people could have easily been killed or grievously injured. Hopefully a full investigation will get to the bottom of it.<p>If DC protestors had just wanted to march around outside the barricades shouting and waving signs, that would have been just fine (and that&#x27;s all many of them did; those folks are unlikely to face charges). They could have stayed all day and night shouting themselves hoarse if they wanted. There would have been no need for police to use force in such a situation.')
