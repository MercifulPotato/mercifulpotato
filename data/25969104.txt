It&#x27;s easier for me to imagine a club being or non throwing stick&#x2F;spear being a game changer than rock throwing.<p>There are living traditions of so many kinds of human hunting methods. Rock throwing is not in the top 1000. OTOH, there are many hunting&#x2F;fishing methods that require nothing but bare hands and knowhow. If throwing rocks is such a breakthrough, why does no one do it anymore? Meanwhile, the few hunting methods and&#x2F;or tools that chimps use <i>are</i> represented in extant human hunting behaviour.<p>Also fighting. I&#x27;ve never seen involved in a paleohuman duel but if I had to, I think I&#x27;d choose the hitting stick over a rock. The david vs goliath approach doesn&#x27;t leave much room for error... and David had a sling.<p>I mean, the technical parts details of this theory <i>is</i>  interesting. Explosive movement abilities developing in the Erectus lineage. I just think the rock throwing seems off.')
