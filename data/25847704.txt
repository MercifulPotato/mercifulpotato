I deny there are <i>concentration</i> camps with the intention to murder people. Big difference.<p>I don&#x27;t say all camps are good. I don&#x27;t say nobody is being ill-treated. I&#x27;m sure there are incidents. But I deny that it&#x27;s a <i>mass concentration camp with the intention of murdering 2 million people</i>. Big difference.<p>All the interviews with people who say there are concentration camps, are with Uyghur separatists who have ties with extremist members. The very same people that just a few years ago the US would have labeled as terrorists. Don&#x27;t you think their answers would be biased? Look at the track record of North Korean dissidents, it&#x27;s been proven again and again that they have an incentive to lie and that not everything they say can be 100% trusted. What makes you think Uyghur dissidents are different?<p>Heck, for years I&#x27;ve heard stories about Falun Gong being painted as wholly-innocent people who are wrongly prosecuted by the CCP. But now, the New York Times exposed them as spreaders of pro-Trump misinformation. This is another example that shows that people who are in conflict with the CCP, are not automatically trustworthy or honest people. Yes maybe the CCP&#x27;s treatment on them is wrong, but two things can be true at the same time: CCP could be wrong to treat them like that, AND they could be untrustworthy or have a evil agenda of their own.<p>Even this point is discussed extensively in the video.<p>If you&#x27;re gonna argue whether China&#x27;s anti-terrorism efforts use too broad sweeps and is heavy-handed, fine, I don&#x27;t disagree with that. What I do disagree with, is that it&#x27;s a genocide&#x2F;enslavement of 2+ M people or whatever the made-up count is today.<p>You mentioned Taiwan. Whatever I spoke about here on HN about Taiwan is neither in support of the mainland position on Taiwan, nor against it. I was just providing perspective so that people gain a more accurate understanding of the issue. Perhaps you think CCP is &quot;the enemy&quot; and their perspective is automatically invalid. No I don&#x27;t agree with that.<p>I don&#x27;t consider myself pro-CCP. You&#x27;re not gonna find me in agreement with the great firewall policy for example. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I need to be necessarily against everything they say&#x2F;do either. \nNo, people who don&#x27;t oppose CCP at every turn, are not pro-CCP. As I said: I&#x27;m pushing back against people who are against China for the wrong reasons.')
