Not the Like&#x2F;Click&#x2F;View counts.<p>Obama did the connect thing. He was certified &quot;with it&quot;. He was called the first Social Media President for taking advantage of it in ways the &quot;dinosaurs&quot; didn&#x27;t. He collected record number of Likes. But what was the point of all that? Did the Likes&#x2F;Clicks&#x2F;Views translate to  outcomes?<p>Those that didn&#x27;t think he was &quot;with it&quot; just went and looked for some one else. And propped them up with the same tools. Trump gets record Likes. Trump gets power. But where are the outcomes?<p>Both sides think they are brilliant for hitting new social media records. And then get trapped into an arms race of Like counting. Not outcome counting.<p>Both sides have proved Likes do not equal Outcomes for Society. But they sure do reward the Individual and some small coterie around the Individual.<p>The reward system has to change. Count Outcomes to Society. Not outcomes of the person.')
