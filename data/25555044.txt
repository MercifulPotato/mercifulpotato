It happens sometimes with species like tiger sharks (which are pretty widely regarding as being angry at the world), but most other encounters are usually mistaken identity or curiosity.<p>I like to think of it as ratios; the number of shark &quot;attacks&quot; <i>far</i> outweighs the number of people killed by sharks. Great whites have been known to be like &quot;yum, a seal!&quot;, take a bite, go &quot;what the hell is this??&quot; and then let the person go. Except because they&#x27;re an enormous shark, the person still has a huge chunk taken out of them in the process, not because the shark was actively hunting a person and was fought off.<p>Whales, on the other hand, have more ways to do this; they seem more willing to brush and nudge and otherwise interact with things before taking a chomp, which can be seen in some of their non-person-in-the-water interactions with boats and people on piers.')
