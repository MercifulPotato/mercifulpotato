I&#x27;m not including the chance for severe side effects, hospitalization here (I don&#x27;t know a good data source for those that is age-specific).<p>That&#x27;s a lot lower than the risk for older people, but it&#x27;s still a somewhat high absolute risk.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d get vaccinated. The risk even for young people is still there, and it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> low.<p>The source for these numbers is the following paper, specifically figure 2a:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-020-2918-0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-020-2918-0</a>')
