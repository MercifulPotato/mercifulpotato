There&#x27;s every reason to believe that the people installed to run Alibaba &#x2F; Ant after Jack gets sent off to &quot;re-education camp&quot; will be unable to propel it to further heights. Stagnation is likely as good as it&#x27;ll get and there&#x27;s every reason to believe it&#x27;ll be run into the ground eventually.<p>I see Jack Ma as a sort of Chinese Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. Shooting yourself in the foot like this seems to be incredibly stupid. American government officials would never consider even hobbling someone like Jeff Bezos... that could be partially out of fear (he could literally just liquidate a portion of his wealth and have someone else elected in your place through campaign contribution), but its more because of the incredible value someone like a Bezos, Musk, or Ma brings to your economy.')
