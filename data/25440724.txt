I find it to be very good. I tend to tweak my desktop a bit, I don&#x27;t run with the straight defaults. The software for searching and installing packages seemed to not work well last time I checked but that was years ago- I tend to do all that with the dnf cli.<p>I have not moved to Wayland yet and it is not the default so that will be a big shift at some point. I also avoid nvidia. I used to use their cards but just got tired of the constant hassle.<p>I don&#x27;t really try to push anyone towards Fedora or KDE. There are a lot of great choices when it comes to Linux but for me it&#x27;s always been good. I run MacOS on my MBP for the few applications I can&#x27;t run on Linux but that list has become really short. At this point I think Webex is the last thing that&#x27;s holding me there. My next laptop may be a Lenovo.')
