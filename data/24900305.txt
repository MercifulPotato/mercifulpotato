Transfers are very slow, especially if you want full resolution, and it&#x27;s always frustrating to just connect my phone to the camera--the apps are slow and clunky, setting up the adhoc network is flaky, and often times even after connecting it&#x27;ll suddenly just disconnect for no reason. The XE3 supposedly supports a persistent, bluetooth connection that&#x27;ll auto connect and auto transfer photos, but every time I&#x27;ve tried to set that up, it sends like the first two photos along and then doesn&#x27;t work anymore.<p>I&#x27;ve moved to just using an SD card reader.')
