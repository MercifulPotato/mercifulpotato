I saw an advanced video I and couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing.<p>These advanced gymnasts stood on a box, bent down with straight legs touching their toes, grabbed onto barbell with light weights, keeping their legs straight, slowly stood up keeping the barbell close to their body.<p>The explanation was the back is designed to do that and if you don&#x27;t it you lose the ability.<p>That&#x27;s not something I would ever attempt, but goes to show if you know what you&#x27;re doing and have the necessary foundation in strength and flexibility, round back is not only OK but necessary to keep range of motion and strength. Again, I would never attempt that myself.')
