The only meaningful differences are that the iPad can undock from the keyboard, the iPad supports Pencil and the OS is different.<p>OSX running on iPad with the same processor as the Air would actually be great, considering the magic keyboard is so good.<p>If I could instantly change between OS&#x27;s I wouldn&#x27;t need to lug around both devices. Better still, if the OS could be designed to support both modes in an integrated way, it would knock everything else out of the water even more.')
