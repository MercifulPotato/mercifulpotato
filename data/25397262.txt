Such censorship reduces spammers&#x27; freedom to speak in order to preserve that of the other participants. Spamming closely resembles a tragedy of the commons (overuse of the system to solicit sales) and anti-spam an associated regulatory action.<p>The problem with such an analogy is that spam is inherently off topic - approximately none of the other participants actually want to see it. That&#x27;s fundamentally different from this case. Whether you deem it misinformation or political speech, many of the participants clearly do want to see it.
