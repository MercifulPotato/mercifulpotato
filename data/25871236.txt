There is a mild psychological effect that forces people below minimum wage to find a new job. However, if the economy doesn&#x27;t have enough jobs above minimum wage, then it does nothing.<p>If the government offered jobs at the minimum wage there would be an effective price floor for wages. Better yet, if those government workers spend their income they can drive economic demand which ends up creating jobs above minimum wage. Eventually every job pays more than minimum wage and nobody is dependent on the jobs guarantee.')
