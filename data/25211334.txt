Item(by='0xWTF', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606323483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209064, text='&gt; The time for the market to react for a product with the complexity of a mac is decades.<p>This makes me think of the 2 slit experiment as applied to basketballs. There is a period of time that decisions need to be properly considered, presumably simple decisions need little time, and complex decisions need more time. There is also a period of time that is required to make a decision, and a level at which the decision is made.<p>There are lowly software engineers making decisions like this, some of which may not even percolate to daily stand-up, yet will require the Supreme Court to unpack 10 years from now. And no one really knows.<p>It&#x27;s like trying to pass a basketball through a slit. Yes, there&#x27;s a theoretical interference pattern, and you can calculate it, but you can&#x27;t do the experiment because you can&#x27;t pass the basketball through a slit that small (in the case of basketballs, if I recall, the largest slit is angstroms if not smaller).<p>So in software development, You&#x27;ve got huge uncertainty in the societal implications of some decisions about what information you&#x27;re going to pass over the network, but you can&#x27;t even get them all through daily stand-up, let alone to Congress or the Supreme Court. Somewhere along the way, some of them end up on Hacker News with people mis-quoting Eric Hoffer, “Every great security decision starts off as a movement, turns into a business, and ends up as a racket.”')
