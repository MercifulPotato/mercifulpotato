However, in order to provide a guise to my employer that I&#x27;ll &quot;return&quot; when we have an office I plan to keep a P.O. box in NYC.  Hence, it&#x27;ll hurt to keep giving payroll tax &#x2F; income tax to NYC, however I&#x27;ll have basically zero living expenses.<p>Since there&#x27;s likely no way we&#x27;ll have an office until August I&#x27;m planning on just finding a new job in TX when they ask if I&#x27;m coming back.')
