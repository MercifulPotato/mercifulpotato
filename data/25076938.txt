What can anyone else take from it?<p>True molecular assembly might never happen, but it&#x27;s not clear that advances in &#x27;room at the bottom&#x27; ideas of nanotech wouldn&#x27;t have happened, had there been a larger research effort. Advances in using  silicon lithographic techniques to produce machines on a micro-scale are pretty amazing - I&#x27;m fascinated by the idea of the MIT micro gas turbine (apparently the scaling is such that an aircraft skin covered in micro-turbines could be comparably efficient to macro-scale engines) but I don&#x27;t think the research has progressed since the early 2000s.')
