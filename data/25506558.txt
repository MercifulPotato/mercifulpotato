There should be restrictions on how much DMCA abuse is tolerated before sticking them into “timeout”. And if a legitimate need arises while in timeout, too bad so sad.<p>The court case is particularly disgusting. He should win and get treble his court fees, though dunno if Canada has that.<p>But having said that, I feel for schools as they have to do SOMETHING and there is just nothing good. Can’t have just the honor system cuz that’s worked so well. But if these systems are over the top (and they are) what do you do?<p>I’m glad I’m not having to take tests using this kind of software. I tend to look around at other things when deep thinking. Even if no music on, I use N&#x2F;C headphones to keep sounds out. Hell, if it’s particular hard problem I might start sub vocalizing as I work it through. All habits that would get me dinged left and right.')
