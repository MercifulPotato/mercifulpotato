At first I was just playing around and had the Winamp plugin configured to stream to the server running on the same PC.  I think I used one of those dynamic DNS services to keep it accessible to the outside world but I may have just updated it when my WAN IP occasionally changed (oh...those sweet, naive days of not worrying when I opened those kinds of ports).  A 128kbps mp3 stream to a few people at a time was workable.<p>Eventually a guy I knew from some web forum offered to host the server for me.  He worked for a small-ish ISP and hosting company and said they&#x27;d never notice or care if I bounced it off their server because even 10 or 20 people streaming 128kbps at once wouldn&#x27;t even show up on their radar.  Sure enough, I had no issues and never even had anyone come complaining that I was streaming my personal selection of music without paying any licensing fees.<p>That said, I eventually got a little worried and began to research the cost of licensing.  I didn&#x27;t like the idea of getting sued and this was still the time of RIAA lawsuits against p2p services.  Unfortunately, it was also the time when they lobbied hard to increase the cost of legit licensing for streaming.  Whereas radio only pays for a blanket license, streamers had to be able to track per-song-per-listener numbers and also pay royalties, unlike terrestrial radio.<p>That sorta put the kibosh on my streaming radio ambitions.  A nerdy personal experiment was one thing, but I was starting to get enough listeners that I wasn&#x27;t eager to end up on the wrong end of a nasty letter from someone&#x27;s legal department.  The cost of going &quot;legit&quot; had become too high and honestly, I didn&#x27;t have enough original&#x2F;local&#x2F;whatever content to offer anything unique.  At best it was like having &quot;free&quot; XM radio back when that was all the rage before Youtube and Spotify made such things irrelevant.')
