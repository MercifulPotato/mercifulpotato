If the range of values is large, you could xor everything together as a O(1) space check for likely equality. Result is nonzero -&gt; sets definitely aren’t equal; result is zero -&gt; sets are probably equal, but you’ll need to check again some other way to make sure.<p>Of course this is absurd if you’re dealing with anything that already fits in ram, but it’s still neat to think about.')
