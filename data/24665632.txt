You will <i>comfortably</i> find yourself spending most of your career in the top 2 quintiles, if not the top quintile altogether (~$100,000 salary puts you in the top quintile).<p>If you&#x27;re below median and would like to attend, you&#x27;re going to receive FAFSA, Pell Grants, on top of university-specific discriminatory pricing that favors the poor.<p>There&#x27;s no reason one should pay out-of-state tuition outside their own State unless it&#x27;s at a &quot;top-tier engineering school&quot;, in which case the point is basically moot.')
