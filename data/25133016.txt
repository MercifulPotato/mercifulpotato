Not to say there’s a bunch of hidden talent there, but in the last couple years there has been a long string of good, high level people who got huge offers from FAANG and walked away. Oracle doesn’t even try to compete, and couldn’t. In most cases that person is also replaced by an offshore, sub-par employee with no money to hire a real replacement.')
