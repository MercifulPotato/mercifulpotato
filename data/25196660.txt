I figured I remembered at least something from undergrad.<p>Now I&#x27;m also curious, if the 400,000 cores are arranged in this 12x7 grid configuration (as seen in the article photo), does that have any relation to the sequence &#x2F; ordering of the simulation cells run on the chip?   For example, if you have an x &amp; y simulation space, do the corresponding ranges of the GPUs on the chip physically tend to map to the coordinates of the physical simulation cells (logic being that if you want simulation cells nearby each other to access results of neighboring cells efficiently, put them on neighboring GPUs)?<p>I guess that then leads to the question of how you handle the 3rd dimension, but I suppose that&#x27;s kind of just another slice in the other axis when you have to iterate over that.')
