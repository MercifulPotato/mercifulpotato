Item(by='rsp1984', descendants=None, kids=[24825125], score=None, time=1603103422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24821141, text='<i>When standing on Earth we experience a frame of reference that is accelerating upwards, causing objects in free-fall to move along parabolas, as seen in the accelerating frame of reference on the left.</i><p>I&#x27;m trying to understand what is meant by this. When I drop an item on the floor it goes there in a straight line, not a parabola. Same if I drop something from a helicopter. Obviously I&#x27;m missing something here. Can someone with more insight ELI5 this to me please?')
