Item(by='rektide', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602971242, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24811136, text='The $63 N2+ has the latest &quot;C&quot; rev of the S922X, which is a dual 2.4GHz A73 + 4x A53 and a &quot;MP6&quot; variety of bifrost GPU, a G51. The C4 has the newer S9005X3, which has 4x 2GHz A55 cores and a smaller G31 bifrost gpu. Those A55&#x27;s, while improved over the A53&#x27;s, are going to be sigificantly outmatched by the A73 cores on the N2+.<p>The H2+ has an Intel J4115 Atom celeron running 2.3GHz all-core, which I expect would trounce these ARM chips. It&#x27;s also $120.<p>Alas there hasn&#x27;t been any update to the excellent Exynos5422 that started HardKernel&#x27;s&#x2F;Odroid&#x27;s ascent as the XU4. Lovely 2GHz Cortex 4x A15 4x A7 with (2x! wow! thanks!) USB3 root hosts  and on-package RAM: really an amazing chip way ahead of it&#x27;s time.  These days it&#x27;s way outgunned but this chip really lead the way for SBCs with it&#x27;s bigger cores for the time, USB3, and on-package RAM (which we really need to see a comeback on).<p>Worth noting that the A73 on the N2&#x2F;N2+ and RPi4 are from ARM Artemis, which hails from 2016. Maybe some year SBC won&#x27;t all be running half decade old architectures, but at least we&#x27;re at the point where half a decade ago we were doing something right. ;) Still, one can&#x27;t help but imagine what a wonder it would be if an chip &amp; SBC were to launch with an ARM X1 chip available.')
