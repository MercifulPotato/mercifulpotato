You have to manually do a reverse proxy to whatever ip has been added in the private network. If you use K8s on AWS or GCP then your services automatically are accessible from outside world. There were attempts to make Nginx or similar LB working with virtual hosts but never seen that working in practice. It seems like developers keep it enterprisey so that people keep using and be locked in to the cloud.')
