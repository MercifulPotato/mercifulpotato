To me, recent polarization is a product of echoChamber * confirmationBias. e.g. (1) I subscribe to a trustworthy information outlet on $PLATFORM that reflects my beliefs. (2) I am recommended related untrusted content to increase my engagement with $PLATFORM. (3) I do not verify the related content because it reflects what I already believe. Rinse, cycle, repeat. Forcing voters to &quot;shut up&quot; means only allowing information to be shared by trustworthy sources. Over time I suspect that decreases polarization, at the expense of free speech.')
