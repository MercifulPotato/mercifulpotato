It appears to split pixels in two (check the special unicode ascii art character on line 142[0]), not in four as the screenshot would suggest. Is that special character half-width in certain terminals, or something?<p>EDIT: ahhh I got it! Before this commit, they printed out <i>two</i> spaces for a single pixel to closer resemble a square, because most terminal fonts are much taller than they&#x27;re wide. They replaced that by a single character that has one color in the top half and one color in the bottom half. Each of those halves, again, are almost square (HN doesn&#x27;t let me display the character here, it filters out certain unicode ranges)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trashhalo&#x2F;imgcat&#x2F;commit&#x2F;1f9ef8c888fa93e1eedc591115431bbd1897d944#diff-2873f79a86c0d8b3335cd7731b0ecf7dd4301eb19a82ef7a1cba7589b5252261R142" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trashhalo&#x2F;imgcat&#x2F;commit&#x2F;1f9ef8c888fa93e1e...</a>')
