I’ve never experienced this soft of behavior, nor have any of the many contacts I have in the space. I suspect this only occurs in litigious companies (Blizzard and Nintendo both immediately pop in my mind). Typically, hackers get scooped up by games companies and switch to anti-cheat, at least in my observations.<p>Edit: I do know it’s fairly common for companies to have “dox” on hackers. Actually making use of that information, like hiring a PI, is quite an escalation.')
