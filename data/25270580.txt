But part of the joy of gift giving is trying to figure out what they might enjoy. Just as part of the social game of gifting is to see what others think you might like. It&#x27;s a way of opening up to new experiences granted by people who know you. Ideally scaffolding perspectives and pleasures that appeal but were outside what you&#x27;d normally enjoy. An unread book can always be regifted, and it takes a sociopath to regard a gifted book as an insult.<p>Sure, if your goal is to maximise the utility of every moment algorithmically, this might seem wasteful. But you&#x27;re also very likely not any fun at all, and have few people to gift.')
