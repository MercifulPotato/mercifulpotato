The problem with bluetooth on windows is that it doesn&#x27;t work in duplex mode. You can&#x27;t use speaker and mic together on bluetooth. If you disable the module for mic(don&#x27;t remember what it&#x27;s called) then the speaker function works perfectly.<p>All the support posts that I read told me that bluetooth is the problem, not windows. But I call BS on that as the bluetooth duplexing works perfectly fine on Linux as well as macos.')
