You expect the town&#x27;s map to be accurate and to have all relevant streets listed - not having some of them missing.<p>This report suggests that we do have &#x27;streets&#x27; missing.  Researchers are now delving into finely nuanced areas of research at a level the equivalent of the house before the preliminaries are resolved - before all streets are found. Bypassing prerequisites always has serious consequences, things go wrong, errors occur, time is wasted, work is duplicated by others, etc. Even patients may die.<p>I&#x27;d suggest that no one yet knows how this will impact research that&#x27;s already been completed and which now has to be reinvestigated.')
