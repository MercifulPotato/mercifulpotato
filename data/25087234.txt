Right now, I&#x27;m wondering how everything will charged especially the compute-time because if it is low enough you&#x27;d be able to create easy and extremely scalable servers.<p>According to [0], it will - obviously - be charge for both compute-time and storage operations, and storage operations is expected to be around workers kv price which is very favourable. However, assuming that compute-time is charged at minimum at-or-higher than Workers Unbound, using workers for chat-rooms and other websocket stuff would be unfeasible. Workers Unbound costs $12.50 per MM-GB-sec - given that a server is 128 mb (the current fixed memory size) - the price per-worker-second would be at least $0.0000016 per connected-worker. It could get expensive very fast.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24616775" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24616775</a>')
