Looks very promising. Right now, I&#x27;m wondering how everything will be priced, especially, the compute-time. Because if the price is low, you would be able to replace a lot of complicated servers with easier and more scalable workers.<p>According to [0], they will - obviously - charge for both compute-time and storage operations, and with the price of storage operations expected to be around Workers KV. Assuming that compute-time is charged at minimum at-or-higher than Workers Unbound, using workers for chat-rooms and other WebSocket stuff would be unfeasible. Workers Unbound costs $12.50 per MM-GB-sec - given that the server is 128 MB (the current fixed memory size) - the price per-worker-second would be at least $0.0000016 per connected-worker. It could get expensive fast.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24616775" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24616775</a>')
