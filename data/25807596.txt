It is heavily overloaded with functionality, that any accidental touch results in an unwanted action.<p>Google Search on mobile browsers is horrible too. When having a typo in the search terms and trying to fix it, the search field moves to the top of the screen and it constantly happens that I click on the second or third entry in the list of suggested searches.<p>I also have issues with GBoard, which cause tons of typing errors. My last iPhone was an iPhone 3G and I recall it having a much better keyboard many years ago than Google currently has.<p>It&#x27;s almost as it was deliberate to artificially increase certain click KPI&#x27;s or force users to use the phone&#x27;s search bar or autocorrect function.<p>I believe, decision makers at Google are too far away from the products, and while managers might have developed good soft skills they massively lack practical knowledge. Google would do good hiring more engineers and less academics and managers.')
