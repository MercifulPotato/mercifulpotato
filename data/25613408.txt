Nice living and freedom?\nOr are you comparing apples and oranges and ignore the true costs?\nHow is the living for the lower classes? They get exploited, imprisoned, killed.\nNot for the communist party but for the market. Same same but different. And that are only their own people. \nWhat happens to other nations is worse.\nStrange enough that the victims of the US war on drugs and war on terror aren&#x27;t attributed to the US government although they are the consequences of government actions and lies.\nThe Shah in Iran, the killing of Kurds by Saddam, the lies about WMD in Iraq, the hundreds of thousands killed in the Iraq wars, Guantanamo, the emergence of ISIS, etc. And that&#x27;s only the middle east.\nIs that cognitive dissonance or ignorance?\nYou probably enjoy the benefits of the &quot;free world&quot;, that puts you in the top 10%, as it does me. I bet the top 10% of China are satisfied with the government too.\nDo you have as much sympathy for the Muslims in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Libya, etc as you do for the Uyghrs in China? Or are they just terrorists or savages for you? Do you even know any of the names of the corresponding ethnic groups in these countries, or are they uninteresting because they are just collateral damage of the good guys?\nAnd don&#x27;t start with whataboutism, the West has the longer history in this respect.')
