There are middle options.<p>For example, if I search for &quot;how to do a Subaru oil change&quot; it&#x27;s the perfect opportunity for the search engine to show me ads related to motor oil, Subarus, car maintenance videos, etc... If I opt in to sharing my location with the search engine they could also show me ads from local repair shops and car dealers.<p>Later on when I&#x27;m reading an article about dog training, I don&#x27;t want to see ads about fixing my car, show me ads related to dogs. Use the context of the page for targeting.')
