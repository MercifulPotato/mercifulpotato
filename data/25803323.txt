I&#x27;ve been with them for years and they simply won&#x27;t let you get off the phone until your problem is solved. I asked them last time how can they stay with me so long, even to the point of having me hang up so they could call me to test the fix, with &quot;calls per hour&quot; goals and other metrics. He laughed and told me there are no metrics except that the customer is happy at the end of the encounter. I really can&#x27;t recommend them enough.')
