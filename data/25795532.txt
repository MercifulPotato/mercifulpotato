This assumes that no one else has tried something different. There have been an massive number of attempts at something better. The result? They have all failed and developers continue to use the command line. You can write a ton of type of apps with visual tools but almost universally it&#x27;s sucked or only valuable for toy apps.<p>Examples that I have personal experience with:<p><pre><code>  * VB6\n  * Frontpage\n  * Delphi\n  * Access\n  * Excel\n  * Hell even storyboards in iOS based Dev\n  * Blueprints in Unreal Engine\n  * etc... \n\n</code></pre>\nThe same results, they work for non-programmers&#x2F;non-professional programmers. Almost without question we have seen that text based programming on a more or less standard *nix based OS or text based programming on a Windows OS are the two ways that are the most effective for engineering of software. The programmers complaining about the tooling we use? Sure we should continue to improve that tooling but that doesn&#x27;t mean scrapping the basic fundamentals. The installer should ask to modify the $PATH and then do that. There that solves that issue and doesn&#x27;t throw out 50+ years of science and research and experience on the best way to engineer software.')
