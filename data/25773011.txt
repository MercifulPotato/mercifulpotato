And we need to encourage more people to be good parents, rather than punishing the kids that happened to have one. To put it into perspective, genetically, we are still very much close to the stone age people. The only reason our lifestyle is much better than theirs is the knowledge and habits that get passed from generation to generation. If you eliminate that, we&#x27;re back into caves.<p>&gt;I didn&#x27;t choose to be visibly the same as those in power around me.<p>This can be nicely solved by decentralization. Have multiple different sources of power, let people live near those who they like and trade with others. But instead we are headed towards a dystopian central authority that gets to split people into first-class and second-class citizens.')
