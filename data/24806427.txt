I had a big project for my Ph.D. thesis that was good enough to get spun out into a startup. They didn&#x27;t even offer me a job.<p>They were under no obligation to, but it set my career back five years and I&#x27;m still angry about missing out on the obvious route from graduating to being really awesome at what I wanted to be really awesome at.<p>It&#x27;s not controversial that they did this, I was a junior employee and they didn&#x27;t have a ton of money. It still significantly damaged my career to be forced to start all over on a totally new thing despite literally inventing what they were doing without me.<p>Blame? There doesn&#x27;t have to be blame for that to suck for the little guy.')
