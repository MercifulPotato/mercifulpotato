They are mostly useless for coding, and they are totally useless for people like you. Find out if the application is a recruiter before you send anything in, as lots of them make posts that sound like they aren&#x27;t middle men. This is what stack overflow jobs has done so well... way better signal-to-noise than any other options.')
