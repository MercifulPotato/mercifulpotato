I find it quite valuable when you are seeking change in your career, or when you are in a leadership role. It does not seem as helpful if you are an individual contributor primarily focused on tech skills.<p>My recommendation is to ask them what they specialize in and how their background helps them deliver value in those areas. Coaching has no specific credentials or training, while at the same time there are a plethora of non-required training courses and certifications that claim to be the &quot;right&quot; way to become a coach. So you have everything from someone with no experience who just slapped up a website declaring themselves a coach, to people who have sincerely put years of effort into learning and practicing. They all have different approaches, backgrounds, and skills.<p>You&#x27;ll get the most out of it if you can identify what goals you want to achieve by working with a coach, and then consulting with them to see whether or not they are the right person to help you with those goals.')
