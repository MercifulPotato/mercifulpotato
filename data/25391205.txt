It looks like anxious-attachment styles are more likely to have it.<p>The thing to think about when you run into someone like this is that, for whatever reason, their victimhood has been the only reliable tool that has enabled them to receive positive attachment from others. It&#x27;s no wonder they get highly defensive about their victimhood being called into question.<p>These issues are probably intransigent (narcissism, for example, is one of the most immune-to-therapy personality disorders), but maybe one way around victimhood with a friend or family member is to notice positive things about them that don&#x27;t have anything to do with their victimhood (which is a tough task with some people).')
