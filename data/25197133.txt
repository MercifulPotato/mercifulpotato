Ironically, its most similar to genetic search, a method most commonly associated with machine learning.<p>If he used a standard optimzation method instead, convergence would be fast and the result much better. A similar problem, using splines to set force inputs for a robot that travels through a maze with barriers optimized using start and end position and force minimization, was a lab in a course I took last year.<p>The question becomes one of hyper parameter search, i.e. what kind of model&#x2F;function approximator is sufficient. Here the problem is easy enough that its easy to find a sufficient simple model. \nThe huge networks are nice for more general problems because they tend to work moderately well for everything... in the dataset.')
