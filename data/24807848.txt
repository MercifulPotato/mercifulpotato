Item(by='hilbert42', descendants=None, kids=[24807915], score=None, time=1602915960, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24806028, text='I truly hope my cynicism is unwarranted, that I&#x27;m wrong, and that your ideas are viable and would work because English is in an almighty mess (and I feel sorry for those who have to learn it as a second language).  However, I think you overestimate the ability for any agreement within any Anglophone country let alone even a partial agreement across any or all of them.<p>You come from a part of the world that is renowned for its sense and civility, whereas over the last 40 or so years the Anglophone countries have had internal squabbles over just about everything and anything to the extent that they have—in parts—become almost dysfunctional, democracy just isn&#x27;t working to the extent that it once did.  I say this as someone who was born in one, worked in three of them, and travelled to the others at various times over the years.<p>Take the US for instance:  the country has become so polarised over whether to wear facemasks in the COVID-19 epidemic—even after getting the best advice available to wear them—that one could be forgiven for thinking that insanity pills have been added to its water supplies.  It&#x27;s likely the very notion that someone or authority might make suggestions about changing the way people write or speak—even if it&#x27;s not aimed directly at specific individuals—would likely be taken as an affront by many.<p>Again, I&#x27;d love to be proved wrong as I&#x27;ve been saying for years that both pronunciation and spelling would be much easier if English were to introduce characters with accents&#x2F;diacriticals into those awkward, pesky words such as <i>&#x27;through&#x27;, &#x27;thorough&#x27;, &#x27;thought&#x27;</i> and so on.<p>In fact, I posted a rather long response on the neurosciencenews.com website asking if anyone knew of any research work that&#x27;s been carried out with bad spellers and those with demonstrated dyslexia with the aim of helping them to overcome their reading difficulties <i>&#x27;by training them with accented text (albeit suitably contrived for the purpose)&#x27;</i>. I went on to suggest <i>&#x27;that if it&#x27;s not so then this might be an avenue worthy of research&#x27;</i>.  It seems to me, that if any progress is to be made in cleaning up English then the lever could well come from a successful—or even partially successful—way of treating dyslexia (as the research would have demonstrated that the changes to the language were worthwhile and should be made).<p>Your point about multiple implementations is worthy of note.  If say changes were made to books specifically printed for dyslexic people then, over time, some or all of the changes could be more widely adopted.<p>My post hasn&#x27;t appeared on neurosciencenews.com yet, presumably as it&#x27;s a moderated site.  I&#x27;ll look at the post again and see if parts of it are suitable for posting here, if so then I&#x27;ll post them directly below in reply to this post.')
