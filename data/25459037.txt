Please prioritize TOTP &#x2F; U2F over social logins.<p>I might be off base here, but does anyone <i>really</i> leverage social logins anymore?  Seems like it&#x27;s the worst case scenario for auth in the case that a customer can no longer access the associated social account?  Basically in every case you&#x27;d have to provide an antiquated flow for them to &quot;re&quot; sign-up with an email.  I&#x27;m genuinely curious of the value add here, outside of using Sign In With Apple (since it parlays nicely into Apple Pay integrations).')
