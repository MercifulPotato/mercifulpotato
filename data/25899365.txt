Yes an interconnect inside a colo is going to be dirt cheap. But you can’t compare it to a huge backbone spanning continents that gives you reach across the world. Everyone should peer with everyone they can locally. Use the tier 1s for reach beyond what you can peer with. (This is not a defense of tier 1s and their peering policies or pricing.) Also this is why it’s always amused me when DC guys quote their raw switchport capacity with pride. Gotta multiply that by distance traveled to get a real comparable metric.')
