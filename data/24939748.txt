My last boss used to be a &quot;bon-vivant&quot; guy, meaning he would particularly enjoy a nice meal with the occasional wine to go with it (please note this is pretty common in France) [0].<p>Two years after joining his team, I had gained quite some weight. I figured I had to eat less somehow, but I never had the impression that I was overeating. I also didn&#x27;t want to skip to those meals with him. So I tried a few things:<p>* Pace myself with the wine. We would usually split a bottle among us. I actually enjoy wine, but don&#x27;t particularly enjoy being tipsy, especially when I have to work. So win-win-win (see below)<p>* If there was some fruit available have that instead of cake, or skip desert altogether. Drinking the wine slowly leaves me with &quot;something to do&quot; while the others have desert, so they don&#x27;t feel any pressure to hurry up.<p>* Go for more &quot;filling&quot; meals, meaning I looked for dishes with a bunch of vegetables. This would keep me full longer and I&#x27;d be less hungry in the evening, so also eating less. Another bonus is that I&#x27;d feel &#x2F;really&#x2F; full and actually not want desert.<p>What I&#x27;ve found is that even though  in the beginning the others would comment on my not having desert, they actually stopped having it themselves after a little while. The wine never actually went away, but we would occasionally only have a glass instead of a whole bottle.<p>The point is that I think people may feel there&#x27;s a certain expectation to have a lunch a certain way. And it may be true in the sense that &quot;it&#x27;s common, so people expect it&quot;. But if you don&#x27;t fully conform to it there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any issue, pretty much no one seems to care [1] (except maybe if you think that you <i>have</i> to adhere to the expectation).<p>All this being said, I do appreciate that for people who enjoy nice meals it can be difficult to choose those &quot;restrictions&quot;, especially when they&#x27;re right in front of you.<p>[0] There never was any pressure to go along, especially since he was the kind to actively avoid talking shop at lunch. But, as the team would go out with him, I would have missed out on getting to know them. I should note that I&#x27;m not particularly outgoing and rather focused on my job, so random chats during the day wasn&#x27;t exactly something I&#x27;d spontaneously do.')
