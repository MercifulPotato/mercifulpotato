A living wage means that a person is able to afford someplace relatively clean to live, feed themselves, afford heat in winter, etc.<p>That&#x27;s not middle class in traditional class terms (<i>petit bourgeois</i>) based on the manner of interaction with the capitalist economy, but it&#x27;s pretty much requires being “middle class” by the modern American broad income categories standards, where middle class is the middle income category.')
