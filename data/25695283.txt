Item(by='agiroth', descendants=None, kids=[25695684], score=None, time=1610157779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25694094, text='&gt; Free speech != guaranteed access to a company providing access to a big audience<p>If that&#x27;s what were happening you&#x27;d probably have a point, but it isn&#x27;t. &quot;Not deleting&quot; something is not the same as providing the audience, nor amplifying.<p>And, by the way, yes free speech does imply some obligations on the rest of us. Speech is not free if you are not free to exercise it; &quot;you&#x27;re free to talk in a prison cell&quot; type of thinking isn&#x27;t productive because it avoids the entire conversation.<p>Free speech has absolutely nothing to do with the government, by the way. Just because one country wrote down something called &quot;The 1st Amendment&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that somehow free speech only exists in that country and only when the government gives it to you. Free speech is a <i>natural</i> right that we all have and nobody has the right to silence anyone else: The 1st is simply one aspect of that.<p>The fact that society at large has lost that value cannot be viewed as a good thing and all the people in this thread defending the silencing of millions because they disagree with them politically is beyond shameful.')
