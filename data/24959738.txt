This means to <i>prevent</i> violence we have to maintain certain rules.<p>This <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> mean however, that we have to <i>wait</i> till bad actors in fact act violently, after e.g. having stated they want to abolish these rules, after threatening violence, after breaking present rules and stretching present conventions etc. This means that he didn&#x27;t want to suppress intolerant views (IF they can be hold in balance with rational arguments and public discourse) — instead he would plead to limit their effects on society (thus reducing potential future violence).<p>But it has been over a decade since I read Popper, so maybe you read something I didn&#x27;t.')
