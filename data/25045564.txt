That would put them back at square one</i><p>I don&#x27;t think Zoom has transgressed anywhere nearly this badly, but even if I did it doesn&#x27;t make sense to fine any company their entire value unless your goal is simply to destroy them. The company is only worth as much as it is because it is expected to continue as a company, and there would be no way for it to continue if it owed that much money to the government. Unless it was nationalized and run by the government, but I doubt you&#x27;re proposing that? Which means instead the company liquidates, and its liquidation value is far less than it&#x27;s value as a business.')
