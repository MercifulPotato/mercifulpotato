Item(by='morelisp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605616639, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121960, text='In other countries the role of the census is significantly lessened in modern times because basic population questions can be answered with &quot;instantaneous&quot; (in terms of when it was measured, if not when you get the results) data. The idea of waiting increments of 10 years to get basic counts of where people are living &#x2F; moving to &#x2F; from seems ridiculous. Deeper demographic information is usually handled via sampling, and does not require the nationwide (and especially this time, logistically taxing) mobilization of census-takers.<p>I do agree it would be difficult for the US to shift to such a system given the requirement is constitutional rather than merely a procedure of the civil service.')
