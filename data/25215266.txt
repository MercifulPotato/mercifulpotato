While I think that very short outages in line with SLAs must mot necessarily go public or have a post mortem, it is astonishing to see that some teams&#x2F;managers go through lengths to hide this at the „primus“ of hyperscalers.<p>I always wonder how many more products AWS pushes out the door versus cleaning up and improving what the have already. Cognito itself is such a half-baked mess...<p>But back to topic, when should we update status pages? On every incident? Or when SLAs are violated?')
