The underlying tech we use is p2p streams in libp2p (part of IPFS) which allow you to dial a public key. The actual IPs of the node are looked up in a DHT, and then the connection can be authenticated without a CA because you already have the public key (the stream itself is TLS1.3). Any file&#x2F;dir chunk in Peergos has an address which has 3 parts (owner public key, writer public key, and a random 32 byte label). Most data is content addressed, so no need for location based addressing at all. Modifications need to be routed to the owners storage server, which is done using the p2p stream method just described.')
