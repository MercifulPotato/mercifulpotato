Who cares? I as a user like this approach apple is taking.<p>The same issue comes up with google and some of their behavior around spammers &#x2F; scammers and others. I wish more of the anti-trust &#x2F; abusing their position things kept a focus on user benefit and impact. Letting match.com and ancestry.com do their own billing and subscription renewals on iOS sounds like a nightmare from hell (having dealt with ancestry billing before!)<p>I just had to submit for a refund for an annual subscription that was misleading on the app store (10 minutes after I purchased). The process could not be simpler and MUCH preferable to sitting on hold for hours (as I have with others).')
