We have tried these worlds in the past and they were not pretty.<p>Personally, I think a distinction is necessary. Companies IMO should absolutely obey the laws regardless of if they like them or not. It&#x27;s entirely unfair to blame them for obeying the law.<p>They (as well as individual people) are free to oppose those laws in an attempt to change them, however until they are changed, they should follow the laws or cease trading in the country who&#x27;s laws they disagree with. It&#x27;s entirely fair to blame them for not fighting stupid&#x2F;wrong&#x2F;harmful laws.<p>Allowing companies to choose which laws they are going to obey is never going to end well.')
