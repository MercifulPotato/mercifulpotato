My theory is that hiring is just really hard and it’s difficult to do that at scale.<p>I know people who are really good at interviewing. I think I myself can interview reasonably for people who have to work with me.  But that takes a lot of time and energy. So “specialists” from HR take over. But they don’t understand the real requirements for the job so they have to come up with a lot standardized indirect measures which don’t work well.')
