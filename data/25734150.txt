Allow sending messages without PoW to friends. If you want to send a message to a stranger, you still need to do PoW. That should not happen often, so PoW bar could be higher.<p>2. Mobile clients probably won&#x27;t be able to perform adequate PoW, so there should be an option to delegate PoW to some server for money. That&#x27;s not a protocol issue, though.<p>2.1. May be instead of paying for PoW, it would be better to send money directly to the receiver. That would complicate the protocol, though.')
