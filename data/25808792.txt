If you had agency tasked only with the defense of US infrastructure, it would have a clear mandate to patch zero days. Any &quot;offensive&quot; agency would have to deal with it doing this (just as such offensive agencies deal with zero days being patched by others).<p>It seems entirely reasonable to prioritize protecting US infrastructure over the possibility of a spy agency culling another nations&#x27; secret.')
