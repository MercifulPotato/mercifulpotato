We easily could have had higher magnitude of deaths but we chose to use preventive measures to not have that. Hence, it does not yield a conclusive comparison and deriving anything from that is void.<p>The times of comparison are also not valid, as we are now just at the beginning of the 2nd or 3rd wave and compare that to the sum of all WWII related deaths at the end of WWII.<p>This is the reason why people are cynical when they say the measures are too excessive because we wouldn&#x27;t see enough deaths. The only reason we don&#x27;t see excessive deaths is due to the measures.')
