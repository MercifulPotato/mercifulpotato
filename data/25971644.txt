The implication that &quot;applied math&quot; doesn&#x27;t involve math abilities is an interesting one, but doesn&#x27;t have bearing on reality.  There is a good bit of interesting, and quite challenging, applied mathematics going on out there.  Including large chunks of what we usually call &quot;computer science&quot;.<p>If I&#x27;m a hiring manager hiring for a position where quantitative skills matter, hiring someone who did applied math at a high level is absolutely something I would look for.')
