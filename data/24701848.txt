With my index finger on the touchpad, I can &quot;roll&quot; my finger a little in any direction (without actually sliding the finger), and the mouse moves a few pixels immediately.  It&#x27;s hard to get single-pixel accuracy, but 2-pixel accuracy is doable.  I also have no trouble tracing the Y Combinator logo.')
