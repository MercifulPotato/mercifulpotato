So I&#x27;m not sure how that affects your 3.5 billion time window. Prior to life appearing on Earth, the planet&#x27;s conditions may not have been suitable. It may be that life appeared as soon as possible once the conditions allowed for it and that life developed to become so good at taking up available resources needed for life that new instances of life could not come about.')
