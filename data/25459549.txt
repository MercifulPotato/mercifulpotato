If there are new ways to take away even more features from it, I&#x27;m not sure why they couldn&#x27;t be taken away from Bitcoin as well to improve its security.<p>Ethereum is a complementary to Bitcoin that&#x27;s a more complex and less secure, less scarce store of value, and it&#x27;s much more about running complex financial contracts.<p>As these protocols have strong network effects that give their value, it&#x27;s really hard to just ,,overtake&#x27;&#x27; them.')
