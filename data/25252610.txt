Modularity is a good thing to have for innovation. If we&#x27;re returning to &quot;fixed sets&quot;, that probably signals the exploratory period is dying.<p>Anyway, &quot;general computing&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean mixing and mashing hardware. But it definitely means executing arbitrary software with full control over installed hardware. The trend line here is definitely from &quot;more&quot; to &quot;less&quot; of &quot;general computing&quot;. We&#x27;ve started with raw metal and hardware diagrams being included in the instruction manuals; then diagrams disappeared, CPUs gained abstraction layers - but it was still fine, computing-wise. But now we&#x27;re in era of OSes and even CPUs limiting what users can do with them, and multiple parties owning various pieces of a computer, with nothing left to own for the user who actually buys the machine.')
