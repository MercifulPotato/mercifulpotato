I get Tesla&#x27;s approach of making EV&#x27;s sexy with self driving&#x2F;ludicrous mode&#x2F;etc and I know the cost of batteries is a limiting factor right now, but I&#x27;d love to see how cheaply you could build an electric car.<p>It seems like with virtually no moving parts, and battery production getting better, you aught to be able to build an EV for a good deal less than an equivalent ICE vehicle.')
