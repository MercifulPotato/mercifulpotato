It&#x27;s a regulatory compliance system. Specifically, it&#x27;s to comply with a regulation requiring that the force on the stick increase with increasing angle of attack.<p>The situation that the regulation addresses should never occur on a fare carrying flight. It&#x27;s at the edge of the flight envelope, and a pilot who deliberately flies at the edge of the envelope with fares in the back should be prosecuted.<p>That said, sometimes things break, or weather causes things to go wrong. This may result in inadvertently flying near the edge of the envelope.<p>To a rough approximation, 0 out of a 1000 flights will meet the requirements for MCAS to activate.')
