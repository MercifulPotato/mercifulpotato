I mean for two months now alt-tab is broken on 20H2 release. No fix incoming yet. Zero days unpatched for 90 days etc. On WSL itâ€™s a networking and HyperV encrusted nightmare. Have fun trying to get anything vaguely complicated to do anything even remotely sane. Total shit show.<p>This is a rather bizarre list since I never had these issues on my Windows 10 installation.')
