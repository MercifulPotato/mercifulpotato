Voting machine vendors will say they have no way to track voters until someone finds a flow or figure it out. Or machines could be altered or hacked or...<p>But really the biggest problem is #2: because if there&#x27;s a problem, you need a paper trail. Because in the event of a recount, you want your average joe or jane to be able to recount ballots.<p>You could bring all the blockchain stuff (because I often hear that) or what not into the argument, you still wouldn&#x27;t be able to do both #1 and #2.<p>So to me, voting must remain a paper thing.')
