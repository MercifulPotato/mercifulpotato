You didn&#x27;t <i>ask</i> for these ads to be there.<p>(A simple switch saying &quot;include ads relevant to the query&quot; would change this to &quot;pull&quot; mode in my books, as long as I could enable or disable it permanently for my session&#x2F;account.)<p>Still, in context of this discussion, I meant to focus on the websites whose content Google reproduces in search results. These sites are the players that opted for an ad-funded business model, which is the source of this whole kerfuffle. Having an answer to my question being provided directly in response to query is a <i>feature</i> and great UX for me as a user. Websites want to restrict this not because they want to offer me value, but because they want to monetize my eyeballs. Sites with alternative business models wouldn&#x27;t have a problem with Google reproducing content, and perhaps could reach an agreement in which they feed Google content on purpose, in exchange for some payment. Less websites and more <i>data sources</i> would be a good thing.<p>&gt; <i>Also: you don&#x27;t consider the need for new companies to get initial attraction for a new (or better&#x2F;different version of X) product. How would you have that happen without advertising?</i><p>Perhaps I need to update my article with some thoughts on that. The TL;DR: of my position on this topic is: if everyone shouts through megaphones at everyone else, you need your own megaphone to be heard. Take away everyone&#x27;s megaphones, and maybe we can all have an actual conversation.')
