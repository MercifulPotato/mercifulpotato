It&#x27;s likely that your post was seen by some as being too promotional for yourself so they may have flagged it for that purpose. I would try re-submitting it just as a link, and to not include strings like &#x27;My&#x27; and &#x27;is out&#x27; in the title, instead just describe the content as succinctly as possible.')
