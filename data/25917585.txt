What I have also learned is that a solution obviates a dynamic someone thinks it is their job to manage, and a visualization that solves a problem is its own problem.<p>The &quot;best,&quot; diagrams show change over time, and provide the presenter with a way to demonstrate how they are the important pivot point that optimizes and drives that change. The &quot;worst,&quot; diagrams are the ones that illuminate the problem in such a way that it is no longer difficult, which humiliates the people it was presented to and designed to help.<p>I recommend using data viz privately, to reason through and solve problems quickly, and then use the time you save for self investment. The real value I think is to use data viz not as a product for productivity, but as an arbitrage tool for leverage.')
