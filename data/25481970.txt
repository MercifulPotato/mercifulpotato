(I first thought about 7z too but having to reupload the whole archive even if only a few files are modified made me look for another solution).<p>In short, you can do<p><pre><code>    nfreezer backup my_documents&#x2F; user@11.22.33.44:&#x2F;backup&#x2F; \n</code></pre>\nand the backup will be done or updated (if only 1MB have changed since last backup, only 1MB will be uploaded and not 100 GB).<p>Everything is encrypted locally (including the filenames), and <i>never</i> decrypted on remote. You can&#x27;t use the files on the remote server, it&#x27;s only cold storage - the only thing you can do with it is: restore to your local computer (if one day you need it), and decrypt it locally.<p>It&#x27;s 250 lines of code in one single source file, so you can read it quickly to see if it&#x27;s ok or not for your use case.')
