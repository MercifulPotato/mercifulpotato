If nothing else, that violates the site guideline of the principle of charity.  But I think it&#x27;s deeper than that.  I suspect that you maybe actually think that - that you&#x27;re actually, obviously right, and anyone who disagrees with you is deliberately blind.  That kind of attitude draws downvotes any time it escapes into your words.<p>In particular, the parent post to this one.  I&#x27;m surprised that it isn&#x27;t downvoted.  In fact, I did downvote it, purely for the &quot;you&#x27;re a bunch of whining crybabies with your heads in the sand because you downvoted me&quot; that runs all through it.<p>And:<p>&gt; Worst to me, is that HN facilitates teeny, tiny acts of violence against me.<p>If you think downvotes (or being rate limited) are violence, you need to separate your identity from your words.')
