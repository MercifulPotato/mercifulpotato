There are like 10 separate map implementation  in FreePascal, but  they are all slower than C++&#x27;s std::unordered_map.<p>Then I compared another dozen of libraries, and found the fastest one that is like 50% faster than std::unordered_map. But it was a rather straight forward implementation of non-linear open addressing.')
