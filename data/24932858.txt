When asked, they say they ordered on Amazon and are upset at Amazon for it being late. After you explain that Amazon is <i>also</i> a marketplace, they understand why it’s late (it’s the seller’s fault), but they’re still upset at Amazon for not making it <i>clear enough</i> that it wasn’t going through Prime.<p>[a]: I.E. non-Prime purchases (ignoring the fact that Prime purchases can also just be late)')
