Advertising pays for the latter but people decry both. IDFA is there for advertisers to use without being able to explicitly identify the user but still provide some measure of knowledge to present ads more than random. Once it&#x27;s no longer opt out, I doubt anyone turns it on.<p>Eventually everything on the web will require payment without there being a universally supported payment method, which is what should be the solution everyone is working on (read an article, pay 1¢ out of a fund you provide under your control for example). But instead we get ranting about privacy. Shouldn&#x27;t HN discussions be about finding a better way rather than ranting?<p>My programming blog used to get 300,000 readers a year, which would have netted me $3K a year at 1¢.
