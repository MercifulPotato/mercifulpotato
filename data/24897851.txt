Shasta today?&quot;<p>&quot;OK Google, add a waypoint for the last gas station before the mountain pass&quot;<p>&quot;OK Google, what percentage of people can you detect to be wearing masks on recent Instagram photos tagged at a location within a 10 mile radius of Mt. Shasta?&quot;<p>These are all things I would <i>expect</i> a computer assistant to do really well. They have access to so much data, and so many APIs, that they should be able to break down these sentences into a SQL-like query and give me results. The third, for example:<p>&quot;recent Instagram photos&quot; -&gt; Instagram has an API<p>&quot;tagged within a 10 mile radius&quot; -&gt; parse the cities within a 10 mile radius and look for tags in all of them<p>&quot;people&quot; -&gt; use your wonderful person detection networks your friends at Waymo developed<p>&quot;wearing masks&quot; -&gt; I&#x27;m sure your internal datasets have this label, so run an object detector<p>Then compile and reduce the data to give me the number I want.<p>That&#x27;s what I want an <i>assistant</i> to do. But it couldn&#x27;t even do the first, which just involves a single API query to fetch air quality index information. Bleh. And as for the second, it has no idea what &quot;last gas station&quot; or &quot;mountain pass&quot; means; it&#x27;s a query a human would know to be extremely commonplace.<p>It turns out that the current generation of &quot;assistants&quot; are mostly just template-matchers which really doesn&#x27;t help me much at all. I can set my own alarms, thank you.')
