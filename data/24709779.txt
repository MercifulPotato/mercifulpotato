Somehow I&#x27;m still logged in on my other device, I&#x27;ll use that as a sign of luck and migrate all of my data to a new account while I can. Will also try to rely less on Google for instance. Would also need to start receiving mails from my old email address. The worst part though, the moment I logged in with my new account to my old Macbook Pro, it treated it perfectly fine and rather said that my other device (the new Macbook Pro from which I was locked out in the first place) is suspicious or something without any rhyme or reason. I&#x27;ve checked all of my apps, extensions and everything, it&#x27;s all legit.\nGuess Google simply sucks since it doesn&#x27;t even provide customer support in this matter.')
