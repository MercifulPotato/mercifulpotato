She was getting increasingly frustrated as <i>nothing</i> was making sense to her. I told her to relax, go take a nap, and when you wake up everything will make sense.<p>Three hours later I get a text from her: &quot;OMG thank you. The nap did help me understand everything!&quot; (I&#x27;m paraphrasing).<p>I don&#x27;t know what it is exactly, but I feel like naps almost invariably help me to understand complex problems. I suppose it&#x27;s partly because my brain is still thinking about the problems while I sleep, and partly because my brain wakes up energized and ready to go, without the fog of tiredness interfering with my thoughts.<p>Regardless, napping when I&#x27;m tired has yet to fail me whenever I&#x27;m stuck on a complex issue.')
