You really get a very near SPA feeling with a lot less effort.<p>BUT basecamp libraries (turbolinks, stimulus) are horrible open source libraries. There are not any changes or bug fixes for months now (for both) and nobody does know whats the actual state, whether they are abandoned or basecamp is working on something new.
