But this article is full of rookie mistakes and I can&#x27;t figure out the purpose of writing it except clickbaiting.<p>&gt; The main problem with repeating a code chunk is that if a bug is found, there is more than one place where it needs to be fixed.<p>No, the main problem is that reading repeated code adds cognitive load for reader. Also, when you copy-paste the code you should copy-paste its tests too, and that leads to CI&#x2F;CD resource wasting.<p>&gt; The alternative to copy-pasting the code is usually to put it in a function (or procedure, or a subroutine, depending on the language), and call it. This means that when reading through the original caller, it is less clear what the code does.<p>If the function and local variables all has clear naming and function does not mutate passed variables (which otherwise should be clearly implied by  it&#x27;s name) - you never need to step into it while debugging and just save a bit of time while reading the code.<p>So, the takeaway here is: the code is written for humans, not computers. The idea of clean code is ease of reading and understanding. That&#x27;s what DRY is for.')
