Initially I found it difficult to talk about this and start taking actions to change the situation, but once I started taking action to change the situation things gradually started to improve. In hindsight it would have been better to talk through the problem and then take action to change the situation earlier.<p>I had gotten my head into a bad place after mentally assuming responsibility for the outcome of a work project in an environment where I had very limited control over the outcome. I was stressing myself out thinking about about work outside of the hours I was paid to work. When I was recovering, my mental model when thinking about the situation was that I&#x27;d constructed some black box in my mind full of work-project-related-concerns, and that when I wasn&#x27;t working I&#x27;d habitually start thinking about stuff inside the box and then the box would start radiating stress and ruining my day.')
