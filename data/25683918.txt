What is known about that guy anyway? Maybe he is a leftist who wants to warn about fascism.<p>I think Biden and so on showed sympathy to BLM rioters as well. What is wrong with trying to understand people&#x27;s needs and pains?<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous how you people twist everything Trump says.<p>It also shows what your &quot;opponents&quot; can expect under your rule.<p>I bet you would put &quot;Camp Auschwitz&quot; guy into your own version of Camp Auschwitz in no time, and you wouldn&#x27;t even feel bad about it.<p>You don&#x27;t realize that Socialism is just as murderous, and that is what you people stand for.')
