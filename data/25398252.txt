That’s why, as a Linux user, I have always been a bit envious of macOS users, who had access to tools that could instantly show the current application’s shortcuts.<p>On Windows and Linux, there was no such thing. You had to find shortcut information in the software’s documentation and hope that it was searchable.<p>KeyCombiner Desktop shows the current application’s shortcuts in a searchable table, triggered instantly via a system-wide key combination. It is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.<p>This lookup also includes all shortcuts and text snippets from personal KeyCombiner collections, making it a universal cheatsheet. I am afraid you will have to read the blog post to fully understand what this means.<p>I appreciate any feedback!')
