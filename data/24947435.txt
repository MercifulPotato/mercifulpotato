Structures are built on a square tile grid, but objects on belts move at a much finer resolution, and have a bunch of specific behaviors (moving in two lanes, being picked up or dropped onto belts by inserters, belts merging into other belts, etc).<p>Older versions of the game actually used an even more flexible physics engine for objects on belt (not restricted to two lanes), but that was deemed unnecessarily complex -- and the current model is much more performant.')
