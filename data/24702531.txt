Item(by='dilippkumar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602019831, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24700724, text='&gt; The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) authorizes an agency to issue a rule without\nprior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those\nprocedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under the APA, notice \nand comment is deemed “impracticable” when an agency “cannot both follow section 553 and execute its \nstatutory duties,” while the “public interest” prong “connotes a\nsituation in which the interest of the public would be defeated by any requirement of advance\nnotice.” Generally, the good cause exception for forgoing notice and comment rulemaking\n“excuses notice and comment in emergency situations, or where delay could result in serious\nharm.” While emergency situations are the most common circumstances in which good cause\nis invoked, the infliction of real harm that would result from delayed action even absent an\nemergency can be sufficient grounds to issue a rule without undergoing prior notice and\ncomment.<p>&gt; Here, two different circumstances are present that satisfy the APA’s good cause criteria.\nFirst, the shock to the labor market caused by the widespread unemployment resulting from the\ncoronavirus public health emergency has created exigent circumstances that threaten immediate\nharm to the wages and job prospects of U.S. workers. The INA’s wage protections are meant to ensure \nthat the employment of foreign workers does not have an adverse impact on similarly employed U.S. workers. \nBut the flaws in the existing wage levels—which were promulgated through guidance and without meaningful \neconomic justification, are inconsistent with the statute, and serve as the source of adverse labor \neffects on U.S. workers even under normal economic conditions—can only exacerbate, and severely so, the \ndangers posed to U.S. workers by recent mass lay-offs unless immediate action is taken. Keeping in place the \ncurrent levels is untenable, and any delay in issuing this rule is contrary to the public interest. Notice and\ncomment procedures in these circumstances would make it impracticable for the Department to\nfulfill its statutory mandate and carry out the “due and required execution of [its] agency\nfunctions” to protect U.S. workers.<p>&gt; Separately, even absent the emergency labor market conditions caused by the coronavirus\npandemic, providing the public an opportunity to comment before the adjustments to the wage\nlevels take effect is contrary to the public interest insofar as it would impede the Department’s\nability to solve the problems this interim final rule is meant to address. Advance notice of the\nintended changes would create an opportunity, and the incentives to use it, for employers to\nattempt to evade the adjusted wage requirements. This constitutes a situation where the public’s\ninterest is “defeated by any requirement of advance notice” and also justifies the Department’s\ndecision to forgo notice and comment before issuing the rule.<p><i>sigh</i> - and here I am, paying payroll taxes without being eligible for any benefits, hoping that I&#x27;ll live to be 130 years and get my permanent residency.
