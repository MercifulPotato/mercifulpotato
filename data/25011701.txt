This causes huge tension and also miscommunication. Knowing how to do something should at least give you more decision power on how to move forward with a problem, but what ends up happening is extra overhead explaining solutions and options just so a decision is made by someone else that might still not understand and make the wrong decision anyway. This also causes a bottleneck and compounds the problem by making the org. very slow to respond to changes in direction.<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t see an easy solution, and bad managers tend to be the ones that have the least understanding of the problems, but somehow make the most decisions.')
