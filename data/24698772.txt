Let&#x27;s say it kills 600,000 people on average per year. That is not measured like the Covid death are measured in most countries. For the flu they take the excess death to estimate how many people died. But the majority of people are not tested. Whereas we are doing extremely hard counter measures against Covid-19, and we still have more deaths than for the seasonal flu. And the flu and Covid-19 season is just starting in the northern hemisphere. On top of that we have the long Covid phenomenon. But is&#x27;s incidence is still unclear. But even if it is just 2% of Covid cases, that are ill for month (if not for years), that is really quite significant; even expensive for the economy.<p>So, I don&#x27;t see Covid-19 as &quot;just like the flu&quot;.')
