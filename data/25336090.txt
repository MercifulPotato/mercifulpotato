But then even a normal gas range won&#x27;t work -- you need one that will output the insane-sized heat that is required for a true stir-fry. Of course, not many people go to those lengths... :)<p>As for warped pans, I never had that problem -- all my stuff is thick stainless steel-clad pots and pans. That&#x27;s interesting though, it makes sense -- it would need full contact for effective heat transfer.')
