There are subspaces like &quot;all even grades&quot; that are closures under all basic operations.<p>If I remember correctly, the &quot;even subset&quot; of a 3D GA multi-vector is isomorphic to the Quarternions, which is why they turn up so often in 3D graphics libraries.<p>But think about how <i>messy</i> this is! These 3D libraries are blending together subsets of vaguely related algebras that are not &quot;compatible&quot; from a type theory perspective and so they&#x27;re forced to convert back-and-forth. It&#x27;s like mixing Unicode UTF-8 with Latin-1 byte strings. If you squint, it <i>looks</i> like one is the subset of the other... but not really.<p>With a pure GA-base library, the &quot;rotation interpolation&quot; functions would use the &quot;even multivector subset&quot; type, and be totally compatible with the rest of the library. It&#x27;s the same type definitions, just with different parameters. This would be like using UTF-8 Unicode throughout the program, but having the ability to define a string-based type that only allows the &quot;Basic Multilingual Plane&quot;.')
