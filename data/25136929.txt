Basically a big RDBMS with a bunch of stored procedures.  Maybe something fancy like Tableau in front of it.  The hard part would be getting the data sanitized and into the DB, and access control.  Probably lots of encryption requirements as well.<p>Also note this is an RFP, so the decision to do it has already been made, this is basically the procurement of the service happening here.')
