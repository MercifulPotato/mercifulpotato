They don&#x27;t want to pay for RHEL licenses in test&#x2F;dev but need a binary compatible version to ensure they can get enterprise support in production should they hit an issue. Having different drivers&#x2F;kernels&#x2F;libraries is a non-starter.</i><p>Unless you are doing kernelly things then the small difference in kernel version will not be that big a deal.  Also for most applications, dev&#x2F;test is <i>better</i> on Stream since it represent RHEL next.  If the next version of RHEL will break your app, you find out in dev&#x2F;test instead of in production like you used to.  I think it&#x27;s worth considering if this isn&#x27;t <i>better</i> for your use case than previously.<p>It&#x27;s also not very hard to compile your own kernel if you really need an exact version.  I do that sometimes on Fedora when I&#x27;m testing a driver I maintain.  You can also just keep the RPMs from either previous releases as well (that&#x27;s not a bad idea so even if you&#x27;re building your own kernel you can extract the config file from it).')
