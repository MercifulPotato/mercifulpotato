It is a <i>fact</i> that speeding in a motor vehicle is extremely dangerous. There&#x27;s endless data supporting the link between speed and death.\nSpeeding in a motor vehicle on public roads is doing something that is known to, and can easily kill innocent people.\nIf one really wants the social cachet of being a rich &#x27;rebel&#x27;, please do something that can only kill oneself. That would be fine. Dont risk the lives of other innocent people.')
