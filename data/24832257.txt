My perspective on game development is different than it is for tools -- some of the most impressive OS tools I&#x27;ve seen (Blender, Krita) are where they are specifically because they&#x27;ve been designed by committee, and because it turns out that a committee of artists generally produces better art-tools than a committee of programmers and marketers.<p>&gt; The community can maintain stuff that is &quot;boring,&quot; where there is no controversy. When the right approach is clear to all. The community can write an emulator, but cannot write a video game.<p>A good 90% of the tools where reliability matters are boring, and I want them to be boring. I compare this to other tools that I use outside of a computer. I don&#x27;t want a radical piano when I&#x27;m composing music, I want a finely tuned, boring solution. I don&#x27;t want radical pencils, I do most of my artwork with tools that I know extremely well.<p>When I picked up digital drawing, my approach was the same; I didn&#x27;t want an auteur experience, I wanted extremely consistent drivers, and consistent software that allowed me to focus on my artwork, not the user interface.<p>I think you&#x27;re hitting on an interesting artistic point with game development, but you&#x27;re misapplying that point to a field with different concerns. I use Linux because it&#x27;s boring. It gets out of my way and lets me focus on creative tasks.')
