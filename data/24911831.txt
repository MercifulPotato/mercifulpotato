Item(by='ajarmst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603832453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24908296, text='Thanks very much for the caution (reports where the quote about revolutionary results comes from the lead author tend to trigger my skepticism reflex). Looking at the paper, a lot of the results are based on cell studies, in addition to the rodent studies. The research looks good and promising, but it also appears to be incremental progress based on work that&#x27;s been going on for a decade or so.  My other concern is that the racemic form of the drug in question is a popular beta-blocker (the R- isomer alone does appear to have a different physiological effect, it is also apparently a promising arrhythmia drug.) That would indicate to me that there are already probably an awful lot of AD patients taking the racemic mixture regularly.  I&#x27;d think if it were a miracle drug, we&#x27;d probably have at least some indications.  Finally, the title of the paper includes the phrase  &quot;but [does not prevent] Î²-Amyloid Accumulation&quot;, which seems to directly contradict this marketing release&#x27;s claim about reversing AD.  That said, if they do come up with something that can significantly ameliorate AD symptoms for a decade or so, I&#x27;ll happily dance in the streets.')
