Even if I were multimillionaire I wouldn&#x27;t change this.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely a little confused by this sentence. You lay out your reasons below, but seem to be assuming you get to pick. By the time someone attends university, they&#x27;re usually, you know, people. Adults in the 18+ sense, high school diploma, ability to get a job, have their own opinions about the world, access to federal student loans, etc. You&#x27;ll have some influence in terms of the degree to which you&#x27;ll support their decision and advice you can offer, but you don&#x27;t get to <i>pick</i> anything, especially if your child is talented&#x2F;driven enough to get into an Ivy League w&#x2F;o being a socioeconomic outlier.')
