The way we did was testing a lot of slogans and audiences with Facebook ads and seeing what converted and then retained long-term.<p>Also, I find the template statement to be clunky and not as useful. Both in my current startup, and previous startup - HubSpot - I doubt any employee could recite this contrived positioning statement. And if you can&#x27;t remember it easily then it&#x27;s not going to be used much.<p>At HubSpot our positioning was simple: &quot;All-in-one marketing software&quot;.
