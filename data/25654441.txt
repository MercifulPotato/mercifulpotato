There is another option, buffering, which causes high latency. The intermediate device must either buffer (causing &quot;buffer bloat&quot; = increased latency) or drop the packet.<p>If increased packet loss is occurring seemingly randomly, it could be something on the network is updating&#x2F;syncing and saturating the link. It could be Steam games, desktop OS updates, mobile device updates, podcast downloading, game console updates, etc.')
