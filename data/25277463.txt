It seems like not that long ago we thought to &quot;hack&quot; unsaturated fats in order to give them a buttery texture.  Fast-forward 20 years and it turns out biological systems are unimaginably complex, and trans-fats are quite probably inflammatory agents and carcinogens.<p>There&#x27;s always some risk in innovation, but it seems like synthetic nutrition is an absolute minefield.  It&#x27;s not just the raw complexity of the field, either.  It&#x27;s also that much of nutrition is junk science, even in the peer-reviewed literature.<p>On a more conspirational note, I also can&#x27;t help but to notice that the agro-dietary industry is a pretty low-margin business.  It seems like driving up profit margins requires convincing people that existing foods are somehow unsuitable, and that &quot;innovative&quot; products are therefore needed.  I think vegan and ecological sensibilities are being instrumentalized to this end.<p>In any case:  this anonymous internet stranger plans on skipping the lab-meat fad.')
