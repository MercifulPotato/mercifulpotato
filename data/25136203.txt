Item(by='golergka', descendants=None, kids=[25136789], score=None, time=1605704167, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25133217, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve grown up in a typical 3-generational Russian family sharing a rather small apartment, and I can tell you, it gets on your nerves when the grandparents want to watch TV at maximum volume, while the parent is trying to catch some sleep debt and the kid (me) is doing homework in the same room. That was one of the main reasons why I decided to move to the West where having enough private space was considered to be a basic and unquestionable necessity.<p>I&#x27;ve had exactly the same experience, and I only now slowly come to realise the amount of emotional abuse that is normalised in such families. Shouting and fighting (physically, with bruises and injuries) on a daily basis, belittling one another, constantly being passive aggressive in any communication, never-ending hostility towards your closest family members â€” it&#x27;s just something that is completely normal and expected in many, many families that live like this. Even without alcohol involved.')
