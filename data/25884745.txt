Item(by='abeppu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611425962, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25883095, text='&gt; They don&#x27;t want to type out a bunch of words for a question if the reply isn&#x27;t going to happen for a few hours.<p>But if I&#x27;m not immediately available, they&#x27;ll presumably need to ask someone else, or accept that they have to wait for a reply. Either way they will need to type the question at some point. So type it now, and if I don&#x27;t immediately reply, paste the same question to the next person, etc or better yet put it in a channel, where my teammates can jump in.<p>And frankly, the norm that people should try to ask a clear question, or frame an actionable request up front often seems to improve the understanding of the requesting party. I&#x27;ve many times had the experience where pulling together the relevant info to frame a question answers it, or fully describing a task reveals a way to streamline it.')
