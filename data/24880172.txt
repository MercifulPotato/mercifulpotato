Teaching students the names of the Platonic solidâ€™s for example is seemingly vastly less useful than basic financial literacy.  As a math class you can cover plenty of useful ideas like risk assessment at the same time.<p>Alternatively, I would drop things to 3 years of English to add a year of Home Economics that covered basic cooking, practical nutrition, taxes, personal finances including insurance, and saving for retirement.  All I can recall from mine was a few weeks we learned how to fill out a check and sew a pillow.')
