You have an opportunity to mingle with others at the bar while waiting to get back to your group. I met one of my partners like this, as well as a few great friends.<p>The biggest reason virtual events suck is just they don&#x27;t employ as much people. All those people who actually run the events, clean, cater them etc don&#x27;t have jobs. I hope things are normal by Summer')
