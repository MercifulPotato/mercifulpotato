The modern society worships success, and the people pay oversized attention to what successful people do - like what they eat, how exercise, how they stay motivated, etc. And now instead of respectable, successful, well dressed, educated, smart, cool, etc. Wall Street-ers a bunch of &quot;retards&quot; crawled from under the rock, teared a new one to those Wall Street-ers and got right on top of that podium of success veneration and idolation (like the &quot;nerds&quot; did 20 years ago with their tech startups). No surprise all the establishment (which these days naturally includes successful &quot;nerds&quot; of the previous generation) fights back. The established interests are always scared of changes, and especially when changes look like paradigm shift (while we wouldn&#x27;t know for quite some time whether it is a true paradigm shift or just an aberration, the scare is real)')
