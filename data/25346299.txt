I own not one, but two pair of the Beats (like ‘em enough to get the wife a pair), so I’m their “sucker” target market. Sure, maybe one can get better sound for the same money, but as you point out, other headphones don’t connect to my Apple stuff as neatly (or at all; yea, Bluetooth), yada, yada. So I’ll will sacrifice a bit of sound quality (or so the sound nutters say) for convenience.<p>But $550? Even this high-income Apple fanboi has his limits. At that price, the reviews better say the sound is <i>outstanding</i>. Because for one, Apple is competing against the Beats I already own.')
