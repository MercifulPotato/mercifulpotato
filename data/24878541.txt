People with SHA1 hashes in their signatures have a reasonable way to transition away from those signatures while maintaining the reputation of those identities. There really isn&#x27;t anything out there as good.<p>I should also point out that that the attack this is addressing (Shambles) has close to no practical implications. So this is a good example of how the PGP&#x2F;GPG ecosystem takes security breakage very seriously.')
