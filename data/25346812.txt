It says 13 rounds were fired, and I&#x27;m guessing they were fired in fully automatic mode.  Assuming we&#x27;re talking about a higher caliber weapon (likely an AK variant, given the region), humans can&#x27;t make a 10&quot; group with an AK in full auto.  Had a human tried this, they&#x27;re about as likely to kill his wife as they are to kill him.  AK&#x27;s fire 600 rounds per minute in full auto, with each shot generating 6.9 ft lbs of recoil.<p>&gt; Machine guns have penetration and dispersion<p>I don&#x27;t think machine guns have the amount of dispersion that you think they do.  An AK-47 shoots ~5-6 MOA groupings (5-6&quot; groups at 100 yards).  That&#x27;s not particularly accurate for modern machine guns, but it is likely in the realm of what we&#x27;re looking at here.  An RPK is also an option, and would produce smaller groupings.  Assuming you have something that can control the recoil, I don&#x27;t see any reason why shooting in full auto would be less accurate.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s just such a strange detail that really doesn&#x27;t speak to AI at all.<p>It has less to do with the AI itself and more to do with the implications.  If someone really has created an AI that can wield guns, that is incredibly terrifying.  World leaders are scared because assassination attempts used to be a death sentence; now they can be killed by a parked car.  The rest of us should be terrified because mass shootings could become drastically more effective.  If this thing has good target acquisition, it could become a terrifyingly effective weapon for mass shootings.  As bad as our mass shootings have been, they&#x27;re usually done by humans, who are pretty bad shots.  The majority of the bullets miss everyone.  Imagine what happens if there&#x27;s an AI that can aim an AK as fast as the AK can fire.  It could shoot 10 people in the head per second.')
