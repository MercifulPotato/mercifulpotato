Most smart switches will work as regular light switches even if the whole rest of your smart home is down.  Then you use the smart home stuff to make everything more convenient but if the smart home is down it falls back to dumb home functionality.<p>An easy example is my pantry. Itâ€™s got a smart switch (Inovelli Zwave) hooked up for the light plus a door sensor on the door. Normally when you open the door the door sensor turns on the light by communicating with the smart switch and when you close the door the light goes off.  But if everything is down the switch still acts like a regular light switch and you can turn the pantry lights off and on.<p>Other examples might be garage doors that open when they detect you pull in to the driveway.  You want to make sure that you can still just press the garage door opener button so that you can get in like a normal person when presence detection fails.<p>Smart home functionality should enhance, not replace, at least until everything is 100% bullet proof and never fails or goes down (i.e. not in my lifetime)')
