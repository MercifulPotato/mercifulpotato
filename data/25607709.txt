It can be done well in various ways and badly in various ways, like virtually any style.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that Phil is not just wrong about brutalism but also wrong about these examples being (primarily) brutalist. Not generally using raw concrete, they would not be considered brutalist. The modern &quot;box&quot; has been largely discarded by contemporary institutional architects in favor of rough, pseudo-gabbled, uh, crap, as shown in the majority of these examples.<p>I&#x27;d say a bad brutalist building is like a rough bureaucratic dictate whereas present bad institutional architecture is like a bureaucratic dictate but rewritten with contemporary niceness guides - &quot;this is a notice concerning your rights under the involuntary amputation act&quot;')
