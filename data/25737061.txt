It&#x27;s a pure propaganda project meant to manipulate public opinion outside of the US. It&#x27;s the Asian version of Radio Marti, or Radio Free Europe. Funded by the U.S. taxpayers, run by the U.S. government, to improve the image of the U.S. in the world, to strengthen friendly governments and to weaken government enemies.<p>It is an overt propaganda machine, but fully available for covert agencies to use as part of any project they wish. A great way to use it is to float a story, then get more legitimate outlets to report on the story using it as the source.<p>It&#x27;s like BBC News, if the BBC didn&#x27;t broadcast to British people and was explicitly conceived as a propaganda arm of the government. So not really much like BBC news.')
