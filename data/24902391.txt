Now ask &quot;Is it trash to acknowledge that Hunter Biden had his dad use his influence to replace a straight-laced Ukrainian prosecutor with a corrupt stooge so Hunter could enrich himself?&quot;<p>That&#x27;s trash. Or:<p>&quot;Is it trash to point out how Soros-funded Democrats are involved in a global pedophilia conspiracy that American conservatives are secretly working to take down?&quot;<p>That&#x27;s also trash.')
