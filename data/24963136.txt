You start a sport, you&#x27;re gonna be made aware that there are ways to do the sport that immediately hurt, and that there are ways to do it that won&#x27;t hurt immediately but will fuck you up for sure in the long run, or even the medium run.<p>There are ways to hold a pen or pencil that will fuck you up in the long run for sure, and most people hold one in these ways. I didn&#x27;t learn proper form until I was in my twenties, via lore passed on from master animators I was working under. I&#x27;ve since seen the same knowledge in places like &quot;old penmanship manuals&quot; but it sure was not a thing I was taught as a kid learning to write.<p>Fountain pens, you kinda <i>have</i> to learn decent form to use. A Bic? You can write with <i>any</i> kind of grip, even one that looks like you tied your fingers in a knot around it.')
