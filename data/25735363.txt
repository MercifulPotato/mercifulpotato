The README.md in that repo outright states that the context for the email is absent and does not necessarily provide concrete proof of any specific narrative:<p>&gt; ... Remember that while the email is validated, the context isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s possible this reflects a secret meeting to conspire with Vice President Biden. Or, it&#x27;s possible the guy attended one of the many Washington D.C. social functions whereby people shake hands with politicians and exchange pleasantries. As Richelieu is claimed to have said &quot;Give me six words by the most honest of men and I&#x27;ll find something to hang him by&quot;. Give me an email dump from the most honest of persons, and I&#x27;ll pull one out of context to hang them in the court of social media. ...<p>&gt; ... I personally have many doubts about where this email came from, and the overall &quot;narrative&quot; they are trying to push. Regardless, I can validate the basic facts about this email.<p>Are there any more emails with full headers?')
