I read the title as an endearing and respectful way to reference the elderly in India.<p>I hadn&#x27;t personally encountered the 2(b) form you reference.  When I was a kid, even an implied taunting of the older generation was forbidden, treated as stepping out of the bounds of social protocol, and would get you punished by your own parents or family if observed.<p>Even now, as an adult, I would feel strongly compelled to stop myself from using the 2(b) variant you just referenced.  It feels taboo.<p>Maybe things have evolved a bit since I left India, which I admit was quite a while back.  I wonder if my grandmother might lament this change as a deterioration of values in the younger generations :)  &quot;The kids have no respect these days&quot;.')
