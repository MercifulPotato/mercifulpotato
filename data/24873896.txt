Your memory or &quot;cache&quot; for what C is indexes with the specific harmonics that make the timbre of a piano. On another instrument it&#x27;s a different sound, the main harmonic is the same one but the timbre is so different that you need to go through the &quot;let&#x27;s use perfect pitch for this&quot; part of your brain.<p>It&#x27;s the same thing mechanics use to identify engine sounds quickly or why some people can tell who&#x27;s walking on a hallway because of how the steps sound. Repeated exposition to a stimulus that then gets associated with something etches a memory.<p>This not only happens with perfect pitch. To for example know how to tell a major third from a minor third on all keys you can &quot;memorize&quot; all the sounds and know which one they are. I think my brain kinda did that and now I sometimes get confused with M3 and P5 because of how &quot;similar&quot; they sound even though you can like totally fit another tone comfortable between the root and the fifth and the root and the third don&#x27;t have enough air for that.')
