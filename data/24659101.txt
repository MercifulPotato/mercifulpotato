Item(by='ertian', descendants=None, kids=[24662781], score=None, time=1601615479, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24658577, text='It&#x27;s definitely true that outright dismissing all high-caste Indians is no better than doing the same for low-caste or any other race of people.<p>I have to say, though, if I saw an org chart with a disproportionate number of Indians (relative to nearby &amp; similar companies, or other parts of the same company) I would take that as a warning sign. As you say, in my experience, less political and more open-minded Indian tech workers will tend to be drawn to more diverse workplaces. It just seems unlikely that a whole bunch of cool, modern, forward-thinking Indians just coincidentally happened to fill a whole management chain.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;d think the same thing if a management chain were overly-dominated by any particular group, be they Chinese, white, or, I dunno, UC Berkeley grads. It&#x27;s a sort of organizational smell. It just seems to happen more often, anecdotally, with Indian management, either just because there are proportionally more of them or because they&#x27;re used to a more old-school corporate culture.')
