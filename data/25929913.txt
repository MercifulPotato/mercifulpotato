Pre-teen me saw a lot of the kind of things you mention before the internet was a thing. The students at my school had pseudo-competitions for who could get the best porn&#x2F;gore, earning kudos for the bloodiest gore or &quot;hottest&quot; porn. Often the lines would blur whens someone found scat or snuff but that&#x27;s a different matter.<p>Later on in life, I think everyone knew &quot;a guy&quot; at work that had all kinds of taboo material. The Weird Eddies or Creepy Colins of the world had a black-market snatched from them when the internet got popular.')
