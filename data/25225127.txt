HDS wasn&#x27;t scared to use OSS and build open platforms.<p>Big edit sorry<p>I wandered away from concluding with my own little dream to decouple the block implementation from the fs how DAOS does only with a full selection from the commercial file systems available, paying for usable capacity and not raw installed drive specifications. Paying for peritoneal at enterprise mark-up sucks. Meanwhile not too many people seem to be aware that you can run very small budget and scale file systems that were only available in multiples of house prices only a couple of years ago. The latest all flash NetApp filer is 20k and I don&#x27;t imagine many people who have the knowledge to debate about the issues can&#x27;t economically justify that even in a home lab. Executive care options can cost less only it&#x27;s not many acquisitions that can cost you more just owning but with orders of magnitude difference between the costs.')
