Git branches have essentially zero overhead and deleting them is just extra complexity in the CI toolchain. Deleting branches also deletes context in some scenarios. When dealing with an old codebase its nice to be able to checkout the exact version of the code at some point without having to dig through the log to get hashes and then dealing with a detached head.<p>The example in the article is a bit of a special case. It is a huge, and old, monorepo. In the typical case, fetching everything and fetching master is equivalent because all commits in all branches make their way into master anyway. If you have a weird branching strategy where you maintain multiple, significantly diverged branches at once, but only care about one of those branches at build time, then this optimization would save you time.')
