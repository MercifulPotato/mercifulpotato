To me, C++ looks like an organic extension of C syntax, while Objective C looks like an alien graft on top of C.<p>Same with semantics: In C++ there is a continuum from POD structs to adding non-virtual methods to adding virtual methods. In Objective C there is a gaping chasm between C types and Objective C types, and weirdness occurs when you mix the two (e.g. pass a method taking an (int) to a place expecting a method taking an (NSNumber *)).<p>Containers (arrays and dictionaries) in Objective C, I find particularly ugly, especially in earlier (pre-2010 or so) versions of Objective C. They can contain only Objective C objects, not C objects, but can wildly mix and match objects of different types (this has been helped by Objective C generics by now). Access to elements is very verbose (this has been helped by syntactic sugar by now).<p>Just recently, I had to review Objective C code using a multidimensional numeric array. Even in modern syntax, it was no joy to read, and I wept for the senselessly murdered memory and CPU time. But if it had been written in pre-2010 Objective C, I might have lost my will to live for weeks.')
