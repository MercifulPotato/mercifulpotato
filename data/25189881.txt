The model where you just stick ads into some unused screen space, popups, commercial breaks, ad segments are hot garbage.<p>Like I don&#x27;t really have an issue with someone posting a thread &quot;BIFL Request: Spatulas&quot; and some brand rep being like &quot;Hey I work for $company and we have a thing that might work for you.&quot; One of the best answers I ever saw on &#x2F;r&#x2F;femalefasionadvice was a Lululemon rep doing a full breakdown of their different product lines, model differences, prices ranges, target markets. Like god damn I wish all ads were like that. It was an actual informative sales pitch.<p>I think some light regulation that says reps have to be upfront about their affiliations is all that&#x27;s really needed here.')
