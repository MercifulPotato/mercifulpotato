Parler&#x27;s current deplatforming indicates that &quot;start your own company so you&#x27;re the governor&quot; is a borderline unrealistic point of view, since the internet and especially mobile phones are run by mega-corporations that don&#x27;t support an open platform.<p>If we look at Parler being dependent on other companies, there are 3 dependencies that bit them in the last few days:<p>(A) running servers on AWS<p>(B) distributing Android app through Google Play Store<p>(C) distributing iPhone app through Apple Store<p>Parler could and should have avoided the dependency on AWS by hosting with a company more aligned with their views or outside of the US.<p>However, I cannot in good faith say &quot;Parler should have written their own mobile OS if they want people to use their platform from their phones&quot;. I believe Android supports app installation without Google Play. It&#x27;s a little inconvenient, but I think an extra minute or two of clicking around is an ok price to pay for access to unpopular speech.<p>However, as far as I know there&#x27;s no way to have an app on iPhones without Apple&#x27;s approval. This is a strong point for &quot;even if you start your own company, you&#x27;re not the governor - 45% of America&#x27;s phone users can only access your service at the mercy of Apple&quot;.')
