I’ve personally seen developers not use projects only because they’re AGPL. Even GPL seems to scare some developers.<p>Do you think it is more likely to scare your potential paying customers, your potential contributors, or potential freeloaders?<p>I expect that is likely to scare people in this order:<p>1. Freeloaders<p>2. Contributors<p>3. Customers<p>If I have a Free Software project, I want to scare freeloaders while still welcoming potential customers and contributors.
