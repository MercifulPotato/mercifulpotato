No sensible person believes blocking QAnon nonsense is a &quot;scandal.&quot; For many reasons, not the least being that it is also the very definition of &quot;unsubstantiated&quot; as is this Hunter Biden story.<p>Applying editorial standards (finally) to some of the more outrageous content posted on social media platforms is no more controversial than that of print media&#x27;s choice to do so.<p>The term &quot;social media&quot; is a complete misnomer to begin with.
