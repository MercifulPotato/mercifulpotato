If you are comparing programmers productivity.. or for a better monitor monitor .. ok let&#x27;s use a 900usd 4800u then.. ok 80% of perf in single core and 140% on multi for less than half the price.. and wait the 5800u and see.. when you compare you have to be fair between the components.. single core bench from 12core 24th vs 4core it&#x27;s the start of every biased bench')
