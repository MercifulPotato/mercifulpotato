Just because a higher level concept made its way into a standard library that doesn&#x27;t male it go away, nor does it eliminate the need to reason and have higher level discussions involving it.<p>Take for example C#. Does it make sense to talk about event loops in C#? Or observers? Or callbacks? Because those are all design patterns, aren&#x27;t they? Great, you don&#x27;t need to add a lot of boilerplate code to get to use one, but you&#x27;re still using the concept and reasoning about the system in terms of these patterns and their features and properties, right?<p>Just because I can buy a ready-made roof instead of having to cut down trees or buy the wood somewhere, that doesn&#x27;t mean that a roof is no longer a roof.')
