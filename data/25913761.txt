Furthermore Covid has demonstrated that society carries on functioning when air-travel is cut to a fraction of its former volume - leaving only international shipping and road-haulage as the remaining oil consumers without a decent post-oil plan yet - but it&#x27;s demonstrable that there&#x27;s plenty of oil left to keep those services running for decades with current proven reserves - considerably more-so with the expected end of gas-powered cars within a couple of decades.<p>The author&#x27;s definition of &quot;cultural bankruptcy&quot; seems to be &quot;the US is exporting individualism to the world, which will mean an inevitable decline to non-cooperation and (insert your preferred game-theory metaphor here)&quot;. Whatever one may think of that, he doesn&#x27;t establish a reasoned connection between the two - just hand-waving.<p>I think the author just has an anxiety disorder that needs better management.')
