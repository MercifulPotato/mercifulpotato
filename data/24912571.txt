Item(by='saagarjha', descendants=None, kids=[24912636], score=None, time=1603836608, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24912464, text='I am in tech, as you might guess ;) I know the type of people mentioned in the parent comment, they go to a handful of schools I could name specifically, and the reason they are that way is that they are either the children of multi-millionaires of billionaires, or are friends with someone who falls into that category, or at the very least go to the school and benefit from the parent donations and atmosphere. That isn&#x27;t to say that there isn&#x27;t a drive to do well at other schools in the valley, but it&#x27;s nothing like &quot;I&#x27;m going to start the next big thing&quot;, it&#x27;s more like &quot;I&#x27;ll make good money at FAANG someday&quot; for most people.')
