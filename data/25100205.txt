I come from a tech background. If I cant figure out how to set myself up in&#x2F;on the fediverse then its doomed to be very, very niche...therefore not a good platform for _social media_. I hope it gets easier to understand&#x2F;use&#x2F;benefit-from. What are the specific barriers? Like not being able to figure out where to sign up for anything. I might be missing the point or maybe its just in its infancy and the software that will run the big social network or other service that could become ubiquitous just hasn&#x27;t been made yet.')
