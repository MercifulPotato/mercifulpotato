There was a really good documentary about memory called How Does Your Memory Work. Highly recommended, you get to see a glimpse of the workings of Susan Polgar&#x27;s brain. I might also confuse it with My Brilliant Brain from National Geographic :)<p>I remember seeing a live post-mortem analysis by Anish Giri. It was just astonishing how fast he can see combinations, yet also how deep those combinations are. And then on top of that throw in a sentence like &quot;Oh, it is not new, it was played in 2006 as well, in that game between him and him&quot;. So really, fast thinking, slow thinking, and picking deep into your memory, all at once, seemingly without any effort. That is 2760 ELO for you :)')
