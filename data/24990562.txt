Political Correctness not only created a Streisand effect, but it also created a martyr mentality for right wing ideas.<p>The sad thing is that the left learned absolutely nothing from 2016 strategy-wise. I remember explaining to my leftist friends at length why people would vote for Trump. They finally understood, I thought. Then 2020 rolls around and it&#x27;s like they forgot everything we discussed. Back to the deplorable playbook.')
