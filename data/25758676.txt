Variable length encoding doesn&#x27;t have to be overly difficult, but x86 is a weird ISA. I&#x27;m not entirely familiar with what you cite so I can&#x27;t really comment, but x86&#x27;s semi-unbounded prefixes and sheer volume of extensions make things difficult.<p>A master&#x27;s project might be to write a decoder, possibly to verify (prove - everything in a CPU has to be formally verified or generated from some other formally verified tool) it.<p>As proof I raise that many disassemblers, which run as software and are therefore much easier to write, still disagree and struggle with x86')
