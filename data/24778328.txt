I&#x27;d guess that a lot of the people signing up for Facebook just for the Quest don&#x27;t follow the same patterns as a typical user, so the algorithm flags them and removes them.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll get reinstated once Facebook manually reviews, but it&#x27;s definitely a major annoyance.<p>Sidenote, I got my quest 2 yesterday and from a hardware standpoint, it&#x27;s blown me away coming from PSVR.  Too bad the Facebook nonsense keeps it from being a must have product.')
