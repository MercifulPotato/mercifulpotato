With the number of games being released every year, especially in a genre dominated with indies, it is difficult to find games to play. Steam&#x27;s tag are all over the place, with most &quot;roguelite&quot; games being tagged as &quot;roguelike&quot; too for publicity, and weird categories like &quot;action roguelike&quot; cropping up on any RPG with some degree of procedural generation.
