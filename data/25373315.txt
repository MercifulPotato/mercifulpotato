You can make anything you want – and more – in the current context, and any particular historical format or container love is anachronistic pointlessness.<p>But you&#x27;re wrong in the sense that development paradigm represented an era where programmers and non-programmers alike could dive in to explore, conceive and create experiences in a way that is more interesting and accessible to a broader group of people than today&#x27;s more modern, powerful practices.<p>The flash plugin itself, as a format, does not enable something different, but the editing environment and culture definitely did, so in some way the death of the container does mark an end of a particular creative era in digital society.<p>Perhaps only for the participants, and even then I&#x27;m not mournful, but it is an ever-so-slightly sentimental moment for those that witnessed that fusion of creativity between types who were decidedly not technologoical and those who were, fused in a shared creative endeavour.')
