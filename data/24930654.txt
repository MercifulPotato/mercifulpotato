Most of them are, in fact, utterly pointless; SELECT statements that return no values, SELECT statements that return <i>all</i> values (equally pointless), SELECT statements that return complicated sets of values but have essentially no mathematical interest because there is no practical way to represent them as anything smaller or more interesting, etc.<p>In this massive sea of results, you should expect a lot of interesting things to exist. Finding them is tricky; in percentage terms they make up 0% of the results, but we have mechanisms for finding some of them.<p>Basically, there are so infinitely many mathematical statements that there can&#x27;t help but be a large supply of &quot;interesting&quot; statements like this.<p>For an interesting view on that, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mathematical_coincidence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mathematical_coincidence</a> . These are true statements or almost true statements (near equalities) about a wide variety of numbers that are essentially meaningless... it&#x27;s just there&#x27;s so many ways of putting things together that there are inevitably large numbers of these things (the wiki page is just a sampling).<p>You can even generate these mathematical coincidences yourself. Create a program that will systematically iterate over abstract syntax trees of mathematical expressions involving whatever combination of mathematical operators (+-Ã—&#x2F;, sqrt, log, sin, whatever) and numbers you like (the first ten integers, e, i, pi, whatever else you like), store up a table of results and emit any two expressions that are, say, within .01% of each other. You will rapidly find a ton of results, because it turns out that even with modest numbers of operators, there are far more mathematical expressions than there are small numbers for them to result in separated by more than .01%. If you think about it, this program can&#x27;t <i>help</i> but emit a lot of results. Some of them will be humanly &quot;interesting&quot;. A few of them will even be mathematically interesting (e.g., this procedure will generate the famous Euler identity relatively quickly if you included the relevant operators and numbers).<p>On a larger scale, this is also known as the Strong Law of Small Numbers: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Strong_Law_of_Small_Numbers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Strong_Law_of_Small_Numbers</a> The previous paragraph is a very bite-sized example of why this holds that you can code up yourself if you are interested.')
