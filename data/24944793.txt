So you don&#x27;t have to set up connections on each call or handle your own pooling. \n* comes with builtin fast (de &amp;)serialization using protobuf. \n* uses a definition language to generate SDKs for a whole bunch of languages. \n* makes testing super easy because your testing team, if you have a separate one, can make an SDK in their preferred language and write tests.<p>Much better developer experience and performance writing HTTP services and code to call them.<p>Cons are \n* not being able to use Postman &#x2F; firebug, nothing on the wire is human-readable\n* load balancer support is sketchy because of the use of HTTP trailers and full path HTTP&#x2F;2. That&#x27;s why AWS ALB supporting it is news. \n* The auth story isn&#x27;t very clear. Do you use the out of band setup or add tokens in every single RPC?')
