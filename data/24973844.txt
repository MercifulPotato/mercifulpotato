A dedicated entity can shoot entirely new original scenes (unique footage), deepfake actors’ faces to look like the people they’re targeting, edit it all together, and possibly add CG VFX as a final layer to make the resulting video look very real[0].<p>Of course, knowing all that is not really necessary for someone to shrug off truthful incriminating footage as “fake news”.<p>[0] One caveat is that deepfaking works better with higher quality footage. To produce a complicated scene with altered actor faces while maintaining realistic “phone video” look, it would make sense to film with good lighting and high-quality gear into log or raw format, and then imitate the look in post-production after deepfaking is applied.<p>Thus, one method of detecting such fakes could be by checking for traces of VFX, artificial noise, signature lens properties, signature behavior of phone video recording “magic” (such as noise reduction and stabilization), etc. Enough of producer’s dedication could make that tricky, but IMO it could be easier than applying automated deepfake detection straight up—it’d be buried early enough in post-production workflow, with a lot of noise introduced by subsequent “phone look” VFX.')
