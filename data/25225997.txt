But beyond that, I&#x27;m super appreciative for keeping the community consistently amazing throughout the years.<p>I&#x27;ve seen heated discussions here. Dang always offers constructive guidance when discourse devolves or gets off topic. It&#x27;s never preachy, and it usually leads to amicable results when I see it.<p>In years past I commented in frustration that HN was at risk of becoming like Reddit. Dang said not to do this and pointed out a community rule discouraging it. Looking back, I was completely wrong in that judgment. HN is one of the few places that really hasn&#x27;t changed. There are brilliant people from all walks of life and at various intersections of our industry, all coming together to ask questions and share our perspective. There isn&#x27;t anything else like it.<p>HN isn&#x27;t without faults, but it&#x27;s the best community on the Internet as far as I&#x27;m aware. Frequently informative, always entertaining. I learn more every day because of HN.<p>Dang,<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;w7SRSzF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;w7SRSzF</a> (warning: audio)<p>Thank you.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23968134" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23968134</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gigazine.net&#x2F;news&#x2F;20200728-vocodes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gigazine.net&#x2F;news&#x2F;20200728-vocodes&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hightech.fm&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;28&#x2F;ai-celebrity-voice" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hightech.fm&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;28&#x2F;ai-celebrity-voice</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypebeast.kr&#x2F;2020&#x2F;7&#x2F;vocodes-free-launching-text-to-speach-service-bill-gates-barack-obama" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypebeast.kr&#x2F;2020&#x2F;7&#x2F;vocodes-free-launching-text-to-s...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.larazon.es&#x2F;tecnologia&#x2F;20200803&#x2F;zdj5mf47zfc6rmci5aguhewxcu.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.larazon.es&#x2F;tecnologia&#x2F;20200803&#x2F;zdj5mf47zfc6rmci5...</a>')
