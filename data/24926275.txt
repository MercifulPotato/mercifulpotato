Obviously, skill and time are scarce resources and the result is that most SPAs are crap.<p>OTOH all these component based frameworks have definitely brought us a much better way to produce interactive experiences compared to the jQuery days. This is not related to SPAs at all. You can use React&#x2F;Vue&#x2F;etc in a multipage application. The problem is that to hydrate (make interactive) the server rendered HTML you now need to duplicate your markup between your server language and front end framework. The solution is to use the same framework in the backend and the front and write the components just once.')
