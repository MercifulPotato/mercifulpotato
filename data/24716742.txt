Should it be used at all then? Is it acceptable that it&#x27;s harder for the ~15% of the population to get a passport than the rest of the population because of an algorithm in the loop?<p>I don&#x27;t think you can put it down to other factors like socio-economics as the Home Office reproduced this in their user testing before launch and acknowledged as a problem of the system (Vs the photos)')
