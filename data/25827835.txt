Estimates help narrow down what is important and what isn&#x27;t.<p>Maybe you want features x, y and z. If it takes a day then X is worthwhile, if it&#x27;s going to take a month don&#x27;t bother. Z must be done so if that&#x27;s going to take a long time we need to drop y.<p>One of the best product owners I&#x27;ve worked for would often ask for estimates and base plans and features from those. Some things would be easy technically and valuable, others harder and just a nice to have (but worth it if it only pushed things back a day).')
