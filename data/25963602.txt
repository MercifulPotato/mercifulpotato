But since I finally got fed up with shell scripting, I want to find a proper viable long-term alternative. I know that for most of my scripts I won&#x27;t care neither for startup time nor for strong typing (just an example, I know that OCaml and thus F# have it) won&#x27;t be necessary. But I just want to have a powerful tool in my hands for those few outlier cases where you&#x27;ll get pissed off at slow startup.<p>But I can still agree with you!<p>&gt; <i>For historical context, around 1994, I ditched shell with heavy awk and add use in favour of Perl to avoid the heavy overhead of multiple processes being spawned by the shell scripts.</i><p>I feel a novice now. :D<p>To be fair, there weren&#x27;t things I wasn&#x27;t able to achieve with zsh scripts and `parallel` and the usual suspects (sed, awk et. al.) but when I measure how much time -- and sometimes sanity -- I lose until I make something rather trivial work, the analysis isn&#x27;t in favour of my current workflow. 500 &quot;quick and dirty&quot; scripts each wasting you 3h as opposed to 5-10 minutes amounts to a LOT of wasted work time.<p>To be fair, I was not inclined to use F#. OCaml always impressed me with its amazingly fast compiler. But you have a very solid point that with F# you can use the entire .NET ecosystem...<p>&gt; <i>So you have to know both what you need but also which alternatives you are benchmarking it against.</i><p>I don&#x27;t know <i>exactly</i> what I need, for the better or the worse. I just want to do one big switch (away from sh&#x2F;bash&#x2F;zsh scripting) and not have to redo it anytime soon, is all.<p>Most tasks are I&#x2F;O bound anyway so normal shell scripting and `parallel` can take you VERY far. But I&#x27;ve been bitten by weak typing and surprisingly parsed values so I am looking for something stricter. Runtime speed is hardly relevant to anything because again, I&#x2F;O bound is the norm (_especially_ when you work with the network; most network-bound tasks that people put in their scripts nowadays could easily be handled by a Pentium III from back in the day, I feel).')
