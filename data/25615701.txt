I&#x27;m a physics&#x2F;EE major by training and career-wise I&#x27;m focused on ML and robotics, but I love art and <i>especially</i> using art to visualize science in ways that are understandable to the general public. (I&#x27;m also doing an astrophotography project to show the visual sizes of various nebulae. Your usual NASA photos don&#x27;t really provide any sense of scale, and many people have the misconception that you need insane magnification to see them, but there are actually a whole lot of objects that are visually much bigger than the moon, just too dim to see.)<p>Being an engineer by background my network is mostly engineers -- I don&#x27;t really have any strong connections with galleries and media, but I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for them! I welcome intros if anyone would be so kind. :) TIA!')
