Now it doesn’t matter if you decentralised all the infrastructure, the tech is too cheap to <i>avoid</i> total surveillance.<p>Now, laser mics are school projects, and the hardware cost for pointing one at each and every window in London 24&#x2F;7 is significantly lower than the annual cost of the Metropolitan Police Service in the same city.<p>Now, your WiFi can be converted into a wall-penetrating radar, do pose detection, heart rate and breathing detection.<p>Now, my wristwatch knows when I walk past the charging station to turn on its screen and remind me of its existence. I don’t even know <i>how</i> it knows when I’m walking past.<p>Now, I have an IR camera that can see through some opaque-to-visible-light materials for no good reason and at pocket-money prices.<p>“Centralised” has its problems, but getting rid of centralisation isn’t enough.')
