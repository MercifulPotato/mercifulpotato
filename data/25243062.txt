Pretty interesting find.<p>The arrow in the picture appears to be metal so not stone age. And the question of why so many in that spot? Did something in the ice collect them there from all over? Or was their a seasonal hunting ground where these guys hunted?<p>Sadly what I see in hunting spots around the bay are discarded plastic shotgun shell hulls[1]. Sadly I think those things will last for a very long time.<p>[1] Yes, I pick them up when I find them and hike them out but clearly not everyone does.')
