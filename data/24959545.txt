And for the record I&#x27;m currently in Australia and spent the early part of COVID pandemic in the US so have familiarity with both sides of the equation):<p>Does anyone have a plan to get the world out of COVID?  Previous pandemics such as SARS&#x2F;MERS were contained but had no vaccine, Spanish Flu wasn&#x27;t contained but there were lasting antibodies (up to 90 years![0]).  For COVID all we&#x27;ve been doing is &quot;hoping for a vaccine&quot; which by all accounts[1] will only be 70% effective and will likely require boosters.  The world is on a roller coaster of going into and out of lockdown (see Europe this week instituting stay at home orders again) and all the while _there is no plan_ for the world to get past this.<p>So I ask again, does anyone have any kind of plan to get the world back to normal?  In Melbourne, Australia, people are wearing masks and &quot;buying time for a vaccine&quot; but when it comes it won&#x27;t help the at-risk portions of the population.  In the US there seems to be no plan at all.  Nowhere in the world has anyone come up with a pathway forward to return the human race to a way of life similar to where we were at in 2019.<p>So, given there are so many people in here skilled at decomposing problems and articulating effective solutions, and given there most likely won&#x27;t be a &gt;70% effective vaccine in the next 2-3 years, what is the way forward for the world?  Or are we to be mired in an endless cycle of lockdown&#x2F;open&#x2F;lockdown for as far as the eye can see.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2008&#x2F;08&#x2F;080817223642.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2008&#x2F;08&#x2F;080817223642.h...</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;12&#x2F;health&#x2F;covid-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;12&#x2F;health&#x2F;covid-vaccines.htm...</a>')
