Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609470203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600294, text='&gt; Your assertions are simply not borne out by historical truth<p>What assertions?<p>&gt; there have been periods of history where there was no inflation or deflation, where there was plenty of investment and growth.<p>That...doesn&#x27;t contradict anything I&#x27;ve said. I have not stated or implied that, in the absence of inflation or deflation, one would not expect productive investment and growth. I have agreed with upthread claims that deflation discourages economic activity, and also pointed out that the effect you praise of deflation discouraging consumption is an example of discouraging economic activity.<p>&gt; For example, post-civil war US.<p>You mean the 1865-1867 recession (which also featured significant deflation, not “no inflation or deflation”) or the 1869-1870 recession (ditto), or the Long Depression starting in 1873 (ditto, again.) The post Civil War 19thC USA is actually a pretty good example of the association between deflation and poor economic performance, and definitely not an example (for good or ill) of a period with “no inflation or deflation”.')
