Pretty much every company does this.<p>You offer a product that would normally be paid, for free and gain market share. Then you build a business on top of that customer base you created.<p>That&#x27;s where WhatsApp comes in for Facebook. They&#x27;ve gained huge market share, now they can attract businesses that want to sell directly to consumers. This is pretty handy and common in countries like Brazil.<p>Before people start shouting against Facebook, I&#x27;ll reiterate that every company does this:\n- Microsoft did by driving PCs&#x27; prices down so they could gain software market share.\n- Stripe does it, with things like Stripe Atlas. They commoditize creating your own business by making it very simple. The idea is that [some of] those new businesses will eventually use Stripe and will help the company grow.<p>This is a pretty common pattern.')
