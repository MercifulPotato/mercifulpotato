The efficacy of 94% is simply 1-5&#x2F;90.<p>When you have only 5 infections in the vaccinated group, you can have at most 5 minorities represented there. So, if for example you don&#x27;t have any Native Americans, it will look like the efficacy for Native Americans is 100%.<p>The better title for MIT&#x27;s research would be &quot;No statistical difference for the vaccine efficacy across racial groups&quot;, but that wouldn&#x27;t be so exciting, would it?')
