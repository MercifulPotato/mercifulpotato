When I switched to Kubuntu i felt like I was finally home. I always heard bad things about KDE but the thing that I found there might be the best desktop environment at the moment. I like it better than OSX even.<p>Ofc there are some annoying things on Linux machines (e.g. having to research more before buying hardware), but Windows isn&#x27;t without it&#x27;s annoyances as well (e.g. bloatware like MS Edge that will try to get your attention once in a while, some things that you can easily achieve on a linux machine are cumbersome or impossible to solve, and the ways you do it change much faster than on Linux etc)<p>I use both. But for dev stuff I prefer Linux by a lot.')
