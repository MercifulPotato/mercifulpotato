Item(by='saghm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607804277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25400139, text='I hadn&#x27;t realized that dark mode came out for Github, so I went and enabled it, and wow, even as a fan of &quot;darker&quot; dark modes (rather than the medium gray that so many apps and sites seem to prefer), I can see what OP meant! The main issue for me is that the text colors are all fairly dark as well; I&#x27;m sure that my tastes are too gaudy for most people, but I find higher contrast much easier to read, and on the off-chance that anyone else is like me and prefers much brighter text, I threw this CSS together:<p>```\n.link-gray-dark, .news li blockquote, .link-gray, .text-gray, .text-gray-light, .UnderlineNav-item, .blob-code-inner {\n    color: white !important;\n}<p>&#x2F;* code comments are a dark gray by default, so I made them something brighter *&#x2F;\n.pl-c {\n    color: orange !important;\n}\n```<p>As a bonus, if you also can&#x27;t stand the sidebar on the right of the main page, you can hide it and reclaim the space for more useful content with this:<p>```\n[aria-label=&quot;Explore&quot;] {\n    display: none !important;\n}\n```')
