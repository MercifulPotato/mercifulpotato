Rather I think this is the influence of the &#x27;Anglosphere&#x27; online both in term of culture and of tech (for example in Spanish autocompletion could insert the opening marks but it&#x27;s probably often not even considered by the devs).<p>Indeed tech is not made in a local-friendly way normally - for example, losing those symbols is a direct consequence of the fact that they are usually buried with other rarely used symbols. But for cases like punctuation, I don&#x27;t really mind it. It might just be me but I&#x27;ve never cared about &quot; vs » and I&#x27;m happy to have an international standard to make things easier. diacritics are more important (n vs ñ, o vs ó) but those are usually far better covered by autocomplete, so no complains there.')
