We&#x27;re evolving beyond the raw survival of the fittest that determined who lived and who died when we were essentially animals.<p>Many of us spend most of our lives healthy enough not to need help, but either we care that others do, or else we selfishly recognize that we could find ourselves needing help someday for unexpected reasons outside our control.
