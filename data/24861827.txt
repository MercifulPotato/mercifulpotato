Instead, asking WHY he believes gives you the opportunity to engage in the discussion, maybe change your views a little or change the other persons&#x27; a bit.<p>That&#x27;s why comments like that are annoying, they&#x27;re a way to dismiss discussion instead of engaging in it, and engaging in discussion is the point of this silly site.<p>I&#x27;m someone who also isn&#x27;t wealthy and disagrees with wealth taxes. Responses like that one aren&#x27;t an honest attempt to engage, and I&#x27;d also ignore it and move on :)')
