I think it is pretty well established that at least for civil litigation between the parties, the existence of a contract license covering the work generally <i>requires</i> the aggrieved party to proceed under contract law, not bare copyright law. It is at least reasonably consistent that the same should bar criminal copyright action, as well.')
