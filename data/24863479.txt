There won&#x27;t be anyone there to talk to.<p>Not that there (usually) is now.  9cm is a big loss to the amateur community, but honestly, it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s currently heavily used, or for lack of alternative bands to communicate on.  The band in question is not &quot;mainstream&quot; in ham radio in the way that lower (HF, VHF, UHF) frequencies are; it&#x27;s used by microwave experimenters, and almost exclusively with home-built equipment.  (You can&#x27;t just buy an off-the-shelf, ready-to-use 9cm transceiver; at best you could probably buy a transverter, but many hams who are interested in this band will construct their equipment from scratch.)<p>The reason it&#x27;s a big loss -- bigger than it would seem based purely on utilization -- is that, like every amateur band, it has its own peculiar characteristics, and experimenters are therefore losing an important and unique domain to experiment in.  9cm in particular is the lowest-frequency amateur band that is unarguably located in the &quot;microwave&quot; range, so it&#x27;s of particular interest for that reason alone.  And it&#x27;s a wide allocation, which is especially relevant in an era of high-bandwidth digital communication: lower frequency amateur allocations have correspondingly less bandwidth to work with, as well as, in general, stronger restrictions on how that bandwidth can be used.<p>Of course the loss also sets a depressing precedent.  The majority of hams have never used the 3.4 GHz band (and now they&#x27;ll never get to!) But what band are we going to lose next?')
