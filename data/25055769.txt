They&#x27;ll likely end up with the encrypted secret key, but no way to access it. That&#x27;s because the password is something you <i>know</i>, and divulging it could mean self-incrimination.<p>Courts have ruled, for example, that the police can compel a suspect to put their face or finger up to a phone to unlock it through biometric means, but a suspect cannot be compelled to divulge their PIN. That&#x27;s why using biometrics, while convenient, is a bad idea.')
