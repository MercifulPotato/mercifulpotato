Things that happen in quantum mechanics are not necessarily explainable using spacetime.<p>Although in general physicists believe a lot of things from spacetime for QM, like that information can&#x27;t travel faster than light, it isn&#x27;t actually baked into QM.<p>That&#x27;s my understanding at least.')
