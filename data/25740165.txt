Just in case I didn&#x27;t make myself clear, I don&#x27;t mean substituting the hashing on the server, I mean adding it on the client.<p>&gt; Also it would require additional roundtrip to server in order to get the stored salt.<p>It could be salted with some constant&#x2F;domain name.<p>&gt; Then there is the UX problem where mechanism like that would have to be implemented on the browser level<p>What I am saying could perfectly be done with javascript, although I don&#x27;t see why browsers could not integrate it too.<p>&gt; which according to some leads to “ugly and confusing” UI.<p>I am completely lost, I am not sure if you understood me but I don&#x27;t understand what you mean. Can you explain yourself further or provide a resource that explains this UX problem you&#x27;re talking about?')
