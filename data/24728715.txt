Item(by='flohofwoe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602241561, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24727622, text='What <i>is</i> the Mac target audience if not &quot;professional creatives&quot; though (which got a late huge influx of developers who wanted a &quot;UNIX machine that just works&quot; when Apple switched from MacOS to OSX, and those are also the first to leave now). Maybe the market in the US is very different, but in Europe the Mac always used to be a &quot;professional tool&quot; for creating things. The way OSX&#x2F;macOS has been going in the last decade alienates many of those users.<p>I struggle to see the point in that strategy. We&#x27;re at a point where the &#x27;average user&#x27; doesn&#x27;t need a computer, since even cheap noname mobile phone are good enough for most things now. Why turn the Mac into an oversized mobile phone? This won&#x27;t attract any new users who are happy with their phone, it just will drive away the people who bought a computer because it lets them do stuff that&#x27;s not possible on a phone.<p>PS: My comment reads a bit snobbish, which wasn&#x27;t my intention. I do believe that no actual &quot;average user&quot; (or &quot;homogeneous&quot; target audience) exists in the real world. Thus it doesn&#x27;t make sense to create a single setup which targets such an &quot;average user&quot;. Options, customization and (for some people at least) being able to poke into the guts of the system are important, and that&#x27;s what Apple is taking away on macOS, and that&#x27;s what makes macOS more and more unattractive.')
