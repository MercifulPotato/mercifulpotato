Over hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, humans seem to have been generally tuned to avoid specific, concrete, short-term threats to their own life&#x2F;health individually, or perhaps extending very slightly just to their own family&#x2F;group&#x2F;tribe, but anything that&#x27;s a threat more generally, more abstractly or longer-term tends to fall off the radar quickly, even if there&#x27;s a high probability that those things might turn into an existential threat to the individual at some point in the future.<p>I&#x27;m also curious how (or if) we&#x27;re going to learn to collectively solve some of these long-term problems before many of them really start to turn into those specific, concrete, short-term threats to us as individuals, at which point many of the &quot;easier&quot; solutions may no longer be effective anymore.')
