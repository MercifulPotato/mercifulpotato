If you say &quot;round in some direction&quot; this is now a policy that must propagate to every bit in the stack that touches input and rendering.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s no worse than the current solution for that screen and better for the one that matches.<p>It actually is much worse for the one that doesn&#x27;t match, because now you have lost the ability to do pixel-perfect scaling.')
