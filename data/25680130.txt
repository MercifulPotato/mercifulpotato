If you are detained, which the police have ample power to do so if you for example just broke into the Capitol, if you don&#x27;t identify yourself usually you _will_ get arrested.<p>So yeah, if you are not arrested you don&#x27;t have to identify yourself. But if the police show up and you are clearly committing a crime if you actively refuse to identify yourself you will get arrested and you will have to identify yourself.')
