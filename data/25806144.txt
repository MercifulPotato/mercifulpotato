And the problems with C enums that people complain about don&#x27;t apply for me. That&#x27;s not what I mean by &quot;use of types&quot;. What I mean by it is significant &quot;programming in type language&quot; as opposed to &quot;in code language&quot;. Programming in type language I find unappealing because it is very indirect, implicit, and typically achieves very little per line of code.')
