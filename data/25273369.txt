Those English classes were in fact a load of hot garbage. In the two decades since I graduated, I have not once been asked to write Marxist literary criticism of poetry. I haven&#x27;t even been asked to produce a bibliography, especially not a punctuation-perfect one in MLA format.<p>Reasonably correct use of the English language is important, but that wasn&#x27;t taught. Grammar is not part of a typical English class at the college level. It&#x27;s a college admission requirement. I probably met the requirement in 6th grade. Even if grammar were covered in college, it&#x27;s not likely to stick if the previous 12 to 15 years of school didn&#x27;t make it stick.')
