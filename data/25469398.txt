I could equally ask you to justify your cynical view of &quot;big tech companies&quot;.  But I won&#x27;t because I&#x27;m perfectly fine working with your chosen bias.  Especially since you were so up front about it.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m no fan of Google either, and I accept this cynical view of them.  But there&#x27;s plenty of space for cynicism on both sides in this situation.  She was pressing the nuclear option by threatening to resign, so I assume that the relationship was already strained.  And I severely doubt that it was entirely over the one cited instance.  Therefore, I doubt she&#x27;s going public to try to win her job back.<p>She could solely be trying to give Google a black eye on her way out, whether out of disgust or altruism.  But doing so requires her to paint Google as &quot;the bad guy&quot;, and that in turn requires her to paint herself as &quot;the good guy&quot;.  So net effect is the same, regardless of motivation.')
