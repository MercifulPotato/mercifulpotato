We have more than enough history to corroborate.<p>&gt; And 2008 has killed plenty of people, by rendering them homeless, hungy, and unable to afford healthcare.<p>Right, and these events are rare and noteworthy also â€” the only other time that had happened before that was during the 1930&#x27;s. The same cannot be said for structural changes in government. In addition, if you think the scale and severity of economic deaths of despair caused by 2008 can be compared with the civil wars in the Middle East, the Balkan Kosovo War, the World Wars (and Holocaust), or what&#x27;s going on in Central Africa...I really don&#x27;t know what to say.')
