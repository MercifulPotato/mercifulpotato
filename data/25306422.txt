In addition, the visitors sitting at tables with cases A and C (V1, V6, and V7) were not infected with COVID-19 because they faced away from the infectorâ€™s face. These findings strongly suggest that this outbreak occurred by droplet transmission exceeding a 2 m distance and excluded contact and fomite transmission. This transmission pattern is similar with the outbreak of a restaurant with air conditioning in Guangzhou, China.21 In this article, the authors concluded that the most likely transmission was done by droplet and also emphasized the direction of air flow.*<p>Also they analyzed the RNA to confirm linkage.')
