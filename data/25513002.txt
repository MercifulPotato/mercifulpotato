I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to separate the two.  Just some forms of manipulation are fairly benign, while others aren&#x27;t.<p>Still, I think banning advertising is a bad idea, even if I personally would be happy if I never saw a bit of advertising again in my life.  It can perform a valuable function, especially if there&#x27;s an underdog that is trying to offer a competing widget, say one that is more sustainable and also cheaper.  Without advertising, I could see a large incumbent making it nearly impossible for this underdog to make a dent, which would harm customers of that product category.<p>In that case the advertising isn&#x27;t &quot;hey, I&#x27;m going to use psychology to convince you to buy this thing you don&#x27;t have and don&#x27;t really need&quot; (the thing I object to), but &quot;hey, I know you already buy this thing, but I&#x27;d like you to consider buying my version of it, which is objectively and factually better than the thing you&#x27;re already buying&quot;.  I think <i>that</i> is valuable information to get into the hands of potential customers.<p>But I just don&#x27;t see a way of legislating away the psychological-manipulation types of ads while keeping the genuinely informative and useful kind, at least not without purveyors of the former finding loopholes to pretend that they&#x27;re pushing the latter.')
