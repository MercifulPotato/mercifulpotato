Apple is a shared experience.<p>Nobody gives a hoot about Dell, Lenovo, HP, etc because they are just commodity providers. People <i>do</i> very much care about Microsoft, but they do so on different horizontal layers — finance guys love Excel, IT guys love AD, developers love Visual Studio. But... there is no shared experience.<p>I think bias is the wrong characterization. End of the day, Apple is very good at communicating their position on things, and they do it across their portfolio. My nine year old son is somehow excited about the M1 chip. Some of the stuff that sounds like bias is really a reflection of people actually knowing what the company is doing.<p>Other than niche companies like Ferrari, I can’t think of anyone better at marketing and communications than Apple.')
