Then word came down from up high that the company was standardizing on a single chat platform and that platform was Teams. Now there is basically no Slack being used (and certainly no paid Slack) any more.<p>The main argument was that Slack for 13k employees was incredibly expensive, while Teams was &#x27;free&#x27; and already integrated into most of their infrastructure.')
