Here&#x27;s an image of my account holdings.&quot; is that market manipulation?  If I go on my youtube channel and explain my reasoning is that market manipulation?<p>In both cases I guess you could say &quot;Yes.&quot; and I might agree, but I do not believe it rises to the level of illegality.<p>I could see the SEC looking at this, deciding that it represents collusion and should not be allowed and clawing back the &quot;ill gotten&quot; gains.<p>Blockchain based settlement anyone?')
