So the last thing you want to happen is for the virus to catch the vulnerables in the last moment before they are vaccinated and essentially renders the whole vaccination program ineffective.<p>Of course there&#x27;s the debate of this whole pandemic about the harm to economy and people&#x27;s lives etc. To me the majority of the damage has already been done and can&#x27;t be undone. So I&#x27;d like the measures to be taken to end this ASAP, even if they are even stricter, and to mitigate the harm as much as possible. But I highly doubt that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to happen. The actual policy effects may be neither here nor there.')
