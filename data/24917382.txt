I personally think that there will be a huge no-code revolution, because of the simple fact that there are still a lot of manual paper-based poor efficiency processes in businesses.<p>Without no-code software, the cost to automate a simple business process which takes a low paid admin worker 3 hours per week might be:<p>* Requirements Gathering (Let&#x27;s say 1 day)<p>* Development time (Let&#x27;s say only 5 days)<p>* Testing time (Let&#x27;s say its fast and only takes 1 day)<p>* Bug fixing (Another day)<p>* Ongoing Support and changes (estimated 25% per year)<p>So at $500 per day and this incredibly conservative timeline, let&#x27;s say that solving that simple business process costs $4,000 capex with $1,000 annual costs including infra. This saves 3 hours of work for someone on minimum wage... $2,340 per year.<p>A few problems:<p>* Problem Number 1 - This doesn&#x27;t meet most companies hurdle rates (&gt;2 year payback).<p>* Problem Number 2 - The problem wont be deemed &#x27;big value&#x27; enough to get IT resource assigned<p>* Problem Number 3 - People in general want to work on &#x27;bigger problems&#x27; and will hate going solo on a tiny piece of work to reduce a single workers week very slightly.<p>Ok, so that&#x27;s fine from a company perspective, but look at it from the minimum wage workers perspective - They might be doing something that they KNOW they themselves could automate, but their IT department won&#x27;t do it because they deem their time too valuable, and they aren&#x27;t allowed to do it themselves because they aren&#x27;t deemed knowledgeable enough.<p>No-Code shouldn&#x27;t aim to solve all problems, it should aim to solve the problems that are below IT&#x27;s threshold but still deliver user value, otherwise there is value left on the table and you have people doing work that could be better automated or put on a better platform.<p>It&#x27;s not to replace everything, its to build something that&#x27;s better than excel and paper, when your IT department can&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t build it because of capacity&#x2F;hurdle rates&#x2F;investment.')
