It&#x27;s anti-tax&#x2F;regulation propaganda.<p>Put your business hats back on: Companies don&#x27;t price based on some &#x27;cost plus&#x27; formula (e.g., &#x27;our cost is $100, a 20% markups is &#x27;fair&#x27;, therefore we&#x27;ll charge $120!&#x27;). If they did, your soda would cost 10 cents (rough estimate). Don&#x27;t ask what your software would cost.<p>Companies set prices to maximize their profits. When Uber&#x27;s costs decrease, do they cut prices or take more profit? Do they tell this story when other expenses increase? This expense is no different than all their other ones in terms of its affect on pricing. When competitive SV salaries increase, does Uber whine and say they are forced to raise prices by the cruel demands of software developers? What about when the drivers&#x27; expenses increase, such as the cost of gasoline? On an economic level, pricing depends on supply and demand, and price changes depend on the elasticity of demand (among other things).<p>The new law merely causes Uber to share more of its profits with the drivers. If Uber wants to raise prices, that&#x27;s their problem.')
