The positive countries are all European and Japan, while Turkey is almost two standard deviations negative despite having seriously stronger &quot;socialist&quot; institutions like worker protection, free healhcare and consumer rights.<p>My hunch is, the writer started with regressing solely on socialism and tacked on democracy (which is very heavily correlated with wealth in Europe) after not getting the results he wanted.
