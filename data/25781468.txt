No one in finance is doing accounting or model estimation using Python&#x27;s floats; they are using numpy&#x27;s float32 (or float64) type instead. I think a more accurate version of what you&#x27;re saying is that static type checking is useful when modeling complicated contracts; this might be true, but I think it&#x27;s not that important, as those things aren&#x27;t that liquid anyway.<p>Jane Street&#x27;s decision to use OCaml is almost as much about hiring and history as it is about language features.')
