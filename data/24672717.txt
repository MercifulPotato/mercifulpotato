And the direction of the arrow of time is determined by how many different paths there are pointing away from any given point- points that you’re more likely to land on if you travel between connected states randomly are your most likely future, and the points you’re least likely to land on are your past.<p>In that understanding, in a point like the Big Bang, the network of points is more evenly connected so that there isn’t any clear future or past, which is why time appears to start there.  Every point is the future from that configuration and there is no past.')
