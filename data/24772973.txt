I kinda hate how conspiracy-theory-ish it sounds, but I can&#x27;t much deny it any more?<p>I&#x27;m one anecdotal data point:<p>Never heard of this guy, but the cold shower thing just sounded plausible enough that I figured I&#x27;d try it.<p>Not even the whole thing cold -- I start off with a hot shower and then just drop it for the last minute or so, as long as I can stand.<p>And -- it&#x27;s CRAZY.
