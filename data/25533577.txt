I bet Brexit would have never happened - there&#x27;d have been too much legitimacy in a recent vote and the leaders could not have justified a referendum.<p>The &#x27;empty shelves&#x27; &#x2F; &#x27;rationing medicine&#x27; memes are ridiculous.<p>The EU is 80% about trade, it always has been, and very few people had existential qualms with that. There would hardly be such a thing as a &#x27;Eurosceptic&#x27; if they focused on that.')
