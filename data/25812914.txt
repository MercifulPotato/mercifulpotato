The parts written by Griesemer are less pleasant, no offense to him<p>But some of Go&#x27;s language decisions only become clear once you&#x27;ve written a lot of Go<p>For example, the &quot;var name = expr&quot; declaration form seems unnecessary in light of the short &quot;:=&quot; form but it is in the language to allow indented declaration blocks like this (where some variables get an initial value and some get just a type):<p><pre><code>  var (\n      text []byte\n      last int\n      more = true\n  )\n  ...\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve been using Go for 3 years and the more Go I write, the more I appreciate it.
