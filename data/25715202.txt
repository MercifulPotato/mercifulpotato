This makes me more inclined to believe them over you. I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong, but as someone who doesn&#x27;t know much about the market, I do not see the implicit&#x2F;obvious points that would prove the article wrong. Furthermore, being wrong in the past does not preclude someone from being right about the future, and vice versa.')
