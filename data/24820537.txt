I used to pay for it but then ended up having a stack of unread magazines because I tried to read every page. I really should renew my subscription as their articles are in depth and I&#x27;m often amazed how can they crank out so many great articles within a week.<p>Having said that - I see many tech people complain about pay walls even though many of us make $100k+. Pay walls on websites aren&#x27;t that expensive. Wait till people find out how much the Economists costs.')
