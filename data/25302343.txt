It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s frequently associated with a load of additional information that could eventually be used to identify someone (think advertising cookies when associated with a load of browsing data). So you can&#x27;t escape from scope by saying you&#x27;re using a unique ID rather than a name.<p>IP addresses are slightly different because that address can be used to identify the subscriber in certain cases (who in turn may or may not be an individual).')
