Uninstalling from the disk implies that you&#x27;ll reuse the existing filesystem on the computer.<p>Each of your named OSes has different preferences as to which filesystem they will run on, each filesystem with different capabilities and expectations. Windows - NTFS, OS X - APFS and HFS+, Linux - depending on which flavour you choose. Thus an uninstallation program isn&#x27;t really much use, because the installation of anything new should blow that away.<p>Or is it you wish that your computer had a bootstrap program when you powered it on which would source an installation image (for Windows, OS X, whatever Linux flavour you prefer)?<p>To that last one Apple machines do offer this in a limited fashion in the form of &quot;Internet Recovery&quot;, plug in a blank disk into a Mac or delete the GPT on your SSD and it will offer to connect to wifi&#x2F;ethernet to download the installation image for either the version of OS X it shipped with, or alternatively the version last installed (I cannot recall which). Though of course it won&#x27;t help source any installation media of the other OS families.<p>This installation image is a cut down version of OS X which will provide just enough drivers to get the system functional, the disk drive formatting tools, a command line interface with a number of basic system tools to troubleshoot with, and a functioning web browser.')
