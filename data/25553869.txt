Item(by='ryanSrich', descendants=None, kids=[25553940], score=None, time=1609099929, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25553804, text='&gt; Figma<p>Figma isn’t very good. It’s better than sketch for prototyping, but not as good for vector. It’s also web based, so it’s painfully slow. I also think it’s a bit expensive.<p>&gt; Gsuite<p>Google is an evil company, but it’s a choice between giving an evil company money, or using a terrible product (O365). I have to focus on the business, not wondering why Outlook isn’t filtering Spam. So Gsuite it is.<p>&gt; Gusto<p>Gusto is fine really. I contemplated putting this one in the Happily category, but ultimately  decided to move it down given that I do think it’s a bit expensive for what you get.<p>&gt; Stripe<p>Stripe’s core payment processing is obviously the best around. Where I have issue with Stripe is in the fees they charge (pretty high), and their new Customer Billing Portal. It’s a half baked product that doesn’t support even slightly complex billing mechanisms.<p>&gt; Netlify<p>Netfliy is a good product, and I enjoy using it, but their pricing is strange. I can host 10 sites for free but it’s $15 per user for a collaborator? Seems weird. I’d happily pay say $30&#x2F;m for unlimited users.')
