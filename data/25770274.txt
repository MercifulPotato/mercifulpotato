Not even close.<p>Just a few pointers: polling on peripherals instead of interrupts (i.e. USB vs. PS&#x2F;2 and DIN) introducing input lag, software no longer running in ring-0 while being the  sole process that owns all the hardware, concurrent processes and context switches, portability (and the required layers of abstraction and indirection), etc.<p>It&#x27;s a bit cheap to blame developers while at the same time taking for granted that you can even do what you can do with modern hard- and software.<p>Everything comes at a price and even MenuetOS [1] will have worse input lag and be less responsive than an Apple II, simply because you&#x27;ll likely have USB keyboard and mouse and an LCD monitor connected to it.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;menuetos.net" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;menuetos.net</a>')
