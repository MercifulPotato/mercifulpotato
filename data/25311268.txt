I mean <i>really</i> hate them.  They make me feel like my brain is encased in concrete and they do nothing for my pain until you hit the hydromorphone level.  And all hydromorphone does is suppress the pain enough that I go &quot;Thanks. &lt;snore&gt;&quot; and finally pass out.  Lather, rinse, repeat <i>every two hours</i> until the surgeon finally cut me open.<p>However, that experience is <i>not</i> universally shared.  I have met people just like me, but I have also met people who just <i>LOVE</i> oxycontin (which has <i>zero</i> upside for me--I&#x27;m still in pain <i>and</i> I can&#x27;t think).<p>Addiction is very personal and specific.')
