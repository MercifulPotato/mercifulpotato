Obviously much simpler systems should be drastically faster, but project management tools do tend to be processing quite a bit of data and so do involve _some_ amount of inherent &quot;weight&quot;, but that isn&#x27;t an excuse for very poor perf.<p>The time to first load is derived from the fact that you&#x27;re running essentially the equivalent of many &quot;transition&quot; type interactions, but they should be run almost entirely in parallel, so roughly 2x between &quot;transition&quot; and &quot;new load&quot; is a reasonable allowance.')
