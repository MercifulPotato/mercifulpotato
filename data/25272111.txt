There are plenty of situations where someone may have not just the right, but a responsibility to force to you to do something against your will.  I hate to use the police as an example, because there are plenty of cases against them because some of them abuse their rights and fail in their responsibilities, but police have the right and a duty to stop you driving while you&#x27;re drunk for example, preventing harm or attempted murder, rape, or fraud.  They are supposed to be properly trained for this.  This is why we all have rights AND responsibilities, you can&#x27;t just do whatever you want at the expense of others if you&#x27;re thinking only of your rights.  This is the point of encouraging, and in some cases enforcing, stay at home orders, wearing masks, social distancing.<p>Melbourne in Australia enforced strict stay at home orders for a number of weeks, against the purported rights and will of many, because the state government decided it&#x27;s the responsibility of citizens to do what&#x27;s best for their city, or country, or society, to ensure the wellbeing of their fellow citizens and avoid country wide calamity by the pandemic.  The people made a sacrifice of personal time and liberty so that the sacrifice wouldn&#x27;t forced upon others by the personal choices of selfish individuals, in the form needless death and illness for hundreds or thousands of people, it also likely prevented more severe economic ramifications, and I think it was heroic and responsible that they did so.')
