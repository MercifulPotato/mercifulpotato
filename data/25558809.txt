This doesn&#x27;t mean they are now healthy. It just means the toxic stuff is now no longer at the original level. Impact on organs? Not a great picture.<p>A &quot;Forever chemical&quot; indeed.<p>* Assumptions just to make things easier to see. PFOS half-life is actually 5.4 years. So the table above is <i>too short</i>. Assume nothing gets stuck where it can&#x27;t decay. What is toxic for this? What is typical buildup for a 20 year old for various locations&#x2F;contexts?')
