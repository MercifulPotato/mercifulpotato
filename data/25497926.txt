How on Earth is it that I can walk into a doctor&#x27;s office or hospital to get medical treatment and have no idea how much it&#x27;s going to cost? $10? $100? $1000? Who knows. I had an ear infection once, went to the doctor who looked at it for a minute and said &quot;give it a few days&quot;. I assumed this would cost maybe $20 or something? Nope. $400. There&#x27;s just no way of even knowing. In no other industry would you buy something without knowing the price ahead of time. With medical care it&#x27;s even more screwed up because, well, it&#x27;s your health? You&#x27;re generally more desperate for services now, so it&#x27;s not like shopping around for clothes or something.')
