I see some people write paragraphs as messages on discord servers and iirc that wasn’t technically even possible on irc and I feel like it’s even strange to see in the middle of lighter chatter.<p>Also slack threads are awful, imo. I can appreciate them in certain contexts like asking what tool everyone likes or where to grab dinner, but if your slack has become a place where complicated tech answers wind up in threads it makes searching so frustrating just due to the UX. Also they’re limited, or were, on features (code blocks never looked right, etc). I HATED when outages wound up in a slack thread and not a room which was too frequent at my last employer.<p>That #tagging&#x2F;#threading feature available on the other slack&#x2F;discord&#x2F;teams competitor I can’t think of right now is something I really want.<p>I have to pay attention to not treating slack like irc quite a bit.')
