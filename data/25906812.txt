If Peloton can do it for cycling, I do not see the reason you cannot do it for rowing.<p>Although a pain point kind of seems obvious, Peloton is successful because cycling by itself is &quot;approachable&quot;. Anyone can hop on a bike and just start cycling, doesn&#x27;t matter on your gender, weight, or conditioning.<p>While rowing, eh.. You said it yourself, people avoid it in gyms like the plague. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love rowing for the same reasons you do, rowing is the activity I do the most during the week.<p>It&#x27;s just that a lot of people do not like rowing, or&#x2F;and are scared of it, and the biggest &quot;problem&quot;, it is hard, way harder than anything else in the gym.<p>So it seems that you are naturally blocked with a certain ceiling as to how much you can grow and where. While you are establishing a moat yourself to keep competitors away, the bigger question is how is the customer going to cross the &quot;rowing moat&quot; to even try your product?')
