They have far better contrast than IPS. The black is indeed black. I find it great for working in dark mode on text. However the colors and viewing angles are a trade-off. Although I find the viewing angles are still better than TN and can be somewhat mitigated with a curved screen.<p>I personally use a curved 32&quot; 4K VA screen. The resolution, text size and contrast make this great for text heavy work.')
