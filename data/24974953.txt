You still need to change versions centralized. The only difference is that monolith will not let you do that partially. Example there’s vulnerability in package, but only gateway exposed externally. Unless gateway still produced valid json&#x2F;gRPC etc request it doesn’t really matter , you change a lib version without having impact on all other services that might be affected by library version change.<p>It’s clear that article affected heavily by outdated Java way of building software. Where everything is injected by DI , AOP so even a small change in a core component is a big deal.<p>No it’s not. Unless micro service is doing what expected and passes unit tests I don’t care.
