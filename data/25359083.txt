It seems pretty clear to me that we should offer protections to individuals on truthfulness of others speech.<p>What about package labeling? Company&#x27;s are required to post truthful listings of their ingredients and labels if their products are shown to do harm. Is this an appropriate limitation of speech?<p>I suspect we could also agree that there are missinformation and disinformations that if distributed at a wide scales can also be seen go cause harm to individuals. Holocaust denial for instance is a fairly obvious rhetorical tool used to discredit the Jewish experience, promote anti-semitism, and recruit people into organizations seeking to do harm to Jewish people.<p>Anti Vaccine propaganda also does harm to members of our society as it reduces the efficacy of our public health programs and promotes the spread of deadly disease.<p>So my last question is only to ask what is the appropriate line for us as a society to draw? It appears Etsy has landed on &quot;harmful falsehoods&quot;. This seems relatively sane to me, and I would expect most of the argument to lie in the word harmful rather than falsehood. I worry however that you&#x27;re implying we might also be arguing about falsehoods.')
