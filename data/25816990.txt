My opinion is that service meshes are still not mature enough. Many products are built as a layer on top of istio (check solo.io or ambassador, or knative), but are still complex to manage, and require some basic envoy proxy knowledge.\nWill they be integrated with kubernetes and fade in the background? definitely not, not even close.')
