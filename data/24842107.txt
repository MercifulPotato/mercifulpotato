I&#x27;ve been programming various parallel programs though for myself.<p>&gt; The term &quot;fork&#x2F;join cycle&quot; is intriguing and meaningless to me as a non-Julia user.

Each time the threads need to communicate, you join, and then use the &quot;master&quot; thread to pass data to all of the different units.<p>-------------<p>For example, most video-game engines issue a fork to calculate the verticies of all objects in the video game (the fork turns into a GPU call). This is called the vertex-shader.<p>Once all the verticies are calculated, the GPU joins these threads together, and the main-program &#x2F; game engine continues.<p>The next step is the geometry shaders: so the CPU forks (aka: spawn thousands of GPU threads), and joins on the results of the geometry shaders. (Tesselation may spawn more vertexes. Ex: you model a rope as a square, but then the geometry shader turns the square into a rope-shape at this stage)<p>Then the pixel shaders. For every pixel of your 1080 x 1920 screen, a GPU SIMD-thread is forked off, and each pixel&#x27;s final color is calculated based on the results of vertex-shaders and geometry shaders before it.<p>Each of these cycles is a fork-join cycle. Thousands of threads spawning, thousands of threads joining, the CPU calculating some synchronization data together, and then spawning thousands of threads again.<p>(In practice, modern game engines are now async for speed reasons. But the general fork&#x2F;join model is still kinda there if you squint)')
