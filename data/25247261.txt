Item(by='qsort', descendants=None, kids=[25258387], score=None, time=1606677488, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25247140, text='&gt; That comes from the fact that they don&#x27;t understand the data they are dealing with (as you said with dimensions). You cannot use the arithmetic mean on interest rates because it does not make sense to add them up.<p>If you&#x27;re going down that route, which operations make sense and which don&#x27;t boil down to the algebraic structure of the set of the possible values of the datatype. For example, you can&#x27;t <i>add</i> dates but you can <i>subtract</i> dates, because dates have an affine structure, therefore the arithmetic mean of January 14 and October 13 is an operation that makes sense. Similarly with temperatures.<p>The thing is that it&#x27;s sometimes tricky and unintuitive to figure out what you&#x27;re allowed to do: ratios are a good example because you <i>can</i> add them, it just doesn&#x27;t mean what most people expect it to mean.<p>I do agree that understanding your data goes a long way, but I believe making people more aware that tools other than &quot;sum &#x2F; n&quot; exist is worthwhile, even though the article does have problems as I highlighted above.')
