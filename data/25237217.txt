They chose a compiler which is performant and widely available and bet everything on it to keep things straightforward. It looks like it&#x27;s served them well.<p>This compiler is on the other hand naturally not available on all platforms and is not appropriate for all contexts. Alternate implementations could have filled these gaps, but they&#x27;re not there.<p>The fact that the compiler defines the language and vice-versa enables additional flexibility in changing the language&#x2F;compiler and development speed at the cost of instability. Different projects may tolerate different amounts of instability and for those that are more conservative Rust may not be an appropriate investment.<p>With C++ one can code for a specific compiler or in a standard way. One can pick C++98 or 17 or anything in between. All of these are supported options and they give C++ its massive breadth and offer the most flexibility to teams. There&#x27;s obviously disadvantages associated with all that, but claiming that diversity is a weakness is not generally true.')
