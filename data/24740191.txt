What you said about kids clothing is spot on, but I&#x27;d expect similar dynamics for women&#x27;s clothing (tighter fits = lower tolerance, also lower tolerance for color mismatch etc) and there are a couple of categories that I&#x27;ve outright stopped buying on Amazon because of the enormous problem rate, namely whitelabeled consumer electronics.<p>In 2020 I&#x27;ve returned ~5%:<p><pre><code>    markers that were dry\n    test clips with mislabeled quantity\n    de-laminated screen protector sheet\n    mislabeled thermal printer (photo, listing said it had an internal spool compartment but it didn&#x27;t)\n    cell-phone arm stand that lacked the spring tension, even adjusted to maximum, to hold up my small, un-cased Google Pixel\n</code></pre>\n1% sounds quite low, but if I had foregone buying anything heat&#x2F;storage sensitive and followed my own rule about whitelabeled goods that&#x27;s exactly where I&#x27;d be. On the other hand, my returns were painless and most gambles paid off so I think I&#x27;ll carry on.')
