To create a pull request, one must have already done the work to fork the repo themselves. The pull request is an offer to contribute that work back. If the project owners cannot or do not wish to do the work to even triage pull requests, that&#x27;s fine, but in that case it&#x27;s pretty clear that a public GitHub repo is the wrong place to be.')
