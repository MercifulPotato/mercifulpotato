(The risk of permanent hospital closures &amp; bankruptcies in the USA was about losing revenue from certain type of procedures because of COVID risks, but that&#x27;s a separate issue that has little to do with this.)<p>So again, why do you need to quibble over rounding errors in cause of death paperwork when the hospitals are filling up or full? Why? What&#x27;s the point?')
