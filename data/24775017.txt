Unicorn Train is a fun way for teammates to recognize and reward each other for doing great things. It currently integrates with Slack and GitHub, with many more integrates to come. It&#x27;s built using Ruby on Rails on the backend, Tailwind on the frontend, and is hosted on Heroku.<p>Any and all feedback is welcome :)<p>Cheers!')
