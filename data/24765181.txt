I&#x27;ve seen some closed-source database drivers for Python which is because they are implemented as native C code.   but nobody uses them and there are vastly better open source choices that everyone uses.   Commercial libraries are not viable in the Python ecosystem where an open source alternative that is decently maintained exists, there&#x27;s nothing to be gained by trying to steal an MIT library and selling it as some kind of encrypted package, nobody would ever use it.')
