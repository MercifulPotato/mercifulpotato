They&#x27;re written in this mathematical way that kinda obscures how to actually think about them practically. If you&#x27;re more into math maybe stochastic calc will be just fine for you.<p>Here we go anyway:<p>Hull: Futures, Options, and Other Derivatives<p>Natenberg. Don&#x27;t recall the name, but this is maybe the closest to practical.<p>Paul Wilmott, Quantitative finance.<p>Taleb, Dynamic Hedging. Got a signed copy :)<p>Also I think it&#x27;s smart to read about instruments that aren&#x27;t options, ie don&#x27;t just cut to the chase. Time value of money, futures, forwards, bonds, swaps, equities. Then vanilla options on all those things, then exotics.')
