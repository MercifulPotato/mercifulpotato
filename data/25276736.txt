I expect that there will be a lot of people who think that once they get the shot, they can immediately stop wearing masks and practicing social distancing.<p>The rollout to the general public will need to be combined with extensive efforts to make sure people know that it takes time for a vaccine to actually provide protection.<p>In the case of this one, it is about a week after the second shot, which is three weeks after the first shot, so you should keep up all your pre-vaccination measures for a month after getting the first shot.<p>2. In a fair number of people, the first shot is accompanied by strong symptoms similar to a severe flu, which lasts for about a day. (I haven&#x27;t read anything about whether or not this can also happen with the second shot).<p>The people who get that strong reaction might be reluctant to get their second shot.<p>The education efforts accompanying the rollout to the general public should make sure people know that there is a decent chance of such a reaction, but they will get over it in a day, and it will be worth it for the protection from COVID.')
