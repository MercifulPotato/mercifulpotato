I mean I guess I get less PTO than other countries, but I get way more pay. I could just take a month of unpaid vacation if I wanted to, and still make more than my European counterparts. Tech also gets great healthcare (unless you work for a startup or something I&#x27;d guess).<p>Not disagreeing that unions would probably be a net-positive for tech workers, but saying that tech in the USA gets a worse &quot;benefit package&quot; is pretty dishonest.')
