What are the due fees? %5 of gross annually? 200 people * 300k year * %5 of salary = 3 million.  They will use this on fancy dinners with Google execs? Or spend it in &quot;wrongful terminations&quot; law suites with google for years?<p>2. Who runs it? Will it be a 10 year long president? What is his union salary? A non-google person?  Will it be full time? A slack group?<p>3. Who gets into the union?  Base is on the newest woke culture? Base it on need? Salary? Scan their social media? Seems like a great way to start discrimination.<p>4. Will being in this union freak out future employers?  If your union spends most of it&#x27;s time suing - will they want you around? EG. I don&#x27;t see Tesla wanting a high ranking union person from google.<p>5. My wife worked at a union.  Unions tend to not fire - so  (non blue collar) you end up with hundreds of drained, demotivated, incompetent - due payers.  This is the direction people at google want to go?  Who will actually do the work? Non-union Sub-contractors?<p>6. Will they become political? Will you have to join this political party? What if you disagree on a few things?<p>7. Will they corner off work? EG. You can&#x27;t be a designer level III without being in the union.<p>One thing that wont happen: better working conditions.')
