The HN commenter says 1kMRR from a <i>side project</i> is indeed impressive. Immediately after, the author states &quot;$1000 per month from a side project is considered meh.&quot; The entire article is responding to a straw man.<p>FWIW the original article the comment came from was about 1k MRR <i>startups</i>. I think if you treat it like a startup, you better be making more than 1k&#x2F;mo after a couple years (or, alternately, losing 100M per month) to be considered impressive.')
