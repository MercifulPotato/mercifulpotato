It&#x27;s sold roughly 15,000 copies since then.<p>Along the way, I&#x27;ve learned that there are not only multiple ways to easily buy reviews (and in bulk), but that a significant portion of Amazon reviews are these &#x27;bought&#x27; reviews--utterly fake.<p>Amazon does police reviews, but it&#x27;s inconsistent and easily defeated.<p>More practically, I&#x27;ve come to realize that Amazon reviews have very little to do with sales now.
