Item(by='jleahy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609155638, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25557115, text='&gt; Flags don&#x27;t have to add an extra implicit input&#x2F;output everywhere. Both ARM and PowerPC avoid updating the flags unless explicitly requested.<p>Well ultimately they do, not updating the flags means more options for the compiler (things can be scheduled in between the compare and jump), although with cmp+jmp fusion that&#x27;s now a bad idea making the concept dates.<p>Ultimately each instruction pending execution in an OOO core needs to sit somewhere waiting for its inputs to be available. If you are x86 and you suggest cmov then potentially you need to wait for 3 registers and flags, meaning every slot in this structure needs to be capable of waiting for 4 things to happen before becoming ready. In RISC-V you only need to wait for 2 things for any instruction.')
