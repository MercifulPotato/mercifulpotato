Item(by='neogodless', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610232228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25704687, text='It took me about ten minutes but I went through one of the claims from here[0].<p>So I looked up Minnesota voter registration counts[1] and Minnesota 2020 vote results[2]. I put this in a spreadsheet and looked at totals per county, and any examples of turnout exceeding eligibility. The percentage ranged from 76.9% to to as high as 92.6%. In no case did it exceed 100%, let alone 350% as claimed in a YouTube video. Given that on my first attempt to validate a claim of implied voter fraud (if more votes were actually cast than eligible) I was unable to, I feel there&#x27;s no reason to investigate that particular claim further. Presumably each of these so called &quot;proofs&quot; follow this pattern. If any did not, I would be shocked if no one outside of conservatively-biased journalism was able to go through each such instance and find sufficient proof that justified further investigation. Sure I&#x27;m just one person taking the minimum of effort on one instance (the first I could readily disprove on the list without exhaustive efforts), so I did not go through every item and spend all day. This is just an internet comment, and despite my efforts, I assume I will still change exactly zero minds. But it reaffirms that what some are calling proof and justification is not even accurate, let alone validation.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanthinker.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;election_fraud_you_can_see.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanthinker.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;election_fr...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sos.state.mn.us&#x2F;election-administration-campaigns&#x2F;data-maps&#x2F;voter-registration-counts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sos.state.mn.us&#x2F;election-administration-campaign...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sos.state.mn.us&#x2F;elections-voting&#x2F;election-results&#x2F;2020&#x2F;2020-general-election-results&#x2F;2020-precinct-results-spreadsheet&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sos.state.mn.us&#x2F;elections-voting&#x2F;election-result...</a>')
