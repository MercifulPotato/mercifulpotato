I thought they were hidden deep down away behind the OEM layers?<p>I have tried their the demo systems at several occasions, (they have been developong them in 20y) but not comma.ai&#x27;s.<p>For example they calculate the opening speed of your eyelid with high precision, the gaze direction output is within a few degrees of error.
