The big idea was &quot;graceful degradation&quot;: sites were expected to work without JS, at the cost of (say) a server-side error instead of immediate feedback.<p>Modern reddit does not gracefully degrade: it requires JS to click buttons, to load images, to scroll, etc. Old reddit still works well without JS. So does Google for that matter.')
