They have no incentives to change this system, so give them incentive.<p>There are so many red flags in your post, if I were you, I&#x27;d start looking for my way out immediately (I don&#x27;t know your personal situation so ymmv). Company culture changes slowly, and based on the number red flags, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s probably easier to leave and find something better. If you are staying because you like working with some people, ask them to consider joining the same company where you get hired. If you try to change the organization, be prepared that people will stop liking you because you are not the obedient little code monkey anymore and they won&#x27;t like that you don&#x27;t let them exploit you anymore.<p>&gt; on-call isn’t compensated with the rationale that it’s part of your engineering duties<p>That&#x27;s just wrong, do not let them convince you this is normal. If they want you be available at all times, then they should pay. If they don&#x27;t want to pay, tell them you won&#x27;t do on calls anymore.<p>&gt; In a gambit to prioritize uptime over engineer time<p>I see they are very generous with <i>your</i> time.<p>&gt; Being able to sleep fully through the night is increasingly rare.<p>Again, it&#x27;s a sign that your system is unstable. You need to ask them to prioritize fixes to these issues, even if they can&#x27;t be solved easily. Take a good look at how development is organized. Do you have automated tests, code reviews, knowledge sharing? Are you always working on features and ignore bugs? Running systems should not be this hard.<p>&gt; yeah, we’re looking into it<p>This is an acceptable answer exactly once.<p>&gt; The company could easily afford it, but probably doesn’t want to pay for what it can get for free.<p>I didn&#x27;t want to be philosophical but: Power concedes nothing without a demand.')
