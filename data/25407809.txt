(thanks to fucking Brexit for forcibly removing my EU citizenship, which I very much wanted to keep. Grrr :&lt; )<p>Anyway, PayPal didn&#x27;t allow changing account country through the UI, and there didn&#x27;t seem to any other way of doing it either.<p>Not sure what people who move country are supposed to do... o_O')
