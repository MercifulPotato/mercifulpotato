When I see an interesting link, I paste it into the textbox at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:2784&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:2784&#x2F;</a>. This creates a new parent item.<p>2) I create sub-item under it which may include several tags, such as: #perl #toread<p>3) When I read the page, I create new text nodes under the item to annotate and locally store the information.<p>4) Whenever I want to publish something to my public blog, I add a child item with the #publish tag to it, and it&#x27;s automatically pushed (using curl and HTTP GET or POST.)<p>5) My public blog is unauthenticated, but I could also limit publishing rights to e.g. only items signed by my particular PGP key.<p>6) When my notepad gets full, I archive it into a zip file and start afresh. This is how I deal with &quot;information overload bankruptcy&quot;.<p>7) If I&#x27;m looking for something I annotated in the past, I use zgrep or whatever it&#x27;s called on my pile of zip files.')
