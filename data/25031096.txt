(And don&#x27;t misjudge my tone here - I mean this in the friendliest way.)<p>I care about the fact that the US government has let this gorilla grow into King Kong and start throwing us into walls and trampling on our industry.<p>If this trend continues, the giants will swallow us completely. Our industry has always been special, and the barriers have historically been low. Now that Apple enjoys a position at the top, they&#x27;re putting up fences and walls for the rest of us.<p>Apple is shitting into all of our faces, and we&#x27;re being told to just take it.<p>Meanwhile, you celebrate that. Please don&#x27;t.')
