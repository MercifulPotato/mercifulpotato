AMD&#x27;s YOY performance gains in Zen really are exceptional. Their mobile processors blow intel out of the water. They are more efficient and performant.<p>I still have a 6700k which is plenty fast enough for anything I do. But in reality it&#x27;s quickly getting outpaced by Zen. The only reason Intel has been getting faster in the past few years is because of Zen and now Intel is shitting the bed.<p>The next few years, especially because of Apple Silicon, are going to be really interesting for desktop processors. I think we&#x27;re going to see some really crazy innovations.')
