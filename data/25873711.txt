I tried it with my D850. The advantage is, predictably, awesome optics. The downsides were a) finding a place on my desk for the camera and some sort of mount b) the camera battery gets eaten really quickly.<p>Interestingly, the webcam utility isn&#x27;t available for the smallest Nikon cameras - the Coolpix range - so I guess there won&#x27;t be a dedicated Nikon webcam.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;downloadcenter.nikonimglib.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;548&#x2F;Webcam_Utility.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;downloadcenter.nikonimglib.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;548&#x2F;Webca...</a>')
