Around 60 times more deaths than, in the case of vaccine, those still living with side effects.<p>But these side effects were apparently the strongest in just a part of the population: 4-18, which is 11 million, resulting is estimated 200 people with side effects.<p>Covid-19 luckily affects exactly that part of population less, but even then I&#x27;d guess that Covid-19 already made more damage to more than 200 people in it.<p>And that small number of cases just can&#x27;t be detected unless the trial covers enough of those affected. If the total effect is 200 cases in the whole population, a trial would have to be performed on at least one 20th of it: as much as 600,000 children would have to be a part of the trial to even detect that issue. Not to mention that it took two years to recognize the issue.<p>Now, for the trial to recognize the problem, half would have to be placebo group. That gives once all outside of the trial are counted 97.5% of people unprotected for two years.<p>In the case of whole population, and even waiting for only 10 months, there would still be 68,000 deaths more if that kind of trial would be a condition for the acceptance of vaccine.')
