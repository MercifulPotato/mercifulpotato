Get your best AI and make it play Minecraft, then same AI make it play a RTS, then make it play an RPG.<p>It will not work and a child will beat it at everything. The reason is we can understand stuff at a higher level, then we can create strategy like offensive, defensive, we learn from mistakes and don&#x27;t randomly search for solutions.<p>About chess I bet a grand-master will beat your AI at chess if you swap those rules and you don&#x27;t retrain the AI, you can only update the rules. The AI only sees numbers and functions, no goals, sub objectives etc.')
