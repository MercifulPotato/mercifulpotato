Can the &quot;hallway track&quot; experience somehow be simulated in VR or MMORPG to improve the interactivity between participants? It doesn&#x27;t sound like a practical idea, sure, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s stupid enough to be excluded from investigation.<p>On second thought, a simulation in video games isn&#x27;t a particularly new idea, there must be a good collection of researches and conclusions already. I should look it up on Google Scholar someday to answer my own question...')
