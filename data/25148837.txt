Why is that?  People who explain other cool things in math are never like that.<p>Although there are a few honest texts, almost every introduction to geometric algebra sounds as if they are introducing a new &quot;school of thought&quot; that will change mathematics forever.  As if there was a worldwide conspiracy of powerful people who promote backwards concepts like exterior algebra, tensors and quaternions, and they want us to take the red pill.  This may have sounded slightly funny the first time it was written, but it is an ugly, self-defeating meme right now.<p>To anybody who may be discouraged from learning geometric algebra due to the weird antics of its promoters: please, ignore the stupid rhetoric and study some Clifford algebra.  There are a lot of neat ideas in there! (but of course, not only in there; you may still want to learn the other, well-known, equivalent definitions and notations for the same objects).')
