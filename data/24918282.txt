With TPM, your computer decrypts and boots up to your OS, where a thief would have to enter in your OS password. They can&#x27;t bypass it by patching the OS files or cracking the hash stored on disk, because the disk is encrypted. They also can&#x27;t bypass it with a patched kernel&#x2F;bootloader, because that would change the PCRs, causing the TPM to no longer auto-unlock.')
