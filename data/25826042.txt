Item(by='Jemaclus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611000768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25822485, text='&gt; That&#x27;s a very good question, and not necessarily something I find easy to explain concisely.<p>I&#x27;ve been where you are. One tip I have is to spend a little bit of time (an hour or two) and work out exactly how to explain it concisely. What&#x27;s your elevator pitch? If you ran into the CTO of your dream tech company at a friend&#x27;s party, and they asked what kind of work you would like to do, what would you explain in 60 seconds?<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I think what you have above is pretty close. If you can tweak it slightly, you can likely get to a &quot;Here&#x27;s what I want to be doing and this is why you should hire me&quot; in the same sort of pitch.<p>I know it&#x27;s difficult to explain sometimes, but it&#x27;s worth your time to figure out how to frame it concisely. Good luck!')
