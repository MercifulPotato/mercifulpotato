The immigrant always has a way out, with the worst case penalty being deportation.<p>Additionally:<p>- In some cities (&quot;sanctuary cities&quot;), reporting a crime does not lead to deportation.<p>- They can also apply for amnesty if the conditions in their home country are that bad.<p>- Agencies accept anonymous reports. The immigrant doesnt even need to be working at the place at the time of the report.<p>So depending on the circumstances of the abuse, there may be no consequences to the illegal immigrant for reporting.')
