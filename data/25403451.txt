I reported the ad to Facebook and they declined to take any action to remove them. They continued for months selling credentials to Office365, etc. that were obviously fraudulent, and for some reason I frequently saw their ads. I ended up reporting them to Microsoft because I’m not a huge fan of fraudsters and wanted to see them brought to some sort of justice. Anyway, they eventually went offline, but I don’t know if it was any thanks to me or if their scam had simply run its course. They were never blocked or removed from Facebook. They just stopped buying ads and took down their website.<p>It took me less than a minute to figure out this company was fraudulent, but Facebook couldn’t do so even with a tip. It’s pretty clear that they either DGAF or are actively accommodating criminals as long as they buy ads.')
