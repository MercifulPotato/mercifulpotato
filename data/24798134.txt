The idea that content moderation makes you a publisher seems a bit silly to me.<p>If I have a platform for selling say automobiles, and people keep trying to sell kitchenware of something equally not off brand.  Removing that content doesn&#x27;t make you a publisher, it makes you a steward of the purpose of a platform.<p>The idea that moderation or cultivation of a platform, sudden makes you a &quot;publisher&quot; (which is frankly a term that shouldn&#x27;t even be used in this case as it is too narrow for the web is) makes no sense.<p>This is, a bullshit threat to try and assert control over platforms that people interact on by the government. It isn&#x27;t needed, and is likely to be harmful.')
