Selling a piece of spectrum is a very good analogy.<p>Another easy analogy would be IP addresses. Early on in the internet huge chunks were just given out for free. Now they&#x27;re valuable because they&#x27;re scarce and the demand for them has skyrocketed as the internet grew.<p>You need spectrum to participate in the radio business (and other kinds of businesses). You <i>need</i> IP addresses to participate in the internet. Similarly you <i>need</i> HNS (as an example) to participate in the Handshake network.<p>And as with spectrum and IP addresses, there&#x27;s only a fixed amount of HNS (or at least that is the expectation, the details vary in each cryptocurrency).')
