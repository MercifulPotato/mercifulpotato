First I thought I must register before seeing the courses, but it is possible.<p>After a few click I reached <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marshallyin.com&#x2F;courses&#x2F;alphabet-course&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marshallyin.com&#x2F;courses&#x2F;alphabet-course&#x2F;</a> It has three buttons: &quot;Overview&quot;, &quot;Curriculum&quot; and &quot;Complete&quot;.<p>I thought that &quot;Curriculum&quot; would show only the list of topics, but not the main part of the curse. I didn&#x27;t understand what &quot;Complete&quot; mean, it is very confusing. I did&#x27;t know how to continue and see the content of curse.<p>After reading the text in the page, I understood how the buttons work, but don&#x27;t expect people to read the text.')
