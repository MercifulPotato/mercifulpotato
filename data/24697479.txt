From the R7RS report:<p><i>Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary. Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming paradigms in use today.</i><p><i>[The] Scheme Steering Committee decided in August 2009 to divide the standard into two separate but compatible languages — a “small” language, suitable for educators, researchers, and users of embedded languages, focused on R5RS compatibility, and a “large” language focused on the practical needs of mainstream software development, intended to become a replacement for R6RS. The present report describes the “small” language of that effort: therefore it cannot be considered in isolation as the successor to R6 RS.</i>')
