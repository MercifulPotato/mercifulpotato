Opinions here are my own though.)<p>Although it&#x27;s primarily known for allowing apps to store their users&#x27; data in a place under their users&#x27; control, for better or worse, it&#x27;s built on many SemWeb technologies.<p>And even though I&#x27;m still somewhat disillusioned about the Semantic Web (like Aaron Schwarz, I used to be enthusiastic about it way back when), but there certainly is a chance it will be interesting again when your personal (potentially private) data can be part of the Semantic Web as well. For example, if they&#x27;d have written their reviews in a Solid-based website, linking them to MusicBrainz would be a relatively small step.')
