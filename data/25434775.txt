That&#x27;s presuming you&#x27;re even alerted to it in a timely manner. In that scenario, the appropriate response almost certainly not going to be &quot;turn off the business&quot; and even if it is, it&#x27;s not going to matter whether you can do it in 5 minutes or 5 hours.<p>The only scenarios in which you&#x27;ll have enough information to justify activating this plan, are scenarios where you&#x27;ll also have enough information to respond to the actual threat, rather than just shutting everything down.<p>It&#x27;s something that might sound impressive to people who aren&#x27;t experienced with incident response, but it&#x27;s practical uses are so close to non-existent, that any time that was spent developing this solution was most certainly wasted in lieu of doing something actually useful.')
