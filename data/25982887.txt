It&#x27;s a tactic MS used to take control of a technology it, with the goal of making it unviable -- see the &quot;extinguish&#x27; part. Back then, it was in Microsoft&#x27;s interest that people used native windows apps to keep them in the MS ecosystem. The web was good for makers of other OSs like Apple. Nowadays, Apple tries to keep the web in lame duck mode for the same reason. Google wants the web to be powerful not to neuter it but because it&#x27;s in their interest. You can argue if the web _should_ be an app platform, but applying &quot;embrace extend extinguish&quot; to Chrome misunderstands the motivation of Google.')
