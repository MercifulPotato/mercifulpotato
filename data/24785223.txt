The most recent star wars films focused on &#x27;resistance&#x27; instead. It&#x27;s an opposing force to a current trend.<p>I don&#x27;t care that no-one was interested or not, the key part is that the content of the discussion centred around money.<p>If people weren&#x27;t interested in the subject of artistic comdy and they expressed that, there would be evidence art still matters. Wrapping up people&#x27;s disinterest with a conversation around money, shows it&#x27;s dead art. Shallow or deep, interpreted or not.<p>The fact that you guys are still deflecting from the idea that art is less potent, is in itself a sorrowful confirmation of the idea.')
