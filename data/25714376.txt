Maybe that&#x27;s just another way for him to fortify his own mind about doing callous things to other people.

Any CEO that tasks a just-promoted former team lead, project manager or other non-manager to first time CTO and MT member and that then expects that person to take the axe to the team in a way that will not destroy the company is out to lunch.<p>This article is proof positive of that, it misses a whole slew of important considerations and will likely result in a mass exodus of the people that keep the company running within the next couple of months.<p>I&#x27;ve had to lay off people before, this is not how it is done.')
