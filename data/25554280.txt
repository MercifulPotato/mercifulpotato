Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609103414, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25552293, text='&gt;&gt; Also this gem: &quot;These clips also revealed flight in hazardous conditions including heavy rain, fog, snow, and close proximity to buildings in downtown Philadelphia. There was also posted proof of the pilot intentionally losing radio signal, and control, of his drone.&quot; That goes way beyong &quot;innocent experimentation with your new drone&quot; and into &quot;deliberately endangering people and property&quot;, especially if you&#x27;ve been warned about it twice already. Youtube money must&#x27;ve been pretty good to keep going.<p>&gt; I wish there were an exception for this. Likely the drone had programmed waypoints and was in an autonomous mode.<p>It&#x27;s probably not a safe way to fly, at least in an urban area near buildings, like the article said he was.  GPS can go batty sometimes with signals blocked or reflected off buildings.  I&#x27;m also not a drone pilot, but I&#x27;m a little skeptical that a drone flying by waypoints can compensate very well for weather conditions (such as gusty wind).')
