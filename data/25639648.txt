But interviewing isn&#x27;t like that and shouldn&#x27;t be. It is more like, cooperatively working on a problem with a colleague and then presenting and explaining it to your teammates. That&#x27;s a pretty valuable skill at work, even necessary, I would say.<p>The whole &quot;loner dev in his cave&quot; stereotype, most of the time, just materializes in the form of a dude writing code that no one can understand or maintain, with a cherry on top being that dude not being able to effectively explain it to other people either.')
