I have no idea how to compare the relative impacts on social stability; keeping a sizable percentage of the population in economically precarious positions is likely more destabilizing, but spying and blackmail can have massive effects, too.<p>&gt; A sense of helplessness in the face of seemingly overwhelming force isn&#x27;t the same as &quot;not caring at all&quot;<p>I look at this as:<p>(1) Roughly the same proportion of people at any given time will be [failing to save, feeding the surveillance beast].<p>(2) Change the environment, and you change their behavior on the margin. (Opt-out 401K increases overall savings rates; safe defaults frequently don&#x27;t get changed.)<p>(3) Change the incentives, and you change behavior permanently. (Ownership stakes encourage savings; close channels that leak personal information.)')
