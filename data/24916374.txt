It&#x27;s not that.   It&#x27;s a <i>different</i> job.<p>Gather some evidence about whether you&#x27;re good at helping people solve their problems.  All sorts of problems.   Problems not even having to do with work.   Ask whether you&#x27;re good at communicating up <i>and</i> down, high level and low level.   Do you enjoy answering dumb questions and explaining things over and over again?   Are you good at switching between topics that you didn&#x27;t want to switch to, hour by hour?  Do you <i>like</i> writing reports and managing projects and Gantt charts?   Are you &quot;a people person, I&#x27;m good with people dammit&quot;?<p>Would you take the job if there were no pay increase?  If the answer is no, then that&#x27;s likely not what it&#x27;s going to bring you -- it&#x27;s probably going to bring you stress and dissatisfaction more than any potential pay difference.  Of course, it may vary a bit by company, but this is often a reasonable caution.<p>Think hard before just jumping in.  Managing people isn&#x27;t what many think it is!')
