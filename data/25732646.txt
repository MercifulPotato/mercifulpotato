You can visit hacker forums and get a list of these. There are still a ton of AS&#x27;s in the world doing this, and no one is unpeering them even though they do huge damage to core infrastructure. On the other hand, if you try that on a well-policed data center like AWS, you&#x27;ll be either blocked by automated tools or dropped as a customer (or both). That illustrates the difference between how customers are treated and how peers are.<p>Spam is a bit different because email providers just block IPs and AS&#x27;s that are major spammers. This is done with a simple firewall policy and has nothing to do with peering.')
