Seems to work well enough. OTOH, someone at Google has to make this a feature.<p>Paved&#x2F;unpaved: that&#x27;s one suck-ass assistant you&#x27;ve got there. I <i>know</i> the Garmin on the dash of my motorcycle will give that option. The Garmin RV-specific GPS has loads of other options, such as avoid any low overpasses that will rip the solar panels off my RV. Though it doesn&#x27;t look like Apple is any better than Google, only because Apple Maps doesn&#x27;t offer the option. Anyway, satellite and street view? Rand McNally had this information since dirt was first created, no need to get the satellites out.')
