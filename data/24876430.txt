It hasn&#x27;t been from regulations changing.<p>It&#x27;s all been due to lack of expertise and project mismanagement. In the US they plowed forward with designs that &quot;couldn&#x27;t be constructed&quot; and wasted money building something different from what had been designed. With the French EPR design, welding skills weren&#x27;t there to deal with insanely complex and difficult welding jobs.<p>The failures of nuclear construction have been internal to the industry, they haven&#x27;t been foisted on the industry.<p>We should build now with the clear path we have to 80%-90% decarbonization, and see where the chips fall.<p>So I think we are in agreement there?  Maybe in 2045 NuScale (Or Terrapower or whoever) will be shipping reliably and have brought down costs quite a bit from what they currently think they can hit. Maybe not, and we will go with whatever the cheapest alternative is to meet our reliability needs.<p>There&#x27;s certainly adequate VC money to get these nuclear startups off the ground. Personally, I don&#x27;t think any of it is &quot;smart&quot; money, but rather just hedging money. Which is to say I&#x27;m really glad that people are investing in it, even though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a likely bet, it&#x27;s a necessary bet.')
