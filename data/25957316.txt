Same thing when you lend out money. This isn&#x27;t rent seeking: capital is crucial to any business and to provide it is to provide a valuable service. Which is not to say that there&#x27;s not a lot of rent-seeking behavior in the stock market, or that modern capitalism is entirely sane, but that&#x27;s a different topic.')
