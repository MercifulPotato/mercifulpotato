For instance, if you knew that a nonlinear function was a function of sin, cos and logs, selecting these as basis functions and finding the correct functional form [2] would likely help an optimizer find more parsimonious model than a NN using standard activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, etc). As a thought experiment, suppose the generating function was this: (5 parameters)<p><pre><code>  y = a1*log(a2*x)&#x2F;cos(a3*x) + a4*sin(a5*x)\n</code></pre>\nIf one attempted to fit this with log, cos and sin basis functions, one is likely recover this form with ~5 parameters. But suppose we tried to fit this with an NN with the stipulation that the approximation error is under some Îµ -- I suspect we&#x27;ll need quite a bit more than 5 parameters.<p>NN&#x27;s tend to generalize better (assuming proper regularization) than polynomial approximations and have fewer numerical problems like Runge&#x27;s phenomenon, but I don&#x27;t think NNs aim for (or have results that demonstrate) parsimony in parameters.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Polynomial_interpolation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Polynomial_interpolation</a><p>[2] If the functional form is unknown, there are techniques like &quot;symbolic regression&quot; that attempt to do a structure search to find a well-fitting structure.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Symbolic_regression" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Symbolic_regression</a>')
