Yes on: amazon is free to do whatever the license allows.  But no on: if that  wee the point of the licensing, it&#x27;d be encoded in the license.<p>I think the point of OSS - and there are various flavors so this isn&#x27;t some unitary point, but more like a general direction - is the insight that copyright isn&#x27;t actually a good model for software development.  OSS licenses are a hack to sidestep fundementally misdesigned legal structures while staying within them.  But because OSS uses licenses to create a more open development model, it&#x27;s restricted in what it can do; it&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; an EULA essentially.<p>Ideally, we&#x27;d fix this in the law, not via tricky licenses, but we don&#x27;t live in a world where that ideal is anywhere even close to a serious enough problem to be addressed - at least, that&#x27;s my take on &quot;the point of the [OSS] licensing&quot;.<p>The various flavors of OSS try additionally to either use various other approaches to encourage a more open model in a closed world, or conversely don&#x27;t bother since it&#x27;s a hopeless endeavor, or vary exactly how open they want things to be; but the general gist is that the license is a hack; it&#x27;s a design limitation, not by design.')
