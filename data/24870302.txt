Many human societies around the world and through time give more priority to the idea that people build homes and community across time. The fact that we allow free movement into cities, towns and villages doesn&#x27;t have to mean that &quot;newcomers get an equal say&quot; (although it certainly could). Why shouldn&#x27;t a multi-generational community be able to say &quot;we like it the way it is, and don&#x27;t want random&#x2F;arbitrary migration here to change that&quot; ?')
