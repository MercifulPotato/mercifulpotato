Presumably, Google is pushing separate downloads due to the much smaller file size necessary for the x86_64-only package—the universal binary contains both x86_64 and ARM applications, and weighs in at 165MiB to the Intel-only package&#x27;s 96MiB.”<p>It is not clear what is being saved here.<p>Apps can determine whether or not they are running on an M1, so it should be possible for Google’s update code to download only the stripped version for the actual architecture.<p>I hope this is just a temporary situation.')
