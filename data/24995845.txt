In the Netherlands, in the 80s, we used to hear about drug tourism and that made us think it was all very strict in neighbouring countries, but when old enough to go there (germany, belgium, france, spain) to campsites etc, we saw it was everywhere and the cops only take action on dealers. In Spain, at least where I always go, almost everyone under 50 smokes weed in public, most drink and many do cocaine in the weekends. There is no violent crime (some break-ins in holiday homes, but those are rare enough that when it happens everyone knows about it) and you can get your fix everywhere even with the Guardia around. Practically, you wonâ€™t have too much issues in most of EU so PT did not change much.')
