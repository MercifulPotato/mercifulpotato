Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=[25098730], score=None, time=1605418131, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25097685, text='I can say &quot;not at all&quot;, but mostly because I had a depressive bout that absolutely haunted me for multiple years when I was in High School.<p>Every day, my daydreams would be about whether or not today was the day I&#x27;d decide to kill myself to end my misery. The hardest part was finding a way to kill myself without hurting those I did care about: my family. Any way I gamed a suicide: it would result in somebody in my family blaming them-self, or someone else, over it. And I didn&#x27;t want to die like that.<p>I don&#x27;t really remember when it started. I know my first serious suicidal thought freaked me out (to the point where I cried myself to sleep that night). But I also know that it didn&#x27;t take very long until I accepted the constant haunting of suicide as my everyday normal. The period lasted for years.<p>I must emphasize how _NORMAL_ depression feels when you have it. You wake up with it, you got to sleep with it, and then tomorrow morning you wake up with it again. You learn to live with it. You forget what life was like before you had depression.<p>----------<p>I don&#x27;t have any advice for people in depression. All I can say is that I somehow climbed out of it and absolutely don&#x27;t have it anymore. If I knew how it happened, then I&#x27;d tell you. But as far as I can tell, it was just dumb luck.<p>I do have advice for people who are worried about someone with depression however. You cannot convince them that their feelings of depression are &quot;non-normal&quot;. Depression is just with you, its something you carry in that period, just how you live your life. The concept that you could even possibly shed the feelings is boggling.<p>If you want to talk about depression, with someone who has depression, then you cannot treat it as if it were &quot;special&quot; or &quot;exotic&quot;. Depression is just every-day life for someone with depression. Telling someone that they can &quot;get rid of depression&quot; would be like saying... you don&#x27;t have to poop anymore. It just doesn&#x27;t &quot;make sense&quot; on any level when you have depression. I mean, yeah, life would be better if I didn&#x27;t have to poop all the time, but I expect that I&#x27;ll have to poop tomorrow.')
