It shows how personal note taking is to the user. I currently love notion. I switched over from Evernote, and it has been a game changer. The only downside is I&#x27;m tied to notion (the company), in a way I wouldn&#x27;t be if I used something like markdown and git. That said, I think it&#x27;s worth it to have the features in notion.')
