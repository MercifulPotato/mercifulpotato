They are a perennial hardwood species and need a cold stratification period before they are viable.  So you&#x27;d need to poo somewhere where the seed sat over the winter and came up the following spring.  Most vines in the wild grow from clones from the sprawling parent, with seed being spread by birds.<p>c) Don&#x27;t think the company cares about you. They&#x27;re worried about large farms in the central valley etc. propagating without license. As I&#x27;ve said elsewhere in this thread I&#x27;m not sure why they bothered printing this on the package that consumers see. Propagation agreements are very common.')
