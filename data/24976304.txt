Though I wonder if someone could do some work with keyboard-and-headphones only?<p>EDIT: Carry an android tablet, and this keyboard, with a battery pack, and you can show the keyboard&#x27;s view onto the android tablet: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;PZLEUOG9k4Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;PZLEUOG9k4Y</a> .
