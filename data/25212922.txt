But it should be more transparent to the user what&#x27;s going on, and it should be possible to switch it off if the user decides they don&#x27;t want this.<p>And really, the article also mentions Apple used to do this with a local cache but stopped doing this in Catalina. The question should be asked why. A local cache arguably offers better protection as it will work even without a network connection whereas the OCSP has no alternative other than failing open or stopping the system from working.')
