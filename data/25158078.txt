This is a large OLED screen (&quot;large&quot; is an understatement -- it&#x27;s the equivalent of a 4x4 grid of 24&quot; 1080p monitors). Because it&#x27;s OLED, there&#x27;s some minor risk of burn-in. As one of my measures for mitigating that risk, I use Dark Reader with the contrast turned up. This also happens to look really cool on an OLED with its perfect blacks. There are a few sites that it does a poor job with, and for those I just have it disabled.')
