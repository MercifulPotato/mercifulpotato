Anybody speaking the words &quot;Huffman tree&quot; will be thrown out the window. Huffman hasn&#x27;t been a &quot;tree&quot; for years, we all use canonical Huffman.<p>Similarly, the difference between LZ77, LZSS, etc. aren&#x27;t really of note. The modern innovations in LZ77 are 1. getting the really optimal parse from your encoder (hard!), 2. things to recognize higher order structure, like repcodes (first seen in LZX, but also a big part of LZMA), 3. allowing the CPU to parallelize the decode procedure by making the stream less serial.')
