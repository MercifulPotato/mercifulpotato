On many occasions I <i>wantied</i> a no-code no-hassle &quot;point and click&quot; automation and I have tried them a few dozen times over last 5 years and never had any success even once - they had always lacked something and were unable to do things I wanted. And I wanted nothing extraordinary, typically something like a proper bidirectional synchronization between two services (say, Alexa todos and iOS reminders)<p>They seem to work for many people though, so they aren&#x27;t useless in the general sense.')
