Sounds contradict but because it is. Let&#x27;s take Hong Kong for example, Hong Kong has changed China&#x27;s view on this issue completely. Hong Kong would be a much better asset for China if it is independent but stay Chinese. China does not need another city. The problem is that even though Hong Kong is Chinese, the movement of seeking independence (I am sure you can find how some parliament members&#x27; display of &#x27;fuck China&#x27; during inauguration would upset Chinese government) has lead to a stage, where Chinese government would be very worries if they don&#x27;t have the control of Hong Kong. Now they are looking at this &#x27;one country two systems&#x27; differently, because one party will not respect &#x27;one country&#x27; and the other party will not respect &#x27;two systems&#x27;. The same is Taiwan. One option is to have a friendly state, it is not going to happy; the other option is to have a independent state, China will not allow it to happen. Taking Taiwan does not really benefit China, but from the government&#x27;s eye, if the relationship don&#x27;t change, and Taiwan declare independence in one way or the other, China will be forced to react or suffer the chain reaction of the result of it.')
