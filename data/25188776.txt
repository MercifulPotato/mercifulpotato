Like different countries responding to COVID: truth doesn&#x27;t really care how special the US&#x2F;Sweden&#x2F;Japan&#x2F;wherever thinks they are.<p>I read your link but I don&#x27;t understand the point that the Brookings institution is trying to make about the context  of the quote. I&#x27;m open minded, but miss the point they are making; perhaps because it&#x27;s a transcribed interview.<p>Nevertheless: quotes are nice because they distill an idea down to an elemental form. They might be wise or they might be dumb, but the simple idea expressed in the phrase (regardless of who uttered it, or what they meant at the time) seems wise to me as we consider the tradeoffs between a walled garden vis-a-vis privacy.')
