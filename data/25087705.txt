Item(by='godelski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605302757, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25086667, text='&gt; I&#x27;d love to have some sinophiles explain Xi&#x27;s strategy<p>I&#x27;m not a sinophile, but I have pro CCP friends (we get in a lot of arguments). I think the reason to support Xi is very simple. Look at Shanghai in 1990 and 2010[0] and GDP[1]. While many are still poor in China, it is nothing to what it was in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s. Many families went from living in impoverished conditions to being wealthy. Living conditions improved <i>dramatically</i> for the average Chinese person and cities appeared out of nowhere and many of them are quite successful. This is just fact. But when you look at it through this lens it is easy to understand why people support Xi. Their lives got better. Then think back to Mao, where no line couldn&#x27;t be crossed if it was for &quot;the greater good.&quot;<p>It is important to keep this in mind, because it is easy to ignore things like human rights violations, racism, colonialism. I mean the same thing happened in America. It is also easier to not compare things on a spectrum but discritized (e.g. you&#x27;re either &quot;racist&quot; or &quot;not racist&quot; there is no <i>more</i> racist or <i>less</i> racist)[2]. So what do you see in China? Your country is booming. You see America talking shit. You see Americans revolting and complaining about their own government. You see George Floyd. But you don&#x27;t see Xianjiang. You don&#x27;t see Hong Kong the same way we see it in the west (it&#x27;s just a <i>few</i> protestors). You see &quot;We, the powerful China are trying to help <i>our</i> fellow Chinese people gain a better life&quot; and the average mainlander doesn&#x27;t understand &quot;why <i>they</i> don&#x27;t want <i>our</i> help&quot; (something my Mandarin tutor said to me). They don&#x27;t see HK as successful, they see it as falling behind the rest of China.<p>So my understanding is that it is more about that they fully trust their government. They have real evidence to point to too. The other issue is that the viewpoint is different as well. Uyghurs are seen as terrorists and the term &quot;reeducation camp&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;concentration camp&quot; for them. There&#x27;s a high level of nationalism and sense of being a part of something bigger. You can also see this in how the history of China has been taught differently through history and how the definition of &quot;Han&quot; has changed (as well as what &quot;China&quot; is and called). The terms China and Han have become great unifiers for the country and people (there&#x27;s something to say to creating less racial division points). It really comes down to perception and flow of information. And I&#x27;ll be honest, seeing a lot of this makes me question a lot about the flow of information we have here in America.<p>To be honest, watching China (and America, Africa, Europe, Russia), I&#x27;ve come to believe that political support more comes down to human psychology and emotional appeal than it does to logic and morals. That might be why the current state of the economy is a good predictor of the next president (not 100% accurate, but pretty good). If you weren&#x27;t doing well before and you are doing well now, well it must be the leaders, right?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;9rcoznoiwol21.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;9rcoznoiwol21.jpg</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ichef.bbci.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;800&#x2F;cpsprodpb&#x2F;14997&#x2F;production&#x2F;_104857348_chart-china_gdp_ws_languages-fn923-nc.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ichef.bbci.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;800&#x2F;cpsprodpb&#x2F;14997&#x2F;production...</a><p>[2] I&#x27;d say that this binary thing is an important aspect (one that has also become a problem in America). But like I have friends that say that <i>America</i> is hypocritical because it complains about censorship in China but not about it on Twitter. There&#x27;s no nuance. There&#x27;s no taking into account if an individual is expressing consistent ideology (complain about censorship in China <i>and</i> in the US) vs hypocritical (complain about censorship in China <i>but not</i> in the US, or vise versa). There&#x27;s also some confusion that complaining is an essential part of democracy as criticizing your government in the west is seen as a way to improve and iterate as opposed to tearing it down.')
