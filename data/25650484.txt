Item(by='vkou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609878015, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25649794, text='&gt; I have no idea what the solution is but I think whatever it is will involve the public being more disapproving of parties that behave in a slimy manner like this.<p>One of the two parties is currently seriously considering not accepting the results of an election they lost. The leader of that party is busy calling up election officials, and threatening them into magically finding thousands of votes that will give him the victory.<p>And the rank and file of the party isn&#x27;t distancing themselves from this behavior. Instead, they are turning their ire at the person who leaked it.<p>On the order of slimy political behavior that voters don&#x27;t punish politicians for, this issue we&#x27;re discussing won&#x27;t even register. We&#x27;re currently so far down the rabbit hole, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever find our way out.<p>&gt; I have no idea what the solution is<p>That&#x27;s because there is no perfect solution. We don&#x27;t live in a perfect world. We just have to find the best solution out of a space of sub-optimal ones. And in this case, public research is a much better starting point for policy than private research, or no research (which is what would happen if we applied your standard.)')
