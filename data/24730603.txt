But I understand how someone could interpret the video differently.<p>In the video he tells how he used the term to explain to his boss why they wanted to spend time refactoring code. He justfies what they did as borrowing money to make an investment. They had to pay off the loan but he thinks this was a good investment.<p>The specific section where he talks about people getting something wrong related to the debt metaphor at 3:18, the section title &quot;Agility&quot;. If you just watch this, it can seem like he is saying they are using the term wrong. But I think what he is saying is that they are getting the _justification_ for going into technical debt wrong, not that they are using the term technical debt wrong. After he calls it a metaphor, not a term.<p>In other words, I think it is OK to use the term technical debt to refer to &quot;debt&quot; no matter how it is incurred.<p>I understand people could interpret the video differently and I would be interested in hearing other interpretations.')
