Normal people buy a lot more of everything — eating out, holidays, films, clothes, subscriptions, <i>everything</i> — and do so continuously, not just on special occasions. I don’t know why I’m different in this regard, only that I am.<p>Still, if everyone engaged with the economy the way I do, the economy as we know it would collapse. I feel that my luck is simply in being different rather than anything else.')
