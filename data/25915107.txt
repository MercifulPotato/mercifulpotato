If you gave consent to Facebook to track you &amp; you are my friend, you&#x27;ll give my phone number to Facebook, and photos of me, etc. I cannot opt out of that! And in fact FB is well known for building shadow profiles [+]<p>Look, I understand if you feel &quot;privacy rights&quot; and &quot;voting rights&quot; are not in the same class of rights, I even mentioned explicitly that even though the same principle applies, you may not agree they&#x27;re comparable. But you can&#x27;t deny that the only reason voting rights are not transferable is because we said so - we have laws that dictate &quot;voting rights are not transferable&quot;. It&#x27;s easy to imagine a world where voting rights would, in fact, be transferable. It&#x27;s just as easy to imagine a world where advertisers don&#x27;t have the right to build a profile about you.<p>What is happening now is that we started with a world where (online) privacy rights were non-existent, and laws like GDPR are aiming to change that. You may not agree with the change, but others do, and it&#x27;s a legitimate sentiment to have. It&#x27;s not necessarily outrageous to want to &quot;impose on everybody&quot; my view of privacy rights.
