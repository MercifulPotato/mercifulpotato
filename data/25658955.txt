Of course, it is an essential skill for them to have, but that&#x27;s something for a school exam and not job interview for someone with verifiable credentials. Or do you think that surgeon didn&#x27;t suture in their previous job and just &quot;winged it through&quot; for years? What exactly do you hope to achieve with such an interview question?<p>That&#x27;s exactly what is wrong with software engineering hiring and interviewing. It is  focusing on examining nonsensical minutiae instead of whether the person has any sort of design skills, is capable of teamwork or has any sort of project management skills.<p>These are way more important for a senior engineer than whether or not they have crammed algorithms for a month and can reproduce them on the spot in front of a whiteboard (and will promptly forget them in a week or two again). That algorithm can be looked up in 5 minutes if needed, lack of project management skill could pretty much doom the company in the worst case.')
