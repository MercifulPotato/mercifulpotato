Silicon valley startup valuations allow some crazy and amazing ideas to be tried, but it&#x27;s all based a premise that startups may one day become a unicorns. This also supports Silicon Valley level wages, which are almost non existent in Europe.<p>Now not only has the EU declared unicorns unwelcome, but also European users will be discounted, and perhaps even become a liability, if an EU startup seeks an exit to a US buyer. That&#x27;s a huge problem since all major EU exits are sales to US buyers.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear the Silicon valley innovation model didn&#x27;t work for Europe. But Europe still needs to figure out how to get money circulating back into productive capital. Negative interest rates mean you can park your money in real estate and ride the stagflation.<p>The current model seems to be for the government to fund all R&amp;D, but please trust me as someone who spends way too much time writing grant applications that this model sucks.')
