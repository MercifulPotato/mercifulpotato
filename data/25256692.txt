Modern cryptos trade faster, with more anonymity, and more efficiently. BTC will never see mainstream transactional use- it&#x27;s purely a store of value.<p>It still has some transactional use in online black markets for ease of purchase and name recognition- but it&#x27;s considered &#x27;legacy&#x27; and moving into unreccomended and unsupported territory on most markets.<p>I do believe that crypto does and will continue to gain use cases- but BTC is already on the tail end of it&#x27;s useful life in any of those.')
