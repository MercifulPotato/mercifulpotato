I also feel like I fit the description of a plumber presented here. The most challenging algorithmic problems that I&#x27;ve had to confront in my career, which came when I was working in DSP for an RF company, were things that were tackled by the team -- a group of very talented and very experienced engineers -- and we worked on these problems collaboratively and over a period of time that is not measurable in minutes or hours.<p>But, having said that, isn&#x27;t it also undeniable these things, these leetcode-style algorithms, are used to gatekeep entry to many of the &quot;better&quot; jobs in our field, despite the fact that we know that these things are not strictly necessary on the job? At the very least, this has been my experience and I read the same anecdotes on HN frequently.')
