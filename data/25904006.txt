Strictly speaking if we just use the term homeless you&#x27;re correct. 79% of them are not like that [ARA Asunnottomat 2019]. They&#x27;re people like students bunking in a friends bed without a valid address or other short term issues, like the social security making a mistake, but they&#x27;re eventually rectified. This means the homelessness has lasted for less than a year.<p>21% are long term homeless. And that&#x27;s what people generally mean when they collegially use the term homeless. That&#x27;s defined as homeless that has lasted for more than a year and has significant social or health component, such as substance abuse or mental illness. The thing about mental illness is that there is also treatment for them. The solution is different for them as for the substance abusers.<p>If you ever see a Finn begging it&#x27;s pretty much always an alcoholic who wants more beer. That&#x27;s because the mentally ill cannot really beg as they&#x27;re either receiving treatment or if they have unfortunately slipped trough the cracks of the system they&#x27;re also unable to beg for any extended period.<p>As for the scale of this problem. 2019 there were 961 persons listed in the long term homeless category. That&#x27;s out of a population of 5.518 million in 2019. That&#x27;s 0.017% of the whole population. Also, even out of them 584 live with someone, just not with an official address. They wouldn&#x27;t be counted as homeless in US.<p>The actual amount of people in street on that category was 177. That&#x27;s 0.003% of the population.')
