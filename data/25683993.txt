Like in the demoscene sense.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t matter that the robot couldn&#x27;t possibly coordinate everything in the video on is own. The software doesn&#x27;t just have to coordinate high level &quot;go here, move like this&quot;, you also have the lower level coordination that sits between the collision avoidance and basic driving etc and the $gcode_variant driving the servos. I&#x27;m guessing <i>that</i> stack gets a major overhaul every time one of these videos gets made, like almost every Hollywood movie has a massive &quot;software development&quot; section because of all the artistic direction that needed new or changed functionality.<p>The original video showing Spot moonwalking had the most imperceptible of splices in it right at the end of the moonwalking bit. Several months&#x27; worth of development alongside careful use of multiple scenes in this newer video have mitigated the need for hacks like that. It&#x27;s nice to see.')
