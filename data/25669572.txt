At this point new features add less and less value.&quot;<p>I agree 1000% with this! But even most websites this days add way too many features that you don&#x27;t simply need. Simplicity is the king in everything! I&#x27;m a firm beliaver in long term hardware, when building a computer it needs to last at least 10-15 years between builds or upgrades. Only exception is hardware failure or software no longer supporting some hardware (which is rare on linux) Good article thanks!')
