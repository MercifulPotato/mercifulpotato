Item(by='repartix', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610724147, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25789219, text='There&#x27;s no &quot;avg transaction fee&quot;.  The transaction fee is derived from the deposit amount, and it&#x27;s you who chooses the deposit amount (from ~$0.01 to $500) when creating a new rePOWCHA. The deposit amount isn&#x27;t a fixed $5 that you see on the front page.<p>What you may be asking is, why is there any fee if there was no abuse.  Maybe there shouldn&#x27;t be.  I&#x27;m open to removing it.<p>The practical cost right now is small, since the service just started 2 days ago and has few users.  I don&#x27;t know if the service will be sustainable at scale if there&#x27;s no abuse.  Maybe there will be enough abuse that the service will be sustainable from the 1% &quot;abuse&quot; fee.  There would have to be some way for the service to pay for itself.<p>As a user, a bigger issue may be that the mere thought the user won&#x27;t have 100% of their deposit refunded may deter them from using the service.  I&#x27;m more inclined to remove the &quot;no abuse&quot; fee for this reason.<p>On the other hand, as a web app that integrates rePOWCHA and with a large userbase, the web app may want to monetize this user interaction.<p>So I don&#x27;t know what will work best. There&#x27;s probably a balance there.<p>Since the fee seemed rather expensive to you, what fee structure would you suggest for the &quot;no abuse&quot; case?')
