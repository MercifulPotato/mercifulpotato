They&#x27;re not really fun to receive.  I remember a span when I received several and while I was <i>fairly</i> sure they weren&#x27;t serious, it&#x27;s still not too fun to think about.<p>B) whinging about inevitable death threats to deflect attention from your gaffes isn&#x27;t really great, either.  The public complaint, if anything, <i>further normalizes</i> the death threats with people inclined to make them.  Secondarily, it generates sympathy and distraction, which is probably the effect one wanted when one chose to whinge.<p>If one wants to object to death threats in a way that improves our culture and makes them less likely, it&#x27;s probably best done out of band from the actual coverage of one&#x27;s failing.  Do it retrospectively, and in contemplative channels, not ones that are already polemic and filled with attention to the failing that caused the original outrage.')
