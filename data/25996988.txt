The first example I&#x27;ve seen was from Ongakukan in 1995 (Win 95J) (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Train_Simulator_series" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Train_Simulator_series</a>). The video were 360x240 or similar and filled a CD. Quite realistic as long as you &quot;play the game&quot; and don&#x27;t stop near a road near stations where there is road traffic that then stops too.')
