While all of the reasons and possible societal factors are not well understood, the effects are.  Women tend to find only the upper percentile of men in objective attractiveness to be attractive, while men are more uniformly distributed across the spectrum of what they find attractive when comparing between genders in heterosexual dating contexts.<p>The net result is that in male skewed geographies, it&#x27;s actually possible that the majority of men may be considered undesirable.  China has a massively unbalanced gender distribution, which clearly plays an effect here as well.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;psychology&#x2F;okcupid&#x2F;yourlooksandyourinbox.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;psychology&#x2F;okcupid&#x2F;yourlooksandyo...</a>')
