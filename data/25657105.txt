I live in Uzbekistan and my father has pancreas cancer. There are no good oncologists in my country. I&#x27;ve contacted many hospitals worldwide and most of them asking about 10K USD and we must pay 80% of the bills before they start curing my father and of course I can&#x27;t afford this amount of money and I have no any option to get it. I am ready to be in debt for any amount if they could try to do smth and make my father&#x27;s last days a bit better for him.')
