It was just enough work to go get it to make me not bother with it for casual use but easy enough to grab in the case that I really needed to make a call (or get directions somewhere).  Worked like a charm for me and I noticed an almost immediate improvement in my mood and generally felt less distracted in life.   I feel now that I have broken the habit of looking at my phone I could probably keep it closer but I just don&#x27;t care enough to walk out to my car and grab it now.<p>I will still say I use my laptop more to do stuff I might have done on my phone but it feels like less of a problem to me since I don&#x27;t carry my laptop around with me everywhere. I just do what I might have normally done then put the laptop away and don&#x27;t think about it again.  Having just a little division between my online life and real life is just enough to make me feel sane again.')
