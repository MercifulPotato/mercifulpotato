Item(by='ithkuil', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607242186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25321868, text='asn.1 distinguishes between schema and encoding; there are many binary encodings and you can technically devise a custom one that would let you describe the high level structure with an asn.1 grammar and then lay out the actual bits with a custom encoding format so that it matches the pre-existing format you&#x27;re writing the new serde for). This may work as many formats have this leveled approach. E.g. the lowest level of the spec may tell something about how to encode integers (all integers are 32-bit big endian, or varlen encoded ...), sequences (ength prefixed, or terminated by a sentinel.<p>Any chances you have some reference to what you saw?')
