(Given the current tenor)</i><p>A genuine question of my own: what has planted this worry in your mind? What tenor do you speak of? The demographics of the US mean that any policy that POC want to enact has to also be supported by enormous numbers of white people; that POC-friendly policies have ever passed is evidence that working with white people is par for the course.<p>To attempt to answer your original question, it depends on what you mean by &quot;join&quot;.<p>The simplest answer is to bring it back around to class and recognize the shared fight against intergenerational poverty: support social programs that disproportionately benefit the poor of all races e.g. a livable minimum wage, expanded worker protections, public healthcare, etc.<p>If what you mean instead is to start a conversation about the unique ways in which poor whites are disadvantaged, well that&#x27;s fertile ground but it also requires acknowledging that whites and poor whites have schismed into, effectively, entirely different races (they don&#x27;t intermarry, they don&#x27;t socialize together, they hold different values, have different cultural touchstones, etc). That&#x27;s a difficult conversation to have, and you&#x27;re going to find a lot of resistance from plenty of poor whites who still want to associate their identities with a holistic &quot;whiteness&quot; that they still long to be a part of. But <i>someone</i> has to start the conversation, even if it&#x27;s uncomfortable, because the alternative is that the powers-that-be continue to wield that longing as an instrument by which to motivate poor whites to vote against the social programs that would benefit them.')
