Meanwhile, in my experience there are amoral and desperate small businesses on every streetcorner stealing anything they can get their hands on. The alternative is often to not make any money becasuse they lack the skills. When you look internationally, the tech industry consists of a finite number of skilled and capable people and organizations, plus a vast ocean of people in over their heads.')
