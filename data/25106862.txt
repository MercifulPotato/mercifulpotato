I finally decided that the Linux desktop was never going to solve its feature and compatibility shortcomings to make that possible. I much prefer Linux as a development environment, but for anything related to office productivity, compatibility issues force me to be on Windows so much that it&#x27;s not worth the effort to switch to Linux for the few things that I could do there. I could rant about lost opportunities, but that&#x27;s already been done many times by others.')
