RISC was and is a philosophy that&#x27;s basically about not adding transistors or complexity that doesn&#x27;t help performance and accepting that we have to move some of that complexity to software instead.<p>Why wasn&#x27;t it obvious previously? A few things had to happen: compilers had to evolve to be sophisticated enough, mindsets had to adapt to trusting these tools to do a good enough job (I actually know several who in the 80&#x27; still insisted on assembler on the 390), and finally, VLSI had to evolve to the point where you could fit an entire RISC on a die.  The last bit was a quantum leap as you couldn&#x27;t do this with a &quot;CISC&quot; and the penalty for going off-chip was significant (and has only grown).')
