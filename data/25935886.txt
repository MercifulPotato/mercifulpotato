We are unable to ensure Reddit&#x27;s content policy and the WSB rules are enforceable without a technology platform that can support automation of this enforcement. WSB will be back.\n</code></pre>\nThis seems like a DDOS attack on r&#x2F;wsb well knowing that the moderators cannot keep up with moderation?<p>Or is this simply a case of getting too popular for Reddit? The fact that discord was banned around the same time as r&#x2F;wsb going private is suspect.<p>edit: After hours market shows GME is has TANKED!!!! Closed at 345 and dipped to 248. Holy, there will be class action lawsuits for sure now.<p>edit: I&#x27;ve been on the phone for 2 hours waiting for my broker to answer. All of this seems weird.
