One example is that if you are inside of the sphere, at least some of the mass will be pulling you away from the point at its center. I think what you mean is that a point mass closely approximates a spherical mass, but the degree to which that is true becomes less and less the closer you get to the center. I don&#x27;t think you have successfully contradicted what the person you responded to said.')
