Or to force them to never go over the speed limit.  Or to force them to only drive smaller cars with better visibility out the windows.  Sure it would be nice if people did all these things.  But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to force any of it.  I&#x27;m sorry about your wife - that would be really scary and suck.  I hope that both of you are able to stay safe and healthy.')
