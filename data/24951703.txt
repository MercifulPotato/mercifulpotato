Ton, we\nhave to examine you.<p>At midnight I got the infamous bad news delivery by the doctor\nthat I have acute leukemia of the quite rare kind.<p>It is called APL, which is not very common, but it is very lethal.<p>So usually you don&#x27;t survive two weeks with this, unless, of course,\nthe treatment works.<p>So that&#x27;s what happened.<p>They immediately gave me blood transfusions\nand chemotherapy,\nand luckily after a few days I was recovering.<p>So I quickly moved from the critical phase\nto the phase of that you may get cured.<p>Four weeks later I was released from the hospital.<p>I was strong enough to join the rest of the\nworld in the ... lockdown, staying at home.<p>After five weeks I had my first bone marrow\ntest, which was extremely good.<p>And cancer was in remission, the doctor said. We are going to take you to the next phase, to cure you fully.<p>And that&#x27;s called the maintenance phase.<p>Maintenance, right?<p>Then he said, well ... actually it is 7 months of treatments in which\nyou have to be four months in hospital.<p>Not full time. But imagine in the afternoon you go to the hospital,\nthey hook you up with the bag of poison, you wait three hours, you\nget sick, you go home, go to bed, in the morning you feel a little bit\nbetter.<p>And in the afternoon you go back to the hospital.<p>They hook you up, and you get sick again.<p>That&#x27;s for 4 weeks, and then you get 4 weeks to recover, another 4\nweeks getting sick, and 4 weeks to recover, another 4 weeks to get\nsick, another 4 weeks to recover, another 4 weeks to get sick!<p>It was last Friday, the last of the chemotherapy.<p>And this morning I went to the doctor again\nto discuss the tests I had.<p>And luckily my blood is fantastic, the bone marrow is looking really\ngood, I could be declared cured.<p>But there was one little test they are still\nwaiting, is the DNA test, which will take another 2 weeks to get.<p>But the doctor said I shouldn&#x27;t worry about that.<p>I&#x27;m recovering extremely well.<p>So basically I&#x27;ve got my life back<p>So ...<p>And oh, how much I would have loved to sit together, today, at the\nconference with everyone because there would have been a conference\nand we would have thrown an enormous party not this year.<p>So I&#x27;m telling you this because this whole experience has had a\nprofound impact on me, on my personality, on my life of course, plus I\nhad time to think.<p>And I learned a couple of lessons.<p>First, getting cancer and surviving it\nit is not a fight. It is not something you win, something you\nlose.<p>You only need one thing. A little bit of discipline of course, to take\ncare of yourself, eat well, do some exercises.<p>But what you need is luck.<p>And I was lucky.<p>I was lucky that science found the right treatment\nfor me.<p>This is only 15 years old. This treatment for people with this kind of\nleukemia.<p>I was lucky to have family, friends around\nme to stand by.<p>I was lucky to have a team here in the company\nto stand by and to have.<p>Francesco Siddi to replace me for 8 months,\ndoing fantastic job on it.<p>So I was lucky to live in the Netherlands, \nwhere there is a universal health care for\neveryone.<p>So there was not a moment that I had to worry about what would the\ntreatment cost, and the doctors didn&#x27;t have a moment to think other\nthan what can we do for Ton, to help him, to cure him, and to make it\nas good and easy as possible for him.<p>So next time if you see people having cancer, don&#x27;t wish them strength, or in Dutch &quot;sterkte&quot;, just say good luck, and I wish you well, or a good day, a good evening.<p>Other things that I learned was that I want to start taking better care of myself,\nand I want to, I have a feeling that I was sacrificing myself too much.<p>So I want to put myself more forward, and also take care better of myself in a way that I can pay myself a little bit better.\nSo I can afford a little house outside of Amsterdam with a garden.<p>I also mentioned last year that at some moment I have to step aside from Blender, for the future, to allow other people to come in.<p>And the process is been sped up, but not so much that I want to step down, but to get very strong people around me to help making Blender strong, and keep it strong, and move on, and step forward.<p>Because the main thing I learned was that I was really really not\nready to let that go.<p>I couldn&#x27;t let go of Blender, because that&#x27; s my life&#x27; s work.<p>Blender is life, right.<p>Blender is a community.<p>It is a team of people here.<p>It is everybody who is contributing.<p>It&#x27;s the developers.<p>The bug fixers.<p>It is the people that make add-ons.<p>It is even the people who complain, or the people use Maya and don&#x27;t like Blender.<p>It is the forum trolls.<p>And even the people who want to have the game engine back.<p>So all of them are the people I love.<p>And all of them I feel like is my family.<p>And I would never let go of that family.<p>So, enough drama, right?<p>I want to end with a little more happy note.<p>As you all know 2020 is not very nice.<p>It is a year that we are going to forget.<p>But the happy message is that 2020 didn&#x27;t get me down, and I want to spread that positive vibe with everyone.<p>So please take care of yourself, take care of each other, and a little bit of Blender.<p>And I see you next year in Amsterdam, or somewhere else.<p>Bye Bye!<p>Cut.')
