She doesn&#x27;t do email for private stuff and she&#x27;s not going to install another app.<p>If I don&#x27;t message my mother via WhatsApp she&#x27;s not going to get it. She doesn&#x27;t understand what the fuss is and WhatsApp is already complicated for her.<p>I&#x27;d love to be able to message people with zero extra effort but the fact is it&#x27;s a non-zero amount between us and in the end I&#x27;m the one who has to go the extra yard.<p>I know this because I&#x27;ve not had a FB account in over 7 years now. Facebook&#x27;s not necessary but it sure as hell is easier.')
