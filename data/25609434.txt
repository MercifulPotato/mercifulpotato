The situation is not going to get better. It&#x27;s only going to get worse, and your options are two: Leave with your mental health and reputation intact or leave after they have been destroyed.<p>This is the right thing to do however for many people on a visa it has significant life consequences and financial hardship with having limited time to pack up your life and leave the country you built a life in.<p>I’m sure if the author wasn’t dependent on having a visa they would of left much sooner than they did. Companies know they have unfair leverage on employees dependent on sponsored visas. Employees on sponsored visas have very little options and next to no rights, in this case the author felt suicide might be their only way out.<p>I’ve been in a situation in a job I didn’t like with a bad manager well aware if I quit I had 90 days to find a new job or leave the country. 90 days isn’t a long time to find a new job or pack&#x2F;sell all your belongings and ship to a new country without a job&#x2F;place to live. I had to put a plan together to save enough money to cover the significant costs of leaving, a timeline to find a job with a deadline if it doesn’t work out to pack and go. The situation was far less stressful than the authors and I was in a good position where if the worst came to the worst I could take the financial hit and be relatively ok on the other end. Non the less it was incredibly stressful and put me in bad mental health so can completely understand why for some people they believe suicide to be a valid option.<p>For some people leaving is not just a case of handing in their notice.')
