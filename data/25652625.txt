I distinctly remember a shooting that was livestreamed on facebook after which law enforcement took action and seized 8chan (The site that DID ban the exact same violent clips) just do a search of facebook shooting and you&#x27;ll find that facebook is no different.<p>Another reminder is that 8chan is the same site that used cloudfare but was kicked off because cloudfare decided to take a (political?) stance against 8chan. ironically forcing them to use fringe out of country protection services to keep their site online.')
