Since then we are yet to buy bread in a shop. The machine is amazing. It literally takes 3 minutes to prep. No fancy recipe. Spoon of yeast + 400g flour + spoon of sugar + spoon of salt + 20g of butter + 280ml of water. Quick program and fresh bread is done in 2h.<p>Highly recommend it. I don&#x27;t want to advertise but we bought a well known Japanese brand after a lot of research.')
