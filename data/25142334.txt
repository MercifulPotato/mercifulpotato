I am doubting that as I write it, thinking of the hopelessness of CO2 reduction and all the things to come after we have already passed the point of no return.<p>And I wouldn&#x27;t want to grow up be a giraf either,if climbing a tree works as well, or just shake it up.<p>Oh boy, these metaphors are useless.<p>Let&#x27;s put it another way.

Maybe you are still correct insofar as we from in the midst of it cannot yet really tell what combination of skill will take the crown.<p>But then let&#x27;s drop a few names, Peter Shor, Noam Chomsky, Frederik Kortlandt.
