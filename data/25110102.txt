Thompson put it in words when he was asked for advice.<p>You ask advice: ah, what a very human and very dangerous thing to do! For to give advice to a man who asks what to do with his life implies something very close to egomania. To presume to point a man to the right and ultimate goalâ€” to point with a trembling finger in the RIGHT direction is something only a fool would take upon himself.<p>I am not a fool, but I respect your sincerity in asking my advice. I ask you though, in listening to what I say, to remember that all advice can only be a product of the man who gives it. What is truth to one may be disaster to another. I do not see life through your eyes, nor you through mine. If I were to attempt to give you specific advice, it would be too much like the blind leading the blind.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fs.blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fs.blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan&#x2F;</a>')
