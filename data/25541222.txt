Item(by='ncallaway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608954432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25535856, text='&gt; calling a trans person consistently by the wrong pronouns<p>That&#x27;s not a stage persona, though. I don&#x27;t reject that someone can transition genders, and hold political office as their preferred gender.<p>In the same way, I absolutely don&#x27;t begrudge a politician using a preferred name if it is their actual preferred name. What I personally won&#x27;t tolerate is a stage <i>persona</i>. They don&#x27;t get to &quot;play a character&quot; when they run for office.<p>&gt; Lord Buckethead does it.<p>I think this is the best example of a blurred line. I <i>don&#x27;t</i> mind Lord Buckethead&#x27;s persona, because I view his activities as political satire despite the fact that he&#x27;s using the actual election mechanisms. If, however, he stood a 1% chance of winning and actually wanted to govern I would absolutely not accept &quot;Lord Buckethead&quot; as a reasonable candidate. So, as political satire, Lord Buckethead is fine as a stage persona. As a bona fide political candidate, I think it&#x27;s absolutely wrong.')
