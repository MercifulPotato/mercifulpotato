Their freedom of speech is not abridged. Nor their freedom of the press.<p>On the other hand, forcing Facebook to host content against the owner&#x27;s wishes <i>is</i> abridgment of their freedom of the press.<p>People seem to forget the public responsibility to support media you trust. If you don&#x27;t like that Facebook blocked holocaust denial, then stop using it. Use media you support. The whole point of the First Amendment is to support a marketplace of ideas, free from government interference.<p>And if there is a slippery slope and Facebook bans, I dunno, trans support groups tomorrow, then we can talk about not using Facebook <i>because banning that content is anti-trans and that&#x27;s bad by itself,</i> not because they have no right to shape the communications ecosystem they pay for hosting on their servers.<p>It&#x27;s the Internet. If you don&#x27;t like the rules on someone else&#x27;s BBS, stop expecting them to solve your problems for you and host your own.')
