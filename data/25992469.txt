It&#x27;s not in doubt that individual-targeted advertising is more effective than than the alternatives; by eliminating user tracking you would be decreasing ROI across the board, but that&#x27;s fine because, again, all that you&#x27;re fighting for is a higher ROI than your competitors. And to reiterate, it&#x27;s not like consumer dollars are just vanishing into the ether; every dollar a consumer makes either gets spent or saved, and regardless of the ROI of a specific ad campaign they&#x27;ve still got to buy dish soap or diapers or what have you. Just because advertising ROI drops does not mean that the company revenue&#x2F;profit will drop; if it did, that probably means another company has better ROI (and if they can do so, and as long as they&#x27;re not tracking users, then good for them!).')
