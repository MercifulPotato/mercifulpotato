It kind of anti-resonates a lot with the other post currently on the front page &quot;Woo for its own sake&quot;. It also shows how the HN crowd is split in two, those who like this kind of stuff and those who don&#x27;t. For my part and in my day job these are the kind of things that I actively fight against.\nAs a fun exercise I still appreciate OP&#x27;s effort for trying out something new, it&#x27;s always welcomed and I think this forum is all about that. However, I don&#x27;t agree with the clickbaity title techniques. I hope it doesn&#x27;t normalize the practice here otherwise I&#x27;d throw in some Vodka as well :)')
