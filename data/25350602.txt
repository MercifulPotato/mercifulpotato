It just seems insane.<p>In the 90s, when high-end audio in cars was really first ramping up, I read an article which made what I consider a salient point: people buying an executive-type car with a high-end audio system built in would happily spend a fortune on a stereo for the house that they might listen to for a few hours a week, and then drop pennies (by comparison) on car audio that they could easily spend far more time with. From that perspective, the move into high-end car audio made perfect sense.<p>I see headphones in the same light; if you like listening to music, and your tastes run to music where the quality of reproduction will significantly be improved by spending more on your headphones, it&#x27;s a much more rational spend to upgrade your headphones - which you use for hours a day - than your home audio.')
