But, we also have no serious funding left to handle the pandemic. Our last governor started a rainy day fund years ago and exhausted that last year, along with part of our wildfire fund. There is nothing left for us without federal assistance.<p>There is absolutely a middle ground between putting everything on the state and having one government rule the entire world.
