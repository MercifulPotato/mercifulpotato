Unfortunately, software development performs a LOT of file IO by package management and compilers, and in the case of compilers those files are internally formatted as files containing code (eg obj files, libs or executables), even if they are only temporary during the build.<p>Because of this, an AV product could work fine for every department of the company, but have an extreme negative performance impact on software devs. To give you an idea, it could mean the difference between a 5 minute and a 1 hour build. These issues are inherent to a generic AV product so often the fix is simply to add those folders to an exclusion list.<p>Does it provide security for those folders? Nope. But the alternative could make it impossible to get work done.')
