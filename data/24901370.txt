I guess it&#x27;s just the title that has turned me off even after reading the book.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem to send the right message these days if the idea is that working programmers are building lambda calculus interpreters or theorem provers? Even interpreting a lisp would seem more practical.<p>I think Practical Common Lisp was more in the right track for content but today I&#x27;d focus more explicitly on language design or backend system design.<p>Andrew Appel&#x27;s book does already fill the language design slot though nicely.')
