S. for the Russian Nutcracker Ballet tour, then ask for asylum. Or maybe your country-that-is-not-the-US didn&#x27;t make a big deal of it, but it would be all over the news about how some ballet performer seeks asylum from The Evil Empire(tm). Of course the person would seek asylum in the U. S., The World&#x27;s Choice for Freedom(R).<p>And now Russia has a chance to turn those tables on the U. S.? I&#x27;m kind of disappointed that it took them this long to execute the obvious play.')
