I was drinking 5-6 cups of coffee per day during work days, but not on the weekends.  As I ramped up to my daily dose, I began to notice a decrease in the quality of my work.  I would come in fresh each morning and review what I had accomplished the day before, and I would notice lots of errors in the work that I had done.<p>Aside from the errors, I would get withdrawal symptoms during weekends so I decided to quit.  At the time it did not seem like a big deal.  I quit cold-turkey and had some serious headaches, but felt okay after 3-4 days.  It takes some effort to avoid all forms of caffeine, and I fell off the wagon a few times.  Each time, I could justify my actions because caffeine is so common, and nearly everyone uses it.<p>The second time I quit, the reaction seemed worse.  I felt so bad that I missed two days of work, but the symptoms weren&#x27;t really much different.<p>The third (and final) time I quit, the symptoms were pretty serious.  Aside from the headaches, I had cold sweats and vomiting.  I began to feel better after 4-5 days.  It was so bad that I was certain that I never wanted to go through it again, and I haven&#x27;t.<p>I still crave coffee, and I am tempted every morning when I make some for my (addicted) wife.  I&#x27;ve been off caffeine for over 30 years now, and I have no regrets.')
