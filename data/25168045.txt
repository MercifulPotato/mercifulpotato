That way builds run as siblings of the runner&#x27;s daemon rather than as children via docker-in-docker.<p>The huge issue with that is security which is why it&#x27;s only really practical for a single user or a small group of trusted users.  A secondary issue is that (I think) builds can&#x27;t run simultaneously because they can trample each other when tagging images (since all images are on the runner&#x27;s daemon).<p>If I had to build a Docker focused CI system I&#x27;d think about using Weave Ignite (AWS Firecracker) to spin up VMs for runners with the Docker socket bound like described above.  That way you get all the convenience of binding the Docker socket, but the isolation of a VM that gets thrown away after the build step (or pipeline) finishes.  That idea also fits well with local running &#x2F; debugging IMO because you can bind to the Docker socket on your development workstation (assuming you&#x27;re not running a large build of parallel tasks which might be an unrealistic assumption).')
