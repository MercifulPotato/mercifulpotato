I2P is designed with P2P in mind. The default Java I2P client already comes with a bundled BitTorrent client, there is also a BitTorrent client called &quot;Vuze&quot; and is used by some non-anonymous users to help seeding a torrent across the clearnet and I2P simultaneously. Because of the nature of I2P, don&#x27;t expect great speed. No seeder is &quot;usual&quot;, 10 KiB&#x2F;s is &quot;normal&quot; and 50 KiB&#x2F;s with only 3 or 5 seeders is &quot;good&quot;, overall, it feels as if it&#x27;s still the early 2000s, but when you get used to it and adopt a &quot;download and forget, come back in 3 days&quot; mentality, it&#x27;s not actually that bad. The fastest download I&#x27;ve ever seen was the movie <i>Snowden</i>, 20+ seeders and over 200 KiB&#x2F;s+...')
