Consider:<p><pre><code>  for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {..}\n</code></pre>\nIt <i>looks</i> like the invariant should be:<p><pre><code>  0 &lt;= i &lt; n\n</code></pre>\nBut if they mistyped the loop that would be wrong. You have to explicitly state your invariants. At best, you could detect them and ask for confirmation. And that&#x27;s for an easy to detect case.')
