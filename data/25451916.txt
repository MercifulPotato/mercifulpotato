So, the last 9 months I have dedicated myself to help my daughter in her educational process and I had a profound experience with her that reminded me of all the frustration that I experimented during my 18 years of college and university receiving a lot of information that in a large percentage was irrelevant to me. For this reason, I decided to create a new educational model with a totally different approach from the traditional one, hoping to avoid my daughter having the same frustration that millions of people share with me and with the conviction that this educational vision is the correct way to educate<p>Have a nice day :)')
