Item(by='throwanem', descendants=None, kids=[25944269, 25938777], score=None, time=1611813596, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25938572, text='My own interest in nootropics is some years behind me now, but I note that Nootropics Depot does have bulk phenylpiracetam powder in stock, and I don&#x27;t recall filling my own capsules to have been especially difficult. Slow and exacting work, to be sure, but also the kind of work that a good podcast or TV show helps go faster. With a little practice and a good capsule filling machine, you can make a month&#x27;s worth of doses in a couple of hours - cheaper than buying prefilled capsules, too.')
