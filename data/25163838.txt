If you require RISC to be a load&#x2F;store architecture, x86 is not even close to be one. Also, aarch64 is a variable-length instructions set and include complex instructions (such as those to perform AES operations). Compiler optimizations are meant to be taken advantage by all architectures, regardless of RISC&#x2F;CISC.')
