Item(by='knowaveragejoe', descendants=None, kids=[25910911], score=None, time=1611616869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25910162, text='&gt; Is the idea here that by putting assertions that were discredited and that failed in court cases heard by Republican and, in some cases, Trump-appointed judges in Airtable, they somehow gain credibility?<p>Yes.
