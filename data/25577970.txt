E.g. Santa Clara County Fairgrounds are set up for high throughput drive-through COVID testing and plans are to use the same infrastructure that can host massive numbers of cars and lanes to have massive numbers vaccinated and waiting out their 20 minute observation time.  This site will be able to do thousands of doses per day-- &gt;0.3% of the County&#x27;s population per day-- alone, which exceeds the number of doses we can be expected to be allocated for quite some time.<p>Johnson and Johnson is the best hope for another near-term EUA, which could significantly improve vaccine supply in February.')
