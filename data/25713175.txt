For example, most of the tech companies in London don&#x27;t even provide health insurance, since they rely on NHS.<p>Startups try to use options to convince people but what you&#x27;re given mostly wouldn&#x27;t make you a millionaire in the event of exit or IPO.<p>I guess the other group of companies who could match what FAANG offers as a whole package would be hedge funds. I would say it&#x27;s harder to enter them tho, since they still can throw your CV to the bin just because you don&#x27;t have a degree from oxbridge.')
