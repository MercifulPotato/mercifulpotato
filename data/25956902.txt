Regardless of what industry you&#x27;re in, every business will face inevitable lossesâ€”customers will decide to leave, inflation will occur, equipment will need to be repaired&#x2F;replaced, etc. Those losses need to be offset by growth.<p>While net positive growth isn&#x27;t necessary, it is a major motivator for launching your own business. If you don&#x27;t have net growth, then you&#x27;re exchanging both your efforts in working at the business as well as in the day-to-day running of the business in exchange for a relatively fixed income. I&#x27;m not sure that the risk involved combined with the income to hours-worked ratio is much more beneficial than just working as an employee with much lower risk and no responsibility to run&#x2F;manage the business.')
