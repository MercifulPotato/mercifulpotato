Solar and wind in the US are incredibly cheap sources of energy.  Literally the cheapest options: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451445&#x2F;grphx_lcoe-02-02.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451445&#x2F;grphx_lcoe-02-02.jpg</a><p>Residential solar is expensive because you don&#x27;t have the same economy of scale you see in utility-scale deployments.  Also something like 1&#x2F;3 of the cost is &quot;soft costs&quot; such as marketing and the crazy red tape associated with permitting.<p>The latest academic modelling shows that we can meet 70-80% of energy demand from renewable energy alone, even without storage.  All it requires is building a modest excess of capacity and a 50&#x2F;50 wind&#x2F;solar mix.
