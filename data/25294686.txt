Lots of people can guess what non-dangerous cocaine use looks like, though: I mean, is once a month dangerous use if you do a reasonable amount when you do it, assuming you are otherwise healthy? Can you not warn folks that you might find yourself wanting more cocaine after doing a bit of cocaine and offer tips for dealing with that?<p>Are there ways to make cocaine use safer? Yes, of course! Legalisation will help greatly (you&#x27;ll know exactly what you are getting and we can standardize strength like we&#x27;ve done with alcohol). We can also educate folks in a variety of ways. Offer free help to folks that do find themselves addicted. I&#x27;m going to guess folks wrote about it more indepth before it became illegal as well.')
