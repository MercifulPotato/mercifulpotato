It&#x27;s not.<p>What we&#x27;re arguing is why everything is not fine.<p>SGIs ran VR, multiple displays, and very demanding apps in the nineties too. They did all sorts of wonky, complex, 3d input devices too. So did DEC Alphas. This is the stuff Unix was built for.<p>My claim is that nineties Linux was much closer to having the right architecture for it than 2020 Linux for this sort of stuff. The reinventions and onion layers didn&#x27;t help; they hurt.<p>I think the only piece nineties Linux didn&#x27;t anticipate was the level of hot-swapping hardware (USB, Bluetooth, displays, etc.), and the level of power management. Modern Linux never got that architected or integrated quite right, because it was built with hack upon hack upon kludge. It&#x27;s split up in bizarre ways between kernel and user space which would be really tough to clean up right now.')
