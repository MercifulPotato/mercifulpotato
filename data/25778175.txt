I wonder if you went back in time and invested more in compilers and ecosystem if it could have succeeded? VLIW could really reduce complexity by dumping a lot of instruction re-ordering stuff and eliminating the need for tons of baroque vector instructions for specific purposes.<p>The biggest thing Intel didn&#x27;t do with Itanium was release affordable AT&#x2F;ATX form factor boards. They priced it way, way too high, chasing early margins in &quot;enterprise&quot; without realizing that market share is everything in CPUs. This is the same mistake that Sun, DEC, and HP made with their server&#x2F;workstation CPUs in the previous era. With a new architecture you&#x27;ve got to push hard for market share, wide support, and scale.<p>If I&#x27;d been in charge I would have priced the first iterations of Itanium only a little above fab cost and invested a lot more in compiler support and software.<p>Edit: also whatever happened to the Mill? The idea sounded tenable but I have to admit that I am not a CPU engineer so my armchair take is dubious.<p>Anyway the ship has sailed. Later research in out of order execution has yielded at least similar performance gains and post-X86 the momentum is behind ARM and RISC-V.')
