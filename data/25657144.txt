Item(by='dusted', descendants=None, kids=[25657661], score=None, time=1609936554, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652275, text='I&#x27;ve used a lot of tools recently, including crowbars and hammers of various sizes. This is a stupid idea, as stupid as multi-tool pliers or the swiss army knife.<p>It means that it WILL sell, and the buyers will be the category of hipsters sporting well-trimmed beards, thick rimmed glasses and forester&#x27;s shirts. The customers will be very happy with their product, as happy as they are with their multi-tool pliars and GPS watches, and since they will never actually use it for anything remotely resembling actual work (as with their other posessions) they will remain happy with it.<p>So.. Good on you, Cole-Bar. You can be as next-gen as you want, you&#x27;ll never get picked up on an actual building site. You&#x27;re too flimsy (and expensive) to use as a crowbar (they are TOOLS and they will be hit and bent in every imaginable angle, with any imaginable tool), and you are.. not a good hammer for anything, not as a light precise hammer, not as a heavy duty one. Congratulations, you&#x27;re about as useless as your target audience, a match made in heaven.')
