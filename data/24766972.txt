The rest of the world used to see the US as a beacon of democracy. But the country seems to be utterly incapable of organizing fair elections for its populace. Voter registration failures. Voter intimidation. Politicians literally redrawing maps in order to gain an advangate. A president casting doubt on the validity of mail-in ballots. Postal services being (deliberately?) interfered with before an election?<p>What the hell?')
