Sure, stop signs are important but that’s such a basic aspect of driving as to basically be irrelevant.  All self driving AI’s are going to get really good at identifying stop signs very early in development, it’s stuff like mirages   that designers may never consider that make or break such systems.<p>The easiest elements for humans to interpret are therefore the least important as they’re going to have plentiful training data and people checking for failures.  Interpretability is therefore only really useful for toy problems that don’t actually need machine learning.')
