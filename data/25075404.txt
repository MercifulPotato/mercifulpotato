Apple truly disrupted them all: phone mfrs, carriers, and the app environment.<p>Apple has an opportunity to do the same with the cloud business.  They have three lines of attack, ones they&#x27;ve used before.  1 - a lot of cloud code is platform agnostic (in Python or js etc) so for that the switching cost will be lower 2 - they have an edge in privacy protection and, on a cost basis, their NN chips vs Nvidia who has been lucky enough to enjoy a quasi-monopoly.  People will pay for this, especially when&#x2F;if privacy rules start to have teeth.  3 - Since they are vertically quite integrated and build their own chips, Apple can build web hardware optimized for high performance networking, lots of NNs, etc with kernels to go with.  Their cost structure is potentially a lot lower even compared to open connect folks because they already have everything set up to build lots of machines so they can be quite profitable while undercutting the Amazons of the world.<p>Local server machines?  Not a chance.  And will they do the cloud?  It seems likely they will be driven to it, but given their decades of poor execution on anything but hardware it seems better than even odds that they would flub it despite putting great people on it.')
