I apologize for perhaps not being clear.<p>My question is specifically how would you (the person I&#x27;m responding to) would react to a hypothetical New York Times opinion piece stating that PornHub in particular and no other hypothetical website, has never had illegal content or child sex exploitation material knowingly or unknowingly. I&#x27;m not asking in broad terms, I&#x27;m asking about what your response would be to this individual article.<p>I am not asking about trees or apples or cancer. I&#x27;m asking about a specific instance of your reasoning in regard to this single subject. Just the one single hypothetical question with a very narrow scope.')
