I&#x27;ve definitely refused to work at companies (like Facebook) on the grounds that I think they are doing much more harm than good in the world. But there are also megacorps which I consider to be doing less harm per capita than other technology businesses which I would work for.<p>Part of the issue is that media companies have darlings and enemies that they don&#x27;t really cover proportionately to their offenses, IMO (for example if Google even considers doing any business in China - uproar. But Bing actively sells out Chinese users to the Chinese government and nobody cars, because right now Microsoft is a media darling). And the media doesn&#x27;t write about smaller companies doing bad things usually, unless they are particularly bad, because they fail the &quot;who cares&quot; test.<p>There is also an inherent chaos that comes with companies with hundreds of thousands of employees - bad people will get through hiring and do bad things, people will make very high impact mistakes, things become uncoordinated. So for me personally I try to think of companies in terms of badness-per-capita and whether the rot is coming from the top (Facebook) or is seemingly &quot;random&quot;.')
