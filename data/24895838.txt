We&#x27;re losing nothing here.<p>1) Cache hit must be extremely low because of different versions&#x2F;variants&#x2F;CDN for each library. (Have you seen how many jquery there are?).<p>2) It&#x27;s irrelevant outside of the few most popular libraries on the planet, maybe jquery&#x2F;bootstrap&#x2F;googlefonts.<p>3) Content is cached once on page load and the saving are happening over the next tens or hundreds pages you visit. That&#x27;s where the gain of caching is (10x - 100x). Saving 1 load when changing site is negligible in the grand scheme of things.')
