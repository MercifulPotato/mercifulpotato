Things are a lot better in GKE land.<p>AWS never wanted EKS to be a thing, that is why it&#x27;s overpriced and not very good.<p>Unfortunately ECS is crap and Fargate can&#x27;t save it at this point.<p>Hopefully they get over that soon and make the industry standard stuff like EKS and MSK good and actually price competitive with running it yourself (accounting for ease of management premium ofc).')
