Item(by='majewsky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609672743, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620264, text='&gt; The investment to become fluent in Go might literally be an order of magnitude less than becoming fluent in rust.<p>From my own experience with both languages, it&#x27;s actually closer to two orders of magnitude. One order of magnitude might be correct for the language, but Rust requires you to navigate the ecosystem very early on [1], whereas Go gets you much farther with its stdlib in its common usecases.<p>[1] For example, you pretty much immediately have to decide &quot;Tokio vs async-std vs std&quot; if you want to do anything with IO, or &quot;Actix vs Rocket vs whatever&quot; for HTTP, at a point where you probably cannot gauge the ramifications of these choices properly.')
