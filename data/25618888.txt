I wonder what you are a practitioner of exactly.  If it&#x27;s some sort of traditional therapy you should be aware that for PTSD and severe depression the evidence is that traditional therapy is very ineffective.  So what would you suggest for those suffering from these conditions if not psychedelic-assisted therapy, which from my reading is actually far more effective for these conditions than traditional therapy?')
