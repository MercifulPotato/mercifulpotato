Censorship is something that is done in response from government&#x2F;media pressure. Censorship costs money, but it is a cost of doing business in places like China, and now it seems to be becoming part of the cost of doing business in the United States as well.<p>An additional point that I think many people are not realizing is that Twitter is the defecto medium that journalists and &quot;informed citizens&quot; use to get breaking news in the US. Sure there is a layer of indirection in the censorship, but how is this layer of indirection meaningfully different than the censorship done on the WeChat &quot;platform&quot;?')
