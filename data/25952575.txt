Item(by='0x737368', descendants=None, kids=[25953473], score=None, time=1611884989, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25952052, text='Shame that you&#x27;re getting downvoted on HN for such views - most consumers don&#x27;t care about devices designed to be long-lasting and if the technical population doesn&#x27;t too then it&#x27;s totally a lost cause.<p>I&#x27;ve recently purchased a used T530, which was the last model to feature a removable battery, removable CPU, unsoldered RAM, etc etc(for the pedants - yes, later models still had some of these features, but none of them had all of them). It&#x27;s a fantastic machine that runs everyday tasks without a hitch and with having the option to easily repair it I hope it will last at least another 10 years. The only disadvantage I have compared to the newer T490 model that I use is that it&#x27;s about 1kg heavier.<p>I think it&#x27;s reasonable that some consumers would prefer a lighter and thinner machine, even if that includes sacrificing modularity&#x2F;repairibility, but I doubt those make up the majority and most are just apathetic and willing to go the way of disposable consumerism that corporations are pushing to drive profits further.')
