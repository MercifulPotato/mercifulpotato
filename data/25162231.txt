A customer bought my software more than an year ago and used it.<p>The software has a 30 day free trial (no cc) and also a 30 day money back guarantee after purchase.<p>He used the trial version then upgraded the software. Sent me one email about something not working which I replied to. Never asked for refund.<p>Then almost after 1 year he files a dispute in Paypal (which Paypal decided in my favor btw) but now he is harrasing me almost every other day about leaving negative reviews if I don&#x27;t refund him.<p>He has already left a few negative reviews about my software but I&#x27;m okay with since it&#x27;s just angry abusive non-sense that has nothing to do with my software.<p>But he keeps on threatning me with emails. Now he is threatning filing police complaint against me and my company.<p>Part of me wants to refund him and get it over with (just 200 bucks) - though I can&#x27;t be sure if this would stop his non-sense.<p>But another part of me is angry and feels that this is not right and I should just fight it out.<p><i>Please give me some advice if you have experience with this.</i>')
