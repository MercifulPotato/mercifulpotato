I learned how to code on my own by reading&#x2F;watching tutorials, then picking a project and working on it solving all the issues that come up. This works great but there&#x27;s one huge catch: you need to have a TON of motivation, otherwise you&#x27;ll drop it halfway because some times there&#x27;s no one to guide you, to simplify things, explain another way, etc once you run into something you just don&#x27;t get. By your own it can take 2 weeks solving an issue that could just take a couple of hours if there was someone to guide you more personally.<p>I managed to learn a lot of things this way at 18-19 year old, if I doudbt I could pull it off when I was younger than that when I had interests like football or being a rockstar.')
