I have to use third party apps like Toolbox Pro to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; and even then, there&#x27;s things iOS just won&#x27;t let you do - automating responses to iMessages, for example, or sending iMessages in the background, or responding to arbitrary notifications (wouldn&#x27;t it be great if I could have iOS notify all my friends I&#x27;m driving on any chat app, rather than just Messages?)<p>A good starting point would seem to be what OP wanted - enable Shortcuts access to every toggle in the Settings app. Let me programmatically read and update notification, widget, screen, background, accessibility, Siri, battery, privacy, etc. settings that I can only access through the Settings app. Yes, I know I can do this for WiFi or Bluetooth settings, but there should be much, much more. And I should be able to consent to Shortcuts doing things in the background without my explicit permission, much like I can set up cron jobs on my home PC.')
