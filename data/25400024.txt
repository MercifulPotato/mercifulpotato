Item(by='jancsika', descendants=None, kids=[25401360], score=None, time=1607795226, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398379, text='&gt; I value storycraft.<p>The <i>form</i> of this story has used widely since, and those stories have been incredibly popular with both authors and audiences for well over 100 years now. Implying that a tried-and-true technique of story-telling lies <i>outside</i> of storycraft betrays basic a lack of understanding of the subject.<p>Story tellers enjoy this form for the challenge of balancing what the omniscient narrator reveals-- too much or too strong in one direction and the whole thing falls flat. Readers enjoy the form because it feels a bit like ski jumping-- the writer provides the momentum and the reader&#x27;s imagination leaps off the end with all the story&#x27;s implications flying past.<p>In fact, Nabokov balanced this same form masterfully in the short story, &quot;Signs and Symbols.&quot; The effect there is that the reader leaps off into a level of... well, I don&#x27;t want to ruin it. :) But it&#x27;s enough to say that outside of VR I don&#x27;t think that story could have been effectively written without using the lady-or-the-tiger form.')
