Who finds something first gets the cake and so on. For example when I was playing with digital synthesis, it felt natural for me to modulate the phase within the grain of sample and then I learned it has been patented by Casio. Then recently I read about so called TMT technology, where company essentially patented adding tolerance to components when simulating circuits... I mean d&#x27;oh? If you want to do realistic simulation, that&#x27;s one of the things to take into account, but now that it is patented, good luck. This whole thing needs to be scrapped.')
