They shut down anyone for a slightest mistake, so I&#x27;m just not going to feel sorry for them for their own incompetence or because it&#x27;s hard. If they fuck up, the government will bail them out. If smaller companies they often destroy fuck up, no one will bat an eye. Split them up if necessary, maybe that will fix at least some of the problems.')
