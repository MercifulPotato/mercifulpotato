If the only benefit of freedom of speech was to offend other people it wouldn&#x27;t be much of a foundation of civilization.<p>Sometimes it is important to make people uncomfortable in the name of progress.  Sometimes people take advantage of that to be trolls.  The two are inseparable and to a generic outside observer indistinguishable.<p>But the real reason for freedom of speech is purely to preserve individual liberty and remove any value judgement on the part of society.  The only time it is ok to limit speech is when it poses a risk of real harm to others.')
