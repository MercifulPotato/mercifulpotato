Both require a terminal to be effortless for the consumer (an LCD or e-ink display that shows a real time QR with transaction details like amount, or an NFC chip that does the same thing).<p>I think QR is slightly worse since I have to open my camera app, or open my payment app and select camera, vs just waving my watch&#x2F;phone at a terminal.<p>Things like metro payments are 100% doable with NFC and would be an awful nightmare with QR.')
