Without subsidy, many would just go back to the standard fare of pizza, Chinese, Indian, and Thai food within a half mile radius.<p>We will first have to wait and see whether the on-demand delivery business model will work out in a cheaper country, e.g. GrabFood in Indonesia. Even in such country, my sense is that the restaurants are still getting charged too much to cover for the subsidy given the customers, while the delivery riders are still being paid too little and have to rely on infrequent big tips.')
