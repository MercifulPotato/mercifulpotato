Playing wack-a-mole won&#x27;t help and we probably need some sort of legislation to prove value is being provided before being charged.<p>(BTW I don&#x27;t believe paying Google to prevent being above me is value ad. The intention of the searcher is known)<p>Another example is how Google charges an app creator 30% if someone purchases a subscription. A charge that occurs every, single, month despite Google providing no value after the first month. What&#x27;s an app owner to do? Push for Apple store...where also take 30% cut?')
