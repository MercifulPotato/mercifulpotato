If the on-call incident bonus was $200&#x2F;hr with a $400 minimum that would do it for me (your numbers may be different).<p>This also incentivizes the company not to mess around with on call for dumb problems. A user is locked out at 3am? Not a $400 problem. The server goes down at 3am? That is a $400 problem.<p>If you really want to stick to your guns with time over money, then make the on-call bonus a time-in-lieu situation. For every hour worked on-call you get half a day of time off.<p>Of course, you can always just stick to your guns. &quot;Part of the reason I chose this job is that I don&#x27;t have to do on-call duties. It is a company policy that it is voluntary. Changing that policy materially changes the terms of my employment in a way that matters very much to me.&quot; That last sentence is written in a way that will make HR people nervous without being impolite.<p>Any manager, or HR person can read right between the lines of that, which is essentially: &quot;Try me. Best case is a renegotiation of my contract. Worst case is that I jump ship to any of the unlimited competitors that will give me what I want.&quot;')
