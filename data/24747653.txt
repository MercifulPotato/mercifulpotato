I was considering a Mazda MX-3, learned in the dealer that it was disontinued, walked by the neighbour Toyota dealer and in half an hour I went from &quot;too expensive&quot; to &quot;I want it already&quot;, even if it&#x27;s white.<p>I&#x27;ve made a quick research and it seems that painting a car costs no more than two thousand euros, probably less. Next time, I will buy the white version (cheapest) and it will go to painting right away. I don&#x27;t like the out of the box options anyway.')
