Our textbooks tend to have a lot more linear ones simply because they are easier to handle and teach, not because of their prevalence.<p>Even when you get to the nitty gritty of real world circuits, you&#x27;ll encounter nonlinearities and have to deal with them. The linear approach is fine for undergrad curricula, but having worked with some of the frontiers of circuit&#x2F;semiconductor work professionally - you can&#x27;t build great products by relying on linear diff eqs alone.<p>Furthermore, linear diff eq&#x27;s are somewhat of a solved problem. A researcher is unlikely to discover a phenomenon today that is governed by a linear equation.<p>&gt; Even for something as infamous as the Navier-Stokes equation, you can extract important parameters like the Reynolds number, Froude number, and so on -- which I hope I don&#x27;t need to explain why they&#x27;re extremely useful, even for a numerical design approach -- so even if you can&#x27;t solve the equation, you can still get a lot of mileage out of the analysis itself.<p>Here I think we are merging a little: I took only one fluid mechanics&#x2F;dynamics course (albeit 20 years ago), and we were taught the Reynolds number, etc. The thing is, I would say there were only two engineering courses I took in my whole undergrad where the analytical approach is not particularly helpful, and one really has to go full out &quot;engineer&quot; - either by looking up lots of (empirical) graphs and tables, or use numerical methods. Fluid mechanics was one of those courses.<p>Yes, I agree that doing <i>some</i> level of analytical work on the diff equations is very useful, but in the majority of cases, the main purpose of doing some theoretical analysis on the differential equation is to get it into a form where one can apply numerical techniques to it.<p>I&#x27;m not a fluid mechanics person, but I&#x27;d wager that most of the useful results we have from the Navier Stokes equation came out of some numerical technique (perhaps after a bit of analytical work).<p>In any case: Yes, I agree - it is useful to do some analytical work on it. But the bulk of the gains in the real world come from applying numerical technique on them. And more to the point: Most of what is taught in a typical diff eq course is of little use in doing that analytical work.<p>Edit: As another anecdote, for my grad research, I went the analytical route, as that was what my advisor preferred. Thing is, it was fine in his day when the field was young. Most of the people doing research use numerical methods (often from first principles, so almost no analytical approach applied). They basically &quot;won&quot;. When you look at the useful results in the discipline in the last 10-15 years, the numerical ones outnumber the analytical ones easily by a factor of 10.')
