For me, this was only the first few weeks. Once you know the (simple) borrowing rules, it is rarely a problem anymore. It only rears its head every now and then when you know something is valid, but the borrows checker is not able to infer it.<p>Another dimension to it is that the borrows checker rules also apply in most other languages if you want to write valid code. They are just not enforced and you have to rely on your own discipline instead (which humans are bad at).')
