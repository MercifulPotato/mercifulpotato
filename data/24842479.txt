It’s not what one would reasonably expect and is therefore a betrayal of users’ trust.<p>If Apple switched gatekeeper on MacOS to completely remove the option and the workarounds to run unsigned apps, it would certainly be more secure. It would also be a huge betrayal of users’ trust in Apple and the MacOS platform.')
