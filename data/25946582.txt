[0]<p>The reason for the extra &gt;100% has to do with how the stock lending works (Matt Levine wrote a bit about this recently). [1] Quoted below.<p>--<p>&quot;This does not necessarily mean a lot of people are doing evil illegal nefarious naked shorting! Really, I promise! There is no special limit on shorting at 100% of shares outstanding! Here is an explanation of how options market makers (discussed below) are allowed to short without a locate, but I want to offer an even simpler explanation. There are 100 shares. A owns 90 of them, B owns 10. A lends her 90 shares to C, who shorts them all to D. Now A owns 90 shares, B owns 10 and D owns 90â€”there are 100 shares outstanding, but 190 shares show up on ownership lists. (The accounts balance because C owes 90 shares to A, giving C, in a sense, negative 90 shares.) Short interest is 90 shares out of 100 outstanding. Now D lends her 90 shares to E, who shorts them all to F. Now A owns 90, B 10, D 90 and F 90, for a total of 280 shares. Short interest is 180 shares out of 100 outstanding. No problem! No big deal! You can just keep re-borrowing the shares. F can lend them to G! It&#x27;s fine.&quot;<p>--<p>I still think what Robinhood did here is both wrong <i>and</i> a stupidly short-sighted that will damage their brand, but there&#x27;s so much over confident misinformation about what&#x27;s happening surrounding this that it makes it harder to understand.<p>The NYT is no better - another dumb Taylor Lorenz article got less right than most random Twitter threads.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;simoj_&#x2F;status&#x2F;1354664677364609026" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;simoj_&#x2F;status&#x2F;1354664677364609026</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;newsletters&#x2F;2021-01-25&#x2F;money-stuff-the-game-never-stops" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;newsletters&#x2F;2021-01-25&#x2F;money-...</a>')
