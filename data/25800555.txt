Here&#x27;s the full text: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-020-79429-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-020-79429-1</a>.<p>The first thing they did was a proteomic screen of the study participants&#x27; blood samples to identify proteins that are associated with cardiovascular disease. They analyzed each of 1305 proteins with a univariate logistic regression model, and a P-value threshold of 0.05, and they found 36 proteins. There&#x27;s nothing in the materials and methods about multiple-testing corrections or controlling the false discovery rate, which are standard and essential techniques when going on &#x27;omic fishing expeditions like this.<p>Given that many or most of these 36 proteins could be false positives, all the subsequent analysis of the associations between the proteins and the religiosity&#x2F;spirituality scores and their impact on CVD is highly questionable.')
