Poor data intuition is an exclusive focus on the quantitative with little understanding of the underlying reality.<p>You don&#x27;t understand the actual patterns in reality, therefore suspect data movements do not surprise you (and make you suspicious). You don&#x27;t understand the actual patterns in reality, therefore you do not explore potentially fruitful avenues for data analysis.<p>Expanding one&#x27;s data intuition is about using data to <i>enrich</i> one&#x27;s understanding of reality, as opposed to ignoring reality in favour of the data.')
