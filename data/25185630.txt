A great example of this was the compromise that ended up weakening the 15th ammendment which gave an out for what would become poll taxes and eventually Jim Crow. The civil rights movement needed to take place 100 years after the civil war, and even since then people are still kicking and screaming to deprive black people of their rights.<p>If you don&#x27;t agree with John Brown&#x27;s radically as the author of the book in question doesn&#x27;t, one argument for respect of his point of view is that the reform that Lincoln and later Republicans pushed actually didn&#x27;t quite lead to full equality, and now, 160 years later, we&#x27;re still grappling with the shortcomings of their incomplete revolution.')
