Then I studied NLP for MSc and now I am an applied scientist at a FAANG company. I like my job because it&#x27;s intellectually challenging and I like research but one thing I miss a lot is coding. I code far less than I used to. Because we mostly do fine-tuning and data preparation which is pretty standard in any sort of applied positions.<p>I constantly have this dilemma: Whether or not I should move back to my old software engineering career. Has anybody been in this position? any sort of advice?')
