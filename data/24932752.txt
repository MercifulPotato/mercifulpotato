Thank you.<p>From what you say, stacking can remove both random noise from the sensor and predictable noise such as light pollution. What other kinds of noise are there? It sounds like our noise removal ability is pretty good.<p>I am not an expert though. I do know we can&#x27;t image the Apollo landing sites no matter how good our stacking software is. Our sensors aren&#x27;t good (big) enough. I don&#x27;t have an understand of why that is though.<p>An analog loop would have hard limitations, just like a telescope. I&#x27;m not sure how much noise stacking could clean up. At this point I&#x27;m more curious than thinking it&#x27;s a good solution.')
