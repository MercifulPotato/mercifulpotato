Still think they are the better of 2 options.<p>And on White Fragility is <i>exactly</i> the sort of book that would have, in the 1940s, been used to justify Hitlerian race theory. In the 1940s it would be pointing out that Jews are systematically advantaged and as a group trying to downplay race but that one can&#x27;t claim to be blind to it.')
