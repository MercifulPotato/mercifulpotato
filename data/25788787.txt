The 40-hour work week is still, on the whole, the minimum expectation across many FAANG-like companies. If falling ill during tenure, such companies ~generally seem receptive and supportive. But if you try to join such companies when you are already chronically ill or disabled, and ask for part-time working arrangements or reactive flexibility (e.g. I only have X spoons today so I can&#x27;t work as much, but I can work a little [&quot;semi-sick day&quot;]), it&#x27;s much much harder. Nowadays I only have about 2-3 hours of cognitive time per day. After that I need to lie down and do nothing. It seems so unfair that entire swathes of competent individuals are implicitly sidelined because of their illnesses or disabilities.')
