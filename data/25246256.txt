Not exactly performance to write home about, and they had all been discontinued (and mostly destroyed) by 2008 when Tesla started selling the Roadster.<p>Essentially all you could get were golf carts, mobility scooters, and the G-Wiz.<p>So the idea that &quot;electric cars by their nature are fast&quot; was very much not in evidence at that time. The Tesla Roadster, with 200+ miles of range and a 125mph top speed, was one of the first demonstrations that an electric car didn&#x27;t have to mean compromising on performance.')
