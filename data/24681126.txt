I often use in-home small bluetooth speakers and frankly i&#x27;m happy enough with them - i just want more of them, with more power.<p>So for louder, phone connected speakers would you still recommend Sonos? Ie i&#x27;m not sure i need the idea of multiple rooms playing the same thing. I&#x27;d love it, but my wife wouldn&#x27;t hah. However i do want (decent) quality speakers in all rooms that i can play music on, and i&#x27;m largely satisfied with the bluetooth-phone experience. I&#x27;m just not satisfied with my tiny bluetooth speaker quality or sound level.<p>Any opinion of if i should look into Sonos? Or would cheaper bluetooth speakers fit better?<p><i>(edit: Sidenote, the voice assistant option is a downside for me. Otherwise i&#x27;d probably own a few Apple HomePods)</i>')
