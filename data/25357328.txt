Case remained unsolved for 20 years, until a cold case team was put on it and the police decided to have one ultimate go at solving the case. Via a massive DNA harvest on all men who were age 12 and older at the time the crime was committed and who lived in the area of the crime (hence 21500 men). I was one of them who volunteered (though I feel reluctant about massive DNA harvesting). Because one male could discredit the entire male family tree this allowed the police to narrow down on a suspect who fled the area around the time the massive DNA harvest was announced. The suspect, Jos B., got sentenced to 12,5 years imprisonment a few weeks ago. It was sufficiently proven he raped the victim, and also he got convicted for owning child pornography. Given the impact the case had on the community (myself included, in various ways, such as being afraid to be near the vicinity of the crime scene due to being stalked there as teenager), I&#x27;m very glad it got solved. One of the heights of 2020 for me. Unfortunately prosecution and defense want to go to a higher court, and he did not get TBS (forced psychiatric treatment) [2]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Death_of_Nicky_Verstappen#DNA_profiling" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Death_of_Nicky_Verstappen#DNA_...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;terbeschikkingstelling#Noun" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;terbeschikkingstelling#Noun</a>')
