Gates &amp; Balmer are now nothing more than shareholders (Gates stepped down from the board in March this year). Believe it or not, it&#x27;s people that determine how a company is run and the people running Microsoft today are not the people that were running it in the 80s &amp; 90s.<p>Large business units with billions in revenue take years to change direction, and we&#x27;ve seen that clearly happen under Nadella.')
