I don&#x27;t really go for all the unicorn&#x2F;muffin&#x2F;whatever type childish aspects, but friendly UI&#x27;s are a welcome change from the sort of austere &#x27;businessy&#x27; UIs.<p>This also doesn&#x27;t just apply to work, many people my age (32) are super into cartoons and Disneyland, but the concept of going to Disneyland without a child in your 30s seems... weird to me. It is probably good that people feel comfortable to be sort of weird though versus the stoic version of adulthood in the past.')
