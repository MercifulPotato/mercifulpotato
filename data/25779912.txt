Projects where someone developed a strategy but has never been involved in the details of a machine are doomed to failure (or at best to be unreliable and producing low quality parts).  Projects built by machine fabricators are over-engineered, frequently late, and sometimes unprofitable, but damn if they don&#x27;t work well.<p>The main trouble, I think, is that when a shiny new contraption is brought to the king, it&#x27;s too often the magicians doing the talking - whether they&#x27;re speaking words of power or Common, their job is to talk. Meanwhile, the blacksmith is probably busy at in his workshop some ornate scroll work for the next thing, or repairing the previous gizmo, because he&#x27;d rather be hammering away at his anvil than talking.<p>The higher you go in an org chart, the fewer the number of people who understand the work their company actually does, and the more voices you have between the workers and the decision-makers to take some of the credit for work as it passes up the chain.')
