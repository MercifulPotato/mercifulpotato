Most humans are incapable of discussing these topics rationally, and it only serves to increase division at work.<p>One person could not handle the idea of not being politically active at work, and we discovered after she quit that almost everyone was happier no having her toxic commentary omnipresent.<p>In the best case scenario, folks like this are a big distraction - at worst they are a source for litigation, security issues, and horrible employee productivity.<p>People who want to be politically active at work are absolute poison to creating a healthy cooperative team environment.<p>You&#x27;re doing the right thing, and if everyone else&#x27;s constant hammering of politics at work is creating a bad environment for you, it&#x27;s probably doing the same for others.   You may want to anonymously suggest to the higher-ups that a similar rule should be implemented.   Everyone will be happier.')
