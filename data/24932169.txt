The RCMP did up such a report in 2018.\nIt was something around $6bn&#x2F;year for amount.  Majority seemed to be tax evasion (eg : US billionaire X wants to hide capital X, so hires company Y in China to purchase land in Canada for $X, transferring through hidden channels to reduce tracking).\nApparently that&#x27;s a pretty common model.  Doing the same through Russia was also common.\nThese transactions are illegal in their home countries. (it was a lot of countries).   No real &quot;legal&quot; problem in Canada as yet.\nLegally problematic is because monetary sources are not checked (still), drug dealers can buy and sell property and all of a sudden their money is now &quot;clean&quot; and usable for legal purposes.  As in yes, money laundering.<p>I never saw the report itself, just the interviews on multiple news agencies interviewing the RCMP representative.\nThey did NOT do explicit numbers other than totals in the public, just the example above is my memory of one of their examples.')
