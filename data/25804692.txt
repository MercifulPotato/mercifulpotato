Not out of malice but because if you&#x27;re not being super positive and supportive, you&#x27;re causing discord and not being a &quot;team player&quot;.<p>Most weeks at work are completely benign where we&#x27;re not doing &quot;amazing&quot; work, we&#x27;re doing &quot;work&quot;. We&#x27;re doing our salaried jobs as expected.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating when every Jira ticket that gets closed is some moral victory that needs to be held high. It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s our jobs and it&#x27;s frustrating to deal with the faux positivity when I just want to do my job.')
