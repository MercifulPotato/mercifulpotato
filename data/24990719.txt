I log on remotely to an ONR Y-MP I have access to for research.  Huge-ass machine in its day, but notoriously slow for single-CPU jobs.  So I decide to compile xtetris on it, which was surprisingly simple (why did a Cray have X on it? who knows...).<p>And then I export the display and start playing the slowest game of Tetris, probably ever.  Punchline: I was sitting at the console of an SGI Reality Engine at the time, a machine not known for slow graphics... my lab-mates couldn&#x27;t help but stare and ask &quot;why on earth is xtetris slow on the SGI?&quot;, &quot;oh, no that&#x27;s just a Navy Cray&quot; &lt;grin&gt;.')
