Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=[25560110, 25560063], score=None, time=1609169910, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25559857, text='Even if land were historically taxed at say NYC rates in SF the supply and demand problem would still rear its head.  The problem is artificial supply constraints created first and foremost by zoning and secondly by a myriad of other regulation that infringed upon property rights and adds friction (time, money, risk, all of the above) that prevents people from exercising their property rights. Prop 13 (a monetary incentive to not sell) falls into this latter category.  LVT would just be the revers of Prop 13.  It&#x27;s not going to solve a fundamental supply and demand problem that&#x27;s created at a lower level.  You&#x27;d have everything built out as much as the zoning allows for but the net result would still be inadequate because the zoning is too restrictive and the regulatory friction is going to still works its magic at the margin.')
