The CI builds the package once without disorderfs, and once with disorderfs.  If they produce the same output, the package is reproducible (at least with respect to filesystem order).  Otherwise, something in the build process is depending on filesystem order and should be fixed to sort directory entries before using them.  You wouldn&#x27;t use disorderfs when building a package normally.<p>(At least this is how Debian uses disorderfs.  I wrote the first version of disorderfs 6 years ago in a hacking session at DebConf15 in Heidelberg.  I never expected to see it on the front page of HN!)')
