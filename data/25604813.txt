It arrived to my hand melted! 1-star, bad!&quot; Since they clearly aren&#x27;t thinking enough to -not order the milkshake in the first place-.<p>Milkshake is an extreme example to demonstrate the point, but applies to anything that doesn&#x27;t sit well (previously mentioned burger included), with the added trouble that customers are less likely to know what will sit well.')
