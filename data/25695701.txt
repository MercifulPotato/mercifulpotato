But in this case, a known liar with a <i>lot</i> of motivation to lie is alleging the crime. And there&#x27;s no evidence, even though you&#x27;d need thousands of mostly ordinary people to coordinate the crime and subsequent coverup. If even one of them breaks ranks, everyone else is going to jail. Look at it completely objectively: taking out the names, parties, policies and so on, if you were a betting man&#x2F;woman, who would your money be on?<p>&gt; I know many on the political right are certain, for excellent reasons, that the Democrats were motivated to bias the election against Trump,<p>Here&#x27;s the problem though. The only way, <i>the only way</i>, they&#x27;d be 100% convinced the election was fair is if had Trump won. They simply won&#x27;t entertain the idea that maybe, just maybe, most voters aren&#x27;t so enamored of their guy as they are. If you refuse to accept, without violence, the result of an election as fair unless your candidate won then it&#x27;s not a democracy.<p>&gt; Can you point out something I&#x27;ve said that relies on taking Trump&#x27;s word for something?<p>This whole election fraud this is a Trump invention. He knew he was going to lose and sowed the seeds well in advance. He&#x27;s sued dozens of times and lost nearly every single case.<p>&gt; Is cheating in elections really a complex story from your point of view?<p>Across multiple states, parties, officials, and judges? With no leaks, no whistleblowers, no emails or texts? I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible in theory. But in this particular case, when it&#x27;s a known liar making the allegations, color me skeptical. If Trump had a history of probity and honesty in his past conduct, I might be more inclined to listen.')
