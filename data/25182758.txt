Item(by='hn_throwaway_99', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606095260, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25182235, text='You make it sound simple, but it’s not.<p>If you operate a delivery company, and a factory farmer approaches you to deliver to grocery stores nationwide, you suspect it might be used to transport their specialty, veal. If you say: “I’m not doing politics!” and decide to transport their goods, you are being complacent in the torture of sentient baby mammals, and therefor just did some (highly questionable) politics. If you deny them, you also did (morally correct) politics.<p>-----<p>Note the above is only partially tongue-in-cheek, but I do it to make two points:<p>1. To you, your political viewpoints are obviously &quot;morally correct&quot;. But the whole point is many people disagree with what you consider morally correct. I used my veal example because I feel it&#x27;s something a lot of people on HN wouldn&#x27;t have much of a problem with, but to me it clearly is torture to these animals, and the only reason society at large doesn&#x27;t have more of a problem with it is because how the animals are treated is mostly hidden from view.<p>2. My broader point is that virtually every company could sell some product or service that could be used to further an end that equal number of people on both sides could think is morally horrid or morally righteous. It&#x27;s dangerous to think that your view is the only right one.')
