If you write them using log_b(x) = log(x)&#x2F;log(b) they become:<p>log(z)&#x2F;log(z^(1&#x2F;y)) = y<p>z^(log(x)&#x2F;log(z)) = x<p>the first is obvious from the fact that log(x^y) = y log(x) and the latter is why log(x)&#x2F;log(z) is also considered the base z logarithm. The only reason it looks nonobvious is because the notation they chose makes it non-obvious that log_b(y) = 1&#x2F;log_y(b) (and that the yth root of x is x^(1&#x2F;y)).')
