Since Ripple was started, SWIFT have already created their new SWIFT gpi platform (which they say settles most cross-border payments in in minutes), signed up 4000+ members and apparently are now is doing over $300bn in transfers a day. Most developed countries already have free, real-time domestic transfers (UK Faster Payments, Australia&#x27;s New Payments Platform, etc.), and it looks like SWIFT have just announced a next step of further integrating with these to speed up cross-border payments to seconds [0].<p>For small payments though, I&#x27;ve just used something like TransferWise which is great and really fast too.<p>The biggest problem with Ripple was that there was never actually any compelling need for the XRP token, because you&#x27;d need an extra currency conversion for a cross border payment... So I believe mostly the only way that they&#x27;d got partners to test out their system was to actually pay <i>them</i> from money they&#x27;d got selling XRP tokens to speculators.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swift.com&#x2F;our-solutions&#x2F;swift-gpi&#x2F;instant-cross-border-payments" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swift.com&#x2F;our-solutions&#x2F;swift-gpi&#x2F;instant-cross-...</a>')
