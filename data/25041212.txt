It benefits local bookstores and my shopping experiences have been positive. There are other great sites out there, too, if you&#x27;re willing to buy used or can tolerate slower shipping.<p>I get the appeal of amazon.com though because their prices are competitive and the shipping is usually consistently fast. I just like local bookstores.')
