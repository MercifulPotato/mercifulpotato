We cannot afford RHEL. So we went with CentOS 7 and recently CentOS 8. I migrated some machines from 7 to 8. Turns out I did that for one year. My boss wasted precious money there, and it isn&#x27;t getting us closer to RHEL. My take is its getting us closer to Debian Stable instead. Which is RedHat&#x27;s loss because a migration to RHEL is then more out of the picture. They know this. They thought of the above. And they are fine with it. That is not a technical decision, as you said. It is a business decision.')
