I live in what&#x27;s being called a &quot;Zoom town&quot;, with lots of remote workers who seem to want a smaller town with more outdoor access (Bend, Oregon if you&#x27;re curious). House prices are going through the roof.<p>But Bend was already hot, and on people&#x27;s radar. Yesterday I saw an article about housing heating up in <i>Baker City</i> Oregon.
