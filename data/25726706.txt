I&#x27;m not sure this piecemeal approach will work though, what if some right-winger starts a new social network and we&#x27;re not able to stop it?<p>I mean sure with Parler it worked because of the coordinated effort of Apple, Google and Amazon, but can we always count on that?<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to have a centralised authority that regulates these things, with the legal authority to shut down any service that broadcasts lies and evil things? Like a Ministry of Truth.<p>To avoid people lying to each other in private conversations, I think it would be best if messaging services would also fall under their control, how else could we stop people from texting conservative propaganda to their friends?')
