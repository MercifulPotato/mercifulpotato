But, you really have to accept that as a conceit of the medium.<p>There are basically only two ways to construct a TV series that has any continuity to it whatsoever.  You can either keep most of the main characters together for the entire series, and watch them grow and change, like most series do; or, you can do like <i>American Horror Story</i> does and just scrap everything and start anew every season or so.  Some series don&#x27;t care about continuity, like <i>Seinfeld</i>, so they fall outside the scope of this statement, but, the majority of TV series will be one or the other of these.<p>And, there&#x27;s nothing really <i>wrong</i> with this construction, either.  Like I said, it&#x27;s just something you have to accept, kind of like how every TV home or apartment is absolutely massive compared to what real people live in, or how people are able to comfortably fly on airplanes without squishing themselves into the seats or their heads being within inches or less of the roof of the cabin.  Or the fact that if anybody coughs on TV, they&#x27;re usually deathly ill.<p>I&#x27;ll have to check out <i>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</i>, though.  I&#x27;ve been putting off watching it for some reason -- maybe because for most of 2020, I felt like I was living in a <i>Black Mirror</i> episode.<p>Speaking of Netflix series that really get the time period correct, <i>Stranger Things</i> is 100% exactly like what it was like to be a kid in the 80s.  Starting from the bowl haircut on Will, right on down to every last detail of the mall from season 3, and battling the Demogorgon in a friend&#x27;s basement.  Absolute 10&#x2F;10 set design, and I never noticed a single anachronism.')
