Current &quot;US regulated&quot; exchanges are just money onramps with a fraction of the volume&#x2F;profit seen in the rest of crypto.<p>Also keep in mind that currently crypto is a lot bigger outside of the US, most of Asia don&#x27;t want to deal touch things close to US regulators. Eg. it&#x27;s why Tether is so much bigger than things like USDC (as they actively fight against US regulators in court to protect users).')
