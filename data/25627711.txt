I have to periodically prune my social media accounts because whenever I hear about the latest atrocity, failure of the system, injustice, etc, I get all fired up and become a wannabe activist who thinks we can change the world with software.<p>I&#x27;ll go to bed feeling like I&#x27;ve done my part before waking up to a crippling fear that I&#x27;ve been penalized for criticizing capitalism or the political system or something. It&#x27;s a constant cycle between &quot;optimistic and morally justified criticism&quot; and &quot;self-censorship&quot; that&#x27;s frankly exhausting.<p>How about you?')
