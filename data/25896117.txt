If they&#x27;re talking about how they want to kill Jews, most decent people will feel like they can&#x27;t just let that go unchallenged. And that&#x27;s not the kind of argument that can really be handled civilly.<p>You get the same issue -- albeit usually not quite as strongly -- in a thousand different ways, when you have a globally scoped social platform. All those groups with fundamentally conflicting positions, all targeting each other. The result is chaos, which is why platforms are increasingly tightening the bounds of acceptable discourse.')
