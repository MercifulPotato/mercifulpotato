Item(by='detaro', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607692447, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25385197, text='From what I understand, you claim there is a clear legal category of &quot;assault weapon&quot; you base the definition on. So where is that defined? Your link only talks about fully- vs semi-automatic, the NFA linked from there doesn&#x27;t use the term, ...<p>Whereas past laws that used the term clearly considered it not to be fully-automatic only. E.g. the law that&#x27;s commonly known as the &quot;Federal Assault Weapons Ban&quot; (1994-2008) literally regulated &quot;semiautomatic assault weapons&quot;, a category which doesn&#x27;t make any sense if you insist that assault weapons always are fully-automatic. So what&#x27;s changed that you now can insist that including semi-automatics doesn&#x27;t make sense? I won&#x27;t claim I know all relevant legislation, but it seems pretty obvious that not that long ago, it wasn&#x27;t as clear-cut as you present it.')
