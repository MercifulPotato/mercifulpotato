Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25012528, 25010974], score=None, time=1604695340, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25010545, text='There actually isn&#x27;t unequivocal evidence of war in the early archaeological record, although that is more to do with the definition of &quot;war&quot; than &quot;humans were inherently peaceful.&quot;<p>A plausible modern definition of war is that it is a conflict between two polities that sanctions otherwise illegitimate violence by particular people. That is, war is undertaken by government (not individuals); it requires the use of special participants (military forces); it requires a definitive, positive interaction to commence (e.g., a declaration of war); and it has rules that need to be observed. The exact contours of the definition will differ from author to author, and there are plenty of conflicts that sit in a nebulous gray area (would The Troubles constitute a war? or the Colombian conflict between the government and FARC? or gang wars?), but broadly speaking, you will see some sort of line being drawn between warfare and mere violence.<p>Archaeology tells us that there is pretty clear physical evidence of mass violent deaths as early as the Mesolithic. However, cultural evidence of warfare is not easily established: cave paintings in the Paleolithic don&#x27;t depict anything like warfare, and even in the Mesolithic, evidence for warfare in paintings is kind of thin. It&#x27;s really not until the development of sedentary agriculture in the early Neolithic that we see clear evidence of warfare, and even here, the evidence can easily be interpreted in a way that suggests it wasn&#x27;t a major feature before then.')
