I was considering ditching the Raspberry Pi and building my own custom board using the Raspberry Pi Compute Module. I expected that to be $20-40k, so I thought it might be a good match for Kickstarter.<p>But the more I went, the more I felt like it was better to keep making progress incrementally. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m a software guy primarily or hardware is inherently slower and harder, but changing tiny details about the manufacturing process is always <i>really</i> hard. There are so many people involved, and I almost always fail to anticipate some consequence of the change. The Pi is my most significant component, so changing it would be a huge jump.<p>I focused instead on things that let me keep the core Raspberry Pi system and OS and then change things on top of that like the video capture chip and creating a custom 3D-printed case.')
