They could even be as simple as regulations surrounding making billing more transparent or setting up a website to help people find and compare ISPs in their area.<p>Just some ideas.<p>Regardless, the ballot measure doesn’t even go that far to discuss those options. It literally just asks if broadband should be accessible to everyone. Again, it’s simply a voter opinion poll.')
