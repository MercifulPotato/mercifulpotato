One of Bevy&#x27;s primary focuses is to have fast iterative compile times. Changes to our examples can be recompiled in ~0.8-3 seconds (according to your hardware, os, and linker). We have a &quot;fast compiles&quot; configuration that works quite well.<p>First we do plan on exposing hooks to allow scripting languages to be plugged in to Bevy. We actually already have a pull request out for that.<p>However my default answer to the scripting question is that it is a non-goal for Bevy, and is in fact maybe even an anti-feature. I want Rust to be the &quot;one language&quot; people use to build Bevy games. I think a cohesive ecosystem is an incredibly important part of an engine&#x27;s success. If half of Bevy devs use rust and the other half use C#, then compatibility and interop become a huge problem. The Rust language choice does set a high bar, but Bevy doesn&#x27;t need to be all things to all people. Additionally, the Bevy API is a Rust API. Defining FFI on top means we need a second api surface that is the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; (aka a C api). This both increases maintenance burden and creates the &quot;rust experience&quot; and the &quot;everyone else&quot; experience.<p>In the near future 3rd party Bevy scripting plugins will start popping up, but I doubt I will ever officially endorse them.')
