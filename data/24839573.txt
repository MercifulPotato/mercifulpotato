It _sometimes_ needs a little tweaking to get it right, but KDE&#x2F;Plasma also happens to offer that level of &quot;tweakability&quot; that should satisfy almost all semi-mainstream users (at least anyone coming from Windows or Mac).<p>Compared to my first Linux laptop (a Sony Vaio circa 2000), my current XPS 13 works as well as any Mac laptop I have ever owned, and all the hardware that you would &quot;expect&quot; to work (but probably didn&#x27;t work as smoothly 10 or 20 years ago) Just Works (WiFi, external displays, excellent battery life&#x2F;sleep, etc...)<p>Based on the complaints I have heard about Apple hardware and MacOS over the past few years, I&#x27;d even argue that Linux-on-the-desktop isn&#x27;t any less stable or harder to get working than a Mac.')
