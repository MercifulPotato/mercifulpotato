That they prioritized going wireless so, so intensely, and completely; fully ignored this issue is absolute tripe.<p>These are about as useful as those $900 Mac Pro wheels that <i>have no lock</i> and thusly are only even effective if you have a flat floor.<p>Similarly, these headphones only work if you want to <i>listen</i> to audio - for any creative use whatsoever any given pair of headphones is better.<p>I just don&#x27;t get Apple anymore.')
