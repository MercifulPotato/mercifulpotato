This lets me reload the certificate without restarting mosquitto.<p>My local devices (esp8266) can&#x27;t really handle TLS well, but I want access from outside of my local network to be encrypted. This lets them operate in plain-text mode locally, with firewall rules forcing outside access to be secure.')
