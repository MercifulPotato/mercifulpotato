There was no indication at that time of anything that wasn&#x27;t completely consistent with and expected from a cold, and I even encountered resistance when I tried to get tested prior to the tell-tale loss-of-smell symptom appearing (hence the rapid tests only at that point). I had a mildly uncomfortable phone call with an urgent care center where they discouraged me from pursuing testing because they didn&#x27;t think I had enough symptoms.<p>I knew exactly from whom I had contracted whatever illness I had, and that person had also tested negative for COVID (upon further questioning, their test had also been a rapid one, and they too had not been informed of its unreliability for any negative determination).')
