And heavier metal objects do feel nicer but that&#x27;s not really my reasoning. If a manufacturer is willing to self-flagellate by making their products out a mode expensive material, using a more expensive manufacturing process, and pony up the shipping costs to transport the heavier goods then I can be reasonably sure that they&#x27;re not obsessively cost-cutting.')
