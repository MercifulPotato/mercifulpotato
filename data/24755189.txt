I.e One has to pay that money to get out of jail before trial. If they skip trial, they don’t get the money back, otherwise they do.<p>Then there are Proffesional Bail Agents.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.allcitybailbonds.com&#x2F;bail-calculator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.allcitybailbonds.com&#x2F;bail-calculator</a> . They charge 10% of bail bond as a fee. Bail agents will pay the bond and recover the money when the person shows up at trial.<p>So this has the same effect as college loans.
