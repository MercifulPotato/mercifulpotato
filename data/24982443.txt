This isn&#x27;t inflation and the price increase isn&#x27;t due to inflation.<p>Prices across the board could also go up if war breaks out. That&#x27;s not inflation.<p>Those types of price increases are due to the supply side. Inflation is due to the demand side and the available dollars chasing the [same amount of] goods.<p>Price increases and inflation are not the same thing. They are typically related though.')
