We need a way to authorize messages sent and also a way to enburden senders for the content they send. In pre-internet era UUCP was widely used to deliver messages, UUCP providers used to charged their customers for each message they sent which made spam broadcasting quite costly. What I see is a kind of distributed message transportation system that takes currency from sender and shares a fraction of it with recipient. I.e. sender always pays for sending their stuff, recipient gets paid for interruption. SMS messaging is very close to this.')
