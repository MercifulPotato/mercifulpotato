But Napoleon envied Caesar, Caesar envied Alexander, and Alexander, I daresay, envied Hercules, who never existed. You cannot, therefore, get away from envy by means of success alone, for there will always be in history or legend some person even more successful than you are.<p>[...]<p>&gt;Alexander the Great was psychologically of the same type as the lunatic, though he possessed the talent to achieve the lunatic&#x27;s dream. He could not, however, achieve his own dream, which enlarged its scope as his achievement grew. When it became clear that he was the greatest conqueror known to fame, he decided that he was a god. Was he a happy man? His drunkenness, his furious rages, his indifference to women, and his claim to divinity, suggest that he was not. There is no ultimate satisfaction in the cultivation of one element of human nature at the expense of all the others, nor in viewing all the world as raw material for the magnificence of one&#x27;s own ego.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;russell-j.com&#x2F;beginner&#x2F;COH-TEXT.HTM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;russell-j.com&#x2F;beginner&#x2F;COH-TEXT.HTM</a>')
