My first year of college I worked two 40 hour&#x2F;week jobs during the summer and a 30 hour a week job during the school year. I was determined to get a well paying internship so I could reduce my work hours and still pay for school.<p>There was a snow storm during the day of the spring career fair. Classes were cancelled but the career fair still happened. I was one of the only ones that showed up and passed along my resume to all of the tech companies that attended the career fair. Had it not been for the snow storm I would not have received an internship which led to my first time job. I was a college freshman, B student due to having to work and I had zero practical coding skills outside of one semester of C++. The snow storm was certainly luck but showing up at the career fair was not.<p>However, much of my classmates in the dorm chose to play in the snow and I chose to go to the career fair. Luck does play a role but luck is really putting yourself in a position to take advantage of opportunity. If everyone that lived on campus showed up at that career fair I don&#x27;t know if I would be in the position I am today (25 years later).')
