This makes the double slit experiment seem much easier to grasp:<p>A single photon (which is a wave with a discreet amount of energy) travels through both slits at the same time. This causes the wave to interfere with itself and when it hits the wall it registers as a single point, as the photon must always be a discreet quantum of energy.<p>To me, this makes intuitive sense and removes a lot of the mystery and confusion that gets invoked whenever pop-sci writers explain the experiment. They tend to say something along the lines of: photons are like billiard balls, so they can only go through one slit or the other, but if you don&#x27;t detect which slit it goes through it seems to go through both.<p>Am I close to what&#x27;s actually going on, or am I way off?')
