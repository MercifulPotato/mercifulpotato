Then Trump Jr preemptively tweeted soon-to-be-leaked emails detailing that they had in fact met with the Russians. Then the Muller investigation turned over a hundred other connections. Then, over the next four years, POTUS lifted the Magnitsky sanctions and turned a stubbornly blind eye every time Russia did something stinky, often directly contradicting public statements made minutes before&#x2F;after from his own office.<p>Anyway, point is: there&#x27;s an extremely powerful propaganda machine dead set on deflecting attention away from Russia, and that&#x27;s concerning. More proof one way or another is always better, but this whole &quot;there is no amount of evidence that can convince me Russia did it&quot; trend is a problem.')
