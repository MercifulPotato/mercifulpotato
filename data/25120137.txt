Item(by='rssoconnor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605585599, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25117785, text='Your thoughts are approximately correct.<p>The Godel sentences are of a different character than the continuum hypothesis (CH) because the Godel sentences are simple first-order arithmetic statements, while the CH is a higher-order, a.k.a. analytic statement.  A Godel sentence can be assigned a truth meaning via Tarski&#x27;s definition of truth independent of the axiom system in a way that is much harder to do with the CH.<p>Basically a Godel sentence says something about whether a given piece of software terminates when run on an ideal computer (specifically a piece of software that hunts for a proof of a contradiction within a specified axiom system).  I&#x27;ll argue that whether a specific piece of software would halt or not when run on an ideal machine has a definite truth value independent of any axiom system.  Whereas CH doesn&#x27;t really afford such a software interpretation.<p>I do respect the fact that there exist models of PA + ~Con(PA) but these models are non-standard and we don&#x27;t use such models to reason about software, specifically because they are unsound in this sense.')
