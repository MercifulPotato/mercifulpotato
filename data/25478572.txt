Then the blackstone valley path starts NW of PVD in Lincoln, very nice and woodsy and gives you a historical view of mills and old industry, now mostly condos, and plenty of dams.<p>For me, the issue is linking these up. You have to drive through urban streets in poor areas. Last time I did the 3 mile linkage, I was honked at 4 times by cars behind me, simply for going bike speed and staying cautious. It shocks your ears and adrenaline to have a blast from a car horn, someone is mad at you due to their own impatience, it&#x27;s sad.<p>Car culture is a great economic boon for many, but it&#x27;s polluting and anti-cyclist and anti-pedestrian. We need separated bikeways, not shared surfaces with a faded painted bike which no one cares about.')
