Docker doesn’t change any of the fundamental concerns with a PHP based project. It might reduce the amount of direct exposure required, but for a piece of software that is meant to become the virtual center of your life, it’s still completely fair to be unconvinced.<p>I’d argue that Docker just shifts the problem slightly, while introducing a new set of challenges. It’s unclear if the net benefit is even a positive number.<p>Even if one doesn’t intend to contribute to the core project, it’s going to be necessary to get a bit intimate with the stack over time: upgrades, the inevitable bug that requires some troubleshooting, etc.<p>I found the parent comment both reasonable and constructive.<p>You may not have the same concerns, and that’s perfectly ok.')
