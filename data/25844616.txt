This shouldn&#x27;t be controversial.<p>base is irrelevant to this, and you want (and show!) half-open, not closed, intervals.<p>&gt; This has two nice properties. One is that two slices are adjacent if the beginning and ends match, and the other, far more important, is that the length of the slice is end - start.<p>Yeah, those are all properties of half-open intervals, irrespective of indexing base. It would be as true of Ï€-based indexing as it is of 0-based.')
