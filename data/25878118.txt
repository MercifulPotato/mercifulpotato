Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611360891, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25877760, text='This just confirms what I said above, if you drive them all electric it&#x27;s great, they&#x27;re an EV with a small battery. But if you can&#x27;t and just charge occasionally the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are nowhere close to the official numbers, as evidenced by the studies I linked above. I see this struck a nerve with some people but the reality is that those are only best case and the people who meet them are the long tail of the numbers.<p>And that&#x27;s the crux of the matter, most people buy hybrids because they can&#x27;t charge at home. Those cars end up driving a lot on gas. If you can&#x27;t conveniently charge at home or at work, waiting for 1.5-2h to charge for 40-50Km is far less appealing than 3 minutes for 500Km worth of gas. Place more chargers and make gas more expensive than electricity and the situation would probably change.<p>One specific German manufacturer featured in the studies I linked above sees most of the kilometers driven in their hybrids using the ICE, with a lot of that time the ICE inefficiently charging the battery, and almost cancelling out the fuel efficiency brought by the electrification. The number of people who see anything close to the officially estimated fuel consumption or CO2 emissions is vanishingly low. And the manufacturer knows it but they aren&#x27;t ready with EVs, they have to meet new fleet regulations, and they wanted to benefit from the incentives the German government offers to manufacturers for any EV or PHEV.<p>Looking at a family member in this situation (the one who provided me with the statistics from the manufacturer), they drove ~2000Km in a brand new PHEV with ~11 liters + 9KWh per 100Km. The manufacturer suggests ~2 liters per 100Km. That&#x27;s where most efficiency numbers revolve for that particular PHEV. It doesn&#x27;t help that where they live in Germany charging the battery at a public charger even when assuming the full ~40Km range is 30% more expensive per Km than filling the tank but this is a local issue that&#x27;s not generally applicable.')
