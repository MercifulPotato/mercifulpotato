And we do not have the pin, we were never given a pin.\nHence we lost access to the car GPS and media system altogether in an unknown territory.\nWe somehow got back to home and had to book an appointment with the car dealership for the technician to unlock <i>our</i> car media system!\nHe plugged his device and generated the pin that&#x27;s signed&#x2F;paired with our specific car and then used it to unlock the media system.<p>It is indeed scary that even car manufacturers are moving towards central control of every little thing in your car.<p>The last thing I want to see with all these tech companies following Apple&#x27;s footsteps in a lot of things, is to see the auto industry becoming like Apple.')
