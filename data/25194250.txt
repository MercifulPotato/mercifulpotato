However, after talking with some doctors at a neonatal ICU I found out that in the US, we will often identify an unborn child that is in trouble and get it out of the mother in an attempt to save it. Since these types of cases are considered a birth, they count against the mortality rate whereas in some other countries they would be stillborn and not count against infant mortality statistics.<p>That isn&#x27;t to disagree with the causes given in the article, but after talking to those doctors it made me realize how complicated it is to get accurate comparisons between countries.')
