Eminent domain forces a person out under threat of violence and pays an amount that the forcing party deems to be acceptable. If they were offering fair market value, by definition, they wouldn&#x27;t have to threaten violence.<p>Infrastructure works such as roads and railroads require a continuous right of way to be able to function. Anyone constructing such a work is compelled to purchase all of the land necessary for that work; if they fail to obtain just one parcel, then the value of the result is often worthless. Not only is the seller compelled to sell the parcel, but the buyer is also compelled to buy it.<p>Fair market value is the price that the parcel would have been bought for if the buyer were not compelled to buy it at almost any price, and it can generally be imputed by looking at the history of real estate transactions for similar parcels. It&#x27;s a pretty usual practice, since it&#x27;s relevant for pricing real estate, insurance claims and estimates, and even property taxes.')
