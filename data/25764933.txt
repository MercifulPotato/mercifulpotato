Actually, China is probably most stable system throughout written history, practicing roughly same government&#x2F;legal system and its approach to relation between government and individual person for the past two millennia.<p>Which is to say that in China, as opposed to western civilizations, there is no human rights as we now it because Chinese people are and have always been subservient to the government.<p>In western civilizations monarchy powers slowly eroded and had to either give concessions or be overthrown in a violent revolt. This never happened in China.<p>If you have doubts, just read The Origins of Political Order (Francis Fukuyama). This is well explained there.<p>Ignore labels like &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, the fact is that people in China have only so much rights as it suits the government to give them for the country to prosper. And it does not hesitate to reserve those rights the moment it suits some need.<p>Do I agree with this? It does not matter.<p>Stay on the facts.')
