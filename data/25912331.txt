I wanted Trump out, and Biden seems a reasonable replacement.  I also debunked a number of the fallacious statistical &#x27;proofs&#x27; the election was stolen.  Believe me I would like nothing better than to believe everything is fine.  But especially Navarro&#x27;s report makes me unable to dismiss the allegations off hand with a clean conscience.  I&#x27;ve also looked into the PA court&#x27;s reasons for dismissing Trump&#x27;s lawsuit from back in Sept, and the reasoning is all based on technicalities and does not address the substance of the concern that the loosening of the rules has opened the door to major fraud.  The fact all the coverage of the lawsuits is frivolous dismissal or even in some cases the courts rule in favor does nothing to set my mind at ease.')
