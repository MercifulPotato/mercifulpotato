Let&#x27;s ensure wise men don&#x27;t stop to share their wisdom<p>2. Let&#x27;s ensure wise men don&#x27;t stop sharing their wisdom<p>If you say, &quot;don&#x27;t stop to do X,&quot; that means (roughly), &quot;don&#x27;t do X.&quot;  In other words, #1 means the same thing as, &quot;Let&#x27;s ensure wise men don&#x27;t share their wisdom.&quot;  #2 is the one you want.  If the amount of multiple negatives is confusing, omit them completely and say, &quot;Let&#x27;s ensure wise men keep sharing their wisdom.&quot;')
