Reading it again I think I corrected the mixed up hands in my head. While they say the chisel is in the right and the hammer in the left, everything else depicted paints the opposite picture in my head.<p>If you hold the hammer in the right and the chisel in the left, you swing the hammer from the right to the left with the chisel tilted to the right. Thus the natural writing direction (outward from the swing) would be right to left. Swinging your hammer from the right and moving to the left would mean writing in the opposite direction of the force used to write single letters.<p>So, if the hammer is in the right hand and chisel in the left means a right-to-left motion and makes a left-to-right motion counterintuitive.')
