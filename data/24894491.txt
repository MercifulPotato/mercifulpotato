Scaling should be relative to that physically correct resolution.<p>We&#x27;ve inherited a lot of baggage and odd conventions, some of which were wrong to begin with.  I don&#x27;t think we should be carrying on with it if we can do better.  Having these scaling factors directly correspond to physical reality would be a start.')
