I bought a remarkable 2, and I really wanted to like it but the reading experience was so bad. The writing was wonderful though, but my primary use is reading. I don’t think you’re going to be satisfied with a remarkable. At this point I would recommend an Onyx. They are above average ereaders with above average writing experience. They don’t seem to be the absolute best at either but they are far better in aggregate than any other device because all other devices seem to sacrifice too much in one area.<p>It seems like you want a larger screen but if you’re fine with a smaller screen and no writing capability I recommend you get a dedicated ereader like a kindle; they really do excel at the ereading experience')
