All the newly printed money which has gone into tech over the past decade is a scam. The only thing that mattered at all was your social connections; doesn&#x27;t matter what the project was.<p>Is it a coincidence that the two fastest growing assets are owned by people who share a common history?<p>Mark Zuckerberg is the biggest shareholder in Facebook and the Winklevoss twins are the biggest Bitcoin investors... That&#x27;s no coincidence. It&#x27;s all about social connections. Your social proximity to Mark Zuckerberg and Winklevoss twins determines your future success 100%. Everything else doesn&#x27;t matter. If that sounds ridiculous, that&#x27;s because it is. It&#x27;s a giant financial pyramid scheme.<p>In any pyramid scheme, those closest to the originator of the scheme make the most money... The difference in this case is that they can keep printing money forever so the scheme doesn&#x27;t ever need to collapse.<p>The sooner we realize this, the sooner we will be able to fix the monetary system and go back to normal.')
