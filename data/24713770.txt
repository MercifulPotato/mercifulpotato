Then, allow people to request reviews for that product, <i>along with  specific questions they have about it</i>. Send an email to the people who said they owned the product including the prompt from the requester, and publish their responses as reviews (with question as context).<p>On the reviewer side, I&#x27;m much more interested in reviewing a product if I got a note from an actual human asking about it.
