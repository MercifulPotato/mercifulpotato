Maybe it&#x27;s actually good parenting and they only perceive the outcome to be bad because of misguided ideas of what &quot;good children&quot; should be. Case in point: if it wasn&#x27;t for my addiction to video games growing up and constantly finding ways around my parent&#x27;s restrictions, I would never have become a software developer. That much is certain. Not only that, but I would have a horrid disdain for my parents much like my step-sister (now in her 30s) does for her mother (whom was always praised for being a &quot;good parent&quot;) that restricted everything when she was growing up; so much so that she moved more than 7,000 miles away when she finally reached college age.<p>Somehow everyone thinks they&#x27;re an expert on parenting and that there&#x27;s only one way to parent a child and it&#x27;s a one-size-fits-all situation. Frankly that&#x27;s asinine. People come in all flavors and sizes so to speak. What you consider to be &quot;good parenting&quot; might be viewed as bad parenting by another person. In that sense, there&#x27;s a subjective component to parenting. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of parenting elitists here on HN and I doubt many of you even have children let alone understand the complexities that comes with parenting them at various stages.')
