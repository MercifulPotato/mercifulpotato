It&#x27;s 100% efficient. There is no more effective way to turn electricity into heat than resistively.<p>A heat pump doesn&#x27;t turn electricity into heat. It moves heat from one place (outside) to another place (inside); and can <i>seem</i> more efficient because the system isn&#x27;t closed.')
