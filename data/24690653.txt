The biggest problem is the people who might know how to make it work are no longer there or have forgotten. If it&#x27;s automated there&#x27;s a chance it might work, but if it&#x27;s slightly off then it&#x27;s even harder to comprehend and adjust.<p>I&#x27;ve seen backups and failovers not work so many times that it&#x27;s an amazing surprise when one actually works--usually after laborious manual off-script intervention and invention. I was being somewhat kind to failovers, I have seen smallish backups work on several occasions.
