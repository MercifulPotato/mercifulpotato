College admissions and grading should be name- race- and gender-blind.<p>* These cases of people trying to ban gay media and speakers for &#x27;obscenity&#x27; or &#x27;outraging public decency&#x27; are bad. People should be able to publish what they like, and colleges certainly shouldn&#x27;t ban invited speakers, even if some students find their views challenging.<p>* These people writing about computers and always referring to the user as &#x27;he&#x27; is pretty out of date. Generous use of &#x27;they&#x27; in preference to gendered pronouns is the inclusive choice.<p>The same stances, when viewed from a few decades later, sound right-wing: To modern ears, those stances oppose affirmative action, oppose no-platforming, and say it&#x27;s OK to ignore people&#x27;s preferred pronouns. To some, those views would sound positively Jordan Peterson-esque.')
