And Google+ is completely irrelevant.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think AWS has every really screwed anyone.<p>The apples-to-apples comparison is not to AWS, but to Amazon. There are plenty of complaints against Amazon for ways they&#x27;ve screwed shoppers, book authors, publishers, etc.<p>If you want to compare Google <i>Cloud</i> to AWS, you won&#x27;t have nearly as much to complain about.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to say you don&#x27;t want to deal with or depend on Google because they&#x27;ve screwed you in the past. But the claim that there&#x27;s a serious risk that GCP will suddenly be discontinued is just silly.')
