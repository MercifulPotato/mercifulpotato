Italy is typically included everywhere - it&#x27;s a G7&#x2F;G8 country, with a GDP bigger than Canada or Australia, and trumps Spain on pretty much any indicator (let alone Greece). It has its problems but it&#x27;s not a poor or bankrupt country by any means.<p><i>&gt; At that point why compare to the US though? If the comparisons exclude former communist Europe and poor Mediterranean Europe </i><p>In terms of population, the EU as a whole is 30% larger than the US. It&#x27;s somewhat inevitable that there will be some pruning when trying to compare apples to apples. It&#x27;s just a fact that Eastern Europe is not representative of the larger Union any more than, say, Mississipi, Oklahoma or Alaska are fundamentally representative of the whole US.')
