Even there, though, a single person can live quite nicely on 100k USD (or 120k USD, if going from 100k Euro), if they&#x27;re ok with roommates.  On 50-60k USD, yeah, that&#x27;d be trickier, though honestly it&#x27;s manageable if you skip the top 5.  You can have a very reasonable quality of life in, say, Los Angeles (as a healthy young person without dependents, yes) with that income.')
