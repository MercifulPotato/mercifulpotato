Greenwald has in the past gone so far as to even doubt interference, but he seems to have changed his stance and on JRE the other day he did say they interfered. Also, as you can tell from my post history, I strongly dislike Trump and everything he stands for, to be absolutely clear. I just want to accuse him of the thousands of things he&#x27;s actually guilty of and not the things he&#x27;s not guilty of.<p>If you read Taibbi&#x27;s article, he&#x27;s not at all claiming that the emails are damaging to Biden. The headline is &quot;With the Hunter Biden Expose, Suppression is a Bigger Scandal Than The Actual Story&quot;.<p>Like in my posts, he&#x27;s talking about the media&#x27;s and Twitter&#x27;s behavior in censoring the story - not the emails themselves. Everything he says is perfectly consistent with what&#x27;s said in the Politico article you linked.<p>Taibbi is one of the most reputable, high-integrity, rational, and truth-seeking journalists working today, in my opinion. Reality often sits between a gray area of poles.')
