I&#x27;ve had a pair of wired Audio Technica headphones for the past 5 years and have had no issues at all. Ear pads are user replaceable, headphone cable is detachable and standard, and I can use whatever DAC&#x2F;amp I want (or just plug it straight into a device). Wireless just seems like a downgrade in every way')
