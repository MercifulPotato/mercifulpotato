Item(by='javert', descendants=None, kids=[24664739, 24666064], score=None, time=1601653864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24663576, text='Palantir is a critical component of the &quot;homeland security apparatus&quot; which employs enormous amounts of Americans (especially in N. Virginia) and is becoming a powerful political constituency unto itself.<p>This constituency has and will push for government expansion of surveillance, counterintelligence, the military, and domestic policing in order to enrich its constituent corporations and government bureaus and their employees. This is the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of Americans. I hope there are enough terrorists out there, and criminals in here, to justify that expenditure......<p>You might as well consider N. Virginia and its &quot;colonies&quot; in other parts of the country (e.g. aerospace around Los Angeles) as an extra super-powerful but hidden state within the state. Or you can view it as another branch of government.<p>This hidden state is not partisan. It does not care which political party is in power. Both political parties kowtow to it.<p>I would highly suggest investing in stocks of affiliated companies (Palantir, Oracle, defense stocks, ATT, Verizon) as they aren&#x27;t going anywhere - ever.')
