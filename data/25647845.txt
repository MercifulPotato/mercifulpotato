I’d say learn from them if you can. Don’t engage the ones that just want to poke fun. But if they have a reason they didn’t like the game, you can learn from that. I see some have already called your game “basic,” which might be fair, but it’s not really very helpful. Flappy Bird was as basic as it gets…<p>Many will miss the point and say things like “not HN material.” I couldn’t disagree more. You built something! And published it! That’s a big achievement. Whether the game is terrible, good, or great you exercised all the muscles it takes to ship something, and the next release (whether an update to this game or a whole new one) will be a lot easier!')
