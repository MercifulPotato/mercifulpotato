Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609151210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25542695, text='&gt; way less inconvenient when it does happen (because merging forked branches is a perfectly normal operation and it doesn&#x27;t really matter how much the branches have diverged).<p>Why is two branches that diverge after the initial readme commit so much easier than two branches that diverge from the start? Why doesn&#x27;t it just treat it the same way (as if the empty repo state was a commit that&#x27;s the merge base)?<p>&gt; It completely fuck up diff views of the merge commit.<p>Same question as above - why is the diff so different in that case?')
