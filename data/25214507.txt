But for years they enabled the AMA to cap residency spots and created an artificial scarcity that drove prices of healthcare up.<p>Now they are whining that they are a scarce resource? And they, using the money they acquired by leveraging their scarcity, even bought a submarine piece of PR to buy sympathy from the public so that they don&#x27;t try to figure out why exactly they are so scarce!
