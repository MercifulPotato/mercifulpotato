Meanwhile I tried manually scrapping a video from reddit the other day, I succeeded but it was quite the puzzle. First you have to find the right element in the DOM, then find the source which is a playlist for the various qualities available, then there was a 2nd indirection I think, then finally I got the URL of my video file.<p>My browser obviously knows about all of this but it won&#x27;t expose it easily. No &quot;Save video as&quot; menu. For some reason I don&#x27;t expect that Chrome will implement it any time soon...')
