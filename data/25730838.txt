Even if I could find  replacements for the damaged parts (and I tried), they wouldn&#x27;t be official and would likely be of a lower quality. Furthermore, most modern phones are really hard to put together to the original quality standards, requiring for example new pre-cut adhesive and whole new backplates, since the original ones will get scratched during disassembly.<p>My purchases are (at least partially) driven by wanting a shiny, new-looking device that doesn&#x27;t have any flaws. But, perhaps counter-intuitively, <i>proper</i> repairability would allow me to maintain my devices in this state for a much longer time, which would lead to me purchasing fewer new devices.<p>Repairability this good would also be great for the used market. Right now you never know what faults a phone&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;other miniaturised device might have and if they&#x27;re there, getting rid of them might cost as much as the device. This means that people who want 100% working devices are more likely to buy new. For other products (for example desktop PCs), the chance that an irreparable fault exists is much lower, so buying used is safer.')
