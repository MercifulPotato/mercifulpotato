Test runners, pkg-config, installation, cleaning, out of tree builds, etc. Nothing magic that you couldn&#x27;t do yourself, but IME by the time you do it your makefile is much less simple, it&#x27;s taken a non-trivial amount of time and possibly has a bunch of subtle errors. Even on my own little projects that will never run on another computer let alone another OS I find autotools worthwhile.<p>If I had one major complaint it&#x27;s that it still puts build artifacts in the root directory.')
