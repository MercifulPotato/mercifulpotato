(The cafe has since been closed for a few years.)<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that&#x27;s why I added it to OSM - to get picked up by Google Maps. :)<p>What&#x27;s even more interesting is that when I told people in SV that I was doing that, they told me since it was a copyright violation, Google Maps wouldn&#x27;t do that. :) :)')
