Even in functional languages, you -can- have verbs living with nouns (your struct can have a field that is of function type); it just isn&#x27;t required (or recommended for most use cases).<p>It&#x27;s not a question of can they, or should we prevent them, it&#x27;s &#x27;should it be required?&#x27;<p>It may make sense to require all verbs to be coupled to a noun when your problem domain is mostly modeling nouns, and verbs only describe how those models change and interact with each other. But when the problem domain is mostly process, with nouns being ancillary, it is unwieldy to talk that way. It&#x27;s why you have so many &quot;ThingDoer&quot; and &quot;Utils&quot; and the like in most OO codebases.')
