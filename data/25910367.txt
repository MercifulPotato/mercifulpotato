There might be multiple reasons for the acute chronic laryngitis and you want to exclude most dangerous ones: malignant tumor on larynx or in upper chest (pressing on one of the two nerves leading up to larynx - they loop down and up). In my case that was not a growth (malignant or benign) anywhere - confirmed by CT scans, but my right vocal fold was paralyzed and doctor could not find the reason other than offering hypothesis that the nerve was damaged by inflammation caused by a viral infection. The mobility and voice restored over the course of a week two months after the onset but it was a scary experience.')
