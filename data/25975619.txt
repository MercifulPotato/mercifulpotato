Are you going to tell me about Biden supporters somehow having stolen the presidential election while losing house seats by ballot stuffing now?<p>I am half Sikh and many members of my family served in the Indian military, including in Sikh regiments. I would FAR prefer a BJP central government to a Congress one. Before you listen to another word of Congress propaganda, google the Delhi Sikh Riots and the role senior Congress party members like Kamal Nath played in them. The BJP may not be particularly erudite English speakers and may deliberately choose not to participate in debates at Oxford like a Shashi Tharoor might. They don’t want care to play to a western audience in that manner. But unlike the Congress they don’t put mafioso or wife killers in senior positions no matter how suave they may be.<p>Trump and Modi are not from the same Universe. Modi noticed Trump loves adulation and let him have all he wanted. That is just smart diplomacy.')
