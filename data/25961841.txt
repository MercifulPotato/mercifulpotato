The net outcome of such disclosures is that fraudulent activity is exposed, the people shorting the stock make a profit, the people who were holding the stock still have their shares, and hopefully new investors are more informed about the stock that&#x27;s being shorted.<p>Not all short sellers take this approach though, they could just short the stock because they think it&#x27;s overvalued. It seems that it&#x27;s what happened here, but ended up on the wrong side of the trade when WSB decided to buy GME.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hindenburgresearch.com&#x2F;nikola&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hindenburgresearch.com&#x2F;nikola&#x2F;</a>')
