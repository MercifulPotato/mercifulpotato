No big deal! I haven&#x27;t had that happen yet, though.<p>################<p>If you want to do this you can tune ext4fs to flush writes to disk more often, which does have a small impact on disk performance (a moot point on something using a microsd card for a &#x2F; partition, really, and on the anemic cpu performance of a pi zero w).<p>if you google &quot;ext4fs power loss flush writes&quot; you&#x27;ll find some other references to making an ext4 system slightly more resilient to being abruptly powered off.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;322823&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;322823&#x2F;</a><p>One possible solution is, of course, to just run ext3. Another is to shorten the system&#x27;s writeback time, which is stored in a couple of sysctl variables:<p><pre><code>    &#x2F;proc&#x2F;sys&#x2F;vm&#x2F;dirty_expire_centisecs\n    &#x2F;proc&#x2F;sys&#x2F;vm&#x2F;dirty_writeback_centisecs\n</code></pre>\nThe first of these variables (dirty_expire_centiseconds) controls how long written data can sit in the page cache before it&#x27;s considered &quot;expired&quot; and queued to be written to disk; it defaults to 30 seconds. The value of dirty_writeback_centiseconds (5 seconds, default) controls how often the pdflush process wakes up to actually flush expired data to disk. Lowering these values will cause the system to flush data to disk more aggressively, with a cost in the form of reduced performance.')
