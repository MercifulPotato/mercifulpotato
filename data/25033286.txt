The supply chains are incredibly fast now and I can&#x27;t imagine there&#x27;s enough time for this process to take place - even tomatoes from southern Spain are probably on shelves in a few days. It&#x27;s not like shipping bananas from the Caribbean. I think it&#x27;s more that the watery tomatoes are the varieties that grow the fastest and offer the best margins at the lower pricepoints.<p>An increasing number of tomato imports are coming from the mega greenhouses where they are harvested red and can be packed on site. This one is Dutch [1], but I remember hearing that they&#x27;re building some in the UK. Clearly they&#x27;re never going to be the same as growing them in a garden in Sicily and leaving them to ripen for a few days in the sun, but not bad for mass production, available year round and much, much better than the tomatoes in the supermarkets a couple of decades ago.<p>&gt; So, grow your own tomatoes - it&#x27;s surpisingly easy - and the taste is amazing.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying for a few years. It&#x27;s been fun and the varieties are way more interesting, but I&#x27;m not in danger of flooding the market.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duijvestijntomaten.nl&#x2F;en&#x2F;packaging&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duijvestijntomaten.nl&#x2F;en&#x2F;packaging&#x2F;</a>')
