Groups and channels and individual chats are not end-to-end encrypted.<p>In other words, Telegram doesn&#x27;t even deserve to be in the same conversation. Even if it had the best encryption out there (however you define that), that wouldn&#x27;t mean anything when it&#x27;s not used in like 98% of the cases (percentage pulled out of my ass).<p>It&#x27;s like comparing Signal to Facebook&#x27;s Messenger, and I&#x27;d still say Messenger over Telegram because at least it uses Signal&#x27;s protocol under the hood (I believe the feature is called hidden conversations) instead of inventing its own thing and ignoring the expert opinions.')
