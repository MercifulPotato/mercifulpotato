Item(by='szhu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603324609, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24852709, text='I&#x27;ve never owned a car but have driven plenty of cars from car shares (Zipcar, etc), rentals, and friends&#x2F;family. Is it weird that I like the driving experience of a Prius the most out of all the cars I&#x27;ve tried? I&#x27;ve tried multiple Prius models too -- Prius C, standard Prius, and Prius V. They&#x27;re all pretty good.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not a car enthusiast. I don&#x27;t care about acceleration; in fact, I try to minimize acceleration&#x2F;deceleration when I drive, possibly a habit picked up from bicycling. However, I do care about a smooth ride (even a new Audi I rented stuttered as it shifted gears), and I care about the car not making a ton of noise when I haven&#x27;t gone onto the road yet. I&#x27;d also like to not have to dance between the pedals when going uphill. Hybrid and electric cars categorically do these things well and every single gas car I&#x27;ve driven does not.<p>Anyway, driving a Prius does not feel the opposite of a &quot;zen like driving experience&quot; to me. I know I&#x27;m not a car enthusiast. I&#x27;m just surprised that almost everyone here seems to be one.')
