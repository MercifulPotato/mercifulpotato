Similarly, coming into mathematical theory with a decent grasp of how math proofs work makes for a smooth(ish) journey through the math landscape. That said, consider the following FREE book that can introduce you to math from close to zero:<p>Book of Proof by Richard Hammack.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.people.vcu.edu&#x2F;~rhammack&#x2F;BookOfProof&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.people.vcu.edu&#x2F;~rhammack&#x2F;BookOfProof&#x2F;</a>')
