These days it takes millions of dollars per month just to pay for the infrastructure you need to be able to be competitive - and then you also have to have some nontrivial edge, without which there isnâ€™t all that much profit in having low latency.</i><p>And that is why I like the idea of a &quot;trade arbitrarily slowly with limited price change&quot; market versus the current approach of &quot;trade fast with an arbitrary price change&quot; market.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24760841" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24760841</a> for an explanation of how the trade arbitrarily slowly market could work.  Under normal conditions, it would look a lot like the current market does.  Except that you&#x27;re paying less to the HFT folks.<p>What I didn&#x27;t describe there is that you could even have a chain of slower and slower markets.  With a maximum rate of price change varying from 1% per day to 1% per minute.  With the idea that ordinary folks would trade on the 1% per minute market while large institutional orders would be likely to go in the 1% per day market.  (And when the price of two markets cross, open orders on the one can match as open orders on the other.)')
