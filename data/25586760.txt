One is an OS library that you can see a bit of in the control panel. This is what Microsoft is removing with this update. The other is a containerized copy that Chrome and Edge ships with. That copy isn&#x27;t going away until MS and Google say so, and if their metrics say there&#x27;s a lot of flash use, then its going to stay for a while, maybe forever as a whitelist-only legacy technology. Its kinda this already, but I&#x27;m guessing it could be stricter, like forcing people to go deep into a menu to activate flash instead of helpfully popping up about it.')
