It was not advocacy for the specific place on the spectrum where the line should be drawn. It was, in response to your comment, an observation that no matter where the line is drawn, there will be some who view it violates their freedom as too authoritarian, and others who believe it violates their freedom by allowing irresponsible decisions by others to impact them.<p>I won&#x27;t go into the particulars of my own opinion on where the lines should be drawn except to say that I think some decisions have been bad, some have been okay, but that in general this is not a situation that lends itself to easy answers.')
