From what I&#x27;ve read (my understanding may be wrong), using a revenue multiple at all for valuation is surprising for companies A) under $5M total valuation and B) with lower growth rates (looks like Baremetrics grew ~11% in the last 12 months). Can someone who knows better than I weigh in on the valuation math here (in general -- no one knows the exact details of this transaction, obviously). I&#x27;m not questioning it, but I am curious to get perspectives on this real world example.')
