You are only good at two things: earning money at your job, and spending it. The whole system is based on how much money you make, and that variable can change unexpectedly.<p>There is also a time cost to orchestrating all those services. Aligning schedules is not nearly as efficient as doing thr work yourself.<p>I prefer the idea of working less, spending less, and learning to do things yourself. Getting your hands dirty gives you a better appreciation for the result. It makes life more interesting and leaves you with a more diversified skillset.')
