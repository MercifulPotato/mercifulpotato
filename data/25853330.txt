I&#x27;m sorry to hear that you didn&#x27;t have a good family&#x2F;upbringing. Glad you found a place that you are more happy in.<p>The media has spent the last 4 years portraying Trump and his voters as evil racists. What is not mentioned is that his support among minorities increased from 2016 to 2020. He had more black and hispanic percentage of voters than any republican in in living memory. Ironically Trump lost the election because middle class white voters abandoned him.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong Trump was a terrible president and there are countless criticisms that can be leveled at his administration. But the key question no one is asking is why did people vote for him in the first place and why did so many vote for him again? To me answering that with &quot;because they&#x27;re all racist&#x2F;fascist&quot; is nothing more than a cop-out from established political powers to distract from their own failure of public confidence.')
