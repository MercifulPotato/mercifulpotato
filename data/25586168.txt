The parser and static analysis for a project written in Go will be very different than a project written in Java. All the language-specific stuff is different code that has different performance characteristics.<p>As an analogy, it&#x27;s sort of like testing browser performance for loading an &quot;average&quot; web page, when each web site has different performance, depending on how it was written. Load times for Hacker News aren&#x27;t all that relevant for Gmail or the New York Times.<p>Yes, you can make a benchmark and optimize it, but you might not even be running the same code that real users are running, due to plugins.')
