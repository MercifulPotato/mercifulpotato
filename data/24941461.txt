Item(by='anoonmoose', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604060537, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24935803, text='Greenwald published his email exchange with his editor.  He brought up his contractual right to publish elsewhere if he likes, in his first response to his editor.  He started accusing them of censorship in the second email (which he sent after the first before he got a reply back).  WHen they did respond, they said it would be &quot;harmful and detrimental to The Intercept&quot; if he published it elsewhere.  Glenn can call that a &quot;lawyer crafted threat&quot;, I see it as a true and accurate statement from his editor.<p>Guess what I&#x27;m saying is, he didn&#x27;t receive a message from the company&#x27;s lawyers that I&#x27;ve seen yet.')
