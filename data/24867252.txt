The net result is that they are now at a point where Drupal could drop PHP 5 support. They also moved towards modern PHP &#x2F; coding practices over the past years (Not invented here -&gt; Proudly found elsewhere, composer, PSR&#x27;s, OOP,...).<p>WordPress stuck with preserving backward compatibility and so the core API&#x27;s have never seen a fundamental breaking change between versions. New features have been tacked onto what was already there over time.<p>I have kept a personal WordPress blog since 2005 and I have always been able to easily update things without migration pains. Of course, I run a minimum of customized code (beyond a custom theme that is). And I suppose YMMV and you still might have a different experience, if you did heavy customization through plugins, heavily leaning on WP&#x27;s core API&#x27;s.<p>Drupal? Totally different experience. Breaking changes and fundamental alterations of the database schema have been par for the course. I&#x27;ve seen 6 month long migration projects to migrate crucial enterprise data between versions. The PTSD of migrating from Drupal 6 to 7 to 8 is real.<p>Then again, WordPress and Drupal are different tools despite a significant use case overlap. I&#x27;d be weary to use either Drupal for a simple blog, or WordPress for an intricate, tailored back office application. I think they are both designed to do different things all together.<p>Having said that, it&#x27;s worth noting that the Drupal project is very aware of past pains. One of the big goals of the past few years was working towards avoiding big breaking changes between major versions. It is purported that migrating between Drupal 8 and 9 is far less painful. Of course, it remains to be seen how that holds up in the long term.')
