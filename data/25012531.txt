You don’t need to know category theory to use Haskell or the libraries.<p>Know category theory or being aware of it just gives you a deeper understanding of the way things work.<p>I don’t know category theory but aware of it. The way I look at it is c style languages you have design patterns. These are loosely designed patterns with no formal definitions. That makes it hard to reason about or test things.<p>In category theory you have mathematical laws. Laws are far stronger than a loosely typed designed patterns so using these laws it’s far easier to reason about code.')
