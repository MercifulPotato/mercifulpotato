I&#x27;m not talking about switching to something overly idealistic or low paying, but other technical fields which would pay less than software development, but by a normal persons standard would be relatively high paying, but more reliant on credentials. However, I currently hold no undergraduate degree, and best case I could complete and undergrad and potentially a grad degree by my late 20s &#x2F; early 30s.<p>But at that point is it worth it? Sure it&#x27;s not old, but the only technical field you typically see people entering at that age is CS, which ofc, is very different from most. I can&#x27;t see it being a positive in interviews, etc. being so old for likely entry level positions.')
