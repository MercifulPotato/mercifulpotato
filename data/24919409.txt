For something simple like a blog, you shouldn&#x27;t be hitting PHP at all once the cache is warmed, let alone caching queries and snippets and whatnot, bugs waiting to happen.<p>The strategy is the same even for complex sites, full page cache at the server daemon for almost every page hit unless a user is doing an action that isn&#x27;t &quot;View this page&quot;.<p>Obviously I&#x27;m glossing over cache busting strategies and how you handle dynamic actions like add to carts, sessions etc, but they&#x27;re all far more simple than rolling your own application level caching strategy.<p>You will get so much more out of your hosting if using an FPC, which gives you way more headroom for the requests that do need to spin up the application.')
