And they themselves can go and found a company just like the founders on the other side of the table.<p>Would it be <i>nice</i> if employees were given options to wiggle fixed comp to adjust to their own risk profiles - so they could choose more guaranteed pay with less risk, or more possible upside with more risk? Sure, absolutely. But I don&#x27;t see how that should be a requirement, nor do I think companies <i>not offering</i> part-ownership are doing something wrong.<p>And I don&#x27;t understand why employees would ever be compensated for the &quot;full value of their labor&quot;. When you work for a company, your labor generally only makes sense within the context of the larger organization. Could that context explain the differences between what employees produce for the company, versus what they are paid?')
