I thoroughly enjoy the game, mostly because I&#x27;m a sucker for world building. The universe is fantastic, albeit a bit too pubescent and &quot;edgy&quot; at times. It also runs fine on my 1660 super. I don&#x27;t really mind the &quot;shallowness&quot; of the gameplay mechanics. Horses for courses, I suppose.<p>But man, oh man, is it buggy. I&#x27;ve never been soft locked this many times in a game before. As a software developer, it&#x27;s honestly a bit amusing to find the obvious cases where the individual sub systems trip each other up.<p>Primary offender is the scripted mission system vs. telephone. You get a phone call just as you enter a scripted cutscene? Two calls coming in simultaneously? You start a yellow dialogue while on the phone? Welp, time to reload.')
