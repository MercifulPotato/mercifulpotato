You get your salary, you set aside 20-75% to pay the bills, some amount you know from experience you need for groceries and other recurring expenses (like public transport and household goods) and if you happen to have anything left it goes to savings. If you&#x27;re privileged, you&#x27;ll also have some petty cash left for occasional lunch&#x2F;night out. When you need to spend some significant unplanned sum you take it out of savings, if you have any. If not, you eat less or go into debt.<p>What&#x27;s there to track, how much you&#x27;ve spent on potatoes and underwear this month versus the previous?<p>That was the scenario for a disciplined citizen. Most just pay the bills (not necessary <i>all</i> of them) and then just spend what&#x27;s left on their debit card until there&#x27;s nothing left. It usually happens before the next salary, of course. No accounting software would help there.<p>UPD: I&#x27;m not sure it was the right place to spill my negativity, I fully understand the benefits of being organized with your finances.')
