It&#x27;s supposed to be a stable one. Too low of inflation is bad because it means less investment in the physical economy. The Fed prints money to try to keep people from just hoarding cash. They want some inflation (and definitely not deflation) because a deflationary spiral means more and more money gets stuffed into mattresses instead of physical investments.<p>Unfortunately we&#x27;re seeing land prices and stock prices and crypto (etc) bid up instead of, say, a massive build out of factories and solar farms and multistory houses. (EDIT: We are seeing lots of houses being built, actually. Lumber is near all-time highs.)')
