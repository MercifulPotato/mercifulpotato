The majority of our real users reside in North&#x2F;Central America and Western Europe.  Recently we began to see hundreds of thousands of installs showing up on Google Analytics from unexpected countries. The installs did not show up on the Play Console analytics, implying these users obtained the .apk from some other source. The bulk of these users are from Pakistan, India, Egypt, and Iraq, but these installs are also occurring in dozens of other developing countries. The event data we get from Google Analytics implies that most of the users quickly uninstall the app after installing it. About 5-10% of them create an account and verify their email address. We&#x27;ve gotten a handful of support emails and a couple of Play Store reviews wherein the user claims our app was installed without their intent or knowledge. We are concerned that whoever is behind this has a malicious objective, but haven&#x27;t come up with a plausible explanation, and thus are hoping someone else has experienced similar phenomenon and would recognize this pattern.')
