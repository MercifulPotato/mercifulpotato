Partly since the advent of modern running sneakers may actually be causing more injuries as a sibling comment pointed out. For a  while I was doing PhD research in materials science and created a technique to do materials fatigue testing of the meniscus. Unfortunately that was the first ever such research for meniscus and the data wasn&#x27;t able to conclude much, alas. The research can&#x27;t say for sure what injuries are from form and conditions or underlying mechanical limits, or the effect of self-repair mechanisms. After that work though, my opinion is to run on the front of your foot and remain well hydrated as both reduce peak impact forces. Also pay attention to how you twist the knee while running (eg don&#x27;t twist during land). Also 1&#x2F;3 of meniscus injuries still appear to be unrelated to any specific injury or activities like running.')
