Numbers who&#x27;s origins are tainted by an illegal number can be illegal. Numbers who&#x27;s origins do not have taint from an illegal number are not. It is not the number that is illegal, it is it&#x27;s color. How it came into being, it&#x27;s history, a permanent invisible mark that it carries with it, and transfers to whatever it touches.<p>You can&#x27;t just dodge color by mutating the number via mathematical operations, color doesn&#x27;t work like that. You can only get rid of the taint by using a fresh number without taint.')
