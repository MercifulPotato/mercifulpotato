Unless Microsoft is willing to forgo licensing costs and also create a &quot;free&quot; version of MS Office to compete against GSuite.<p>For mass consumers, the lack of x86&#x2F;desktop app support at launch means this probably will go the way of Windows RT. Windows RT failed in part due to lack of app support from developers and in a world where Android apps are well supported on ChromeOS, I just don&#x27;t foresee a good outcome for the Windows 10X platform.<p>Personal anecdote: I&#x27;m pretty settled on getting a high-end Chromebook like the newly announced Asus CX9. The support for Android apps is the clincher.')
