Consider all of the sites for Are We (Web | GameDev | IDE | etc) Yet as well as the remarkable progress they&#x27;ve made in such a short time. Rust&#x27;s entire history fits in the amount of time that OCaml has been struggling to solve parallelism.<p>&gt; Jane Street has built a multi-billion dollar company using this approach. If you view such as &quot;abstract language design&quot;, then your loss.<p>That&#x27;s really great for Jane Street, but it&#x27;s really not the badge of honor you (and the rest of the OCaml community) think it is that a single company has managed to muster some success with your preferred language in its 25 year history. It also doesn&#x27;t do much to illustrate that the OCaml community is broadly interested in practical matters--only that one community has done, and they have done a lot of work to make OCaml manageable (like Google has done with Go, except that Go enjoys marketshare outside of Google).')
