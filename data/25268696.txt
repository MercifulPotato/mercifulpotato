That was after converting the property to a static site built with jekyll (you can do pretty amazing, magical-looking things with front end JS calling out to apis and nginx SSI while still serving static conntent) and a hosted wordpress ($25&#x2F;mo) for the content editors (and CircleCI&#x27;s free tier for builds -- woop woop).  And we were insanely over-provisioned with those t2.smalls.<p>Procurement sucks. Having to test out new systems when you need to buy new hardware 2 years later also sucks. Having to wait behind much larger customers when Intel has a Xeon supply shortage sucks (2018 sucked if you had to buy servers).')
