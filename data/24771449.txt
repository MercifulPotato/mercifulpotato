The other is &quot;oh shit, this stuff isn&#x27;t supported any more and is now a liability&quot;.<p>Which is a problem, because the longer you&#x27;re unaware, the more the liability and unknown unknowns grow. Eventually, the liability and cost to replace are huge&#x2F;bigger than it being an asset. The problem just gets harder; especially if you ignore it until it goes horribly wrong. See a comment above [0] for how this could happen.<p>Responsible, senior devs should be able to provide some guidance to the business at what point the system or sub-system is on that liability vs asset curve. &quot;Not cool any more&quot; isn&#x27;t that kind of advice.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24769695" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24769695</a>')
