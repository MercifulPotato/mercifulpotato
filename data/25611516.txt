I&#x27;ll give it a go:<p>Individual ignorance doesn&#x27;t counter a century of established science. It&#x27;s not a matter of authority, or lack of evidence, or insufficient testing. There&#x27;s a real <i>weight</i> to certain fields now, where literally thousands of textbooks have been written on surprisingly narrow topics, because of an intense interest both theoretically and practically for industrial purposes.<p>It&#x27;s not even a matter of laboratory experiments. Sure, we haven&#x27;t done a zillion tests specifically with 5G. That simply doesn&#x27;t matter. Some things are <i>effectively</i> field tested millions of times over through simple everyday activity. We know gravity doesn&#x27;t turn on and off randomly because we would <i>notice!</i><p>Even for subjects that our ordinary everyday experience doesn&#x27;t cover, <i>vast</i> industrial experience does. Literally millions of workers do their work every day with chemicals, machines, and electronics. They know how they work! They depend on that knowledge being accurate!<p><i>There simply cannot be such a thing as our knowledge of electromagnetic waves being this fundamentally flawed in the same manner as we cannot possibly have misunderstood chemistry to the point that we missed an element in between oxygen and nitrogen.</i><p>I just did some random Googling and found stacks of complaints sent to governments demanding a lower maximum 5G power level. Here&#x27;s one quote from a paper: <i>&quot;The extraordinary sensitivity of the VGCC voltage sensor to the forces of the EMFs tells us that the current safety guidelines allow us to be exposed to EMF levels that are something like 27.2 million times too high.&quot;</i> [1]<p>According to that guy&#x27;s theory we&#x27;re all already screwed, because the <i>background</i> radiation in all frequency bands has been waaaaaay higher than that since the 1950s! [2]<p>All of that just doesn&#x27;t matter though, because <i>simple and well-established</i> physics shows that for both 26 GHz and 60 GHz, the penetration depth is less than 0.5 mm into the skin[3], which means that <i>at most</i> the new 5G frequency bands could cause skin cancer.<p>That hasn&#x27;t stopped bloggers breathlessly repeating bad science where researchers take samples of cells from internal tissues and nuke them with high power RF sourcers for weeks on end in order to &quot;demonstrate&quot; the potential harm from radiofrequency radiation.<p>PS: Sabine has an axe to grind and seems to be grandstanding an awful lot. Her videos are mostly pop-science and full of ads. She&#x27;s not an authority on anything other than an extremely narrow field related to quantum gravity, and even there most physicists do not agree with her stance.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.radiationresearch.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;EU-EMF2018-6-11US3.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.radiationresearch.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lanplh&#x2F;PIIS2542-5196(18)30221-3.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lanplh&#x2F;PIIS2542-5196...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;ftp&#x2F;arxiv&#x2F;papers&#x2F;1503&#x2F;1503.05944.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;ftp&#x2F;arxiv&#x2F;papers&#x2F;1503&#x2F;1503.05944.pdf</a>')
