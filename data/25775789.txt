Item(by='halfsquatch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610629083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25747291, text='I use Windows.  I support Windows at work.  I don&#x27;t code.  But I need to pick up one day where I left off the previous day like anybody else.  My solution works on Windows, but should be easily portable to any other platform.<p>I have a batch file called remember.bat, stored in my %PATH% so I can call it from anywhere (I usually use the start menu run box).  It simply ECHOes the time, date, and any command line arguments to a text file.  Like this:<p>(First post.  Sorry if the formatting breaks.) (edit: yeah, formatting broke.)<p>time &#x2F;t &gt;&gt; %userprofile%\\documents\\notes.txt<p>date &#x2F;t &gt;&gt; %userprofile%\\documents\\notes.txt<p>echo %* &gt;&gt; %userprofile%\\documents\\notes.txt<p>echo. &gt;&gt; %userprofile%\\documents\\notes.txt<p>exit<p>I also have a log viewer application called CMTrace.exe (from Windows SCCM) in my startup folder, pointing at that notes.txt file.<p>So when I log in to my computer, CMTrace tails the notes file, highlighting a bunch of key words in different colors to make severity more obvious.<p>When I need to add something to the list, I just start\\run, type &quot;remember whatever I need to remember&quot; (without quotes) and the file is appended with:<p>06:47 AM\nThu 01&#x2F;14&#x2F;2021 \nwhatever I need to remember<p>If you want to view it live, you can use anything that can tail a file instead of CMTrace if you don&#x27;t have access to it.  Otherwise it&#x27;s available to refer to anytime with your text viewer of choice.<p>If I need to remove something from the notes, I can open it in Notepad++ or whatever and save it, but I find myself leaving everything there for future reference.<p>I realize the post starts with &quot;When coding&quot;, but I imagine this could work there, and I know it works elsewhere, so I figured I&#x27;d share anyway.')
