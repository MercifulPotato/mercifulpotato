For instance,  a thermal reactor using thorium&#x2F;uranium and fluoride salts will probably have a graphite moderator,  but the lifetime of that moderator is limited by exposure to neutrons.  This material can stand the chemical environment<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.steelforge.com&#x2F;hastelloy-n&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.steelforge.com&#x2F;hastelloy-n&#x2F;</a><p>but it does not hold up as well under neutrons as we&#x27;d like.<p>It&#x27;s a complicated problem because the question of &quot;what happens to the fission products&quot; is a complicated one.  Some fission products will stay in the salt,  where you hope they won&#x27;t absorb neutrons and &#x27;poison&#x27; the reaction.  Others will condense on the colder parts of the system.  Others are released in gas form,  especially the noble gases Xe-131 and Kr-85.  The reactor vessel has to not just hold up to the molten salt, but it has to hold up to a molten salt which contains random fission products from across the periodic table.<p>A group of enthusiasts took up the cause of the thorium&#x2F;uranium cycle 15 years ago.  There has been a lot of research on it since,  certainly people are much more aware of the challenges there.<p>People were less interested in Chloride salts and the uranium&#x2F;plutonium cycle back in the day but that interest is increasing now for quite a few reasons.  One of them is that the materials challenges seem less severe (no moderator,  more neutrons to start with,  less neutron loss to reactor materials.)<p>The other advanced technology to make that work is<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Closed-cycle_gas_turbine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Closed-cycle_gas_turbine</a><p>which is necessary for any kind of economically competitive nuclear energy because the cost of a steam turbine is outrageous.')
