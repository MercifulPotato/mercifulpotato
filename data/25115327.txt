Usually not as heavy drinking as in other countries, but lower graduation alcohol and slower pace, but it happens for many hours, so it does end up being a lot. The plus side, it&#x27;s hard to feel alone around here. The con, of course the liver suffers, and the excessive social life can end up feeling suffocating (you can opt out, but, especially in smaller towns, it takes some effort).<p>Navarre was a completely independent kingdom until 1521 when it was invaded by Castille, although stayed as a separate kingdom and legal entity within the non-homogeneous political complex of Spain until around 1850, when it became a province with some unique foral rights. These days it&#x27;s an autonomous community within Spain with some extra rights (critical: tax collection &amp; budgeting), same as the three traditional provinces of the Basque Country. There are many cultural and social ties between the Basque provinces and Navarre, also a few lighter ones with the French Basque area, and the areas collaborate, but they are distinct political entities today. Personal, cultural, social and nationalistic ideas and feelings with regards to this are on a very wide spectrum.')
