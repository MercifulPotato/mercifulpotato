It&#x27;s very likely that what&#x27;s been found on &quot;Hunter Biden&#x27;s&quot; laptop is just hacked material which has been stuffed on a laptop to disguise the original source of the breach.  In this case the DKIM signatures are being used to lend credibility to the story that the laptop was mysteriously left in repair shop, never to be reclaimed.<p>DKIM is not meant to validate conversations, it&#x27;s meant to validate single messages for the purposes of spam prevention.  Just because I can cryptographically validate selectively chosen messages from someone&#x27;s mailbox, I don&#x27;t have any proof that the conversation happened as presented.<p>There&#x27;s a good reason why eliminating non-repudiation has been a goal of messaging protocols since OTR in 2004.')
