Does the intern get no pay?<p>What if the advancement is in the wrong direction in the market? Like Windows Mobile was. You could have built a great system that delivered a few hundred million in sales, but two years down the road it cost the company a few billion in costs. Do you get to pay back your share?<p>I&#x27;m not advocating here for the work to be uncompensated - it&#x27;s just when you get a risk shield, you also lose the payout shield.<p>Maybe a better culture of coop&#x27;s would be a better solution.')
