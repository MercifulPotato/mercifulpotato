I&#x27;ll add that the fitness tracker has the added bonus of making you want to meet your &quot;goals&quot; on the tracker, which can sometimes be the difference between me taking a healthy walk or not.<p>As for choosing a supportive partner, I&#x27;ve found that it gets easier as I get older. Age matures people and gives them patience. I&#x27;m also lucky to have a partner who has also experienced serious health issues, so he truly understands at a deep level.<p>Finding him took time, probably more time than a healthy person would spend looking for a partner. But I am grateful every day that I didn&#x27;t give up the search.')
