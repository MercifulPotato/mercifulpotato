Like, for instance, the Japanese polytheism is a &quot;superficial difference&quot; with the European monotheism?<p>I don&#x27;t think so. If it was all superficial, it wouldn&#x27;t be called &quot;culture&quot; and we would not a make such a big deal out of it. I will certainly disagree with you on some things because our cultures are different.<p>You yourself fall into &quot;forests are just trees&quot; trap, and it doesn&#x27;t matters if some kind of mushroom can grow in my forest and some other in your forest. Worse, you seem to give up to the idea that &quot;modern capitalistic world&quot; will make all the forests the same anyway - hopefully you don&#x27;t believe it is for the better (or rather, hopefully you do!).<p>I think you underestimate the role of culture because you misunderstand the culture of others. Perhaps because a culture is made of thousands of big and little differences, and its difficult to see how they affects people&#x27;s daily choices or behavior.')
