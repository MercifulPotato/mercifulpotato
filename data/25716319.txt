You will find that the averaging only smooths out brief transients between your new dots. In the case of the comic, it has no effect on the gradient at 2016.<p>Having more data doesn&#x27;t change the average slope - it simply allows you to measure average slope over shorter distances.<p>So unless you think the joke was &quot;haha we&#x27;ve been at this temperature before&quot;, I suggest it is you who is being ... what you said.')
