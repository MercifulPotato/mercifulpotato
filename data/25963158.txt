I struggle to see how the real value created by this whole system outweighs the negatives. It’s been abstracted too far away from &quot;investing in a company&quot; and created too many perverse incentives. Too many people playing numbers games and gambling, under the impression that they&#x27;re creating value somehow. HFT? How is that anything but absurd?<p>I feel like we’d be better off going back to a more simple system where actual people have actual skin in the companies they&#x27;re taking ownership of.')
