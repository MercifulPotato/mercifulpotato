It&#x27;s close enough to existing RDBMS to reduce the learning curve, and can be incrementally &quot;locked down&quot; via added constraints and types (via formatting constraints). It tweaks the RDBMS&#x2F;SQL wheel just enough to get dynamism, NOT reinvent the wheel.<p>It would be great for prototyping and rush-jobs. For example, a lot of orgs needed to get Covid-related employee illness, notification tracking, and&#x2F;or vaccination tracking up and running ASAP. Something like DR would make it easy.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;66385&#x2F;dynamic-database-schema#46202802" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;66385&#x2F;dynamic-database-s...</a>')
