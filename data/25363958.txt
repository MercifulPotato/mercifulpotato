From a practical point of view it&#x27;s not so clear. If a video isn&#x27;t on Youtube, for many it&#x27;s the same as not existing at all. For example, my Roku  can show YouTube videos, but cannot access arbitrary urls.<p>In general, platforms are not supposed to discriminate, while Publishers do. This particular case makes that distinction far less obvious. I&#x27;d like to see some alternative, such as markings, instead of a simple include or not.')
