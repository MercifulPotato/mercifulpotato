I&#x27;m not sure exactly where it comes from, though my instinct is to blame American media. I&#x27;m white myself, so this doesn&#x27;t come up much with me. I mostly noticed it when some of her family visited us in the US.<p>I would expect much less of this from younger people, as Taiwan is probably the most socially progressive country in East Asia. That said, Taiwan is pretty homogeneous, so a foreigner of any color will be a rarity, and I suspect Africans are relatively uncommon among foreigners.
