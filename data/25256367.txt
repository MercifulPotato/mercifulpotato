It was in the 80s that I first read a paper about a de-novo protein design engineered for a specific stable conformation. Natural proteins have no reason to be particularly predictable, just as genetic programming produces hard-to-understand programs relative to human-written ones. In fact making the structure especially stable against perturbations seems like it&#x27;d make it less responsive to changing evolutionary pressures.<p>(Am not a structural biologist.)<p>Added: 2019 article on de novo design: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-019-02251-x" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-019-02251-x</a>\nNot to say that better prediction won&#x27;t also make design easier -- of course I expect it will.')
