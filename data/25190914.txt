I stipulate that there is immense social pressure for individuals to endorse the slogan &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot;. What I dispute is the proposition that any reasonable person assumes such an endorsement also constitutes an endorsement of the Marxist beliefs of &quot;BLM, Inc.&quot;, a name I&#x27;m introducing to capture the organization you&#x27;re referring to. I agree that BLM, Inc. is so hospitable to radical socialism that we might as well refer to it as a radical socialist organization. I strongly disagree that such tendencies also apply to the slogan &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot;; BLM, Inc. has lost its hold on the slogan, and no longer owns it. That&#x27;s what happens when a slogan succeeds so wildly it&#x27;s on every bumper sticker and lawn in Oak Park.')
