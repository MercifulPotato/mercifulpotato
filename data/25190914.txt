I agree that there is immense social pressure for individuals to endorse the slogan &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot;.<p>What I dispute is the proposition that any reasonable person assumes such an endorsement also constitutes an endorsement of the Marxist beliefs of &quot;BLM, Inc.&quot;, a name I&#x27;m introducing to capture the organization you&#x27;re referring to.<p>I agree that BLM, Inc. is so hospitable to radical socialism that we might as well refer to it as a radical socialist organization.<p>I strongly disagree that such tendencies also apply to the slogan &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot;; BLM, Inc. has lost its hold on the slogan, and no longer owns it. That&#x27;s what happens when a slogan succeeds so wildly it&#x27;s on every bumper sticker and lawn in Oak Park.<p>(I think this is more or less what the libertarian Foundation for Economic Education has to say about BLM as well).')
