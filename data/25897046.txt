ASML is the only company in the world that makes those machines. They sold 6 of them this past quarter and delivered 9, despite limitations on their ability to do business with Chinese foundries. They&#x27;re approximately four-fifths of the lithography market in general, and basically five-fifths of the EUV market. So while their machines are not the only component of a foundry&#x27;s toolkit, it&#x27;s quite clear that ASML is a critically important business.')
