That&#x27;s definitely an unusual and disturbing thing for an adolescent to do. But do you have reason to think Carmack got that way at that age specifically because of his interest in programming, or that his interest in programming kept him that way thereafter?<p>I&#x27;m skeptical of this because he went on to be a successful, respected computer scientist and business leader, as well as starting a family. While of course many people who&#x27;ve done each of these things may be bad at empathy (or worse!), I&#x27;m not aware that Carmack has somehow continued along the course he was on at 14.')
