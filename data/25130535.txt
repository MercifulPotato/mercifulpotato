Apple could easily scale this to 50W, or a M1&quot;X&quot; with Double of everything, ( likely not with the Neural Processing Unit and the Image Signal Processing ).<p>2. That would give you double the performance in MultiCore Benchmarks, and Double the Graphics.<p>3. They will need to double the memory transfer as well, so it will either be a Quad Channel LPDDR4X or may be going with LPDDR5.<p>4. This hypothetical chip could be coming to MacBook 16&quot; next year.<p>5. It is the nature of Chip and Devices that we are fundamentally limited by Heat Dissipation. I call this TDP Computing.<p>6. That is why in many, if not literally every explanation under every graph they will note the TDP difference and you <i>should</i> get the correct perspective or what is being measured.<p>7. That means you should not expect a 10W &#x2F; 25W chip to out perform a 32 Core 250W Chip in MultiCore Benchmarks. You are basically comparing Apple to orange. And I dont know why there are <i>many</i> comments in this thread doing it.<p>8. The M1, and SPEC scores ( no longer are we relying on Geekbench ) are to showcase what Apple is capable of.<p>Edit: I just deleted a massive Rant specific to HN comments on Hardware.')
