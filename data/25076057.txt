(MacOS already fails-open in some internet scenarios.)<p>A better option is to asynchronously update a Certificate Revocation List (&quot;CRL&quot;) and perform any check local to the machine.  This avoids disclosing to Apple every single time you run a program, which program it is, and what network you&#x27;re on.  It could also emergency-revoke certificates just as quickly as the OCSP design by polling at the same frequency (every app startup).')
