Like Java, it&#x27;s a very widely used language in enterprise and industry, and I think that most of the programmers in those languages view programming as just a 9-to-5, white collar job that puts food on the table. Nothing wrong with this view either, but it&#x27;s not the kind of environment that would create memes or inside jokes.<p>Rust, Haskell or Ocaml, on the other hand, are exactly the kind of languages that passionate programmers, that spend a lot of time in chatrooms and on forums like HN, would spend their time on.')
