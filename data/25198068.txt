Random examples might be concrete, or maybe jet airplanes.<p>b) As a way to try to draw down atmospheric CO2 even faster once we are predominantly transition to de-carbonized energy sources.<p>Pilot plants that exist today are just that - pilots. They may be useful as ways for us to learn what to do when we get to worlds that are well described by a) or b)... but we really gotta get there first.')
