They often report needing to put pressure on the handle while the station is handshaking with the car to avoid spurious ground isolation faults and&#x2F;or communication errors.  I don&#x27;t recall reading anything similar with Teslas at Superchargers.<p>Given that this happens across manufacturers, I&#x27;m inclined to think that it is either a design flaw with CCS or a not-clearly-specified part of the CCS spec.')
