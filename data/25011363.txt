They should have gone under with Sears instead of lingering to capitalize on their past glory.<p>Part of my job involves repairing power tools, and I&#x27;ve started lumping Craftsman (and also the once-great Delta) in with &quot;throwaway&quot; brands like Harbor Freight and Tool Shop where I have to turn customers away or at least warn them that I probably can&#x27;t get parts for them. So many parts for fairly recent models have already been discontinued, if they were ever available at all. I see a lot of older customers to whom Craftsman has always meant quality and service, and they often leave frustrated in my inability to deliver on that legacy.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with their hand tools which, while maybe made more cheaply than before, can still be replaced at any Craftsman retailer that carries a replacement. But their power tool parts support is just abysmal IME.')
