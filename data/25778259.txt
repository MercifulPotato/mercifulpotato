It&#x27;s a &quot;right place, right time&quot; situation. Intel&#x27;s long-term problem is loss of market share, but if you&#x27;re going to lose market share, you&#x27;re more likely to survive if it happens when the whole market is growing.<p>There&#x27;s not much that a company so heavily invested in x86 can do in the face of Apple Silicon, aside from executing well on 7nm and bringing it to market ahead of schedule.<p>I don&#x27;t see much of a similarity between Intel CPUs and Blackberry phones, considering that many flagship notebooks (even Apple&#x27;s) have Intel inside. I for one am heralding the new era of voracious semiconductor demand, and am rooting for Intel to get its game face on and turn things around before the opportunity passes.')
