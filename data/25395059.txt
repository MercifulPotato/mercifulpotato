I&#x27;m not at all worried about contracting covid. At my age and health, the science is very clear that COVID-19 poses almost no risk to me. The only reason I&#x27;d bother with a vaccine is to protect others.<p>But protecting others doesn&#x27;t just mean protecting others now. It also means protecting others in the future. Bad government is a _serious_ risk.<p>&gt; I don’t know what country you live in, but many countries have the same assessment of many vaccines.<p>I wasn&#x27;t talking about science in relation to vaccines. I was talking about science in relation to the entire policy. I do not believe my government (Canada) is making decisions based on science in its use of emergency powers <i>in general</i>. That&#x27;s pretty clear by the fact that they&#x27;re unable to justify so many of the decisions made with actual numbers and models.<p>Emergency powers are dangerous tools. We hope they get reserved for situations where the benefit is worth the risk. But after seeing how badly, and unscientifically. government has handled the entire pandemic, I want to see those emergency powers further restricted, so they aren&#x27;t so easy to use in the future.<p>edit: Note how Trump has told the FDA chief that his options were to approve the Pfizer vaccine or resign: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;11&#x2F;trump-stephen-hahn-fda-covid-vaccine&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;11&#x2F;trump-steph...</a><p>What a terrible precedent for science.')
