These properties are difficult to prove in a symbolic model like ProVerif’s, but can be proved in a computational model, e.g. using tools like CryptoVerif or EasyCrypt [5, 2]. This assumption may appear strong, especially considering that Telegram has been widely criticized for its design choices (such as ad hoc cryptographic primitives and an unusual encryption mode), and vulnerabilities have been found in MTProto v1.0 (but actually, none of these attacks have been replicated on the new MTProto 2.0). Still, proving the logical correctness of the protocol under a fairly general threat model is very important because, if a weakness in the protocol exists, it must be looked for in the “lower-level” part of the protocol, among the chosen cryptographic functions and other implementation choices.”')
