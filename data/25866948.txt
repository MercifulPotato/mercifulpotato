The Netgain motor is pretty big as motors go and it&#x27;ll be close to the power steering unit, but still I think I&#x27;ve got enough room there.<p>Most of the work so far has been making battery boxes.  I&#x27;ve got one under each rear seat where the gas tank used to be, one in the front down low where the radiator used to be, a smaller one above it, and another that goes over the motor (which raises the CG more than I&#x27;d like, but the other batteries that basically as low as they can be probably offset it).  Weight balance should be about the same.<p>I&#x27;ll have to do some welding on the back seats, because they&#x27;re too low for the batteries to fit.  Sacrificing about four inches of foam will make for an uncomfortable seat, but it should at least look normal.')
