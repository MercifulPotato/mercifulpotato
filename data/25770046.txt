Item(by='jstgord', descendants=None, kids=[25770296], score=None, time=1610583985, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25769897, text='I think this move by airbnb is gutsy, risky, costly and the right thing to do [ in these unusual circumstances ]<p>I have been an early adopter of AirBnB and used them while living and travelling for a few years.  More recently I&#x27;ve been more critical of them, mainly for the amount they charge in commission&#x2F;fees.  But their service is pretty good, booking from other hotel &#x2F; motel sites is a pain, visually, information-ally and and logistically.<p>You may argue that AirBnB [ and others such as Twitter &#x2F; Facebook etc ] are engaging in censorship - but laws and norms of good behavior are always a balance between rights freedoms and safety &#x2F; efficiency.<p>I would argue that at this moment, everyone of us has to ask what they can do to prevent further violent insurrection, to prevent the spread of Covid, to address climate change.  Clearly the fomenting of right wing nationalism &#x2F; Qanon &#x2F; antivaxx etc has realworld consequences we cant ignore.<p>When I wear a mask it helps other people and myself not spread an airborne virus.  I see this as my civic duty, informed by science, not as a political statement.  If I thought Covid was fictional, I would still wear a mask out of general politeness or to comply with laws and the prevailing medical advice.<p>Individuals must act, and we must take collective actions such as this - our institutions have been weakened and the past year has shown this, and its all hands on deck to shore them up.<p>Not to say we need to get back to &#x27;normal&#x27; .. we need to improve things, and quickly.  We need to act even when we cant see current events in clear historical context, we are in the melee.')
