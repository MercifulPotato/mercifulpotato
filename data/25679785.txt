It seems like they never looked at that Princeton study that stated it had already taken place in 2014 [0].<p>Personally speaking it took the 2008 crisis to finally force me to accept this truth, the US is a corpo-facist State with a very well traveled revolving door between politics and certain &#x27;Private&#x27; Industries that benefit the most of from favourable policy and legislation as their lobbying budgets reflects that--banking, schooling, pharma&#x2F;medical, and most blatant of all military contractors spanning everything from fastfood chains that supply on base meals, to mercenaries for hire (Blackwater&#x2F;Xe) to weapons manufacturing (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Ratheon et al).<p>When you look back at how every crisis before and after 2008 was handled in just my lifetime, be it the opioid epidemic, dotcom bubble before that in the 2000s to the wallstreet corruption and Iran Contra and crack crisis in the 80s their is very little consequence for their corporate and political affiliates, where as entire generations of the populace are let to their own devices.<p>I hate to to say this, as I wish we could just bypass it entirely already a logical decesion, but short of stopping the CCP expanding its far more dysfunctional form of tyrannical Imperialism (and disregard for the environment) acting as a deterrent in South Asia the US has no real function anymore in anything that matters, and we would benefit from hastening the transition from this pointless archaic and clearly Oligarchical nation state model as soon as possible to a Global confederation so we can start solving real issues on the Global level that demand all of our attention: specifically pertaining to climate change and the fallout from just that alone.<p>It really fills me with dread that we can&#x27;t figure this very obvious problem all while we are trying to tackle being a multi planetary species.<p>Boeing just got hit with a $2.5B with a deferred prosecution fine and no criminal prosecutions mentioned for conspiracy of fraud when employees intentionally lied to the regulators. For any pleb or small business owner this is a sure way to get all your assets seized in a &#x27;slam dunk&#x27; case ending in federal prison, but this is a MegaCorp with cronyist assurances from DoD and NASA contracts so expect more sweet heart contracts to come their way to recover far more than this in the near future.<p>What a joke...<p>0:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;journals&#x2F;perspectives-on-politics&#x2F;article&#x2F;testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens&#x2F;62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;journals&#x2F;perspectives-on-poli...</a>')
