If the individual could extract the same 500K from their labor without the company, they would (hopefully). They don&#x27;t because it&#x27;s not purely the labor generating that value, but the capital invested along with that labor. Being a great programmer is worthless without a computer.<p>I think a really good example is a story from Google. An intern changed the compression of the Google logo on the search page and shaved off a few bytes. Since Google serves that page billions of times, that saved google a 10&#x27;s of thousands of dollars a year, and was literally minutes of work. If the same intern did the same work anywhere else, it would have been almost worthless.')
