And this occurrence is so commonplace as to warrant a proposed punitive tax on margin trade profit?  What evidence do you have that this <i>actually</i> happens?  I think you ARE making a moral argument, namely around &#x27;risk taking&#x27; being something that society should punish and discourage via taxation.  You left the second part, the societal cost (which may be real, who knows, you only offered a hypothetical government assistance scenario) completely in the realm of speculative fancy.<p>Not to mention, if you really truly wanted to morally punish and discourage gambling, I seriously doubt a tax on profit would make a dent in it!  Have you ever met a real gambler?')
