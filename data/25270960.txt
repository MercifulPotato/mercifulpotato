Item(by='bentcorner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606862137, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25270265, text='I have a Vivosmart HR as well but my wife got me a Fitbit Versa last year and it&#x27;s a give-and-take.<p>The battery life is worse but the color screen is really nice and the watch can do more (most notably have multiple alarms set from the watch).  Vibration motor is better on the Fitbit.<p>Sleep tracking is slightly better on the fitbit (re. graphs and data).  Accuracy seems better but I&#x27;m no expert (I&#x27;ve gotten false positives where the Garmin thinks I&#x27;m sleeping if I&#x27;m sitting at my computer not moving much, Fitbit has tracked naps which is impressive).<p>I kind of liked the Garmin app more than the Fitbit one.  The fitbit app can be confusing to navigate and it&#x27;s irritating that they try to upsell you on a subscription.  The garmin app is more spartan but it&#x27;s easier to see your data.  I think it might be easier to extract your data from garmin as well.<p>Syncing both watches to your phone is equally painful.<p>I don&#x27;t know of anything new that has a long battery life like the Vivosmart HR.  Garmin claims equally long battery life on their newer devices but I&#x27;m skeptical.')
