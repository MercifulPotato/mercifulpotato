Biggest &quot;drawback&quot; is it&#x27;s all very tied to vue2 (naturally).  I know vue3 has been a moving target for a while, but it&#x27;s out now.  I think it&#x27;ll probably be next summer before BSV is ported to vue3 (which, IIRC, will also be tied to bootstrap 5).  Big undertaking, for sure.')
