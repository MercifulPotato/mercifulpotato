Most games end in well less than an hour, but some take close to almost two hours (due to the increment and long end games).<p>I think like in any game, if you continuously play with opponents of just about your skill level, and you analyze your games to make sure that you are not making the same mistakes again and again, you will improve over time just like with anything.<p>To minimize rating fluctuations and tilting, playing only one long and well thought out game a day works great and keeps it fun.<p>I think to keep it fun, it&#x27;s important not to forget that rating fluctuations are normal and don&#x27;t mean much. As long as you keep playing and analysing each game, improvement is possible.')
