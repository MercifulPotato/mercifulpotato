Developers in east europe earning such amounts are junior level as wages are going up as a result of western clients &#x2F; employers finding they deliver higher quality work than say india, or pakistan. Most people I know in the area, with senior level experience, are at around double that figure. If you factor in ever growing demand for software engineers in the EU then wages are going to go up even higher.')
