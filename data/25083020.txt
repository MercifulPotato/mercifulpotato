After the DashPass discounted period ends, you can choose to continue to be enrolled and charged the then current monthly DashPass rate<p>They also have an offer for the Freedom and Slate cards (which have no annual fee) albeit free DashPass only for the first 3 months and a 50% discount for the next 9. So, still a good deal overall when compared to paying $9.99 every month. Thanks!')
