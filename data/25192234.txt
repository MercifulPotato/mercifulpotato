Item(by='dkarl', descendants=None, kids=[25197565], score=None, time=1606167412, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25189838, text='I&#x27;ve been a Scala programmer for close to ten years now, and I&#x27;ve been shocked at how blithely people will 1) unilaterally commit their coworkers to enormous learning curves, without regard for the consequences, and 2) use crucial projects as personal learning opportunities, again without regard for the consequences.  Partly it&#x27;s self-indulgence, partly it&#x27;s machismo, partly it&#x27;s a sincere desire to build the best thing possible, but whatever the motivation, it can cause a huge mess.  People need to feel responsible for leaving a certain ratio of polished, mature \ncode to beginner, learning code, even though that means that (gasp!) they can&#x27;t live in a permanent state of learning big new things.')
