The whole &quot;stupidity&#x2F;malice&quot; addage has always been a euphemism for &quot;corruption&quot; in my book. There is an insane amount of potentially taxable money and a lot of states dearly need that money, especially right now.<p>&gt; We also have to consider how much our subsidized postal systems are really just subsidizing one form of business over another.<p>Yeah, but you could say that for roads as well, or any utility none of these businesses helped create and from which they profit. That&#x27;s why taxation exists at first place. Imagine Amazon having to build&#x2F;maintain their own roads to deliver parcels...<p>I&#x27;m a bit more lenient with Amazon from an ethical perspective. Airbnb, Uber and co, deliberatly violating local laws with their illegal taxis&#x2F;hotels on the other hand, and the shear inability for governments to crackdown on these services... not because founders are geniuses, because VC money helps exploit justice systems. I can assure you that if I were to launch a bootstrapped Airbnb like service in my home country I&#x27;d be shut down in a week and probably jailed...')
