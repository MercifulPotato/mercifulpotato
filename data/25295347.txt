The EB-5 program is the &quot;government sponsored&quot; way of doing it. I also think that is bad, and abused, but I digress.<p>If your argument for it being good is &quot;the money goes to public colleges, which is basically the government!&quot; then the government should just be transparently selling permanent residency without the smoke-and-mirror charade of a &quot;school&quot;.<p>Are you then going to exclude private schools? I would guess that a degree from Harvard is more worthy of a green card, but then why should Harvard get a bunch of &quot;free money&quot; for selling a green card?<p>US Colleges will still only have a certain amount of capacity. If all of a sudden it comes with a free green card, either 1) less US students can afford to go there, because tuition has risen so much due to &quot;supply and demand&quot;, or 2) US students still go there, and end up with even more debt than they currently have.<p>&gt; Now at least some of the money and gatekeeping would flow through colleges. Especially public colleges, who love foreign students, because they pay full tuition.<p>With the EB-5 programs (the way to &quot;buy&quot; a green card), you have to invest within Qualified Opportunity Zones which are (in theory) designed to assist lower-income areas, or create a certain number of new jobs (I&#x27;m sure there are other investments that qualify too; I&#x27;m not an expert on this program).<p>Having funds go towards these endeavors is arguably &quot;better&quot; than going into the pockets of an already administratively-overloaded university system.')
