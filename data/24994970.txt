Anything done &quot;online&quot; simply verifies that &quot;some human at a keyboard&quot; has the requisite &quot;secret&quot; -- but cannot verify that the correct human who should legally have the secret is indeed the one entering the secret.<p>I.e. Bob gives Joe his &quot;voting secret&quot; and now Joe can log in as &quot;Joe&quot; and vote his legal vote, and also log in as &quot;Bob&quot; and cast a second vote, all while the online system believes &quot;Bob&quot; is casting that second vote.<p>Also, if you want to maintain the secrecy of the ballot then you simply can not perform online voting, because with the machines there can always be some trail to trace between &quot;ballot X&quot; and &quot;Fred&quot; to show who cast that ballot.')
