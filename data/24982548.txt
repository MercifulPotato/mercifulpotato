Item(by='deepspace', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604428743, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24967182, text='I read a fascinating and well-written article about 10 years ago about a woman (a lawyer iirc) who stepped into an elevator in a New York office building late one evening.  Halfway down, the elevator got stuck due to a warped frame, and then suddenly dropped several floors from the weight of the still-unwinding cable.<p>The elevator then proceeded down to the lobby, but the woman was severely injured.  The building was deserted so it took her a long time to get medical help, and afterwards people would not believe her since nobody else witnessed the accident.<p>Wish I could find the article gain.  It reminded me that there are many badly maintained elevators out there and the fact that more of them are not involved in accidents is a testament to their redundant design.<p>To this day I am wary of stepping into an elevator in an old&#x2F;sketchy building.')
