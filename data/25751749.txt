Item(by='joecot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610478336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25750982, text='AWS is just one of hundreds if not thousands of hosting services.  Is GoDaddy allowed to terminate someone&#x27;s account? Linode? The 1 employee host I use in Chicago? AWS is one of the biggest hosts on the web, but they&#x27;re still just <i>a host</i>. Other hosts exist and are readily available to move to, and there&#x27;s no meaningful loss in internet availability between one and any other. The most likely reason that Parler can&#x27;t manage to find a new host is that every other host now knows who they are and what they stand for, and will come knocking if they try to sign up and spin up instances. Parler ran out of giant megahosts they can hide in without having to speak to a person. On an internet that still hosts The Gab, Stormfront and numerous other deplorable sites, it&#x27;s quite a feat to not be able to find <i>any</i> host willing to take you. That feat is pretty much relegated to child pornography and terrorism.<p>Let&#x27;s not mince words: Parler knowingly aided in organizing a domestic terrorist insurrection on the US Capital. Anyone providing hosting to them at this point would be taking on a massive liability. Slippery Slope arguments about kicking off dissenters simply do not apply in this case.')
