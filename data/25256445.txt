Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606757924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25254977, text='&gt; States probably can compel people to take it, considering some already require it for use of public services like schools.<p>Public schools likely could not exist in the densities they currently exist if people didn&#x27;t vaccinate. Likewise, dense urban housing, and many public venues would cease to be viable. Measles spread far faster than COVID; even with something like 95% of the population vaccinated we still have outbreaks in high anti-vaxxer communities. If we didn&#x27;t require measles vaccines where we do, it would be absolutely everywhere. Likewise similarly conquered diseases like smallpox and polio.<p>&gt; Citizens who are forced to give up bodily autonomy to use basic services they can’t reasonably avoid (roads, public transportation, schools, etc) simply don’t have basic freedoms in my view.<p>To date, no state requires vaccinations to use roads&#x2F; public transportation and I find it unlikely that they ever will. But I would support requiring proof of vaccination at the state&#x2F; national borders during an outbreak to prevent spreaders. Likewise, large gatherings (including schools) absolutely must require vaccinations. This isn&#x27;t a matter of freedom&#x2F; versus not freedom. If they didn&#x27;t require vaccination, they could not safely exist.<p>If you choose to opt out of large events, then I support that right. But schools&#x2F; colleges&#x2F; concerts&#x2F; etc, cannot exist in a vaccine optional world.')
