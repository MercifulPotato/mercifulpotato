Making hate viral to millions of people in a decentralized network is an innovation that I am not happy about. What to do about it I don&#x27;t know and haven&#x27;t heard many convincing arguments. I do think European style bans on hate speech might be a positive change. Europe has a lot of weird cultural things as a result of their imperialist and colonial past, but their recent experience with genocide and war does lend them some credibility in terms of how they have adapted. \nI think they have mostly open societies with high quality of life and not many compromises in terms of &quot;liberty&quot;. I equate liberty with overall quality of life, not the liberty of individuals to abnegate societal obligations. So bans on hate speech, and attendant penalties, I see precedent where little harm has been done but a lot of harm has been mitigated.')
