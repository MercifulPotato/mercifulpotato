Effectively it&#x27;s just a different syntax for the same construct after all, it doesn&#x27;t simplify anything, it just makes it more readable. Oh and it makes escaping a non-issue, which already almost sells me on the idea completely, since it seems that 50% of the time I spend writing regex is figuring out what needs escaping and how.<p>Writing regexes is not much of an issue usually (although the many dialects in common use are always a source of frustration) but reading them is always a pain, for me at least. For quick and dirty shell scripts or vim editing it&#x27;s great, for stuff that&#x27;s supposed to be long lived and actively maintained in a codebase I think this verbal approach is a great idea, at least in theory.<p>Regarding the optimization of the intermediate result it should only be a problem if you actually need to output these regexes for other uses or if you need to compile many of them at runtime with performance constraints. If your regexes are pre-compiled then the resulting DFA should look the same as far as I can tell.<p>If somebody makes a Rust crate with a similar concept I&#x27;ll be sure to try it out next time I have to write regexes in a codebase.')
