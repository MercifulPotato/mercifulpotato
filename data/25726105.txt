I think I have read something similar in the distant past but read through it again.<p>&gt; There are [places] on Earth that do have these sharp ventifacts, but we hadn&#x27;t seen them on Mars and we didn&#x27;t test against them<p>This is whats so curious. In their testing on Earth after the fact, they found:<p>&gt; Bedrock with lots of rocks: ~8 kilometers<p>&gt; Lots of rocks, not on bedrock: 13-14 kilometers<p>&gt; Bedrock with few rocks (think flagstones): 30-40 kilometers or more<p>It&#x27;s just very surprising they didn&#x27;t think to test on more varied Earth terrains, looking for worst case scenarios, where they would have clearly found this limitation. It is my understanding that the wheel damage became a major limiting factor of Curiosity&#x27;s mission.')
