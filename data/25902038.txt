Maybe it would be a lot worse if they hadn&#x27;t spent that money, but throwing more money at it and moving up the governance to a higher level likely won&#x27;t make a dent. I&#x27;d imagine local, on the ground officials would have a better shot at it as opposed to state officials.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sf.curbed.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;19&#x2F;21027974&#x2F;san-francisco-homeless-decade-2010s-kositsky-navigation-center-friedenbach" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sf.curbed.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;19&#x2F;21027974&#x2F;san-francisco-home...</a>')
