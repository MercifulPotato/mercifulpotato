A multimedia weather forecast applet written in Java can be scripted by JavaScript to display appropriate images and sounds based on the current weather readings in a region. A server-side JavaScript script might pull data out of a relational database and format it in HTML on the fly. A page might contain JavaScript scripts that run on both the client and the server.<p>We tend to think of JS as having started out as just a way to dynamically show&#x2F;hide elements, maybe add an animation or two, on top of fundamentally HTML-based web pages. But I see here described what we now think of as &quot;web apps&quot;, and even web <i>servers</i> (!) written in JS. They even talk about code-sharing on the front and back ends, a la React in hybrid-mode. I had no idea those things were in people&#x27;s minds at its inception.<p>Edit: Apparently they already ran JS on the server! I had no idea<p>&gt; Netscape LiveWire enables JavaScript programs to be installed, run and managed on Netscape servers')
