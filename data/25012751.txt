I know a language can be great at what it does without generics, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like Go is geared towards being that kind of language.<p>I appreciate how easy it is to write and how incredible the performance is, but I get tired of the style of code it forces you to write. I write a lot of code to reduce the amount of code I need to write. In Go, that&#x27;s not really easy to go or necessarily a good idea because of the lack of generalization.')
