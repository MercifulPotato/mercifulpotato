Not sure what type of sensor it has, but it will react to water vapor. Our master bedroom is right next to the bathroom so showering will cause it to work at its highest setting.<p>Not that it&#x27;s a problem per-se. Just that it doesn&#x27;t really &quot;know&quot; what&#x27;s in the air. So while your cooking may indeed be spewing pollutants everywhere, the fact that the filter is working harder doesn&#x27;t mean the air is bad.<p>That said, humidity needs to be controlled too.<p>What is interesting is, cooking <i>downstairs</i> will set it off. I have two humidity sensors, and they can&#x27;t see any difference. Still the filter will start to work and I can&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s because of water vapor. It some other type of particulate, harmful or not. It&#x27;s getting filtered anyway.')
