Windows is the dominant desktop operating system in China, and I&#x27;d be surprised if the app store wasn&#x27;t censored. Bing search results are definitely censored (they tell you so at the bottom of the page).<p>- Amazon isn&#x27;t selling much that could run afoul of censorship, except possibly books (remember when Amazon used to be an online bookstore?) but in China their market is mostly targeted at the niche of high-end imported goods.
