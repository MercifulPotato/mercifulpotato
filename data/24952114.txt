It&#x27;s longer, contains plot spoilers, and Haldane has more fundamental disagreements with Lewis than Orwell does:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lewisiana.nl&#x2F;haldane&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lewisiana.nl&#x2F;haldane&#x2F;</a><p>I find all of Lewis&#x27;s works somewhat frustrating to read because I think such an obviously skilled writer should have been able to do better. Both Orwell&#x27;s complaint (willingness to compromise the story for ideological ends) and Haldane&#x27;s (attacks on a straw-man version of science as a result of ignorance of the real thing) are IMO correct. That said, Lewis&#x27;s prose is top-notch and many of the individual scenes are great. That Hideous Strength is the best of the Space Trilogy because by that point Lewis has mostly dropped the pretense that he&#x27;s writing scifi. The first two feel derivative of better scifi writers (Lewis acknowledges H. G. Wells and Olaf Stapledon, and I suspect David Lindsay is also an influence), whereas the last is closer to his Narnia series (although aimed at an older audience).')
