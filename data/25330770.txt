Had a handful of small apps I was proud of.<p>But god forbid you step away for 6 to 12 months -- rebuilding my once happy app becomes literally the only thing I&#x27;ll be blowing a day on getting to work again.<p>Often times I&#x27;ll just say fuck it and reinstall Android Studio from scratch.<p>The joy of it all is gone for me.<p>And then on top of all that, you never know when Google will decide your app (that&#x27;s been on the Play store for years) is suddenly in violation of SOMETHING and pulls the plug without an explanation, ignoring appeals. (Had this happen to me a couple times.)<p>With no interest in iOS, and no real alternatives, all that adds up to me eventually retiring from mobile dev in general. Dammed shame, because I had some fun for a while.')
