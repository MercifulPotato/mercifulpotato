Slashdot was pretty much a forum for FOSS. It was already mainstream. And this is 1998 or so. The GNOME team caused <i>massive</i> drama when they started their campaign against Qt (and, thus, KDE) on Slashdot.<p>And on that point, GNOME was a reactionary project. It was not started as a community of people coming together to create <i>good</i> software. It simply wasn&#x27;t. I was there (mostly observing from the Gtk+&#x2F;GIMP side at the horror show). Gnumeric was slapped together in like one day. It was pure 100% trash code. All that CORBA, ORBit, etc. stuff was tossed together. GNOME was a movement that feared KDE would beat them to the &quot;Linux on the desktop&quot;, and their initial versions were designed to play catch-up with KDE&#x27;s feature set. I can&#x27;t overstate how shit early GNOME code was. And then they took to Slashdot to bash the less-than-free Qt because GNOME certainly wasn&#x27;t winning on merit alone.<p>The free software community has been a shitshow for as long as such a thing has existed. Go back to the homebrew movement and see how people reacted to Bill Gates selling proprietary software.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists</a>')
