It&#x27;s worse in cold fusion, cold fusion in palladium is almost feasible, given the low energy barrier for D-D fusion. The setting is quite like the lifetime of the proton, a decaying proton would open up new avenues of theory, unfortunately the next prediction for the half-life is just outside experimental capabilities.<p>Anyway, first thing you do when you see a new paper is check what&#x27;s journal it&#x27;s in. If the journal has a crap reputation you skip it. This paper does nothing to improve the journal&#x27;s standing, so the papers in there must be the usual &quot;nothing new to see here, let&#x27;s all move on&quot; junk.')
