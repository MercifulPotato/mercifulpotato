This also often lead to shipping a single platform&#x27;s UI convention on every platform, for example Material on iOS or iOS patterns and conventions on Android.<p>Poor UX<p>An app&#x27;s UI is more than just how it looks, just as important is how it feels, and if it fits in and feels at home as an app on the platform. Often cross platform solutions generate apps that have slightly &quot;off&quot; UX, such as sluggish interactivity(RN has this this issue), missing gestures(such as backswipe). In general many small cuts that deterioriate the user experience<p>Focus only on the visual<p>The visual representation of an app is only one part of the UI as mentioned above, an obvious other example is accessibility which is often lacking with cross platform tech, especially on iOS. I wrote a whole blog post about how Flutter Web fails[0] in this regard yesterday.<p>Binary size<p>By necessity cross platform solutions reinvent a lot of what the platform already provides which leads to larger binaries(performance is a feature).<p>Performance<p>Ionic for example, runs in a non-JIT(on iOS) enabled webview so can never match the performance of native. React Native runs a JS enging(again no JIT on iOS) which demands more from the device and uses more battery than native in my experience(performance is a feature).<p>In general, cross platform UI works by targetting a lowest common denominator of the platforms which naturally results in a worse experience.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hugotunius.se&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;31&#x2F;flutter-web-a-fractal-of-bad-design.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hugotunius.se&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;31&#x2F;flutter-web-a-fractal-of-ba...</a>')
