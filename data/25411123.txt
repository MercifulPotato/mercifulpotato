I&#x27;m not sure that makes it sound <i>more</i> realistic.<p>Market cap doesn&#x27;t equal actually invested funds, but two dudes swapping one AMZN share for 30k USD doesn&#x27;t actually make AMZNs market cap when other trades are happening at normal prices either. BTC&#x27;s current market price is obviously more subject to manipulation than AMZN, but its price isn&#x27;t dictated by two dudes swapping one BTC at an absurd multiple of what everyone else is willing to sell for either.')
