One  not of those five was 40 minutes away that took 8 days to arrive. I&#x27;ve had stuff sit in post offices so long I had to call to make sure they weren&#x27;t lost. Another item get marked delivered in a different zip code than my own, only when I opened a case was the package thrown on the ground in front of our mail box cluster. I can&#x27;t tell you how many packages marked as delivered only to be delivered the next day.')
