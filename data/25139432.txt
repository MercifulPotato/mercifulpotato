It&#x27;s a model forged by years of experience in the domain.<p>The model has complexities, but they are generally a minimal set necessary necessary to span the domain.<p>At first sniff, new engineers might find the code overengineered. It&#x27;s a Chesterston&#x27;s Fence dilemma. Except, in this circumstance, you have the builder there to explain the fence, and IMO it&#x27;s wrong to assume malfeasance (obfuscating for control), when there are other contributing factors.<p>IME, the way to resolve this ambiguity is paired programming and communication. After the 2nd or 3rd session, the mental model should prove to be transferable or not.')
