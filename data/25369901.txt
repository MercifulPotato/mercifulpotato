Everything they&#x27;ve filed up to this point, seems to either have been hastily put together based on hearsay, or been entirely engineered to postpone state certifications beyond the safe-harbor date (they&#x27;ve all seemingly failed).<p>His administration doesn&#x27;t particularly care for or about Democracy, and they (or their political allies, depending) are grasping at every straw they can find that <i>might</i> be provable in court, and are filing suits.<p>Any actual, deliberate voter fraud would likely be difficult to prove in a court, and committed by individuals at lower levels of the government, largely by unrelated individuals and small groups particularly concerned with the results.<p>An example likely impossible to prove in courts:<p>Richard Hopkins, a USPS mailcarrier came to James O&#x27;Keefe (conservative gotcha journalist), and anonymously asserted his belief that his supervisors had been backdating late ballots so that they could be counted in the Erie PA tally.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;AR_XpJ287Iw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;AR_XpJ287Iw</a><p>After it became clear that the USPS knew he was behind the claims, he did an interview with O&#x27;Keefe, admitting his identity to his identity, and claiming retaliation.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;J-D-2GOswwA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;J-D-2GOswwA</a><p>The FBI opened an investigation to his claims, and did an interview with him that they hadn&#x27;t been aware he was recording.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;QkNkQ2nDQfc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;QkNkQ2nDQfc</a><p>Shortly thereafter, the Washington post ran an article citing three anonymous officials familiar with the investigation that he had wholly recanted his claims.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;postal-worker-fabricated-ballot-pennsylvania&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;10&#x2F;99269a7c-2364-11eb-8599-406466ad1b8e_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;postal-worker-...</a><p>Over the next couple of days, O&#x27;Keefe published the FBI recording, as well as a video of Hopkins denying that he had recanted his claims.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ibU5KVFCg4Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ibU5KVFCg4Y</a><p>By my estimate, none of this can be corroborated. It&#x27;s an individual claim, concerning an activity likely only perpetrated by a small number of people in a manner unlikely to generate a paper trail fit for forensic investigation. In fact, it was included in one of Trump&#x27;s PA lawsuits.<p>As a legal case, this is incredibly flimsy. A snippet of a conversation overheard from the sidelines could never be enough to convict anybody of anything on its own merit. There&#x27;s a reason it wasn&#x27;t successfully brought to court.<p>Nevertheless, the story itself is exceedingly plausible, and doesn&#x27;t depend on a high level conspiracy in order to work.<p>I lean towards believing Hopkins&#x27; integrity, but have no ability to validate whether or not he had enough information to assert things happening as he claims they did with the confidence he has. I find the swiftness of WaPo&#x27;s debunking to be much more interesting.<p>But stories like his are enough to turn the election into a political Rorschach test.<p>These doubts cannot be relieved. They&#x27;ll be as interminable as the &#x27;Obamas a Kenyan&#x27; rumors, the &#x27;Trump&#x27;s a Manchurian Candidate&#x27; narrative, and the &#x27;Hanging Chad&#x27;.<p>Considering how dirty electoral primary processes have become (i.e. treatment of Tulsi, Yang, etc, McConnel&#x27;s primary being marked by the unexptected closure of polling places…), the massive shift to mail-in voting due to covid… this whole bruhaha was inescapable.')
