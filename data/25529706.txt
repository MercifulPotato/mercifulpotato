Even going to linear gamma space seems to hurt.<p>However, it&#x27;s not clear to me why should this be so.  For a given wavelength, I would understand that mixing in physical space would be better, i.e., this may apply to lightness.  Why should it not work better when applied more generically in a perceptual space (Note:  I have worked with displays with more than three primaries), even when pixels are not individually perceptible.')
