Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608939645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25537509, text='&gt; Certified Unix just means you&#x27;ve paid SCO enough money<p>Not SCO, the Open Group. The Open Group is a not-for-profit industry consortium that maintains various standards and conformance programs for those standards, among which POSIX and UNIX are probably the most widely-known.<p>Novell gave the UNIX trademark and test suites to The Open Group; all SCO actually got was the right to sublicense the copyright to the AT&amp;T UNIX software (but not the actual copyright itself). The former is much more important than the later because there are operating systems which pass the test suite (and hence are allowed to use the UNIX trademark) but which aren&#x27;t based on AT&amp;T-derived code (e.g. macOS, z&#x2F;OS, EulerOS)<p>Note that Inspur K-UX you mentioned is no longer a certified  UNIX because the vendor failed to pay the renewal fees. The same is true of Solaris.')
