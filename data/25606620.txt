Others would offer take-out, but there it was up to customers to solve the travel-time problem, so people generally got take-out from nearby restaurants.<p>Now, though, consumers are being offered the food they love delivered to their door, with no hint that it might be a bad idea. I&#x27;m not surprised at all that they are unhappy that the thing they were sold turned out to be disappointing. I agree that if one understands all the logistical, marketplace, and culinary factors, it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to blame the restaurant. But one of the glories of capitalism is that purchasers don&#x27;t have to understand a thing. They just have to have money and a desire.<p>I think the real bad actors here are the delivery companies here, not the consumers. The delivery companies are selling something they really can&#x27;t deliver. It shouldn&#x27;t be up to consumers to figure all this out on an order-by-order basis.')
