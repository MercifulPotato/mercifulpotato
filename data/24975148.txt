Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=[24975202], score=None, time=1604364219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24973748, text='&gt; I think women from cultures where the fairer sex are considered historically ‘submissive’ would have dealt with this entirely differently.<p>It&#x27;s pretty much all human culture. It&#x27;s probably a trait inherited from our pre-human ancestors. After all, our closest primate, the chimps, also have male dominant social order.<p>&gt; Women who are not surrounded&#x2F;supported by their ‘sisterhood’ or female ‘tribe’ often get exploited by men.<p>Oh boy here we go again. Sure there are exploitation by men, but the vast majority of exploitation of women are by other women. There is no magical &quot;sisterhood&quot;.<p>&gt; Experience. Other women know. They share. They talk. They gossip. Guidance.<p>Or gossip, exclusion, rumors, destroying reputations, bullying, etc. Eating disorder, self-image issues, cutting, self-harm, etc are mostly female on female violence.<p>&gt; I am always suspicious of men who try to isolate their girl from female company.<p>Female company? No. You should be suspicious of men or women who try to isolate a girl or a boy from their parents&#x2F;siblings&#x2F;friends. Most women recruited for prostitution, cults, MLMs, etc are by &quot;female company&quot;.<p>&gt; Children are a burden.<p>They are a responsibility.<p>&gt; the female uterus is severely undervalued.<p>As opposed to the male uterus?<p>&gt; As is the value of progeny.. by men.. it is the vessel for half their genetic material and their only way to leave a meaningful biological legacy.<p>Seems more like you are devaluing the value of men?<p>&gt; So until we can grow little humans in pods, women must make men pay their due for carrying their genetic material and delivering it as viable life forms or deny them the opportunity to leave behind a genetic legacy.<p>You are essentially saying women&#x27;s only value is procreation. So if we can grow little humans in a pod, wouldn&#x27;t women have no value then?<p>Also, men protect the women, provide shelter, food, etc. You make it seem like women do all the work. Stop basing your reality off of silly netflix series.<p>Honestly, what&#x27;s the difference between people like you and white supremacists. Just change race with gender and I don&#x27;t see a difference. Of course this kind of flamewar and disinformation nonsense is welcomed all over social media.')
