This is really incomparable to anything else on the market, x86 or ARM, so its hard to say how this will impact performance, but it may help alleviate the need for a larger cache.<p>I think its pretty clear that Apple has something special here when we&#x27;re quibbling about the cache and power draw per core differences of a 10 watt chip versus a 100 watt one; its missing the bigger picture that Apple did this <i>at 10 watts</i>. They&#x27;re so far beyond their own class, and the next two above it, that we&#x27;re frantically trying to explain it as anything except alien technology by drawing comparisons to chips which require power supplies the size of sixteen iPhones. Even if they were just short of mobile i9 performance (they&#x27;re not), this would still be a massive feat of engineering worthy of an upgrade.')
