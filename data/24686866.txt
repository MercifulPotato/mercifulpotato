I found early on while having to work with perforce and using timelapse view (git blame but with a nice gui) that lots of intermediary commits like this generate enough noise to discourage even the most determined sleuth from using commit history to solve a crime.<p>Well scoped and well sized commits, squashed, and in my personal preference rebased, provide a commit history that&#x27;s segregated on actual tickets&#x2F;stories&#x2F;features&#x2F;fixes that I find are navigatable very far back.<p>I&#x27;d say squash usage is very much case by case. But yeah equating a feature like squash to large commits is a fallacy. It&#x27;s a useful tool imo that can be misused, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the tool is &quot;bad&quot;.')
