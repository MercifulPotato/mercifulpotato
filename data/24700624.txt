His Transducers.jl [1] is really interesting and powerful and lately he&#x27;s done a lot of work with things like FLoops.jl [2] and ThreadsX.jl [3] to try and bring the benefits of transducers to more &#x27;regular&#x27; familiar representations so more people can enjoy the benefits. The basic idea behind all of it is that he has an efficient and modular way of describing various &#x27;looping&#x27; constructs that can be stuck together, optimized and parallelized automatically.<p>It&#x27;d be quite interesting to see this stuff extended to GPUs.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaFolds&#x2F;Transducers.jl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaFolds&#x2F;Transducers.jl</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaFolds&#x2F;FLoops.jl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaFolds&#x2F;FLoops.jl</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tkf&#x2F;ThreadsX.jl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tkf&#x2F;ThreadsX.jl</a>')
