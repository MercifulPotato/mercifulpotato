I&#x27;ve done everything people recommend, stretches, PT, rolfing (which is great to be honest) etc. I was and am currently in great shape and stretch for 30-60 minutes a day. The only thing I&#x27;ve ever found to work for bad days is over the counter 8mg Codeine tablets you can get in Canada. I can&#x27;t get them in the US or even for a doctor to consider it, they&#x27;re terrified of prescribing pain medicine. Because of Covid I haven&#x27;t been able to go to Canada for a while and I&#x27;m worried what will happen in the next few months. The over reaction to opioid abuse and other people abusing the system has really punished people with chronic pain. I have friends who have been on opioids of pain management, veterans, getting cut off cold turkey by their physicians.')
