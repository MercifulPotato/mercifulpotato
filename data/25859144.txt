Dozens of websites promise tickets, only to tack on random fees, suddenly increase the price, or (most popular) randomly fail at the last step. The official airline website will make you pay at least $30 more than the next alternative, and there&#x27;s no guarantee that it&#x27;ll be any better&#x2F;more reliable either - but if you book through a third party, you&#x27;ll be extra-screwed if something goes wrong.<p>The airport comes second. You spend at least 30 minutes if you&#x27;re super lucky and know the airport rushing through a crowded, annoying environment, often while carrying stuff, having either tight deadlines or a mind-numbing wait at the end, and until you reach your gate you may be forced to wait but never in a way that you could use the time productively.<p>Also, you need to get rid of your water, then re-acquire water after security, while carrying your hand luggage (because checked bags now cost money).<p>The flight itself, once I&#x27;ve stowed my luggage, settled into a seat, and set up my tablet? I don&#x27;t care. I can sit and watch movies for <i>hours</i>. I&#x27;m even doing it voluntarily at home!')
