Item(by='Arnavion', descendants=None, kids=[24964469], score=None, time=1604251562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24958821, text='&gt;It&#x27;s not just ISPs, can&#x27;t we arbitrarily nest networks?<p>You really don&#x27;t want to have subnets smaller than &#x2F;64. It&#x27;s not worth it.<p>If you do have smaller subnets, all the subnets that together make up the &#x2F;64 must be configured to share NDP messages with each other, this is called NDP proxying. But again, the point is IPv6 is specifically designed so that routing stops at the &#x2F;64 level and uses NDP after that. So don&#x27;t make subnets smaller than &#x2F;64.<p>&gt;And you might foreseeably desire privacy on one of these interior LANs. Or perhaps your ISP is abusive and you can&#x27;t switch for some reason. I dunno.<p>If you want multiple subnets, ask your ISP to give you a larger block than a &#x2F;64. They are likely to do so. In the US you have anywhere from tunnelbroker giving you a &#x2F;48 if you want, to residential ISPs giving you at least a &#x2F;60 if not a &#x2F;56 if your router asks for it.<p>&gt;At what point (if any) will a scheme relying on NDP begin to break down due to collisions becoming unacceptably expensive to resolve?<p>NDP is just ICMP messages. It doesn&#x27;t scale with the number of devices like opening a new TCP connection with every other device on the subnet or something. You broadcast a message and wait for a response. Every time a new device connects to a subnet it has to use NDP to find the router. In the same way every time a device chooses a new SLAAC (privacy extensions) IP, it has to use NDP to find a collision. Every device on the subnet is getting every NDP packet anyway, because that&#x27;s how subnets work.<p>&gt;Or is the algorithm behind NDP so robust that it will work right up until the network is completely full, with every last available address in active use?<p>Thinking of edge cases is fine, but this edge case requires having 200 trillion (2^48, 2.8E14) devices on a single subnet. It&#x27;s very unrealistic.')
