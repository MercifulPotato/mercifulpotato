The workplace is always political. It can not be politicized in the sense of changing from apolitical to political.<p>&quot;Politicized&quot; has to mean then that political conflict has escalated or the political dimension of the workplace has become more visible.<p>In this sense what politicization of the workplace is intended to lead to is political change, that is, a change associated with the decision making in groups, or change in other forms of power relations between individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status.<p>&gt; If you disagree with the shared goal then why join in the first place?<p>Political conflict in the workplace is in the vast majority of cases not like this. When thinking &quot;politics in the workplace&quot;, the typical issues are around worker safety, worker compensation and benefits, the status of lgbt employees, or sexism.<p>A little while ago Github employees protested the involvement of their company with the ICE department of the USA government. In that case, could you simply say to the protesting employees, &quot;Well, you must just disagree with the shared goal of the company and so you should quit&quot;. I think it&#x27;s obvious that would be a ridiculous response given the complaints of the employees.')
