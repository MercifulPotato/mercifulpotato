When it asked for a phone number I gave a throwaway. Turns out they verify you have control of the number, so next I tried some VoIP digits. Facebook knows which blocks are owned by the larger VoIP companies and requested a _real_ phone number this time. So...I went out and bought a damned phone so that I&#x27;d have a phone number to make this bloody account. I verified that I could make and receive calls and started their registration flow again to be blocked by some other kind of BS (I think they thought the number was still in a VoIP block...guess that misfeature isn&#x27;t perfect?). Anyway, it wasn&#x27;t thaat important to me, so I gave up and haven&#x27;t tried again since.')
