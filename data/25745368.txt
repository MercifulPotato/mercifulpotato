Dutch people do know that the extent of their bike lanes and infrastructure is incredible.<p>Yet you will find many Dutchmen in this thread, including the comment you&#x27;re replying to, that express that this is the first time in their lives they&#x27;ve given it thought.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve only seen the new &#x27;megafietsenstalling&#x27; at Den Haag Centraal train station complained about because 8000 bike parking spaces was not ambitious enough and is not expected to be enough space. And yet, it&#x27;s the second largest in the world after Utrecht (also in the Netherlands).<p>One of the many reasons I favor the skateboard over the bicycle â€” it joins me in the train.<p>&gt; At a comparable train station in London, you would be lucky to find 10 bike parking spaces.<p>Well I have never been at a London train station. I&#x27;ve been at Belgian, German, and French ones, and I did not notice any particular difference that stood out.')
