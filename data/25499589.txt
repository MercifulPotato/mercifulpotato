It&#x27;s <i>explicitly</i> multimodal.  We estimate material distribution of baryonic matter by measuring light output as a proxy and then derive their presumed gravitational effects by observing their motions, which is a totally different method.  Now you can argue that those estimates are poor, but it&#x27;s categorically different from dark matter, where there is only one measurement that drives both its distribution and its presumed effects.<p>&gt; More importantly, dark matter also elegantly explains the behavior of other massive objects, like galaxy clusters, which MOND struggles with...<p>This is a bit like saying a seventh-order polynomial adjustment to this 1st order fit &quot;elegantly&quot; explains these data points, so we should throw out the 2nd order fit because it makes us question the 1st order law we started working with.')
