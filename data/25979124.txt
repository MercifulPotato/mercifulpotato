It&#x27;s like saying furniture is worthless because there are so many trees, or music doesn&#x27;t exist because air is all around us.<p>A diamond isn&#x27;t just any stone, it&#x27;s a stone that has been selected for its visual qualities and cut by an expert craftsman. It&#x27;s a beautiful human artifact.<p>Sure, there is no fundamental reason to associate diamonds and &quot;love&quot;, and the whole diamonds politics are horrifying -- but that doesn&#x27;t mean diamonds aren&#x27;t interesting or fascinating.')
