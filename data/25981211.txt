Item(by='throwaway8581', descendants=None, kids=[25981747], score=None, time=1612117876, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25980156, text='The article doesn&#x27;t really get it right. This is what the UCC actually says:<p><i>(2) Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as:\n(a) Pass without objection in the trade under the contract description; and\n(b) In the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality within the description; and\n(c) Are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used; and\n(d) Run, within the variations permitted by the agreement, of even kind, quality and quantity within each unit and among all units involved; and\n(e) Are adequately contained, packaged and labeled as the agreement may require; and\n(f) Conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label if any.</i><p>Here is what the official comments to the UCC say:<p><i>Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2) are to be read together. Both refer, as indicated above, to the standards of that line of the trade which fits the transaction and the seller&#x27;s business. “Fair average” is a term directly appropriate to agricultural bulk products and means goods centering around the middle belt of quality, not the least or the worst that can be understood in the particular trade by the designation, but such as can pass “without objection.” Of course a fair percentage of the least is permissible but the goods are not “fair average” if they are all of the least or worst quality possible under the description. In cases of doubt as to what quality is intended, the price at which a merchant closes a contract is an excellent index of the nature and scope of his obligation under the present section.</i><p>So if you understand (a) and (b) in unison, it means that you can&#x27;t sell someone a lot of goods but then send them all below-average quality units. But, of course, a truck load of apples can still have a &quot;fair percentage&quot; of low-quality apples. Where you&#x27;re selling a single item, like a computer, then (a) is the better lens of looking at it.<p>None of this is legal advice. I&#x27;m not your lawyer.')
