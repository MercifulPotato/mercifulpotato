In fact, PoW is _worse_ than PoS in this regard, because PoW has economies of scale (if someone with a $100k investment earns $10k&#x2F;year, someone with a $100m investment can earn significantly more than $10m&#x2F;year). PoS on the other hand is much closer to a clean &quot;what you earn is proportional to what you put in&quot; design, which is realistically the best that you can do in an anonymous system where users can generate as many independent identities as they want.<p>&gt; can only be made secure against a maximum of ⅓ byzantine actors, compared to Proof of Work&#x27;s superior ½.<p>This is also not true. The 1&#x2F;3 bound is for safety-under-asynchrony (a form of safety for which PoW&#x27;s security margin is <i>zero</i>). If you assume synchrony, then PoS protocols&#x27; safety approaches 50% much like PoW does. Protocols like Casper FFG combine the &quot;best of both worlds&quot;, giving you both of those security guarantees (50% BFT if the network is good, 33% BFT if the network is terrible) at the same time.')
