In this case the light is coming into front lens elements, and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be corrected for distortion, and then not uniformly focused onto the surface of the camera&#x27;s sensor.  Potentially this was for a Imax dome.<p>So, no, this doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with smart phones.<p>In ye&#x27; olde times, induced background blur would have been a gaussian blur in software.  I&#x27;m not sure what special magic they do today. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2006.05698" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2006.05698</a> suggests things have moved on.')
