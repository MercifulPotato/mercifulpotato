Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611856463, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25945524, text='That was a slightly squared steering wheel, allowing all the positions of the hands on it. The one in the article pictures look like they allow a single position of the hands, being basically 2 handles. A sharp turn implies taking one hand off the corresponding handle and crossing it with the other hand to grab the bottom of the yoke. So hand over hand or shuffle steering aren&#x27;t convenient at all, if even possible, on such a yoke.<p>Finding yourself in an emergency situation grasping at thin air because there&#x27;s no continuous wheel to grab seems dangerous.<p>P.S. Seems like all the stalks are &quot;touch buttons on the yoke&quot;. Which is unfortunate.')
