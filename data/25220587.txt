Admitting bias now, I was surprised to see Java winning by a &quot;hair&#x27;s breadth&quot; in certain cases, with certain entries.<p>Later, talking to a PhD in CS who wrote their thesis on graph-analysis of code conditions for JIT optimization, I found out that Java put a lot of excellent computer science into the problem, and that works very well.  As alluded to in a different comment, the response times in both camps were appproaching the physical limits of the hardware, apparently.  I had to recalibrate my expectations, since I thought that C++ would certainly win without fail.')
