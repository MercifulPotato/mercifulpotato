And I really get the convenience of streaming over having to manually sync files with your devices, which is also why I&#x27;ve been mirrorring my collection with a Subsonic instance on my VPS for years, which means that I can stream my music from anywhere.<p>I know that this is not a solution that is viable to 99% of people who just want the convenience without the technical hassle. However, I think it&#x27;s really sad that things turned out to become a dichotomy between owning and renting your music instead of a choice between managing your collection yourself vs. having someone else host it for you. I will claim that many people, if asked, would prefer to own their own music and be free to move from one hosted platform to another if they so desire, and not be limited to buy their music from a single provider. It would also result in a healthier market.')
