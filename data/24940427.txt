If we eliminated drug patents, it doesn&#x27;t eliminate medicine research because that&#x27;s happening independently of profit motive (though still not necessarily independent of funding motive). It just eliminates the monopolization of medicine. Pharmaceutical companies could still make a profit because they&#x27;d still be important for manufacturing the drugs and could charge a markup for it. And since they wouldn&#x27;t be paying for the patents and any pharmaceutical company could compete with any other, it could lower the cost to the consumer.')
