The available evidence is that the 737 Max did not meet the certification requirements for force vs pitch. As such no amount of extra training would have sufficed to make it a certifiable aircraft.<p>I appreciate that Boeing themselves have made this difficult by their PR line that MCAS makes it fly like other 737s. If you have ever been involved in something like this being managed in the public perception you&#x27;ll understand this is pretty typical of how technical issues are dumbed down for public consumption. In this case it also happens to be technically correct, in that other 737s have certifiable behaviour in this flight regime, so MCAS makes it fly more like them.')
