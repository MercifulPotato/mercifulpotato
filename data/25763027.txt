[many details] ... You can disagree about gay marriage but realize that there are definitely things gay couples should have in a legal sense too; hospital visitation rights as one. A lot really was uncertainty about metaphysical and philosophical ideas I think.<p>Good points. I am glad you thought about it, even if you came to different conclusions than I would have.<p>&gt; But all you had to do to shut all that down was to accuse me of homophobia and bigotry.<p>To state the obvious: I never accused you of that.<p>I&#x27;m not stating the obvious to be confrontational; I&#x27;m saying it because I&#x27;ve heard this argument frequently from people I know that disagree with my politically.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve met thoughtful people that feel attacked because they want to think through issues rather than jump on a bandwagon. I am very glad they are being thoughtful and see nuance in the issues.<p>So here is what I hope to learn: I&#x27;d like to know why <i>you</i> feel this way. Do you <i>personally</i> think that someone like <i>me</i>, perhaps from a different political philosophy, is judging you (as opposed to the underlying ideas)?<p>(I have some guesses, but I would rather not speculate.)')
