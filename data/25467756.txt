The amount of negativity for some aspects is very wierd, especially when you compare it to the other years blockbuster: Call of Duty Cold War.<p>CoD features an all white male cast, there&#x27;s no whiff of female or LGBTQ representation. It&#x27;s also horrifyingly xenophobic and repaints the history in a grossly nationalistic manner. Those were all issues that were brought up in connection to Cyberpunk even though that game is significantly less horrible in every aspect.<p>And yet somehow that wasn&#x27;t a problem for CoD at all when dishing out ratings.')
