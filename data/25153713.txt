I pay for YouTube premium but find YouTube slow and buggy most of time. YouTube&#x27;s latest app often break existing functionality. And all features of YouTube premium are available in other free YouTube apps too where you pay nothing.<p>I pay for YouTube premium because it&#x27;s only 120â‚¹(2$) in my country and I like to spend a lot of time on YouTube, a lot more than Twitch or Netflix or any other streaming app.<p>As such I am in favour of this move it it means that YouTube will perform better but I am not sure anymore.')
