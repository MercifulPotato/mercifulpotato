I ordered this toaster[1]. When I received it I noticed that in their user manual they were offering a &quot;gift&quot; in return for an Amazon review. Although to be fair they didn&#x27;t explicitly demand that the review had to be positive. I submitted this 4-star review [2] to Amazon:<p><i>I received the toaster not too long ago. It looks just like in the advertised pictures and works fine. But the language on the last page of the user manual (see picture) makes it clear that LOFTER is offering customers a &quot;gift&quot; in return for leaving a review. Perhaps they&#x27;re within their right to do that but it makes me not trust the rest of the reviews on this product.</i><p>A few days later I got an email from Amazon identical to the one in the submitted blog post[3]. I&#x27;ve stopped trusting positive reviews on Amazon. These days I only look at the negative reviews to see if there&#x27;s a consistent complaint about the product.<p>[1] www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07S3TXD9H&#x2F;\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cutt.ly&#x2F;lhLZQ5o" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cutt.ly&#x2F;lhLZQ5o</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cutt.ly&#x2F;JhLZTjZ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cutt.ly&#x2F;JhLZTjZ</a>')
