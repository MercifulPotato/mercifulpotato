For example, if the &quot;full patent&quot; includes 10 pages of explanatory text, and 10 drawings, and the provisional patent application filed by the inventor only contains 1 paragraph of explanation, and 1 drawing, aspects of the &quot;full patent&quot; might not be apble to claim priority to (or be suported by)the provisional application.')
