There is a trend in HN comments to remind people that a company is a collection of people. Google is a collection of people. There are those of us who care deeply about privacy at Google.<p>First: it&#x27;s interesting talking with googlers or reading their thoughts on how Google does ads and data collection. Many people definitely feel the same way as commenters on HN feel. Lots of people are torn on the fact that ads lets us build lots of other cool products for people. I would say this helps motivate other teams, like cloud, do you find other revenue sources for the company so you don&#x27;t have to be as dated collection focused.<p>Second: I have seen googlers fight the privacy of users even within my division (payments). Many of us want to do right by our users, and be as privacy focused as we are capable given our constraints. We also know there is a general thought that Google is data collection focused, and one slip up will cause a big drama out on the internet and in the news (Google would likely receive more scrutiny here than some other companies). This helps remind us that we need to treat user data as best we can and minimize what we do collect.')
