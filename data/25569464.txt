It just happens to be better than the others we&#x27;ve tried at scale so far-- including attempting to give everyone the same opportunities regardless of ability.  What else is being described there, if not communism?  What am I missing?<p>The real underlying problem is that we are strongly predisposed to naturally arrange into hierarchies.  That&#x27;s not something you&#x27;re going to take out of people.  When you try, they spontaneously form their own.  In a system where you say you&#x27;re giving everyone equal opportunity, people will still pursue acquiring power over others, and will try to hold on to it when they get it.  We aren&#x27;t likely to stop this behavior, and if we do, at that point I&#x27;d argue we would essentially be a different species.')
