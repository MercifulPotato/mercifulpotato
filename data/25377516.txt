The idea is: when a CME of sufficient scale is detected, all switchyards and substations go open a bit before impact (CME ions travel sub-c, so we have between 6 and 10 hours notice). There is a 2-3 hour worldwide blackout, after which we close circuits again.<p>There are several unsolved problems, such as, how do we dump  surplus generation, particularly from nuclear reactors (you can SCRAM a reactor instantly, but you&#x27;re not bringing it back up anytime soon), while retaining the ability to spin back up quickly?  In what order do we disconnect and reconnect? Etc<p>As for satellites, I&#x27;m not sure. You need long antennas to induce the currents needed to destroy things, which is why the grid is far more vulnerable than, say, cars (contrary to the &quot;cars don&#x27;t run&quot; narrative of prepper fiction) Maybe they get through just fine, maybe we lose and have to relaunch a lot of orbital assets? Not sure on this one.')
