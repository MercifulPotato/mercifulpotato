One can easily increase readability of such code by adding comments but one can&#x27;t get performance, stability and flexibility by writing comments.<p>Optimising for dummies just because code is easier to debug isn&#x27;t a good idea, often times I have to debug easy looking code only to find that it&#x27;s not that easy in execution as it was in reading. Simple code often doesn&#x27;t handle all the edge cases, abstraction less code is harder to maintain and change, easy code can&#x27;t evolve and grow with business needs.<p>It&#x27;s only when code is unreadable, buggy and slow that it starts to become a real mess.<p>Also a shout out to Rich Hickey&#x27;s distinction between easy and simple, creating simple code requires a lot more effort and thought and is not easy to just read and modify by dummies.')
