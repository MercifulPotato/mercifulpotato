There was nobody on the streets, hardly anybody shopping.  Within a month you noticed more people on the streets, by 6 months, traffic was 75% of what it was before Covid.<p>You can&#x27;t expect people to put their lives on hold indefinitely, especially people at low risk.  I know that in Canada 20-30 year olds accounted for the vast majority of new cases.  They were just willing to take a chance.<p>And even though these two vaccines look promising, you won&#x27;t get a significant number of people vaccinated until the second half of 2021.  That&#x27;s another 7-8 months away.<p>Reminds me of that movie scene in Apocalypse Now when they are getting mortared on the beach while trying to surf - &quot;The tide doesn&#x27;t come in for six hours, do you want to wait here for six hours?&quot; - Lt.
