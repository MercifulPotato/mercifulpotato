POSIX is worded such that a system with no durability can be compliant.<p>&gt; It is explicitly intended that a null implementation is permitted. This could be valid in the case where the system <i>cannot assure non-volatile storage under any circumstances</i> or when the system is highly fault-tolerant and the functionality is not required. In the middle ground between these extremes, fsync() <i>might or might not</i> actually cause data to be written where it is safe from a power failure. The conformance document should identify at least that one configuration exists (and how to obtain that configuration) where this can be assured for at least some files that the user can select to use for critical data. It is not intended that an exhaustive list is required, but rather sufficient information is provided so that if critical data needs to be saved, the user can determine how the system is to be configured to allow the data to be written to non-volatile storage.<p>Again, the way the normative language you quoted above is written makes it abundantly clear (for a standard) that fsync doing anything is entirely optional.')
