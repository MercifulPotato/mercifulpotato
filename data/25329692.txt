I&#x27;m sure the art would change quite a bit if charging to listen to a song was no longer practical.<p>Though I&#x27;m unconvinced that music would disappear. I can think of many kinds of musicians that do not get compensated per se: small time streamers, buskers, student musicians, garage bands, amateur music clubs, and religious music leaders off the top of my head.<p>To reiterate, I think it&#x27;s fair for someone to ask for compensation for providing entertainment. Also I think considerate people will respect the wishes of creators in consuming content.<p>But bottom line, I don&#x27;t think people have natural rights to a particular business model or to control the expression of others (which is fundamental to copyright). Creators do have legal rights, but that&#x27;s a whole other set of issues.')
