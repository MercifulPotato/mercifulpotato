His documentary on the emergence of Islamic terrorism for eg is quite eye opening. It takes people through how some of the ideological progenitors were tortured in jails by US backed dictatorships. How they were armed and funded indirectly by the CIA and US backed regimes. And how the existence of these radicals was then used by the neocons to wage two destructive wars that are partly responsible for America’s stagnation.<p>The problem is the length. If he cut the length by 50 % the problem would be solved.<p>I think his documentaries show how complex the causes of some things are.')
