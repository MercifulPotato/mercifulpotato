Full stop.</i><p>Governments (or, more accurately, human beings acting under color of law) deciding to assassinate people is morally reprehensible, regardless of how the targeting is done.<p>If &quot;private company&quot; and &quot;ML&quot; are the keywords it takes to get people outraged about assassination programs, I&#x27;m fine with that, but let&#x27;s make sure we know why we&#x27;re upset.<p>This is premeditated murder, and throwing around terms like &quot;insurgent&quot; and &quot;rules of engagement&quot; are just a way of legitimizing premeditated murder.')
