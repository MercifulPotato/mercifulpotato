(I&#x27;m not super familiar with TLS server side APIs, I know there are client callbacks for certificate validation).<p>It would probably be wise to do the check carefully so as to not consume too many resources. A well thought out mechanism could trigger an external process for notification or even automatic renewal - even when needing to cross a privilege boundary, perhaps touching a file or an IPC message.<p>I think this would be slightly better than some of the current setups for things like Let&#x27;s Encrypt that end up running many times unnecessarily. Would be a much better fit for resource constrained embedded devices.<p>[edited: added back a sentence I inadvertently removed]')
