The first indicator was gesturing towards IntelliJ IDEA as an example of a good desktop app.  And whaddaya know, it turns out the author is affiliated.  This isn&#x27;t to say there&#x27;s any intentional deception here—it&#x27;s somewhere between self-deception and simply being unaware of one&#x27;s own blindspots.<p>Without going through the effort of installing and running it, it&#x27;s easy to see that IDEA looks just as good as it did 5 years ago—which is to say not great.  And without any evidence saying otherwise, it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that it hasn&#x27;t gotten any more lightweight or nimble since then, either.<p>People writing JVM apps who tout their quality never seem to understand that their firsthand experience does not translate to other machine&#x2F;system configurations that other people are running.  It very well may be the case that those apps look and feel <i>worse</i> than an Electron app.  (And one doesn&#x27;t have to be a fan of Electron apps to admit this.)')
