I assumed that the number of goals from each team is given by a Poisson process. Then, I used the largest market (Win&#x2F;Lose&#x2F;Draw) to estimate this parameter. With this information I could estimate the &quot;fair&quot; odds of more exotics bets (like e.g. team A will score 3 goals more than team B), which were often mispriced, and then use the Kelly criterion to estimate how much to bet.<p>All in all a nice project, but... at the very end -just before deploying the bot- I realised that the BetFair Exchange is not open to Germans, so I wrote a blog post and open sourced the code. Still, a nice learning opportunity :-)')
