Currently (well, pre-pandemic), my work laptop just moved from being docked on my desk at home to being docked on my desk at work. Sometimes I take it off the desk at home to watch Netflix or sit on the couch, but if you&#x27;re doing anything memory-intensive, the battery dies pretty quickly. I&#x27;d much rather have the battery life and weight of an iPad, if I&#x27;m not losing too much functionality (obviously a huge caveat, and the reason why I haven&#x27;t gone all-in on any of the cloud-based IDE options yet), and I&#x27;d also rather have most of my stuff in a cloud somewhere, so if I lose or break a computer, I don&#x27;t lose all my stuff.')
