Item(by='segfaultbuserr', descendants=None, kids=[25208050], score=None, time=1606297752, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25207221, text='&gt;&gt; trying to make a plane that looks like all the planes designed by humans [..] I&#x27;m sorry that&#x27;s not a task you consider interesting<p>&gt; Trying to create text that looks like text written by humans? Is that really what GPT-3 is designed to do?<p>My understanding is, it&#x27;s designed to attempt to &quot;understand&quot; the inner structure of text written by humans, and to create new text using the same structure based on its &quot;understanding&quot;. &quot;Understanding&quot; is only defined as the creation of a probabilistic model - it doesn&#x27;t &quot;understand&quot; any meaning, only the structure of sentences and paragraphs, Yet, such a mindless machinary can demonstrate a wide range of interesting behaviors.<p>Using the plane analogy: If you feed the airplanes designed by humans throughout history into GPT-3, GPT-3 is able to produce an original design of convincingly-looking airplanes of all nationalities and types. For example, if you say &quot;1960, turboprop, Britain&quot;, it gives you one, and it&#x27;s also capable of mixing things, such as putting a jet engine on a biplane, or designing a hypothetical WW2 Allies plane using Axis military technology. If you are lucky, some of the planes come with semi-functional systems. Some might be able to ignite its engine before it explodes, and few are even capable of taking off before it explodes (and some are unable to take off, but if you put them in the mid-air, it may be able to travel for one minute before it explodes). And it&#x27;s all done under unsupervised learning, and without any domain-specific knowledge on Newtonian mechanics, aerodynamics or aviation. All it needs is an astronomical number of blueprints collection.<p>To me it&#x27;s an impressive achievement, even if it doesn&#x27;t understand how to design airplanes.')
