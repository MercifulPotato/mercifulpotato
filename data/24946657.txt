Item(by='shoemakersteve', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604090297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24942391, text='I think I see where you&#x27;re coming from, in that you&#x27;re allowed to have knowledge of other people, and most of the time it&#x27;s perfectly innocuous. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a very fair comparison. There&#x27;s a pretty big difference between just happening upon some information (that you would likely immediately forget because it&#x27;s not important), and actively seeking out and extracting information, often combining it with more information from different sources, saving it to a &quot;profile&quot; associated with you, and often sharing it with third parties, all without your knowledge or consent.<p>You seem to be implying that there&#x27;s no difference between having a single piece of harmless information about someone, and having lots of personal and&#x2F;or intimate knowledge of them, especially if they aren&#x27;t the ones having given it to you, and even more so if you&#x27;re strangers.')
