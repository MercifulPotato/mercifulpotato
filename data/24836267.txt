Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603194614, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24835684, text='&gt;  The thing with google groups is, it&#x27;s not really a walled garden -- it&#x27;s just a mailing lis<p>Yes and no.  It&#x27;s not much of a mailing list for the people without Google accounts who couldn&#x27;t figure out how to subscribe after Google made the documentation for doing that hard to find (they used to have a decent page about it that was removed).  That&#x27;s quite different from other mailing lists.<p>Thus the anecdote about someone who asked how to subscribe, which was solved by a group admin manually subscribing them.  I&#x27;m certain we lost a number of other people who didn&#x27;t want to bother an admin enough to ask for help, and just gave up.<p>What we found over time is, eventually, a lot of the people reading the group thought it was a forum, and either posted via the Google Groups web interface (never using email), or didn&#x27;t post (and therefore interact) because clicking the Post button took them to the Google login&#x2F;signup page, and that put some of them off.<p>&gt; Anything is a mess if you need to keep track of lots of events. Has Facebook figured out how to make calendars non-confusing?<p>I find Meetup ok for this, because I can see in chronological order what I found interesting today and in the next week or so.  It tells me what&#x27;s the next event I signed up to.  And I can see a good selection in chronological order that I might like to take an interest in, because I signed up to a bunch of groups.<p>Facebook events also seems to be ok if you are only ever invited to very few events on it, as I am.  I still miss them because I only login about once every 2 months these days :-)')
