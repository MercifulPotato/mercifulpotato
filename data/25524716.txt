If the interviewer is asking questions that the candidate knows the answer to the interviewer is literally doing it wrong. It&#x27;s not a trivia challenge, and the interviewer should only ask questions that they are confident the candidate hasn&#x27;t ever seen before. That&#x27;s not to say that Leetcode-style preparation doesn&#x27;t work, but it works by tricking the interviewer into thinking that the candidate has solved the problem very quickly, when in fact the candidate actually already knew the solution.')
