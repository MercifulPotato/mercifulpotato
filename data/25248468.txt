Just as an example: frequent self testing. Incorporating this into my studies more intentionally has helped me learn quicker.<p>I&#x27;m highly motivated and self-driven. This course isn&#x27;t about motivation. It&#x27;s about how we learn and how best to take advantage of that.<p>But I will say that knowing how the brain works and how we learn has motivated me to change my study habits.
