Iâ€™ve also noticed libraries branching into other services that fit their mission. The library in Glendale, CA, for example, has a maker space with a publicly accessible 3d printer. Things like that, that are educational, and have public value but a high capital cost of entry for individuals, are a great fit for libraries. There are even libraries where you can check out hand tools and the like.')
