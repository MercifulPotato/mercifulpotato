A &quot;seal of quality&quot; granted by HN users or simply a measure of how interesting a post appears to the HN crowd? It&#x27;s probably the latter. Hard to make judgments about the general quality of the post by vote counts alone.\nAt least HN is not like the YouTube trending section where a lot of clickbaity videos appear. \nYou will encounter titles like:<p>&quot;I ate nothing for 1 hour and this is what happened&quot;\n&quot;I bought $200,000 worth of bananas and now I&#x27;m broke (and sad, lost in an island full of monkeys barely scraping by)&quot;\n &quot;You won&#x27;t believe this happened&quot;\n&quot;Do this one trick (and waste 10 min of your time)&quot;\n &quot;I almost got killed&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sure you even encountered fancier ones, but these are what came off the top of my head.<p>How to get people hooked on our site long enough and make them watch ads? That&#x27;s YouTube for you. HN is quite different and thank goodness it is.')
