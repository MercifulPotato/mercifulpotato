It&#x27;s just that graphics tech has only recently gotten powerful enough to pull it off, but it&#x27;s still expensive. It&#x27;ll come down in price and get better in quality, while probably staying relatively small due to the setups needed. It&#x27;s just like any high-end gaming setups. Most people are fine with simple gaming on their phone (Angry Birds or whatever is popular these days), some want consoles, some want powerful PCs, some are satisfied with Oculus Quest type VR devices, and some want <i>quite</i> powerful PCs for VR. VR is growing way too slowly and steadily to really characterize as &quot;hype&quot;.')
