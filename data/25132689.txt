Item(by='jjav', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605668106, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121416, text='I&#x27;ve never shied away from embracing complexity in trade of more power and&#x2F;or flexibility wherever it brings me value.<p>I run UNIXen as my desktops (Linux, Solaris, BSDs) even if it takes more understanding and tinkering than OS X, because in the end it&#x27;s more powerful. I run my own email infrastructure instead of giving it up to gmail, because it&#x27;s more flexible and powerful and I&#x27;m in control. And so on.<p>But git? What a curse it is. I identify with the comments that liken it to hazing. A lot of pain to be inducted into the club, just for the sake of pain. No gain.<p>I&#x27;ve been using source control systems for many decades and all of them have been tools that provide their value without being intrusive. Never have I had to fight a source control tool or take backups before every operation like with git.<p>So that explains the hate, from my perspective. git came along and polluted a perfectly good tool space with something extremely user-hostile and didn&#x27;t add any extra value (no, git did not invent distributed source control so that&#x27;s not the explanation; I&#x27;ve been using distributed source control since the mid 90s and today I use mercurial wherever I get a choice).')
