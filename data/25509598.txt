Unlike what was previously thought, we learn that DNA-based life did not emerge from random events in a primordial soup. Indeed, the first molecules of DNA were fabricated by a previous life form. By describing the fascinating events referred to as Phenotypic Revolutions, this book provides a dire warning to humanity: if humans continue to play with their own genes, we will be the next life form to fall to our own creation.\n&quot;I am VERY impressed with this bookâ€”very important topic very well treated.&quot; - Robert Trivers&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Revolutionary-Phenotype-amazing-story-begins&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1729861563" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Revolutionary-Phenotype-amazing-story...</a><p>fyi: I&#x27;m not the author')
