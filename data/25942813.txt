And that&#x27;s fine!<p>The user experience is great, and I like the service in general. The fact that it&#x27;s not tied to an advertising company that is profiling users and making money of it is of course the biggest plus, but please stop with the whole &quot;totally secure&quot; BS. It&#x27;s confusing and is probably even hurting their image: I have had to explain multiple times to friends and family I finally moved off of WhatsApp that we did not do it for the security, but rather to be free of being mined for personal data... Same thing goes for these non-tech &#x27;news&#x27; sources that make a big deal out of it as well, while it&#x27;s totally obvious if you investigate a bit more.<p>(Apologies for the rant, I guess had to get this off my chest.)')
