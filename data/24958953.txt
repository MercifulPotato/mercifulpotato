But that does not tell you <i>the human schedule</i> in Melbourne.<p>Right now, you can probably guess that business hours are &quot;9-5&quot; (09-17h), and so you can do a TZ lookup to see if people are in the office.<p>If you get rid of TZs, and the time is 22:15Z, <i>what does that mean elsewhere in the planet</i>? Is that business hours for LA, NY, Paris, Mumbai, Tokyo, or Auckland? Where is that when people people are sleeping?<p>We know what daylight hours in the local timezone are 8-8 (08-20h), so after doing a Google TZ search we know if someone is likely to be asleep or not.')
