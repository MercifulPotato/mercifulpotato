I worked at a Community College in IT for a while. Students would come into a lab that was specifically set up for testing. The anti-cheating software was such total trash, it would crash, crash the browser, crash the whole system. Students would have to start testing over...<p>At least twice a month, their systems would be down, and nobody could take tests at all. We&#x27;d have to send home 30-60 students at a time, and reschedule their tests for another day. These were students who were also working jobs, and took time off of work, likely unpaid, to come in and take the test. So we wasted their time, and lost them money. Not to mention the constant waste of IT&#x27;s time dealing with this trash software.<p>It&#x27;s totally fucking criminal that these companies sell such garbage to our schools and get away with it. It doesn&#x27;t matter how bad it is, it checks a box on some requirements sheet so we will never switch to something else...  Not that the other options are any better.')
