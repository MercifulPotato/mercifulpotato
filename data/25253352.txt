I seem to have an ingrained negative association with Indian accents, despite some of my favorite colleagues being Indian. I have to actively combat this in myself, but it is ever-present. The opposite is true of most European accents.<p>I grew up in the US south. Many of the brightest, kindest, most well-rounded people I’ve ever met had thick to medium southern accents. And yet, when I hear a thick southern accent, the person drops significantly in my initial estimation of them.<p>Some folks have used their accent to their advantage. One of the best lawyers I know comes across as a bumpkin due to his accent. So, he uses the element of surprise (dropping really clever rhetorical lines) extremely well.<p>At a previous job, one of the best developers had a thick accent. When I interviewed him, he wore a cammo hat. I would have rejected him if not for one of my favorite colleagues insisting that he was one of the best devs he’d worked with. That experience has made me put a checklist in place for my interview assessment process.<p>I wish none of the above was true of me, but there it is. I just have to learn to work around it.')
