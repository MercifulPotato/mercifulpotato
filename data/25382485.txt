Energy is cheap, so liquid cooling the cables and dissipating i.e. 5% of the energy into the conductor is a straightforward trade-off.<p>Compare that trivially to petrol, which costs petrol (diesel) to move to petrol stations, and it&#x27;s actually not that surprising.<p>Additionally, there has recently been a lot of investment into EV chargers with built-in batteries that charge at slower rates when a vehicle is not present, and operate independently from the grid once a vehicle is connected. This answers the obvious question about infrastructure to deliver the power required.')
