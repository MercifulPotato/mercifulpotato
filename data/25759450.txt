None of the available backup strategies are robust, safe and future proof enough for this task (I&#x27;m talking about pictures of my family, kids etc.).<p>Moreover, my experience is, that if you have them in a physical book, you tend to look at them way more often yourself and with others.<p>Bonus point: I only have to do it once per picture. No need to migrate to another backup strategy, another provider and so on.')
