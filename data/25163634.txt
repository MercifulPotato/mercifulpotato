This is what we are trying to change. These companies use social media, linkedin ads, other famous job boards to attract talent. But still the outcome is not much different.<p>By listing on HerJobs, companies can also reach a different demographic that is hard to reach(typically for a company in US or Europe)<p>Agree that there might be people who use this with not the ideal intentions. But we have to start somewhere. We also try our best to vet companies, not just candidates.<p>&gt; A less patronizing solution would be to figure out why women from emerging countries are underrepresented in existing pipelines and address those factors there.\nThis is exactly we are doing. Currently the community consists of mentors(both male, and female) and helps applicants identify their talent gaps and train them. These gaps are not necessarily technical - but cultural and language gaps.')
