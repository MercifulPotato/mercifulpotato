Item(by='bsder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605249513, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25078800, text='&gt; I still do not see how they can role out charging infrastructure in just 15 years. Not everyone lives in a house.<p>We rolled out gas stations faster than that.  Gas stations went from something you had to worry about on long trips in 1975 to every corner convenience store by 1990.<p>And charging stations have <i>none</i> of the downside of gas stations (toxic leakage, theft, licensing, etc.).  You can install charging stations at very small shops without worry.<p>I&#x27;m personally surprised that Target and Lowe&#x27;s haven&#x27;t rolled out charging stations in their parking lots.  Once that happens, it&#x27;s pretty much game over as <i>everybody</i> will have to roll out parking lot charging or lose business.')
