Is this for real?<p>Cisco got its start by pirating a competitor’s operating system?<p>The same thing happened decades later, when Huawei pirated Cisco’s operating system for their own routers, when they first started out.<p>They eventually settled out of court, and Huawei paid up for their malfeasance, so Cisco no longer complains about it, at least not publicly.<p>But the irony here is unreal.<p>Cisco here is claiming to be holier-than-thou, but in actuality, they did the same thing that Huawei did.<p>Also, I heard Huawei travelled into the future, and stole Cisco’s 5G technology. Otherwise, how else could Huawei have come up with their own cutting edge telecommunications technology on their own?')
