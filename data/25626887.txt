I hear you say... travel, see the world, experience other cultures, be with family, and all that jazz.  None of that pays the bills.  I understand your sentiment but don&#x27;t really see how I could do what &quot;really matters&quot; right unless I gave up on a western life entirely.  Maybe if I lived in a van and did some contract based coding I could spend most of my time seeing the world, but  then I would give up so many other wonderful things like a wife, possibly kids, family close by, etc.<p>Ultimately we live just one life.  I want to feel like I accomplished something and made my mark as trivially small as it may be compared to some.  I want to hang my hat at the end of the day and feel like I had control over myself. In other words, I want to master good living and discipline.<p>Of course I want to see family, and friends, and all that.  But there are many hours in the day, and why not fill them with your best effort?  There will be plenty of time when I am old where I will want to do rest, leisure, etc.')
