To give an example, with one of SpaceX&#x27;s initial launches I had a bunch of friends send me photos (I was working as a rocket scientist at the time). I literally got a dozen photos. The same thing happened with an unannounced Navy missile test. I got tons of messages and Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, etc was littered with photos. All the links you listed are from the pre-cellphone era. This is fine, but not what the parent was talking about, so the response isn&#x27;t great. Personally I&#x27;m not aware of a UFO phenomena that took place with the criteria the parent listed (multiple angles and recordings). But I have personally seen that criteria for claims of UFOs but in reality be explainable man made phenomena.<p>As to the Navy stuff Occam&#x27;s razor would say that these are edge cases where the instruments fail. Having viewed these videos this seems like a reasonable explanation. Sure, it could be aliens, but sensors being wrong is an <i>extremely</i> common occurrence so it is a much simpler answer. Edge cases where sensors fail are also cases where human sensors are likely to fail too (this should be unsurprising if you&#x27;ve studied a bit of computer vision). So<p>&gt; either the Navy fabricated this weird hoax, fake data and got a squadron of pilots to lie about it very convincingly, or the whole event is real<p>Is a false dichotomy. Sure, those are two options, but a third option is that people simply don&#x27;t know what they saw but it was a natural phenomena. Ignoring that case isn&#x27;t helpful to the discussion and more likely to convince people that you&#x27;re a crackpot (I don&#x27;t mean this in an offensive way, just trying to help you set up your argument better. I want you to have the strongest argument you can make because that&#x27;s how we find answers).')
