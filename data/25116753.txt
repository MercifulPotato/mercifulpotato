It&#x27;s an automated system that analyzes the call, and it seemed to charge for any call over 45 seconds where food was discussed. As far as the amount goes, they used the average of the last X orders placed through the GrubHub app for that restaurant and charged some percentage of that. Then the owner is able to log in to their GrubHub account and see a list of all the calls they were charged for, listen to each one, and dispute any that didn&#x27;t actually result in an order. The system is garbage.')
