Item(by='core-questions', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608006981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25426707, text='&gt; trans people are treated like lepers<p>Says you; here in Canada at least transpeople are a protected class and have as many or more rights than the next person.<p>This is not the same thing at all as conversion therapy, and it is unreasonable to suggest that there should not be research and development into techniques, therapeutics, and methods to help people who would rather not actually be trans. This is not mutually exclusive with allowing people to be trans, or granting them protected class status! It&#x27;s merely another option, and in no way is it implied that it should be forced on anyone.<p>In fact, &quot;conversion therapy&quot;, as long as it is 100% consensual on the part of the person taking it, should be fine. Why shouldn&#x27;t it? Because it won&#x27;t work? Homeopathy and plenty of other things that &quot;won&#x27;t work&quot; are legal. It&#x27;s the lack of consent that is the moral issue, not the fact that someone might want assistance at living a simpler life, which being cisgendered no doubt is, at least at this time.<p>&gt; For instance, is it better to take HRT and be closer to the person you feel by default?<p>This really depends on the outcome that you&#x27;re after, but the higher-after-HRT-and-operations suicide rate of transpeople makes me wonder whether it&#x27;s actually the better outcome or not. Since this is 100% contextual and differs widely by individual, the only correct standpoint in a free society is to allow both options.<p>&gt; Is it being pushed by a therapist?<p>Some therapists are going to be gatekeepers, some are going to push you towards HRT, it&#x27;s luck of the draw at this point based on the personal biases and ethics of the therapist. The fact is, we&#x27;re supposed to be recognizing and validating people&#x27;s feelings; and it&#x27;s entirely believable that there is a class of people who feel gender dysphoria and simply want it to go away. These people are underserved by the current system.')
