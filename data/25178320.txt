Why is it the publicâ€™s fault for not investing in it?<p>That&#x27;s what my comment was saying. According to the article, the banks <i>used to </i> pay for their staff to learn COBOL <i>on the job</i>. It&#x27;s 100% the financial industries fault that they have allowed this situation to arise. Why did that practice stop? I think this is one of the areas where capitalism is slowly failing in recent decades.')
