The ideas of averages and seeing workers as another part of a machine came from people who were paid by factory owners to come up with better ways to control and maximize outputs. After a generation or two, kids grow up thinking that’s the way it is supposed to be.  A lot of what we got used to with industrialization and feel we cannot live without comes from conditioning and a failure to mindfully examine the lens in which we view the world.')
