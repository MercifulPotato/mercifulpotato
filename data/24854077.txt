Item(by='ggm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603330255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848249, text='I like reductionist maths counter-proofs based on &quot;x cannot contain y&quot;, but I try to be skeptical they apply, because it is plain real mathematicians can reason about infinite things, from finite symbols, as chains of symbols. the &quot;cannot contain&quot; set includes things I can state, but not enumerate.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical about AGI anyway. The proof is unnecessary, I tend to an even more reductionist model: Our lack of understanding where intelligence is, in the brain, goes to our failure to model it. &quot;morally&quot; making claims &quot;its alive&quot; based on a lack of understanding, is a bit like chemistry by alchemy. If you don&#x27;t know why,  you didn&#x27;t make it any more than making a baby would have.<p>Feynman said it better: lots of physics proofs are built on partial models of sub-atomics, which if you ask questions about become unknowables too. Its turtles-all-the-way-down stuff.<p>traditional reinforcement learning will probably not yield AGI, any more than any current method, based on not understanding GI, and until we understand GI, I do not believe any connectionist, or learning model will derive it.')
