FWIW, I also never use nvim&#x27;s built-in terminal because this setup with tmux is so fast and feels super natural.<p>Hint: you have to redefine more of tmux&#x27; binds, the defaults are just not usable.<p>Hint2: most creation and resizing of panes and windows binds should be mapped without the tmux prefix, you can do this with &quot;bind -n&quot; in the .tmux.conf.<p>Hint3: read the tmux manual, it&#x27;s really good and on one (long) page.')
