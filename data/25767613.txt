For example, I knew the details of the Tokyo Sarin Gas attacks and know that it was caused by a &quot;new religion&quot; cult but an average person outside Japan wouldn&#x27;t really remember that as clearly as I am (unless you are somehow in Western Australia since a farm area there was refurbished to produce sarin). It is like 9&#x2F;11 outside America: an average person knows it enough to remember whatever inconvenience they encountered that day but not the whole details.')
