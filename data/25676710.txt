( Which somehow had some tiny connection linking to Apple, but that is in the conspiracy field so I wont go into it )<p>And if you look back now, Apple were not telling truth or lying by omission.<p>Which is what got me to scrutinise every details when they had a battle with Qualcomm. And it was a very different view to what mainstream media tells you.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.displaydaily.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;discussions-with-apple-regarding-license-agreement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.displaydaily.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;discussi...</a>')
