In-state generation is reported generation from units one megawatt and larger. Data as of June 24, 2019 ... In 2018, total generation for California was 285,488 gigawatt-hours (GWh), ... <i>in-state generation dropped by 6 percent (11,494 GWh) to 194,842 GWh. ...

On Wednesday, California&#x27;s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, signed an executive order asking the state legislature to ban fracking oil and gas, the latter of which provided a majority of the state&#x27;s energy during the recent blackouts.” <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;how-californias-environmental-mandates-led-to-blackouts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;how-californias-environmental-manda...</a>')
