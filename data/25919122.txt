The NY Post article they shut down before the election turned out to be more true than false.  It wasn&#x27;t an attempt to incite a coup, it was an attempt to report some inconvenient facts about the son of a man who is now president and corruption. I&#x27;m glad Biden is president as I think it was a needed change that will be good for the US and the world but I still found this shut down of information deeply troubling.')
