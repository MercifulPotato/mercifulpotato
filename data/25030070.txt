So, um, let&#x27;s not do that.)<p>I think you greatly overestimate the abilities of GPT-3. GPT-3&#x27;s writable memory is short-term only – its long-term memory is read-only – so by the end of a conversation, it has permanently forgotten what the topic was at the beginning. Given its lack of writable long-term memory, it is completely incapable of succeeding at any tasks involving long-term planning, such as the infiltration and investigation of a social group.<p>Of course, you said &quot;GPT 3 style bot&quot;, not GPT-3, but the AI you have in mind has significantly greater capabilities than GPT-3 has, so isn&#x27;t fairly said to be &quot;GPT 3 style&quot; at all.')
