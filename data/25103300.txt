I&#x27;m not aware of a precise quantitative measure of film &quot;resolution&quot;, but simply from a qualitative sense of resolving detail, it&#x27;s quite meaningful and useful to say that 35mm film is generally considered to lie somewhere between 4K and 8K. Which is <i>far</i> higher than 1080p.<p>In other words, if you&#x27;re watching a 1080p video and complaining it appears too &quot;high-resolution&quot; to have been transferred from film, that&#x27;s almost certainly incorrect, and it&#x27;s something else that cluing you in it wasn&#x27;t film -- probably grain and&#x2F;or color characteristics.')
