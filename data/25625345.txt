It is a sad and risky part of the space for the users, but doesn&#x27;t undermine any point I made about how the developer makes money. It does undermine how comfortable a publicly facing developer would want to be. Even if the developer does get vilified publicly and professionally or actually incurs some legal liability, they can still just change aliases or release more autonomous code under a new pseudonym. Either way it really amplifies their - or some other developer&#x27;s - earning potential. And users can also buy third party insurance (which is its own sector and has its own growth challenges).<p>Secondly, another thing I was alluding to is that you can just copy working code. You can deploy the exact same service as someone else and compete directly. Too many developers think they need uniqueness, which may have been true in the &quot;I can only get recognition from VCs to make real money&quot; world. DeFi development is analogous to launching a grocery store offering slightly different brands. The code you copied from having already been audited.<p>Third, everything I wrote before was assuming no malicious intent. So if we are copying code for the most part, it moves the vulnerabilities to the closed source oracles and the behavior of the oracle&#x27;s sources of data.<p>I&#x27;m always open to having this conversation, in general top level hackernews has not been ready for that conversation and they want to debate largely irrelevant things about their <i>feelings</i> over blockchain, as opposed to the state of various sectors in the space that they aren&#x27;t aware of. So leading with nuanced discussion would hurt the visibility of what I actually have to contribute.')
