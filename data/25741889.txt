I have no desire to live in your world.<p>What of those of us who respect science, but have less respect for experts? I strongly believe in science, and believe it to be humanity&#x27;s &quot;candle in the dark&quot;. I have little respect for individual experts who insist that their advice must be followed by all those they deem to be lesser than them, whether science is their justification or not.<p>Science as a process is the best tool we have. Scientists are human beings, and are just as flawed as everyone else. The contexts they operate in have also shown themselves to be highly susceptible influence by political trends. There was no end to the &quot;science&quot; that would show you the inferiority of minority races 100 years ago. You are not doing science a favor by steeping it in dogma and being blindly deferential, you&#x27;re turning it into a religion.')
