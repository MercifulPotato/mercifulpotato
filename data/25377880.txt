Would have moved somewhere else and gone back into industrial design.<p>Gebbia - Father is&#x2F;was a successful businessman in the Atlanta area, currently a city councilman. Probably would have been better off than Chesky, but the debt probably still would have stung. Would have gone back into industrial design.<p>Blecharczyk - Upper middle class family + Harvard alum. Taking on the debt might have been painful, but he probably would have been fine eventually, especially with his technical background.<p>I don&#x27;t think their fall-back options were great. If they had &quot;rich uncles&quot; or something, I don&#x27;t think they would have needed to max out credit cards in the first place. I think Chesky&#x27;s level of conviction was simply unwavering. I&#x27;m certain there are much more affluent people who would have given up sooner.')
