It would be one thing if he had just been a middling player, but even with the MASSIVE height disparity between him and the rest of the league, he proved to be a standout player, easily in the top 50% of players historically, and probably much higher. Clearly, there&#x27;s a role for short men even at the upper echelons of the sport - not just as a curiosity, but as an effective value-add above an average replacement, in part <i>because</i> of his lack of stature. But you almost never see NBA players below 5&#x27;9&quot;. The players are tall. The coaches are tall. Surely being tall is generally necessary for success in the sport? But then, Muggsy.<p>Read between the lines. If all the players are tall, and all the coaches are tall, and the game has been played for more than a half century with that assumption... who knows how to train&#x2F;coach a short player?')
