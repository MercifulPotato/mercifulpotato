FB&#x2F;Google at el can offer salaries that are multiple-x of those at startup. If money is what you are after, it just makes a lot of sense to work there and squirrel away the cash.<p>In fact, there are probably only two things that startups can offer that big companies cannot:<p>(1) A product that when successful it will change everything, think Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;SpaceX material. This is good because it puts employees in a position to &quot;change the word,&quot; while also potentially getting paid in the long run.<p>(2) Flexibility and room for the mind to work. No useless meeting, no endless discussions to cover one&#x27;s ass, no set hours or obscure HR policies. Just hard work and a ridiculously challenging mission.<p>Outside of that, why would you work at a startup?')
