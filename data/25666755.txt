Having valid ID isn&#x27;t an issue if you&#x27;re someone who drives, but if you&#x27;re someone who is physically incapable of driving and can&#x27;t get a driver&#x27;s license, well, obtaining that ID can be quite difficult. (Even getting a driver&#x27;s license in my state requires going to a particular building in the hours of 9-5 M-F--sucks if you have an hourly job you can&#x27;t get time off to get an ID!)<p>How many people actually exist in this country that have no form of ID? You need it for even getting various utilities in some areas (maybe all?)<p>Further, why can’t we fix this issue? If it takes 3 hours to get the ID then compensate hourly workers to get it and pass a law requiring jobs to allow time for such a thing. Why because it’s difficult for some we give up on the entire idea of requiring IDs?')
