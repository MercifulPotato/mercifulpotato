The honest answer (at least at the university level) -- probably we don&#x27;t.<p>&gt;&gt; From what I can tell, there&#x27;s very little enthusiasm for online education, on the part of either professors or students.<p>This isnt surprising -- you are probably polling people <i>inside the system</i> -- what about the many more people who cant join the system? I&#x27;ll bet they have a very different opinion.<p>The US educational system, especially graduate education, is a game of money. Even those graduate students who are on grants are only the lucky ones who don&#x27;t have sufficiently large family obligations to fulfill and can therefore stay on a graduate grant. Think of how many people need to work at their parents&#x27; shop, have to take care of a grandparent, sick elderly parents at home, those who are also caring for younger siblings, those w&#x2F;o sufficient disposable income to sit around at quads sipping lattes.<p>Consider all the people who couldn&#x27;t pay to play that game. I&#x27;m sure they would love an alternative.<p>Also consider the opposite problem -- people with money who do not want to take off two years (without income) to get a graduate degree, or worse, move their families to one of several key cities with top universities. They would also like an alternative that is mostly remote.')
