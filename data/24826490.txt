But a whole group I trained with for a time all became professionals, and some of them competed in the olympics. I knew them then before they got there, and I knew their level and their attitudes, and I saw <i>nothing</i> in their professional performances indicating that they had at any point moved into doping. How sure can one be? Never totally sure. But trying to be &quot;sure&quot; about the other possibility (that they were doping) will need more than &quot;yeah, I&#x27;m sure they do&quot;.<p>EditAdd: I <i>did</i> know people who were fascinated about EPO-like medication, and asthma medicine when used without actually having asthma. That was when they were quite young, and that&#x27;s also a long time ago. I never ran into any of them actually using anything, and they were in the minority - I met just two, and sadly one of them died in a traffic accident before he got to a professional level.')
