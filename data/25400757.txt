I couldn&#x27;t tell you where that line is or where it should be, and I&#x27;m not even saying Twitter has crossed it (I increasingly wonder if they have but it&#x27;s so hard to know with the limited information and visibility I have).<p>But I do think we&#x27;re running out of time to do anything about it should action be appropriate.  If Twitter is stepping over the line in taking down people that speak against the incoming administration, that said administration is going to protect them?  I highly doubt it.  (I wouldn&#x27;t expect Conservatives would either were the tables turned for the record.  In fact they have a history of jailing people protesting wars and what not, so I know they wouldn&#x27;t).')
