If anything, the garage gave them ample cover to work in privacy, actually.<p>Still not sure exactly how they did it... Our vehicle has physical keys, no wireless fobs or keyless entry, so it wasn&#x27;t a relay&#x2F;clone attack. They basically just stripped out the ignition, and busted out all the interior lights, and did something in the fuse box (probably pulled a fuse or something to disable the alarm while they worked on the ignition cylinder). We have them on video driving away in our car... Apparently Kia really sucks at anti-theft.<p>We still had all keys in our possession, too. Normally, if you unlock or open the door from inside, while it&#x27;s locked, the alarm goes off. The car was recovered only a few blocks away, parked in an alley, blocking someone else&#x27;s garage. I got videos of the thieves walking away down the alley after ditching it.<p>They left actual valuables in the car&#x2F;garage like tools, sunglasses, camping gear, etc... and destroyed a lot of nonsense things. The only valuable thing they took was the dash cam.<p>As it stands, the garage, the alarm, the steering lock, key requirement, and video recording did little to stop them. The garage was locked too, and very well lit with motion activated flood lights. I don&#x27;t know what else we could have done other than have the garage secured with motion&#x2F;door sensors and a very loud exterior siren&#x2F;strobes... to protect our shitty 2011 Kia. lol, right...<p>Basically, thieves gonna thieve, and vandals gonna vandal.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;denver.cbslocal.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;05&#x2F;denver-police-kia-thefts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;denver.cbslocal.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;05&#x2F;denver-police-kia-the...</a>')
