Wikipedia says that by 1980 apples revenue was $118 million and that was before they released the most popular model (the IIe in jan of 1983), which was still being sold in 1993. The C64 by itself may have sold more units than anything apple produced, but you added up the entire 6502 commodore line. Adding up the entire II line might be an interesting comparison.<p>In the US as I remember the 1980&#x27;s apple ][s were everywhere. And there were 6 models (or more depending on if you count the revisions), and a number of clones (Franklin Ace and laser 128, were two popular ones).<p>So, It would be interesting to get numbers for all those models, because each successive generation definitely cannibalized the previous ones. No one purchased the plus after the &#x27;e&#x27; came out, and the gs was definitely the machine to own later in the life-cycle (particularly with an accelerator).<p>I couldn&#x27;t find overall numbers with a quick google search.')
