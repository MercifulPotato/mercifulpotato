Before that was IRC, Campfire, then Github Chat (an internal product there), and others I&#x27;ve forgotten. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use Teams at some point.<p>The thing I always think about w&#x2F; chat apps for work is you don&#x27;t want it to be that good. DMs are often a cancer in terms of knowledge transfer. Unlimited history and search means that people don&#x27;t write up ideas in a proper way in a more suitable place, whether that&#x27;s a long email or an ADR or a google doc or a pull request. Threads are undiscoverable and missed by people who should be in the loop.<p>Most product managers building these apps want to engage their users via the standard tech metrics - usage stats, number of searches, messages sent, whatever. But if you are in your chat app all day and responding to notifications and watching 30 channels, you aren&#x27;t doing work. You are just surfing your own internal twitter. I&#x27;ve been there, it feels fun but at the end of the day you realize you didn&#x27;t get shit done.<p>All of the incentives are misaligned to actually build an effective chat app for the &#x27;calm&#x27; organization. I have read about Twist (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twist.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twist.com&#x2F;</a>) which I know is all about that focus, and I hope to be able to use it in earnest someday.<p>I know when I&#x27;m really doing well with my job I&#x27;m on slack for an hour or two a day at most, and very deliberate about when to keep it open. The rest of the time I&#x27;m coding or thinking or writing or working w&#x2F; colleagues. That takes a lot of discipline tho, and the allure of always on chat is a strong one.')
