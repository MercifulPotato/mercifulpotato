The rules a rigged against you and me because we aren&#x27;t on the inside, friends with the power, which is usually beurocrats in socialist states. You do something faster, better, cheaper and still fail. Notice this kind of thing is not Bernie Sanders who barely qualifies as anything remotely socialist outside of the USA. Having competition where companies and whole industries go broke and shut down with their assets sold off to those who can use them better has been thought of as a useful counter-measure to this. When there is regulatory capture destroying that competition you get the worst of all worlds.<p>It&#x27;s not captitalism, it looks more to me like bad socialism. My socialist friends would say it&#x27;s not remotely socialism it looks more like captialism and this is what always happens in captialism. Just about everyone says it stinks and needs fixing. Bezos doesn&#x27;t. Murdoch doesn&#x27;t. They say this is the best that can possibly be because everything else is worse, which is probably true with respect to their power and influence. I don&#x27;t see it as true in any other dimension. It needs fixing. Someone will ride that desire to fix it to political power. I hope that person turns out to be a decent human being rather than a genuine facist which President Trump was not and is not, whatever else are his many faults.')
