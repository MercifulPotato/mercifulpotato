Item(by='thomas-vds', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610741967, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25787648, text='The idea of rewarding devs from my team for following collaboration best practices first arose when I was managing a team of 6 junior developers, nearly all of them freshly graduated from coding bootcamps. I was losing a lot of energy to remind them about the need to quickly fix bugs, minimise WIP etc. And clearly, rewarding good behaviour with gamification works better than playing the blame game for suboptimal behavior.<p>As time went I got the chance to work with and manage more senior and incredibly talented devs - but still, some issues remained around sticking to our commonly agreed best practices.<p>Then came COVID and the full-remote setup and it also became increasingly important to keep regular interactions within the team, even micro-interactions when some folks don&#x27;t get the opportunity to work together but still want to connect.<p>So I ended up building Karma initially as a side-project to learn Go during my paternity leave (oops). I&#x27;ve had a lot of fun building that little CLI with the Cobra framework (same one as the one that powers Github CLI). The front-end is built using Tailwind UI and Vue 2.<p>I hope you&#x27;ll have good fun trying this out, and that like me you will also discover what a cool TUI looks like :) Go spread the good karma, looking forward to getting feedback.')
