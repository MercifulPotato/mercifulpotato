Modern x64 microprocessors have a separate front-end that handles instruction decoding.  These instructions are decoded to internal proprietary &quot;micro-ops&quot;.  The internal buffers and actual execution units see only these Âµops.  One can measure where the bottlenecks are, and it&#x27;s rare to find that the front-end is the bottleneck.   While it&#x27;s arguably true that x64 is a poorly designed &quot;foundation&quot;, it&#x27;s unlikely to be causing any performance difference here.')
