Zero.&quot;<p>I think that&#x27;s bad journalism even if you agree with his conclusions. It&#x27;s single-sourced and the source has every reason to downplay their involvement in the events of January 6th. I think that at the very least, Greenwald should have checked those 13 users to see if they had active Parler accounts, rather than just taking Parler&#x27;s word for it.<p>Further, the number is inaccurate. The DoJ press release (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;thirteen-charged-federal-court-following-riot-united-states-capitol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;thirteen-charged-federal-cour...</a>) says 13 people were charged in federal court, and 40 were charged in superior court. That was as of Friday; I can&#x27;t quickly find info on whether or not more people were charged over the weekend, but then again, I&#x27;m not a professional journalist.')
