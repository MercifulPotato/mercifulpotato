MSFT will claim that all that data is for quality control and now security services but ofcourse they are going to squeeze every last drop of money they can from it. To expect otherwise would be like asking an alcoholic to guard a brewery and never sample the product, completely ridiculous. The US has no serious legal repercussions for doing so. Probably because the US intelligence community depends on that data since IT is forbidden from collecting it from Americans on its own.<p>Gee, I wonder why...')
