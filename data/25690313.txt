The one in Budapest has two inch thick metal bar gates. Lesson learned from the embassy hostage crisis in Iran.<p>Anyway, an angry mob of wacko rioters shouldn&#x27;t probably force their way into the legislative&#x27;s building. They should respect the outcome of the democratic vote and vote again in four years. Maybe if this was Iran I would say okay, people are fed up with the ayatollah and the revolutionary guards, but this is the US and the poor buggers are being manipulated, shot tear gas at and four of them got killed. For what? Absolutely nothing. The unfortunate officer died doing his job. This is very sad and scary, it looks like civil war brewing. A really bad thing to happen to a nation armed with nukes. Please do not let it happen, do not pick needless fights, stay clear of angry mobs.')
