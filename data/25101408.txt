I unfortunately need to keep Windows machine for pro tools I use and it took me some time to remove any telemetry plus I can still see with Glasswire some apps are sending traffic. Usually I send an email to the software provider and ask what they send. Unfortunately some don&#x27;t even reply and there is no OSS alternative, so there you go. I wish pirates went a step further and instead of hacking DRM also removed calls home and telemetry. Should mods should be legal if you have a full version and I would pay for such mods.')
