If votes can be checked by other people, a very large number of people (enough to change the result) will be forced under threat by someone else to &quot;vote correctly&quot;.<p>The same happens if you can check your own vote, because any mechanism that lets you do that can usually be used by someone else - &quot;give me your phone so I can check you voted for X like I told you to&quot; (while holding a gun).<p>That&#x27;s why free &amp; fair elections have secret ballots, without personal identification on the ballots.
