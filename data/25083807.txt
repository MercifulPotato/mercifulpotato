It&#x27;s called &quot;point source pollution.&quot;<p>Instead of having a million lawn mowers each belching out pollution, you use electric mowers and have all the filth at the power plant, where it can be cleaned and scrubbed better.  And when new technology comes along to clean better or shift to a new form of energy production, you only have to upgrade one power plant instead of making a million people buy new mowers.<p>Somehow it never caught on.  I don&#x27;t know why.')
