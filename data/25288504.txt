The Postgres extension framework exists very much for this purpose, for projects like TimescaleDB to contribute back without needing to “pollute” mainline with domain-specific features.  Most of TimescaleDB’s code (and all development for the first few years) is Apache 2, and all features are free for anybody to self-manage.<p>(Disclaimer: I work at Timescale)')
