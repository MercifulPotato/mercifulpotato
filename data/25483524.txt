Or are you saying that you expect people to produce quality content for you for free?<p>They are not.  And I generally don&#x27;t.  In fact, I rarely watch YouTube.  When I do, it&#x27;s generally to find a specific song or video clip (both usually decades old) to forward along to someone else.<p>In those situations, I would be shocked if the &quot;owner&quot; of the content (the YT channel owner) had actually paid license fees to the actual copyright owner.<p>As for paying $12&#x2F;month to get rid of ads, that seems an awful lot like a protection racket.  &quot;It&#x27;d be a real shame if you had to waste all that time watching ads.  We don&#x27;t care about the money, we just want to help you make your viewing experience better.&quot;<p>Given that the video in question[0] wasn&#x27;t actually created (or even directly licensed) by the owner of the YT channel, your point is moot for that particular piece of content.<p>As for actual content <i>creators</i>, I absolutely believe they should be fairly compensated for their work.<p>However, simply repackaging the work of others isn&#x27;t &quot;content creation.&quot;<p>Regardless, I make every effort to shun all platforms that attempt to show me ads.  That&#x27;s my choice.  Because I don&#x27;t care to be presented with a bunch of garbage or pay the same people who profit from it to not see such crap.<p>If there&#x27;s something I want, I&#x27;ll buy (not stream or rent or license) it.<p>There&#x27;s far too much of that going on and I refuse to support it.  If I <i>buy</i> music or a phone or a car or a tractor or seed or anything else, I should be able to use it as I see fit, without restriction, data exfiltration or a bunch of scum trying to sell me stuff.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Va8Uz6MoKLg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Va8Uz6MoKLg</a>')
