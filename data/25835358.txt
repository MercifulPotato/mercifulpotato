The trouble is that Amazon simply out-competes ElasticSearch with their own product when it comes to consultancy, services, etc.<p>I kind of disagree here, the main reason it outcompetes is based on the network of linked self serve services in the ecosystem.  We spend a ton of money on Amazon in general, and I would not tout thier consultancy as being anything but ok if not underwhelming.')
