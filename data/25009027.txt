But this is a problem of successful, growing cities and it sounds like OP is in a city in the opposite situation that is lacking in economic opportunities.<p>&gt; Join orgs supporting the homeless and fighting against the criminalization of homelessness.<p>When most people complain about homelessness, they&#x27;re talking about the homeless on the streets, and particularly the ones on drugs who accost the people walking by. Criminalization of homelessness might be bad for moral reasons, but letting an unlimited number of homeless people live on streets indefinitely is exactly the opposite of what almost everybody wants.

Just focusing on the &quot;criminalization&quot; aspect and ignoring everything else is just making the problem worse in other ways.<p>&gt; Buy from locally-owned businesses that treat their employees well.
