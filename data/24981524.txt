Is there something I&#x27;m not seeing here?<p>For instance, one source says that energy production in 2019 was 14,715 MToe (million tonnes oil equivalent) or 14.7 E12 koe (kilograms). The graph said energy intensity was 0.110 koe per $2015. That implies a world GDP of over 130 trillion in 2015$. But I thought GDP was around $80 trillion (maybe a bit higher using purchasing power parity).<p>I&#x27;m confused. Is energy intensity decreasing because somebody&#x27;s using an inflated denominator (PPP dollars)? What&#x27;s <i>really</i> happening?')
