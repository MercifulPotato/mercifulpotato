It should be absolutely fine if Google puts Ozonetel as first search result(because there is a brand and company called Ozonetel), and then puts the ads below that. Its win-win for everyone.<p>&quot;If your customers intend to go directly to you, why do they not go directly to your site but instead search for it on a general search engine?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s because now mostly people(including me) search for a brand we know and click on the site.
