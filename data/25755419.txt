From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i3wm.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i3wm.org&#x2F;</a>:<p>&gt; Based upon the experiences we made when wanting to hack&#x2F;fix wmii, we agreed upon the following goals for i3...<p>Also, from the manpage i3(1):<p>&gt; i3 was created because wmii, our favorite window manager at the time, didn’t provide some features we wanted (multi-monitor done right, for example), had some bugs, didn’t progress since quite some time and wasn’t easy to hack at all (source code comments&#x2F;documentation completely lacking). Still, we think the wmii developers and contributors did a great job. Thank you for inspiring us to create i3.<p>&gt; wmii moved to Google Code[1] before becoming abandonware before Google Code shut down.<p>Both wmi&#x27;s and wmii&#x27;s code can also still be obtained at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.suckless.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.suckless.org&#x2F;</a>. Those are packages, though. It&#x27;s great that the repo for wmii is still available. Thanks for those links.')
