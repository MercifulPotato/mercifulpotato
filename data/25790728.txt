And we remember when professional programs might be written in BASIC and sold on 5.25 inch floppies. On machines with no &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local or PATH. And then we programmed PCs using Borland or Symantec or whatever IDE and there was no &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local or (usually) PATH to be concerned about. And we programmed MacOS before it was Unix based using Think C or CodeWarrior and there was no &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local or PATH or even a CLI.<p>And so when CLIs became popular with (broadly speaking) the early growth of the internet, we became more familiar with &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local and PATH (we probably had some exposure to these already). So while yes, these are found in most modern systems, we see these things as details. PATH simply doesn&#x27;t feel &quot;fundamental&quot; to me because I&#x27;ve written exactly the same kind of code in environments where PATH is used and where it doesn&#x27;t even exist as a concept.<p>Of course, what is &quot;fundamental&quot; is rather a judgment call, and your perspective makes it so that these are fundamental for you.<p>I won&#x27;t defend the original post, particularly wrt nonsense like adding node to a browser. But I do think different perspectives are at play here, and disagreement on either side does not reflect intellectual laziness or people who should be laughed out of the room.')
