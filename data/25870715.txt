Google doesn&#x27;t make anything if you quickly find what you are making for and consume it.<p>Google&#x27;s optimal position would be if you keep searching for the stuff you are looking for and get distracted by ads and buy something in the process.<p>The second best thing would be if you find the stuff you are looking for directly on Google(Google no longer shows only search results but the content of the results as if it comes from them) and then you proceed to buy something through an ad click.<p>For example, Google wins if you search for &quot;When did Trump leave the White House&quot; and you see a snipped containing &quot;Trump left the WH in the early morning of January 20, 2021 using a helicopter&quot;. Now that you have your answer through the content that Google mined for free, they can monetize you but what about the people who put together that information?  Why they would be left out of your business? What&#x27;s fair about that?<p>There was a recent HN discussion about Google mining the database of a small business that specialises on compiling information on the wealth of celebrities. They lost most of their traffic when Google began showing the answer from their database directly instead of showing the link that contains this information. \nHere: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24105465" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24105465</a>')
