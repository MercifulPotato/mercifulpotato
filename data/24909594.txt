That&#x27;s what&#x27;s at stake here.<p>--- --- ---<p>Let&#x27;s look at what exactly is an EM field:<p>Heat transfers through:<p>- conductive surfaces\n - convective mediums\n - radiation: clocks get to tick differently.<p>Nature takes the easiest way, including clock tick cheat code.<p>If you ever want to race the &quot;grounding effect of Earth&quot; in a 100 yard dash, the Earth gets to turn thuggish on you. Earth gets to stroll across the finish line and say to you &quot;that&#x27;s one second.&quot; That&#x27;s special relativity. Coupled with the photoelectric effect and brownian motion we get a general principle that acts everywhere. Even so, if you want to be smart about it, Earth gets to go &quot;alright, check the tape.&quot; The chemicals in that tape are bounded by uncertainty, and yeah, that was one second.<p>That&#x27;s what particles mean. Not some mystic bath or cloud of invisible dots. Things need to charge up internally before they do more externally. You have a start, you have an end, you have a particle. So if you&#x27;re talking particles as a source of consciousness, you&#x27;re talking locality.<p>Before we talk consciousness, let&#x27;s talk what&#x27;s really different from one another. Heat is about as dumb and coarse and universal we can get. So if we ever pop something into existence, there&#x27;s a model to say we just stopped a spinning coin that&#x27;s been propagating through everything at &quot;the fastest things can go before they are effectively two separate things.&quot;<p>If I want to emit a matter wave or a chemical in orbit and ground out to that, or if I want to point a telescope at a black hole and measure the surface, there&#x27;s no way anything wins over that. The sun&#x27;s effectively a black hole because what humans did, and particles are popping in and out of existence.<p>Questions of confidence? Bah. It&#x27;s no limitation to the ability we have now, no uncharted regions to explore. It&#x27;s confidence, a call to damn the torpedoes and get humans to the top of the cosmic food chain for once and for all.')
