Item(by='zepto', descendants=None, kids=[25176210], score=None, time=1605982771, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25171455, text='&gt; &quot;damage control and image management&quot; suggest that Debian would be a Company and a PR department doing such a thing.<p>No, damage control or image management in no way implies a Company or PR department.  Any group can engage in these activities.  Later you point out, the OP appears to be <i>affiliated with Debian</i>.<p>&gt; Who, the OP? Even his nick name suggests affiliation with Debian, there is normally support and action of more people required to bring bigger change.<p>Yes, the OP.  I perhaps should have used the words ‘commenting on’, or ‘responding to’ instead of ‘addressing’.<p>I am not expecting the OP to solve the problems, but I am suggesting that it would be more constructive to comment on the substantive content of the original article than to write innuendo about how many people are just <i>quietly</i> contributing, or implying that the author may be part of a ‘vocal <i>minority</i>’.')
