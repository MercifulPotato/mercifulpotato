And especially if you&#x27;ve been in this industry for a while, this practice was much more prevalent a decade ago.<p>I don&#x27;t think your view is representative of how most F500 companies, or many of the new DTC brands, invest on major ad tech platforms though (FB&#x2F;G&#x2F;Snap&#x2F;etc.). Experienced marketers try to measure metrics as close to core business KPIs as possible, and comparing ads based off of simple A&#x2F;B tests is increasingly becoming a technique of the past. Measuring the incrementality of ad campaigns through long-term holdout groups gives companies a much more accurate read of their investment, while bringing higher statistical rigor as well. So rather than looking for cumulative increases on &lt;metric&gt; after advertising for a year, you could instead point to group A (who saw no ads) and see that group B (who saw ads) drove a 1.5x higher &lt;metric&gt;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you can say advertising is a scam when there are clear examples of popular brands that most likely wouldn&#x27;t exist today without digital ads? Take Allbirds as an example. There are dozens of consumer shoe brands that are already in physical stores and have higher brand recognition; how can you argue that advertising didn&#x27;t help them cut through the noise and grow their bottom line?')
