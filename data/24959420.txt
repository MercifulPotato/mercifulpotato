Would make it easy to see at a glance what kind of complexity you would get exposed to as a user of that framework. Anyone know any collection? Closest to that that I know about is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;todomvc.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;todomvc.com&#x2F;</a> but it&#x27;s biased in a way that it&#x27;s very trivial example, geared towards MV* frameworks&#x2F;libraries and only for web.<p>I fist became familiar with 7GUIs after getting into statecharts of the various flavors, and xState (statecharts in JS) has some of the tasks from 7GUIs implemented: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xstate.js.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;7guis&#x2F;counter.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xstate.js.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;7guis&#x2F;counter.html</a>')
