If it was that big of a deal, the government would be &quot;on it&quot;.<p>After all, is Democracy not the best mechanism possible for executing the aggregate will of the people?  And would the will of the people not be to <i>not</i> be tracked in this manner?<p>I predict this undesirable situation will be eliminated in less than one year - or, in case it is more complicated than it seems (and therefore takes more time to resolve), will at least have significant attention from both the government and the media until it is resolved to the satisfaction of voters.<p>I will keep my eyes open for an upcoming entry for this matter on the &quot;Top 10,000 Concerns of the General Public&quot; KPI tracker where we monitor matters of public concern like this, and I will use 10 of my monthly allocated voting units to express my level of concern.')
