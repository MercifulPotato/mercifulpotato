Everyone can easily picture why drug abuse or alcohol abuse is bad for society. There are subtler things too though. For example divorce is bad for society because single parenthood is hard and those children grow up with a disadvantage. That doesn&#x27;t mean the state has the right to interfere, but it might mean having more requirements for marriage or a public contraceptive policy is a good idea.<p>In this particular case these (presumably men) would be out of the dating pool and would be less likely to have children. I don&#x27;t see an awful lot wrong with that. They&#x27;re mostly the low status men that were functionally out of the dating pool anyway.<p>Or maybe the sex robots are so good, people stop marrying and having children to such an extent that the population collapses, the economy shrinks, and human population drops until it reaches some new, lower equilibrium. Given how we destroy our planet, it&#x27;s hard to get upset at that outcome.<p>More likely some cultures would do that, and others (e.g. Mormons?) Don&#x27;t and then the breeding culture eventually replaces the non breeding culture. Unless you&#x27;re part of that group, it doesn&#x27;t seem like an improvement. But it is very much the way of nature. Which we&#x27;re still a part of no matter how smart we think we are.')
