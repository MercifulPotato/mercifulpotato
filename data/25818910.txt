It came as a total surprise.<p>My boss and my boss’s boss booked a meeting with me at 17:00 in an external meeting room. My boss’s boss did the actual firing. My direct boss just sat there like a sad puppy.<p>They handed me a piece of paper and I signed it. I was still in shock. I was escorted to my desk to collect my things and then taken to the head of HR for my “exit interview”.<p>I told her the whole story and she actually seemed shocked herself. I think I spent over an hour with her, holding back tears, explaining “I wasn’t even told what I did wrong. What am I supposed to do now?”<p>She told me that she thought what the company was wrong. It didn’t change anything but it meant something at least, considering the state I was in.<p>I noticed from her LinkedIn that she left the company a couple of months later as well.')
