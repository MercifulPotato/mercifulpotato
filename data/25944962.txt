It was registered by Tom Christiansen in 1994 and soon afterwards, he let O&#x27;Reilly run it - and they used it to post useful Perl news and articles for a long time.<p>But O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s interest in Perl waned and it sat, moribund, for several years (which probably explains its lack of Googlejuice).<p>A few years ago, the Perl community approached Tom and he let them take over running it. The team behind the PerlTricks web site ported over all the old articles and had been posting new ones. It had become a pretty useful resource again.<p>So, yes, it would be a shame to lose it. But from what brian has posted elsewhere on this thread, that seems unlikely to happen.')
