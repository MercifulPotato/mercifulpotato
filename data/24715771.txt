In the former activity it’s always right but  in the latter it’s always wrong?<p>What’s happening when I identify a mistake while proofreading my own writing or listening to a recording of my own speech? When I can’t figure out how to make a sentence work because none of the ways I can think to phrase it sound good?<p>I’d totally believe that the workings of this recognizer are too slippery to conveniently model and study. But I can’t believe that it doesn’t exist or is completely personal. There are definitely communities with broad alignment on some intelligible sentences being good and others being bad.')
