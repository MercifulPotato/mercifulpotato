It&#x27;s restorative, not harmful.<p>Every morning when I wake up my back and hips are extremely tight and it takes me about 2 hours to loosen them up. However if I spend those two hours laying down waiting for my body to loosen on its own, I get up 2 hours later with the same problems.<p>I agree with you that sitting also causes the hips and back to get stiff and tight.')
