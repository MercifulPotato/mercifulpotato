Part of the reason, I believe, is because companies refuse to commit resources to open source without some assurance that the project will employ best practices to prevent discrimination, harassment, and a hostile work environment, lest the company find itself liable for such. (There&#x27;s also the &quot;good corporate citizen&quot; bit about not being seen to support bigotry and hate.) And corporate resources dominate open source -- without them we go back to dorm-room side projects of questionable maintenance.<p>A-Train&#x27;s Law applies: You don&#x27;t fuck with the money.
