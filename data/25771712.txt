But the damage occured two decades before that.<p>Intel is dying because they should have entered the foundry business in the early 90&#x27;s. Process was always their forte, they were never good at the CPU architecture design anyway as iAPX&#x2F;i860&#x2F;Itanium amply demonstrated.<p>Instead they blew $100B getting into antivirus, network security, mobileye, infineon, and a dozen other failed businesses, $50B in illegal kickbacks keeping AMD out of the unprofitable low end laptop market, and another $50B of &quot;contra revenue&quot; subsidizing their inferior me-too products against mobile SOCs they should have been fabbing in the first place.')
