It’s a field that is hostile to everyone in it.  There are no protections for grad students or postdocs.  Once through those positions you are a moderately paid staff scientist (if you’re lucky) or in another field.  There are so few professorships that it isn’t even worth bothering to list as an option.  Anyone going into science thinking they’ll be a professor should stop.')
