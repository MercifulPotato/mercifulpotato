It isn’t considered nudity (at least in the places I’ve been) for a woman to expose any part of their breast <i>except</i> the nipple itself. That (plus men’s nipples being so boring nobody even thinks to mention them) is what I find weird.<p>That does raise one obvious question: is the cultural difference (1) a real difference of sexualisation of body parts, <i>or</i> (2) does the average [†] hetero women look at topless men the same way that the average [†] hereto man looks at topless women, but society as a whole hasn’t noticed because it is male-dominated and not enough men in power ask women?<p>{As an aside: In the context lindybeige would be an example of argument from authority fallacy; expecting him to be right about comparative global sexuality is like expecting sexplanations to be right about comparing the relative merits of ancient Athenian and Persian armour.<p>That doesn’t mean he must be wrong (if I said that I world be making the fallacy fallacy), but surely there is a better example to use than him?}<p>[†] to emphasise: average as in  “no I can’t just ask my exes that would be anecdotes”')
