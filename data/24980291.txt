I guess this really is nostalgia for a time when you could go out and spend $10-100k, and buy a workstation that had capabilities simply not available on a consumer pc.<p>Yeah, at the end of the day, commodity GPUs with commodity CPUs make up a workstation. But that&#x27;s more to do with PCs &quot;catching up&quot;, and becoming very similar to a small workstation. After all, absurdly huge SIMD units are useful for 3d video games, and everyone wants to play video games.<p>You can still buy the high-end GPU (A100) and&#x2F;or CPUs (EPYC) if you wanted to build your own high-end workstation. But its all commodity parts these days. I think that&#x27;s a net benefit.')
