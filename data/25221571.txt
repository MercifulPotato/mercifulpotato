(At least not from my read of Apple’s philosophy)<p>What I expect is that Apple will eventually make something based on Playgrounds, but capable of producing apps that can be uploaded to the store.<p>However it will be a closed loop system, Swift only.<p>Obviously there will be the usual complaints about why this is bad from a control perspective, which are of course valid.  I’m not here to argue that.<p>What is <i>good</i> about this is that the constraints would force the development of a touch first programming environment.  Don’t expect terminals or gatekeeper etc.<p>This is the approach Apple has been taking with the iPad, and I see no reason they would change it now.  The m1 Macs make it <i>less</i> likely that they will open the iPad, not more.')
