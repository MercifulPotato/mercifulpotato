In the vast majority of cases the script kiddies find out about the vulnerability when the patch is released. Then some bad guy has to write the script to target it, and distribute that and&#x2F;or scale it. All a site owner has to do to win, is patch faster than that.<p>We always aimed to evaluate security patches same-day. The shortest lag we saw was “Drupalgeddon”—about 12 hours. In some cases we would see a lag of up to a month between the release of a patch and the signatures of automated attempts to exploit the underlying vulnerability. We eventually got rid of our IDS because all it did was log failed attempts to exploit vulnerabilities we had already patched, and fruitless door-knocking like password brute force attempts.<p>I’m sure you saw a lot of CMS installations that got hacked. I’m also sure that most them were because of either poor patch discipline, or misconfiguration, or both.<p>I guess it’s true that if someone is going to be bad at running a website, a popular CMS might be a bad experience for them. But even then a popular CMS may have an advantage: it’s a lot easier to find professional help for a popular CMS than for a niche or custom one.<p>Honestly, running <i>any</i> software at all is going be a nightmare for a lot of people. Hence the success of products like Squarespace and Wix; now they don’t have to.')
