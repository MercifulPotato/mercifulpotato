While most of the criticism is justified, I&#x27;d like to point out something that might not be obvious to folks who never worked at a megacorp: not every person who worked on this (or any other thing you have a problem with in tech) is a mindless zombie that makes change for the sake of change, whose only goal in life is to get promoted.<p>This redesign likely took several human-years to get out. It&#x27;s not perfect. It might even be plain bad in your world, and that&#x27;s fine. But the idea that we&#x27;re always smarter than the person next to us is just not a healthy place to be in my opinion.<p>Assume good intent, you&#x27;ll feel better about yourself and it&#x27;ll spread to those around you as well.')
