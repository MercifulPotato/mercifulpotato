I ate very little meat or fish, and barely any bread.<p>To be more mobile I bought VR and played Beat Saber and that was plenty of movement for me. Best thing is it&#x27;s not excercise. It&#x27;s just fun and you can spend hours with right songs trying to one-up yourself without feeling tired or bored (which is what I feel after excercising in any fashion for more than 3 minutes).<p>When I&#x27;m in unpopulated area I take walks few times a week (6k-10k steps).<p>I&#x27;m 42 living alone in small apartment and not working, with nearly all entertainment comming from my desktop and my phone.<p>And fit for me means keeping my bmi in normal range and feeling decently after going up three flights of stairs.')
