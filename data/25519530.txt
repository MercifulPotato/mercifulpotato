How would that being Open Source help you when you cannot ever verify what a server actually runs?<p>Primarily yes, and while true - that&#x27;s an extreme and a bit pointless, imo. I can say the same about Linux, which i&#x27;m on now, as i&#x27;ve never verified what i&#x27;m _actually_ running. Or Matrix servers i&#x27;m connected to, and what they&#x27;re _actually_ running.<p>Yet the idea remains that something some people have analyzed is better than something &quot;no one&quot; <i>(outside Telegram lol)</i> has analyzed.<p>Your question feels as if we may as well all be running entirely closed source. I&#x27;m unsure why the benefits and&#x2F;or supporting arguments for FOSS need to be stated here. Is there a degree of your question i&#x27;m missing?<p><i>edit</i>: Oh and, of course, the FOSS nature is even more important in the case where the majority of Telegram communication seems to lack security. If this was a zero knowledge platform i&#x27;d be far less concerned about their serverside implementation.')
