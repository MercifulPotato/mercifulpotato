A datacenter that’s available 90% of the time is worth vastly, vastly less than 90% as much as one that 99.95% of the time. Commodity businesses are largely built on presumptions of linearity. Produce 90% as much corn&#x2F;iron&#x2F;wood&#x2F;widgets as you expected and you’ll probably make something like 90% of the money you expected. Produce a 90% available datacenter and you’ll have a hard time finding anyone willing to pay you anything. And that’s just availability, not to mention data durability, which is even more critically nonlinear.')
