Item(by='Lazare', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603331953, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24844565, text='&gt; the lowest hanging fruit seems to be noting that youâ€™ve seemingly forgotten about freedom of the press with all your examples.<p>That&#x27;s a deep, deep non sequitur.<p>Citzens United was about whether the government can stop corporations such as the NYT from talking about politics. The majority held that they cannot; freedom of the press (in the form of the fist amendment) protects them.<p>The minority held that the freedom of the press does not protect them. The person you are replying to noted, correctly, that under this view the NYT could be stopped from discussing politics, and your reply is, essentially, &quot;that can&#x27;t be right, the first amendment would protect them!&quot; I agree, of course, as did, thankfully, Justice Kennedy and four of the other justices. The dissenting justices, however, seem to have forgotten about freedom of the press...')
