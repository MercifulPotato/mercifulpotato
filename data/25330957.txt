Item(by='dagw', descendants=None, kids=[25331056], score=None, time=1607338010, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25330867, text='Opening line of the linked paper:<p>&quot;Modern medicine relies on petroleum, particularly to transport patients, staff, and supplies&quot;<p>That part is largely &#x27;solved&#x27; problem and the rollout of those solutions over the next 30 years will probably be significant. As far as plastics and pharmaceuticals are concerned the paper puts it at &quot;an estimated 0.2% of petroleum used in the United States was for medical plastics&quot;<p>As for plastics in general the current number seems to be in the 6-10% range globally depending on who you ask.  With a combination of reducing, recycling and misc. technology improvements I&#x27;m sure we can get that down further in the next 20-30 years. And much of that oil can probably come from sources other than pumping it out of the ground.<p>So on the whole I think winding down the petroleum industry as we know it today over the next 30 years to a fraction of what it is today (no one is seriously suggesting 100% shutdown) is absolutely doable, from a technology point of view. The reasons why it won&#x27;t happen are political.')
