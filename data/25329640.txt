I think the merits of &#x27;Holacracy&#x27; that Zappos and Hsieh vehemently propagated can only be validated if it made any impact on the bottomline.<p>The reason I am saying this is because I worked in a startup which tried posturing like Zappos- flat hierarchy, no cabins, boozing, chilling et al, while being run by a cynic CEO. The startup failed badly so this cool culture never got the limelight but my hunch is that if they had raised enough money and survived another 5 years somebody would have included them in their book or dissertation.')
