Adding anything novel on top of that to increase the chances  of the attack&#x27;s success is incorporating a signal that WON&#x27;T be present in the chosen fall-guy&#x27;s future efforts (unless previously undetected tools can be stolen from the fall-guy), which may (eventually) undermine the desired conclusion.<p>Figuring out whodunnit requires an essentially Bayesian approach, except the data is usually circumstantial, and priors - themselves always contingent on even earlier data - are of uncertain reliability and must when possible be tested against later assumed-reliable data from other channels for consistency (and when inconsistent, deciding whether new data trumps priors or vice-versa is a bitch).<p>Nevertheless, given how much data there typically is, it isn&#x27;t too often that something comes along (like the discovery of a mole, which invalidates assumptions about what the opposition knows, and knows you know, etc.) to upend everything and break or reverse whole chains of inference.<p>So, while we might eventually find out some of the circumstantial evidence that lead to the attribution to a particular actor, we won&#x27;t ever be told what other previous evidence (itself circumstantial) ties that evidence to that actor. Eg. &quot;Toolchain X used in this attack is linked to Actor Y, but we can&#x27;t tell you how we know they are linked. Sorry-not-sorry.&quot; ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
