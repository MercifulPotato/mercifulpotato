The Raspberry Pi’s hardware is largely fixed – you can’t swap the CPU or GPU. Variations in hardware could cause us to get distracted by issues that really shouldn’t be a priority right now.<p>This (provided the Raspberry Pi&#x27;s poularity, affordability and power - surely it would be of no use without these) actually is an extremely cool feature. You can engineer OSes and entire solutions without caring about compatibility issues now. Like in the good old days when people would invent entire HW+OS platforms like NeXT and Amiga, but now you have the HW part done for you.')
