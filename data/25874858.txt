These companies can likely invest more resources in legal analysis than the goverment, so they will use most of it to their advantage.<p>If that were true, or true to the degree suggested here, I don&#x27;t think these companies would fight regulation as hard as they do.  Rather, they&#x27;d embrace them and encourage more.<p>IMHO, this kind of thinking is an interesting bit of free market propaganda, to the effect of convincing people that they&#x27;re helpless in the face of domination by some corporation or other, and their only option is to wait patiently for some market-driven &quot;creative destruction&quot; to occur in the (perhaps far) future.')
