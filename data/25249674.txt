FWIW you could make shapes, or famous buildings, etc., but I have only ever seen the proper tiles in use before. I don&#x27;t even remember which Chinese numbers are which, and I have no idea the characters for which directions are which, either. But it doesn&#x27;t matter as long as you can remember the shape and colour. I definitely prefer the &quot;authentic&quot; look. Besides, eventually you come up with nicknames for remembering what you&#x27;re searching for: there&#x27;s a stickman, a house, a mustache, the underlined th, the letter x, the letter k, etc...<p>Depth perception caught me a few times because certain tile positions overlap at the same angle. I don&#x27;t know how hard&#x2F;easy it is to do, but one of the best versions I saw added a bit of a shadow as if the light was coming from the rear right side to make those more clear. That way it makes the tiers more obvious while still looking natural.<p>Anyway, your game is pretty much spot on, and plays as quick&#x2F;smoothly as a desktop app, so that&#x27;s a good thing. Once in a while the &lt;ding&gt; gets delayed, but that might be my far-too-many open tabs interfering.<p>I like the flower-meter. Nice subtlety.<p>Some people might want a timer. It would be a nice addition as an option, but not default. &quot;Relaxing&quot; goes out the window if there&#x27;s a timer, and I tend to lollygag and carry on conversations while playing games like this.')
