They do work.<p>Star Trek is hardly a documentary.  The characters work because that&#x27;s what the writers want, to tell their stories.  By contrast, in Iain M. Banks&#x27;s post-scarcity <i>Culture</i> novels, work is not really a thing.  Instead people have hobbies and interests, some people accomplish things by getting really into hobbies like spaceship building (but it would have been automated if they didn&#x27;t), and a very few people choose to play important societal roles.')
