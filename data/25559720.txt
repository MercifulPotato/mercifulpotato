Do you live in San Francisco? I don’t mean the Bay Area. Do you actually live in San Francisco?<p>Why did Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland see very similar percentage based increases at the same time? Why has the entire Bay Area?<p>Foreign investment. As soon as Vancouver passed legislation to curb foreign investment their real estate moved back to normal. 1 in 4 housing purchases in California are all cash. That number is even higher in SF.<p>I’m so tired of this uninformed nonsense getting peddled by people who have no idea what they are talking about. Stop it.<p>Edit: This being flagged means it’s time to type in a random password and end this account. Finally had enough listening to uninformed idiots and even more jerks that silently flag things to hide my comment because they are a jerk and a coward.')
