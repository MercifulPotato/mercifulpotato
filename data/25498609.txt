(not using widely due to compatibility)</i><p>It’s not last variable return such as you get in expression-oriented languages like Ruby or Rust; rather, it’s that if what follows the fat arrow is not a curly brace, it’s parsed as an expression, which is made to be the value returned. So `a =&gt; { a }` is the void function, but `a =&gt; { return a }` and `a =&gt; a` are identity functions. Expressed as an approximate grammar, it’s<p><pre><code>  arrow-function = arrow-function-parameters &quot;=&gt;&quot; ( &quot;{&quot; *statement &quot;}&quot; | expression-minus-object-literals )\n</code></pre>\nAll forms of arrow functions were introduced at the same time, in ES6 (roughly meaning “everything since but excluding IE”). `a =&gt; { return a; }` has identical browser support to `a =&gt; a`, so if you use arrow functions you might as well switch to the expression form.')
