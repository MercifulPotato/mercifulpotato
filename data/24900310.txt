But for the 2nd wave (going until today), the death numbers clearly went up a few weeks after the case-count went up.<p>The case-count has begun to decline in Madrid, I think they&#x27;re &quot;over the hump&quot; (knock on wood...). So looking forward, they&#x27;re in a good spot.<p>But you can clearly see: when cases go up, deaths go up soon afterwards. When cases go down, the deaths go down soon afterwards.')
