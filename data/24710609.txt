Item(by='bonzini', descendants=None, kids=[24710896], score=None, time=1602092042, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24708387, text='Saying GNU Smalltalk &quot;is not running in a virtual image&quot; is incorrect.<p>For example, GNU Smalltalk does not load the whole standard library from scratch when you start it, the way for example Python does when you &quot;import os&quot;. In addition it&#x27;s perfectly possible (or even common) to load more packages into the image so that any file-based scripts you launch load faster.<p>And even though by default the compiler is written in C, if you load the &quot;Compiler&quot; package then GNU Smalltalk switches on the fly to a parser and bytecode compiler that&#x27;s written in Smalltalk. If you load the &quot;Debugger&quot; package, exceptions will take you to a gdb-like debugger, with a companion text-based interactive inspector. (The scheduler is part of the image in the same way as in Smalltalk-80, and features such as exception handling and the debugger are entirely implemented in Smalltalk; the only custom feature of the GNU Smalltalk VM that the debugger uses is single-stepping).<p>So even though the image is not as pervasive as in Smalltalk 80 or Pharo (development happens in files and builds upon an image, instead of happening straight in the image), the image is there and it&#x27;s not just an implementation detail.')
