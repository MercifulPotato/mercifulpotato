Item(by='pmontra', descendants=None, kids=[25583566], score=None, time=1609345848, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582322, text='&gt; if and only if the user is actually aware that is part of the contract<p>And if the user understand s&#x2F;he&#x27;s entering into a contract with Facebook.<p>It&#x27;s very unusual to digitally&#x2F;personally sign a contract when entering a relationship with a site like Facebook giving away a service for no money. It&#x27;s very usual or inevitable (and expected) to do it when starting an online bank account or for a car sharing service, internet and phone providers, even a subscription to music&#x2F;movie streaming or online news, something you pay for. There are usually a lot of forms to fill to enter into those contracts and that makes those contracts very visible and understood.<p>I hope this will be overruled at EU level.')
