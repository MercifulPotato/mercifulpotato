We may get there.<p>The &#x27;middle ground&#x27; is literally &#x27;bought vacuum -&gt; show vacuum&#x27; - and it works.<p>People are emotional about this stuff and aren&#x27;t thinking about it in terms of behaviour, response etc..<p>Some things are negative, toxic, this one is just innocuous: you only notice the vacuum ad because you bought one. Otherwise, it would be a completely random ad for something you truly don&#x27;t care about and you wouldn&#x27;t notice it.<p>It&#x27;s actually technically more efficient to show you stuff &#x27;you might want to buy&#x27; than stuff you &#x27;don&#x27;t even care about a tiny bit&#x27;.<p>Edit: I should add - you see ads for generic products all day long - in fact probably the least value-creating ads are those for really well established brands. Crest toothpaste, laundry detergent etc it has not improved materially in decades (small things maybe) and yet they spend billions on packaging, positioning, huge ads etc.. And yet for some reason it doesn&#x27;t quite bother us.')
