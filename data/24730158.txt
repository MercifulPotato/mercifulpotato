Mainstream programmers are just allergic to Lisp syntax.<p>They don&#x27;t like all the parenthesis, and want a more Algol-like syntax (which, these days, and especially for the users who Julia is trying to attract, means a more Python-like syntax).<p>Lisp for a lot of developers also has an old, stale feel to it.  Programming is dominated by fads, and most programmers (especially younger ones) want instead to chase the new shiny.<p>Decades ago, I read that there were already something like 4,000 languages.  I expect in another couple of decades there&#x27;ll be 4,000 more, with every new generation of developers eager to jump on the bandwagon of yet another new language.<p>Python, once the new kid on the block dethroning Perl, is now itself considered to be kind of old and stale, so people are looking for the new thing.  Maybe Julia is it!')
