My mother had quite a problem with this: She stayed home as she could while we were growing up, occasionally working when we really needed money. She started working more when my brother finally didn&#x27;t need as much care (my brother is 11 years younger, so there was quite a stretch).<p>She got told no because she didn&#x27;t have recent work experience. Childcare simply doesn&#x27;t count unless you are getting paid to watch other people&#x27;s children.')
