Keeping state on the client invokes distributed state concens anyways, and in the case of the Phoenix, at least the VM is well-equipped with the relevant primitives to make distributed state easy, especially.  Basically the only cost you have to pay is if latency is a big deal, you are making a trip back and forth to the server, which could be 100s of milliseconds or more in bad situations... Or even really bad situations, like driving under a tunnel, or being in some stretches of subway.')
