There is a layer of air in contact with the structure at any moment, so it ends up co-rotating, so anywhere inside except the axis of rotation itself will feel a force proportional to the distance from the axis.<p>&gt; When we&#x27;re talking about a generation ship, we&#x27;re talking about something a little larger than the Gravitron.<p>Naturally. You can still spin them along and axis: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;O%27Neill_cylinder" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;O%27Neill_cylinder</a><p>We are a <i>long</i> way from been able to build such structures, and I have doubts about the suitability of human political psychology given the travel times involved and how long countries last for on average, but the physics of spin-gravity is fine, even though there may be noticeable Coriolis effects depending on scale.')
