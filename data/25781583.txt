Item(by='dahart', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610654134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25780183, text='&gt; [site] currently shows advertising for gun accessories next to mostly political news and opinion pieces.<p>I guess this is still somewhat straw man. Ads near politics and opinion on a politically oriented site also isn&#x27;t what was being called out exactly. I guess that it could be summarized as advertising the ammunition to carry out a violent insurrection next to the call to create a violent insurrection (illegally), on a site that is primarily social, mass market, and supposedly politically neutral, that was the problem being called out. Trying to draw broader lines than that makes any argument specious at best.<p>&gt; Does the legality of this advertising depend on whether a person or an algorithm selected the advertising?<p>Currently, no. Currently the advertising is legal regardless. (And note, again, the legality of the ads wasn&#x27;t the issue being discussed.)')
