The #1 issue is that <i>a singular entry point simply doesn&#x27;t exist</i>, largely because of the sheer number of different projects, platforms and use cases involved. The interactive tag cloud was supposed to be the main starting point mechanism, allowing users to explore projects by topic. Yet, somehow this doesn&#x27;t seem to register with people (at all)... Also, all the timelines have tooltips, are clickable and take you to their respective project pages.<p>Comparisons with tools like Processing&#x2F;OF aren&#x27;t right or fair either, because they focus on a <i>much</i> smaller feature range and then rely on external plugins to expand scope. thi.ng projects have a bias (in terms of percentage of sub-projects) towards data structures, geometry and graphics, but, at large, ALSO cover the &quot;full stack&quot; (arrrgh!!) via tools for: baremetal programming (e.g. on Cortex M4&#x2F;7 ARM devices), functional &amp; reactive programming, data processing (transducers, datastructures, querying), there&#x27;re several DSLs &amp; general DSL tooling for creating new ones (parser generators, interpreters, transpilers, VMs), audio&#x2F;DSP (signal generators, oscillators, filters), file format support (importers, exporters) to UI (for web, desktop, in multiple languages)... Also don&#x27;t forget <i>most of these libraries are independent</i>. So I&#x27;m <i>genuinely, genuinely</i> wondering how one would distill this into a traditional landing page setup? Also, how this is comparable to say P5? It isn&#x27;t, not even close!<p>What this discussion has brought out and confirmed again (to me, at least) is the commodification of ideas and the explicit expectation of ideas packaged into easily <i>consumed</i> products. Products, which can be consumed and need to provide a quick sale, regardless of conceptual depth (or breadth in this case)... it&#x27;s a little sad to see! By that logic I&#x27;d need to create 250 websites... and there also somewhat are already: Most projects have their own URL (e.g. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;transducers" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;transducers</a>, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;morphogen" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thi.ng&#x2F;morphogen</a> etc.)<p>I&#x27;m really not trying to be defensive (even if it might come across as such, merely trying to provide more subtlety &amp; context to some of the comments). I&#x27;m thankful &amp; there&#x27;s a lot of food for thought how to approach the next phase of development, but I&#x27;m honestly surprised by some of the comments (esp. from this crowd)')
