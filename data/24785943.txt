Because by telling everyone that they can&#x27;t talk about political issues relevant to women, they don&#x27;t have to shoulder the burden of the majority disagreeing with them?<p>But...by assumption, the majority disagrees with them?  I don&#x27;t get it.<p>I mean, just hypothetically, suppose some group was discriminated against at work.  Women, Black folks, LGBTQ folks, folks with disabilities, whatever.  This discrimination is &quot;political&quot;, in that Serious Politicians disagree about whether it&#x27;s right.  I hope you don&#x27;t think this is a stretch.  You&#x27;re saying that in a world where they couldn&#x27;t advocate for themselves by talking about the issues they face, they&#x27;d be better off?<p>If this is about what&#x27;s best for them, why not let them choose? \n Do we have to be the gatekeepers of what&#x27;s good for them or not?')
