I was building an MVP to test out some idea and forgot to remove the hardcoded secret key when I pushed to github.<p>AWS quickly shut it down and informed me. I came back to find millions of queues created and somebody execute 100 million lambda queries.<p>AWS refunded me and I have been with them since. This is a very different experience to what happened with Google. They ignored my email and basically I learned that if I did a chargeback, they would shut down my other services too.')
