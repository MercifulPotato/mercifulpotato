It made complete sense in 1976 when designing an ISA that might support implementations with an 8 bit memory bus and no cache. Why eat more bus cycles than you need?<p>Fast forward a decade or so and all processors had cache and multi-byte memory bus so the unaligned access and compact instruction streams are no longer necessary.<p>But processors these days are complex multi core beasts with IEEE fpu, simd units, mmu, memory controller, cache controller, pci-e northbridge, all kinds of voltage&#x2F;thermal interplay, and even iGPU. ISA is over emphasized.')
