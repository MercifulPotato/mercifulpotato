On very limited network speed connections such as a last mile ISP connection in a developing nation, where speeds might be under 5Mbps downstream, xz has some advantages in lower transfer times.<p>Often times persons on very limited bandwidth connections (even a Hughesnet or Viasat consumer grade satellite link in a very rural area of the USA) will have more than sufficient CPU to decompress xz in a reasonable amount of time. Such as a five year old core i5 desktop computer.<p>In environments where it can be expected that the bulk of users are on very fast broadband connections, zstd and slightly larger file sizes have an advantage.')
