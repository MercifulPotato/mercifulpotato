It is a lot of fun, and much more powerful for my specific use case than any other around (and probably would fail miserably for any other use case). It took 2-3 days and I regret nothing.<p>There are some novel things though, like, I use markdown files, but separate sections with ``` so I can use different inputs like ```MD for markdown, or ```JSON for pure JSON data, or ```PHP for PHP code. The VS Code highlights the portion of the code correctly, so I can work on many formats&#x2F;languages on the same page. The .md file looks like this:<p><pre><code>   ```INI META\n   includes = docs&#x2F;index.html.md menu menuTop\n   title = Theme\n   base = docs&#x2F;docs.html\n   slug = theme\n   ```\n\n   ```JSON menu\n   [\n       { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Demo&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;&#x2F;demo&#x2F;features&quot; },\n       { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Try it!&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;&#x2F;try.html?d=&#x2F;data&#x2F;try.json&quot; },\n       { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Docs&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;&#x2F;docs&quot; }\n   ]\n   ```\n\n   ```MD BODY\n   # Customize the story\n   \n   Below are the parameters to customize the style of the story.\n   ```   \n</code></pre>\nThen I use a PHP script to serve the content live when in development (no compilation, very fast) and a deploy script to generate the HTML files and upload to AWS S3. Works perfectly.')
