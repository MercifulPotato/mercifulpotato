Arguing about this isn&#x27;t purely academic, either - there have been security vulnerabilities resulting from these differences [1].<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justi.cz&#x2F;security&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;14&#x2F;couchdb-rce-npm.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justi.cz&#x2F;security&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;14&#x2F;couchdb-rce-npm.html</a>')
