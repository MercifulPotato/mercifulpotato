The government gets about 44% of what it costs to employ me (that is, I&#x27;m including taxes that the employer pays the government, but come before the negotiated salary, if that makes any sense).  I then pay about 9% tax on everything I buy (8.875% technically).  This doesn&#x27;t include any healthcare, housing, food, or savings for my retirement.<p>The cost of having a society is high.  The big difference between Europe and the US is that there is some sort of safety net if you become unable to work.  Here, you get a cardboard box under the highway and a stern lecture to try harder next time from a 104-year-old politician that&#x27;s never had a real job in their life.  It&#x27;s good when it&#x27;s good, but it can get bad fast.')
