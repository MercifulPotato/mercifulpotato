It builds extra-symbolic (deep learning) systems that substantially outperform symbolic reasoning on tests specifically designed to require symbolic reasoning.<p>Since today&#x27;s programming is 1000% explicitly symbolic, the potential shift to better methods that are extra-symbolic will be pretty disruptive!')
