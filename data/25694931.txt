Most people won&#x27;t put their life on the line for the revolution if their life is sufficiently comfy.  Revolutions only happen when people have no other choice.  When it&#x27;s revolt or die, you revolt.  When it&#x27;s revolt or watch netflix, most people watch netflix.<p>We&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s different this time, but I bet this time will end up like all the other times it has felt like &quot;the end of civilized society&quot;.  Society just keeps putting along.')
