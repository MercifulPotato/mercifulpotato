Item(by='jacobolus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609527206, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605209, text='Claims that he even <i>read</i> a single full book in the past few decades (with his name on the cover or otherwise) are not credible. They changed the briefing format to a few bullet points in a large font with lots of pictures, and he still doesn&#x27;t bother to read them (Tillerson: he &quot;doesn’t like to read, doesn’t read briefing reports, doesn’t like to get into the details of a lot of things&quot;). He stumbles and mispronounces words when slowly reading a few sentences on a teleprompter (also reportedly set to a much larger than usual font), commonly misreads a word or phrase and then ad libs a nonsensical embellishment to play the mistake off as intentional, and frequently goes entirely off script with visible relief to just speak off the top of his head. There is a deposition video where he flat refuses to read a few sentences of a contract out loud. When people ask him about what he is reading, he grimaces and deflects with an answer about being too busy.<p>The speculation that poor eyesight contributes to his functional illiteracy seems plausible.')
