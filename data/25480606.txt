The New York Times and other institutional press have often done this same thing. Which is, they report from &quot;credible&quot; sources without physical evidence of any kind. A source is considered credible by how much clout it carries with other major institutions or because of a history of trust. i.e. Even though intelligence and the military get things wrong all the time even to the point of outright lying, they are &quot;credible&quot;.<p>This has lead them astray many times in much more significant matters. Once reported, they treat contrary evidence as innuendo in all but the most severe cases of contrary evidence. I think they only bothered with a significant retraction effort here because the evidence of their error was so compelling and public.')
