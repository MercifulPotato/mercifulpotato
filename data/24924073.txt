The flashing colors are very stimulating, but the beauty of this game is that it&#x27;s about judging tradeoffs in a constantly changing environment.<p>Yes, starting at the 4th wave there are too many enemies to track.  The zen of the game is this: you <i>will</i> lose some lives every wave after a certain point.  But the game is generous and you will earn bonus lives every X points.<p>The wandering humans in the game give you 5000 points each, but only after you save 5 in a row.  You can rack up extra lives pretty quickly if you can waver through the robots and obstacles and hit 5+ in a row.<p>So you have always think - will this path through the changing morass enable me to save a large enough chain of \n wandering humans to gain more lives than I&#x27;ll lose?  You have to constantly make &quot;business decisions&quot; to keep your profits (total lives) ahead of a fatal loss (your last life).<p>Not that I can get past wave 14 or 15 though.')
