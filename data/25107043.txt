They probably had to get approval for the 100 days and most likely wouldn’t be allowed to make any decisions regarding the matter themselves. That being said, most labs in the US have to abide by the same guidelines and if this does happen again in a setting where the scientists can choose an arbitrary age to let the fetus live it probably won’t be in the US<p>I have no idea what the process is for other countries like Germany in Japan but I’d like to think they’re similar.')
