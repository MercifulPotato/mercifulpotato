They recently came out with a legal pad version and I love it. It&#x27;s a little more work to convert notes into PDFs (have to manually take a picture) but it&#x27;s a cheaper solution.<p>I&#x27;ve never used a reMarkable tablet but there&#x27;s something off putting for me about using tablets to take physical notes. IDK how to explain it, drawing apps are fine but physically writing symbols, or making charts, or writing notes? It just feels off. I like the rocketbooks because it&#x27;s just a fancier way to implement OCR for handwritten notes and the actions between paper and their product is nearly identical for me.<p>Maybe the reMarkable is able to handle this, just never tried it. It does look better than using something like an iPad for note taking.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getrocketbook.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getrocketbook.com&#x2F;</a>')
