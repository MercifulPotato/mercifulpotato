Item(by='ftreml', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611258887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862874, text='We built a software (Botium Box - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;botium.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;botium.ai</a>) mainly for On-Premise use, and we delivered as Kubernetes, Openshift, Docker. We added a hosted plan later and thought it would be a good idea to just use managed Kubernetes for this offer as it didn&#x27;t require much coding changes.<p>We have to support multiple clouds (Azure and AWS), but with Rancher, it is really easy in usage - setting up new clusters, deploying new services, restarting, logging etc. But now that we built up container technology know-how we are transitioning every service where we don&#x27;t need the scaling capabilities of Kubernetes to plain old docker-compose on baremetal.<p>Thanks for the interesting article, didn&#x27;t know about Nomad and will try it for sure.')
