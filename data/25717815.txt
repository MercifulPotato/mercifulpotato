The book introduces the idea of generational cycles [2] According to the theory, historical events are associated with recurring generational personas (archetypes) and I couldn&#x27;t put it down when I read it over the summer. Several people whom I deeply respect recommended this book, including the famous bond trader Jeffrey Gundlach.<p>After reading the book, it was really no surprise to me when the capital was overrun with rioters. The book convinced me, we could very well have a bloody revolution or war considering the unaddressed underlying conditions: extreme wealth inequality, pandemic, desperation, hunger and feeling like one has no personal stake. The rise of China and decline of the United States contributes to another dangerous possible outcome. The tech industry&#x27;s most recent moves to purge conservatives&#x2F;libertarians may make our social condition even worse, by isolating rather than including the most desperate people in our society.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Fourth-Turning-American-Prophecy-Rendezvous&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0767900464" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Fourth-Turning-American-Prophecy-Rend...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Strauss–Howe_generational_theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Strauss–Howe_generational_theo...</a>')
