I wonder if that makes people with ADHD ineligible for the draft?  I wouldn&#x27;t be mad about that.  I&#x27;m also kind of curious about their reasoning.  Is it fear that they won&#x27;t be able to keep a steady supply of medication all the time (i.e. delivering Adderal to the front lines might not be easy), and that people with ADHD become a liability without it?  Amphetamines seemed fairly successful for the Nazis during the invasion of France, although the rate that they gave them out at ended in massive addiction.  The optics on doing something similar to Nazis is pretty bad, though.')
