I feel like i want to play a Satisfactory-lite. Something that gives me the fun of programming without the complexity. Help me build an abomination of complexity that i don&#x27;t have to maintain. Refactoring shouldn&#x27;t exist in this hypothetical game, maintenance should never be a concern - just forward movement and the joy of unburdened chaos.')
