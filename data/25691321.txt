I’ve never looked back.<p>If you’re willing to live with the defaults, learn the new features, and stop trying to make the system behave like it “always has”, chances are it will treat you very well, but you have to be open to change.<p>Yes it’s vendor lock in, but everything Apple integrates so tightly that even as I’m typing this message on my iPad, I can just press a button and have the unposted comment sent to my Mac to continue there.<p>When you get used to it, other operating systems seems so simple. I use windows 10 at work, and it still amazes me that the last functional search bar in the launcher was in windows 95.
