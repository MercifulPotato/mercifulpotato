It brings up the biggest challenges with load testing. I think the &quot;Maybe don&#x27;t load test everything?&quot; idea is the solution.<p>We have to realise that there is <i>no silver bullet</i>. You can spend 101% of your hours on load testing only, and still not achieve a realistic load test scenario. The trick is to determine how much effort to spend creating (and maintaining) your tests, and&#x2F;or what parts of your app to focus on. Limit the scope. The 80&#x2F;20 rule applies here, like in many other situations; you get 80% of the positive results (i.e. insights into the performance of your app) by spending 20% of the effort. Simple, unrealistic load tests are a million times better than no load tests at all.')
