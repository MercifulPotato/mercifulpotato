Then, if you did not study CS (which I did not so I know), you’re really on your own for figuring out what the heck you’re actually doing when you program.<p>There are some very simple and elegant concepts at the bottom\nof the chain that are really useful to understand, and state machines are for sure one of them.<p>Even with state machines, people often dislike talking about them because they’re seen as impractical since they don’t always have a great correspondence to code. But computation is more than just code.')
