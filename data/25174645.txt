I&#x27;ve been to a few live shows that I learned about from targeted ads.  Those were experiences I enjoyed and would not have learned about otherwise.<p>I&#x27;ll pull up my Insta feed right now and list the targeted ads:<p>Osmo -- This is a game system for my kids that I already own.  The ad isn&#x27;t super useful, except I just learned about a new game they&#x27;re releasing that I might want to get for my daughter.  I may have eventually seen this elsewhere, but this is the first I&#x27;m seeing it.<p>Osmo again.  But from a different vendor.<p>Lego -- They have some new sets that I didn&#x27;t know about.  I enjoy building legos with my kids, so now I know about a few new sets we might enjoy together.<p>Something called Soundbrenner.  It&#x27;s a gadget for musicians.  I&#x27;m not a musician so this doesn&#x27;t interest me.  None the less, I am glad I know about this because I have musician friends who might be interested in something like this, so maybe the next time I talk to them I&#x27;ll mention it, and they may be appreciative of me telling them because it can give them an idea of a new way to improve their play.  Maybe they&#x27;ll buy the gadget, maybe they&#x27;ll find something similar, maybe they&#x27;ll build something similar.<p>A charity for helping teachers during Christmas.  This interests me.  I support education and there is a good chance I&#x27;ll make a donation to this cause.  Now I&#x27;m happy that I found out about this charity.<p>An ad for a service that turns pictures of your pets into hand done oil paintings.  I don&#x27;t have pets, but one of my best friends does as do my parents, so there is a possibility I&#x27;ll use this service as a Christmas gift.<p>A contest to win a Lamborghini featured in a lady gaga video.  This is mistargeted and I have no interest.<p>A food sealing kitchen gadget.  I&#x27;m going to forward this to my wife, who loves cooking gadgets, and then she&#x27;ll check her cooking forums for someone who had a DIY version, but now she has a new idea to ask about.<p>Bed Bath and Beyond.  Meh, don&#x27;t really care.<p>A clothing company that follows the Tom&#x27;s model of buy one give one.  I don&#x27;t like the clothes, but if I did, this is the kind of thing I might support if I need new clothes.<p>Some sort of prescription drug.  The ad doesn&#x27;t even say what it cures.  So I have no interest in this.  However, if it happened to be for an ailment that I actually have, I&#x27;d probably click through to find out more and be a jumping point for my own research.<p>Quicken Loans.  I actually hate this ad because it encourages people to refinance their 30 year mortgage into a 15 year mortgage which is a terrible idea.<p>Another ad for musicians, this time an app.  Same comment as above -- not interested but I may mention to a friend.<p>An ad for a new star wars game in VR.  As it turns out, I recently bought an Occulus (from someone on HN actually) so this might be a game I would be interested in.  I probably would have found out about this later when looking for new games, but this is the first I&#x27;ve heard of this game.<p>Another Lego ad, this time a different set.<p>Anyway, I could keep going, as the ads are endless (although they start to repeat).  The point is, in most of these cases, I learned something new that I didn&#x27;t know before.<p>Yes, in every case, they are trying to get me to spend money.  But it&#x27;s money I probably would have been spending anyway (Christmas presents, games my kids and I can play together, games I can play alone, charity donations).  So I&#x27;m glad that I now have some ideas and places to start looking.<p>In a lot of cases, the ads are just jumping off points for research, but they give me new ideas I wouldn&#x27;t have thought of.')
