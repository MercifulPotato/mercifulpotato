But why do people think she was let go?<p>My understanding is she wrote a paper critical of certain aspects of Google&#x27;s business.<p>They asked her to retract it for revisions  because they didn&#x27;t think it was fair to Google which believed it had made advancements  relevant to her critiques.<p>She thought this review was unfair so she wrote an unprofessional message to an internal group and submitted an ultimatum&#x2F;resignation. Which google accepted.<p>Do you believe that corporations generally accept ultimatums?<p>Do you believe the message she sent out would never be a fireable offense?<p>Do you believe she was let go because she was black or female?')
