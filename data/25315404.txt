At the orientation meeting, the director said nearly all homeless fit into one of these categories:<p>1. Mentally ill<p>2. Addicted to drugs<p>3. Veterans (Gulf War, Vietnam)<p>4. Down-on-their-luck families (debt, sudden medical bills, lost job, eviction, etc.)<p>He said #4 category was the smallest, and these families typically got out of the situation within a year or two at most. A &#x27;Pursuit of Happyness&#x27; type situation.<p>The other problems are much less tractable. The distribution of time spent on the streets was strongly bimodal: people were either on the streets for &lt;2 years, or for decades.')
