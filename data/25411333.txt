Item(by='frongpik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607900515, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25406798, text='A software project is a lot like a house of cards where players around the table (employees) take turns to insert one or a few cards (features) until the house collapses (reorg). At any time a player can leave the table and write his score on the whiteboard - the number of cards inserted. If the house of cards collapses, players who were still in the game lose their score. In addition to that, the owner of the game (VP) can stop it any time and his score will be the total number of cards on the table. The winning strategy is to insert as much bloat as possible and leave just before the house collapses.')
