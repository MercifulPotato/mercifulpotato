I think there&#x27;s good reason people are still skeptical that this is a useful treatment, and this is <i>after</i> many attempted trials. The latest &quot;study&quot; of that I saw (from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0924857920304258" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S092485792...</a>) seems to have compared patients who were very sick (high fever) and received normal treatment against patients who weren&#x27;t very sick (no fever) and received zinc+hydroxychloroquine. When viewed in that way, it should be unsurprising then that the not-very-sick patient cohort fared better then the very sick. Additionally, the report notes that the not-treated people in that not-very-sick group also did much better than the treated people in that group. So, all told, that seems like too little evidence and too late, with the real conclusion being that if you want to avoid being sick, don&#x27;t go get sick.')
