In some countries, mostly developed ones, the policies in place almost always make it a silly choice not to take on a large amount of debt to buy your first house. Even if you have the cash, it&#x27;s always wiser to invest your money elsewhere and use the investment income to pay for the interest part of the loan.<p>Avoiding debt is good advice for 90% of the population who can&#x27;t plan or understand long term commitments relative to their income level. When you understand and internalize that debt is simply a trade of cash flows (you get money now, they get money over time) that can be beneficial to all parties involved, you treat debt as a tool. Sometimes it&#x27;s useful, sometimes it&#x27;s bad, depends on your situation. When your debt starts to accumulate, it means that your prediction of future cash flow was wrong.')
