One would expect that these papers would be contributions that citing scientists could benefit from and use in their own work with impact.  For example if scientist A truly developed an O(N) sorting algorithm, then a scientist B might use it in their work to derive some other result.<p>I guess in some fields of science the effective dependency graph of academic work is very flat, and the true results get plucked and developed by industry (being true results it is actually possible to meet the higher reproducibility bar there).  And the citations don&#x27;t actually reflect the true dependencies, but some political&#x2F;social graph instead.  Too bad.')
