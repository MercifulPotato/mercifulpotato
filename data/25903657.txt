If you&#x27;re planning to keep it, then that value is only an insurance number.<p>A car is potentially worth a lot more if you keep it, especially if the car is low maintenance. With electric cars you trade some value up front (they are typically more expensive) to reduce the maintenance over the long term. But you will still have maintenance like replacing batteries when they go. You saved the cost of filling it up with gas and changing oil for going electric. So the smart move would be to treat your car like you&#x27;re still sort of filling it with gas and changing oil and put that money towards the cost of new batteries when the time comes.<p>Every car has maintenance costs. With electric you just sort of push it down the road a ways when it comes to the battery.<p>You could get a new car... sure.. but now you have a car payment, or you may have thrown a bunch of cash at the problem. But if there&#x27;s nothing wrong with your car except maintenance then put that money into the maintenance. Otherwise you&#x27;re just pretending to care about the environment with your electric car that you probably tell yourself is cheaper (due to gas and oil changes) and better for the environment.')
