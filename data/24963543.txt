Slavery is abhorrent.<p>I am with you in wanting to contribute to ending slavery, and other race based methods of oppression.  Certainly I do not want my consumer dollars to support oppression.<p>With respect to the subject of this article, is a China pen boycott an effective way to protest treatment of the Uyghurs?<p>The Forbes article you link to says &quot;According to a new report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank, Chinaâ€™s been accused of forcing Uyghur Muslims to work at factories that produce goods for well-known global companies including Apple, Nike, BMW, Samsung, Sony and Volkswagen.&quot;<p>Shouldn&#x27;t we be boycotting those companies which knowingly benefit from the oppression?  I imagine you would say yes, and practice such a boycott, aided by some investigation of which companies are knowing beneficiaries.<p>How about the Australian government, currently run by the party in power that is supported by the &quot;think tank&quot; that is the source of your Forbes article&#x27;s information about the Uyghurs?<p>Australia was one of only two nations to vote against a Jordanian draft resolution designed to hasten a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Palestinians suffer a different but equally dismal fate to Uyghurs.  They lose the right to earn an income when Israeli soldiers destroy olive farms that have been in their families for generations, and lack alternative employment because the Israeli occupiers deny them freedom of movement and freedom of importation of goods required for industry.<p>Should we be boycotting Australian made pens too?')
