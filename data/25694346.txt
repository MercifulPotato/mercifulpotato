Maybe it&#x27;s a private company, but it doesn&#x27;t make sense to use that principle to justify a behavior that kills free markets, economic or not.<p>At best it&#x27;s hypocritical, taking advantage of competition at the market level, but then preventing that competition within your company, then praising one and condemning the other. It&#x27;s not consistent, platforms need to be platforms and let the information flow instead of control it.')
