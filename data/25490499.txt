If you are into retrocomputing, of course flight sims top the list of the most important titles. There are some systems for which a flight sim was the only graphical game ever officially released. For others, like the IBM PC, flight sims were a benchmark of compatibility in a time when compatibility didn&#x27;t have a set definition -- vendors who could get the PC releases of MFS and Lotus running on their machines had a pretty solid claim to being &quot;100% IBM compatible&quot;. So they are a critical part of the history of the platform.<p>As for whether &quot;the kids&quot; are rediscovering them, they don&#x27;t appear in classic game compilations (which, again, skew console-y), but retrocomputing YouTubers like the 8-Bit Guy and LGR rekindle interest in these titles. Inasmuch as young people are interested in classic computers, they <i>will</i> come across these old flight sims.')
