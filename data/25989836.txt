Item(by='ssijak', descendants=2, kids=[25990743, 25990779], score=9, time=1612195542, title='Ask HN: Is this simple landing page clear enough?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Yesterday I released my project React UI Boutique (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactui.boutique) in early access. But during the day I got several comments from people not being sure what my product is exactly about.<p>The landing page was a lot longer and to checkout the product you had to login. My logic was that people who are really interested will login and I would then be able to ping them with weekly updates.<p>But, after this comments, I removed login requirement and really simplified the landing page, basically leaving only the tagline and a link that goes to the product.<p>After the page I got a lot more people checking the product and it started getting upvotes on Product Hunt.<p>Is this landing page clear enough for you? My reasoning now is that if you are not my target customer (person using React and&#x2F;or Chakra UI), you will not get the tagline and will just leave the page. But if you are, you will get it immediately and will be able to click through to the product easily.')
