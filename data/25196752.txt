He later visited our hackerspace to present his MyCPU project - a computer he built from ground up, including the CPU, graphics card, operating system and everything else. He&#x27;s an amazing guy and his visit is one of the best memories I have of that place. Our hackerspace is gone now and I&#x27;m so happy he&#x27;s still doing projects like this.')
