Focus length without sensor size (or film size) is a meaningless indicator for FOV.<p>But when it comes to a FOV being equivalent to the human eye, surely we should take display size into account as well. A photo made with a 500mm lens displayed at 4&quot;x6&quot; has exactly the same perspective as a photo taken from the same place with a 50m lens, displayed at 40&quot;x60&quot;. In fact that small picture is basically the same as the large one cropped to the size of the small one.<p>It&#x27;s a factor I never see mentioned. The usual explanation is that a &quot;normal&quot; lens gives more or less the same image when we look through the viewfinder as when we look directly, without the camera. But we don&#x27;t look at photographs through a camera&#x27;s viewfinder; we see them on our screens, on billboards, on prints.')
