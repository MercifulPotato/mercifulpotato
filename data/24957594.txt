I think it helps to have ties to the police, some sort of notion in the public&#x27;s eye that you&#x27;re legalish, and perhaps be able to use an army of foot soldiers as a human shield.<p>I think if I were in organized crime, a good one would be privatizing parking enforcement of city spaces and then being in charge of meter maids. But it can&#x27;t be a single organization in charge of meter maids because then it&#x27;s too obvious. You need it to look diffuse, through a network of companies.<p>Oh, I think body shops are a good one, but auto glass companies too. You could just stage some break-ins that just vandalize car glass. People will blame the guy whose glass was broken (why did you park there, was your car empty, blah blah). You&#x27;re just a glass repair shop so everyone sees you as the good guy. And no one will see that your network of auto glass companies is actually controlled by you.<p>Yeah, auto glass companies in cities are a tremendous opportunity for mafiafication. If they aren&#x27;t already.')
