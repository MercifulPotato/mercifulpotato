A developer might use Electron because it&#x27;s &quot;fast enough&quot; and halves your development time, and &quot;fast enough&quot; is always a perceptual metric, and not a technical one.<p>That&#x27;s not writing a slow program on purpose; that&#x27;s accepting a tradeoff of speed for deliverability. Writing a slow program on purpose means intentionally adding code to make it slower with no other consequence.<p>&quot;Fast enough&quot; can be measured in ms latency for UX purposes. Ex: Websites test and benchmark themselves on load time because they know sales&#x2F;pageviews decrease after too long.')
