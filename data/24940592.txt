When pindab0ter says &quot;punished by a committee for something that <i>wasnâ€™t</i> in the CoC&quot;, you somehow interpret that as &quot;improper enforcement of the CoC&quot;, whereas I interpret that as enforcement action <i>unrelated</i> to the CoC.<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s no point continuing this. I think it&#x27;s pretty clear what pindab0ter was trying to say, but you have a completely different interpretation. Unless pindab0ter wants to come back and clarify, let&#x27;s just stop this here.')
