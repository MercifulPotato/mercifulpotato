(Presumably including sending things directly and privately to people that they know, given how much better a channel that is for child porn than somewhere like Pornhub.) That the internet should be a consume-only place for the output of big corporate content factories whose content can be verified. Except framed in such a way as to make this seem like an anti-corporate stance, rather than the massive pro-corporate grab it is.')
