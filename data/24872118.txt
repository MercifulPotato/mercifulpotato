That reward trigger most people get doesn&#x27;t seem to fire with me, to me I just finished something and now I&#x27;m either waiting for the next thing to do or moving on to another thing.<p>That&#x27;s a major reason I have so much trouble motivating myself to get anything done. Even after I finish something, it has no effect on my mood.<p>If I&#x27;m having trouble with something and suddenly circumstances change where I don&#x27;t have to do it anymore, it actually is a big relief to me and thats the only time I feel an elevated mood after crossing something off a list.<p>It would be interesting to see if microdosing LSD somehow changes that or not.')
