And to bring the coroner out just to verify your time of death.  And all the lost time of the other people on the road delayed because you died or were seriously injured when you didn&#x27;t have to be.  We all pay these costs with higher insurance and higher taxes.  These costs are a drag on society.  Just like smokers, people who don&#x27;t wear seatbelts should pay more for insurance.  Likewise, they should pay more in taxes because they cost more.')
