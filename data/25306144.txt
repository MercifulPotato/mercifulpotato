In particular:<p>- At the dawn of the smartphone market, existing x86 platforms were designed for high-performance applications that were too power-hungry for a mobile phone.<p>- Intel wasn&#x27;t interested in pursing low power mobile phone applications, and sold their XScale line to Marvell.<p>- AMD couldn&#x27;t afford to invest in low power mobile phone applications, and sold their entire handset division to Qualcomm.<p>- VIA wasn&#x27;t in a position to invest in much of anything, much less mobile phones.<p>- MIPS was stagnant and didn&#x27;t really have a clear roadmap or future, and RISC-V didn&#x27;t exist yet.<p>- ARM was available for third-parties to license, whereas x86 was not.<p>As for efficiency, modern multi-core processors spend the overwhelming majority of their transistor budget on logic units and SRAM -- the cost of decoding instructions is trivial. In addition, many of the more esoteric x86 instructions are emulated in microcode. As such, I don&#x27;t see how AArch64 would be inherently more efficient than x86-64.')
