Cycling that is what is necessary, but I do not believe that is an easy thing to do - unlike DHCP, there isn&#x27;t a notion of &quot;connect to cell network, get a cell phone assigned&quot; (for a variety of valid reasons).<p>A more viable approach is to attempt to severely limit the data leakage from apps and the like, but this is a hard balance to strike between app functionality (example: ride hailing app), and preventing analytics which can be performed based on the data those apps collect and, usually unbeknownst to the user, provide to the telco as part of location services.')
