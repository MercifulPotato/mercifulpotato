I can&#x27;t see any kind of popup, but maybe that&#x27;s because i&#x27;m using quite strict defaults with ublock+umatrix in whitelist mode (eg blocking everything non html&#x2F;css&#x2F;image by default). In any case, when i do see such popups i usually either click on any button that closes (including &quot;accept all&quot;), since i&#x27;m blocking everything downstream (why should i trust any of their opt-out anyway), or more brutally i just &quot;zap&quot; the popup with ublock (it auto-creates a rule that will blacklist the given dom element). This last method is particularly useful against the retorse &quot;please login to continue&quot; popup from youtube.')
