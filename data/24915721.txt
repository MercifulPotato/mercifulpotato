Just because <i>your</i> life has not come unraveled overnight doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t for reasons beyond your control having nothing to do with personal virtues or lack thereof.<p>We really need to get universal health care in the US, among other things, to limit how far people can fall when something crazy happens. We are making it far too easy to fall and far too hard to come back from it and this is why we also see headlines about how society is coming unraveled and the like.<p>Please don&#x27;t see this as some bizarre statistical outlier. Many homeless people were solidly middle class at one time and then things came apart and we are terrible about actively making it unnecessarily harder than it should be to get back on their feet.')
