Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[25983594], score=None, time=1612124799, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25978342, text='I&#x27;m not sure I understand, but it seems like you mean greying out fewer comments, i.e. restricting it only to those which are more heavily downvoted? Unless we added some other visual indicator, that would be the same as ignoring the first 1 or more downvotes. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a good idea because there&#x27;s a lot of signal in comments being at 0 points, -1, etc., given that they start out at 1.<p>Two things are true: (1) not all downvoted comments deserve that status; (2) most downvoted comments do deserve that status. #1 sucks, but #2 is really important. The benefit of displaying #2 outweighs the cost of #1, which is not to deny that cost.<p>Of course it would be vastly better to only have the #2 comments displaying as downvoted, but with a community mechanism like downvoting, there&#x27;s unfortunately no way to have only the benefit and not the cost. Moderation can help, though (we&#x27;ll often restore comments that are unfairly downvoted) and maybe there&#x27;s a place for something like vouching to return a comment to a neutral state.')
