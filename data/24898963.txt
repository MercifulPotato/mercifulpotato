I&#x27;m the founder of browserless.io, and agree with pretty much everything you&#x27;re saying.<p>Our infrastructure actually does procedure for some of our scraping needs: we scrape puppeteer&#x27;s GH documentation page to build out our debugger&#x27;s autocomplete tool. To do this, we &quot;goto&quot; the page, extract the page&#x27;s content, and then hand it off to nodejs libraries for parsing. This has two benefits: it cuts down the time you have the browser open and running, and let&#x27;s you &quot;offload&quot; some of that work to your back-end with more sophisticated libraries. You get the best of both worlds with this approach, and it&#x27;s one we generally recommend to folks everywhere. Also a great way that we &quot;dogfood&quot; our own product as well :)')
