You say it&#x27;s the &quot;wrong response&quot;; I&#x27;ve seen people who have their families put under threat of death; they actually lose it. It&#x27;s not some choice of bravado, not an honor thing, it&#x27;s a physiological reaction to the extreme emotional stress.<p>You may not understand this type of situation, but I&#x27;ve experienced the feeling of going from a safe, comfortable environment to being in pain and seeing friends hurt, all in a split second; even with Marine Corps training, I was ready to snap. My hands were shaking, there was a roaring in my ears, and I was ready to kill the first threat I saw. That situation, in my home, with my family? It isn&#x27;t a choice. We are biological creatures, and there are some reactions that are just biological. It&#x27;s easy to play armchair general and discount all of the human factors.')
