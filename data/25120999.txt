All men are equal children of creation; no man is born with the right to stand above another, unless it’s on owned land.<p>I promise that I’m arguing in good faith, and having spoken with countrymen of yours I am certain they too do. I’m glad my country never enforced anything COVID19-related, although I disagree strongly with my socialist rulers.<p>A good exercise to do with a friend, or on pen and paper if it’s socially uncomfortable,  is to try to make your opponents argument as convincingly as you can.
