(see my unpopular comment above downvoted and greyed out.)&quot;.<p>&gt; A downvote, in contrast, isn&#x27;t something that wastes our reading time.<p>Unless the comments we <i>are</i> reading are decided by mob rule, and the ones that are obscured (and potentially meaningful) are merely unpopular.  (I&#x27;ve highlighted greyed out comments on this site.)  The truth is we don&#x27;t know why someone down-votes, unless they annotate it, and even then we&#x27;d have to trust their explanation.  Such an annotation wouldn&#x27;t have to be in line.<p>I don&#x27;t really care, personally, but what did people who down-voted me accomplish?  I didn&#x27;t really learn anything to avoid repeating some behavior--other than re-confirming this is not a place to make waves.<p>&gt; The problem with a shallow dismissal is not just that it&#x27;s thoughtless, but that it&#x27;s thoughtless where everyone can read it.<p>With all due respect, this sounds like a well-worn mantra.  Everyone can also read admonishments against thoughtlessness, maybe they should be taken off-line too, in the interest of fairness.<p>My personal &quot;Eternal September&quot; is kicking in, so I guess I&#x27;ll leave it at that.  Thanks for your reply.')
