Item(by='klmadfejno', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607611415, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25370615, text='I think Netflix&#x27;s anime push is really strong if their goal is to get non-anime-dorks to watch anime. Most anime is pretty terrible, not unlike most tv, but unlike mainstream tv in that it has tons of uncomfortable sexism or weird pedo-inclinations. I find Netflix tends to only grab the better chunk of whats out there, and is funding some really strong original content, which I think is above the quality threshold of some of their live action shows (Great Pretender, BNA, Aggretsuko come to mind).<p>I don&#x27;t typically expect to like a random anime, but I&#x27;m trending towards changing that opinion if I encounter it on Netflix and I don&#x27;t see a tasteless panty shot of a young girl in the first 30 minutes.')
