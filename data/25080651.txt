Nuclear war, is bad, any mass killing is bad, any society collapse is bad.\nIt means actual prolongated suffering for most humans. \nNuclear caused extinction is actually a preferable outcome, I&#x27;d rather just instantly die than live in a brutal post sociatle apocalypse.<p>It&#x27;s like the back talk against climate warming, trying to down play it as a non extinction event. Well that&#x27;s true, We&#x27;re not killing the planet, we&#x27;re not even causing human extinction, we&#x27;re just building a really bad future for our children.<p>Ofcourse people born into that future would see it as the norm, but we make decision from our view point, and the norm can be terrible when taken in to context.<p>But I digress, my point is that the rational community seems to have a smarty pants mentality, taking all rhetoric at face value, and usually creating very serious discussions that usually just sidetrack from the important issues.')
