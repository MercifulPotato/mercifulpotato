I don&#x27;t know if that many people fled the greater NYC metro, whereas SF has a lot of flight to other regions entirely.<p>Anecdote: my parents live in an outer suburb of NYC, about an hour driving with zero traffic, that has a train line to Hoboken (with a couple options to transfer to NYC, or just take a ferry from hoboken) that takes like 90 minutes one-way. They&#x27;ve actually seen a ton of people move into the developments around them this year.<p>People want the space, the lower cost, and it&#x27;s a pretty area near hiking trails and nice parks. Schools aren&#x27;t top-tier but they&#x27;re pretty good.<p>Sure, nobody wants a 90 minute+ train ride every day, but if you only have to do it a couple times a week, and there are tech jobs in NJ itself to eventually seek out, it&#x27;s not a bad choice.')
