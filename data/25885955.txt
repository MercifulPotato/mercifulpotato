It&#x27;s only when they happen to be in very fixed positions that you have any hope to notice a definite image of the NaCl molecule.<p>In general, the very fact that you can see something should be a clear indication that you are not observing quantum behavior: particles whose properties (such as position) are measured DO NOT behave according to classical physics, they no longer display quantum effects. And while we have yet to understand what exactly counts as a measurement, something which allows you to have a picture of the atoms certainly counts.')
