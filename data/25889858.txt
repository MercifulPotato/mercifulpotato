In this guidance, the optimal concentration of fluoride in drinking water is the concentration that provides the best balance of protection from dental caries while limiting the risk of dental fluorosis. The earlier PHS recommendation for fluoride concentrations was based on outdoor air temperature of geographic areas and ranged from 0.7–1.2 mg&#x2F;L. This updated guidance is intended to apply to community water systems that currently fluoridate, or that will initiate fluoridation, and is based on considerations that include:</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4547570&#x2F;?report=classic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4547570&#x2F;?report...</a>. (Public Health Rep. 2015 Jul-Aug)<p>Which goes on to say: <i>For many years, nearly all of these fluoridated systems used fluoride concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 mg&#x2F;L; fewer than 1% of these systems used a fluoride concentration at 0.7 mg&#x2F;L (Unpublished data, Water Fluoridation Reporting System, CDC, 2010). When water systems that add fluoride implement the new PHS recommendation (0.7 mg&#x2F;L), the fluoride concentration in these systems will be reduced by 0.1–0.5 mg&#x2F;L, and fluoride intake from water will decline among most people served by these systems.</i>')
