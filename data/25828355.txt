In fact, we know such people existed, long before today, but let&#x27;s say there are more of them. How that changes anything? There always were hundreds of millions of people who would like nothing better than US government to fall. There were many governments actually falling, including as a result of violent - or non-violent - revolutions. Most of us who are out of elementary school probably could remember several examples they witnessed (hopefully not in person, but at least via the news). Somehow it didn&#x27;t cause people to say &quot;well, if that could happen, probably free speech is stupid, we just need to let our betters on Facebook&#x2F;Twitter rule us now, people are clearly too stupid to handle free speech&quot;.<p>To be clear, I am not claiming those violent people are right or not supporting them. I am just surprised that existence of such people - which shouldn&#x27;t be any news for anyone - suddenly makes somebody to give up on such core ideals as free speech, and not as a result of some civilization-shattering catastrophic event with millions of deaths but as a result of a TV picture.')
