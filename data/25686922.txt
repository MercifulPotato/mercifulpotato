So it&#x27;s slightly slower than my original benchmarks, but still amazing performance (IMHO).<p>Anyways, bottom line is wired networking is always going to be more reliable, but WiFi 6 is fast, and 6E will be even faster as newer chipsets are made available (even on a Raspberry Pi&#x27;s pokey x1 PCI Express lane).')
