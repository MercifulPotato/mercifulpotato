I understand resources are not always plentiful, but they&#x27;ve added a bunch of other features and yet this one is still lacking.<p>This is especially infuriating for &quot;intermediate&quot; domains forming parts of a redirect (Google have changed their subdomain structure recently and placing different Google properties into separate containers is now impossible with Multi-Account Containers due to their redirect structure)<p>The pattern-matching feature in `containerise` looks even better again.<p>Hoping it works as well as it looks; going to give it a try now.')
