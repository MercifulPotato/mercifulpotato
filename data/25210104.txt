So the price of the American show will <i>never</i> be out of reach of your broadcasters.<p>So when a broadcaster imports an American show instead of producing locally, they get a much flashier, more polished product - and it actually costs them <i>less!</i><p>And so, for example, Belgian TV shows more scenes in American courtrooms than Belgian courtrooms. And if American TV shows include American politics, they can&#x27;t <i>help</i> but shove it onto Belgian TV screens.<p>There&#x27;s not a moustache-twirling Uncle Sam deliberately orchestrating this, of course. It&#x27;s just a natural consequence of copyright, deregulation and free trade.')
