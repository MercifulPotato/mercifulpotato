How likely is it that a collision like this (two large satellites, high enough for the fragments to have a long orbital lifetime) occurs in any given year?<p>2. This announcement popped up on HN a couple of days before the event. Are we not able to project potential collisions farther ahead? I would think objects of this size are well tracked.<p>I&#x27;m wondering how difficult it would be to detect these far enough in advance to send something up to nudge one of the dead satellites out of the way.')
