It makes a bold claim in the lede - &quot;a de facto union of media outlets, Silicon Valley giants and the intelligence community to suppress these stories&quot; and offers no specific evidence for it.<p>It seems like Greenwald&#x27;s gist is that circumstantial evidence is enough proof - that this story is so obviously important that not covering it prominently is &lt;i&gt;prima facie&lt;&#x2F;i&gt; evidence of bias.  That&#x27;s a reasonable opinion, but that&#x27;s all it is, and if you didn&#x27;t already believe it, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything here to change your mind.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t see the bombshell part.  All I see here is that most journalists want Biden to win, and sometimes politicians&#x27; kids get sinecures they don&#x27;t deserve.  I knew both of those things last year.  The whole debacle like an obvious attempt to smear Biden Sr with salacious stuff that his kid did, and the only reason it&#x27;s getting this much attention is that, unlike Trump, Biden doesn&#x27;t have any other scandals to talk about.')
