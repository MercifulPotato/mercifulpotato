I defer to economists here which is something you’re free to hold against me.<p>Re (2) I’d be very interested in learning more about the delta between CPI and these baskets. Do you happen to have a reference? I’m always down to learn more.<p>Re (3) I agree that inequality has gotten worse but I see that as a social and fiscal policy matter and not a monetary policy matter. If we’d been using gold, the same trend would have manifest. Poor people don’t hold onto money anyways they’re hand to mouth. And any extra they happen to hold onto could have been invested anyways. Frankly minimum wage over the period hasn’t been indexed to inflation either!<p>I’m a huge advocate of decreasing the gap between the rich and poor, I have more than I need to be sure, and the best way to do that is taxation.<p>This gap between rich and poor really started widening after the Reagan era tax cuts and trickle down economics. If you look back the top marginal tax rate in the US in much of the 1900s was 80-90%. Estate tax the same. If you reduce that to 37%, rich people get richer because they keep more and more of their wealth. A practically 0% estate tax ensures the next generation starts on a monopoly board where there’s a hotel on every square. To me that’s a much clearer correlation than the spooky action at a distance of this 2% (a figure you admittedly contested) inflation rate. Do the ultra wealthy really hold cash? Do the poor? Does anyone?')
