Is this Thunderbolt 3? Is this DisplayPort-over-USB? Is this cable too long to be fast? Oh, this cable doesn&#x27;t work for power. Oh that&#x27;s actually not a power-equipped USB-C slot. Does this hub work? Oh, it only works for ports, not video. Etc etc etc.<p>I&#x27;ve literally taken to color-coding cables to know which ones I can use where, and if I just stuck to macs and high-end cables, sure, fine, but I have about 10 other devices that have &quot;things&quot; that plug into USB-C slots, but what those things can do and what they need to do them...<p>It&#x27;s not helpful that Amazon has become a sludge of crappy products with fake reviews. Even I&#x27;ve ended up lulled in a few times and picked up something that just didn&#x27;t work as specified at all.')
