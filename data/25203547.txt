I had to implement a lying progress bar at the behest of my client.  We could not reliably predict much...network speed, file size, moon phases, sock colour, etc would change things all the time.  The client wanted to show the customer that &quot;things were happening&quot;... so we made the bar always move.  The logic was that once it hit 90% or more, customers seemed to be invested and would wait forever.   And yes, we tracked the abandonment percentage against progress bar percentage.')
