If this is very important to your workload, you should consider them. I think this is caused by the fact that Intel&#x27;s memory controller is more tightly integrated, while the AMD memory controller is on the other side of some wires from the cores. AMD compensates with huge cache sizes, but every time they increase the cache size they also make the cache slower, which isn&#x27;t great.')
