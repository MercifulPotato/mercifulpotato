Nothing ever happens. I don&#x27;t see evidence that Apple&#x27;s decision making is affected by what their users think. It took them three years to fix the keyboards even when they were objectively broken.<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t want side loading because it would mess up their revenue stream. Not because they care about their customers. Look at the lengths they are going to avoid USB-C on the iPhone, a technology they pioneered, just to protect their revenue stream.')
