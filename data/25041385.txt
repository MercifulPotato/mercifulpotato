Item(by='Jugurtha', descendants=None, kids=[25041639], score=None, time=1604966011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25041215, text='In the video[0], the title is &quot;Crown prince on Khashoggi killing: &#x27;A heinous crime that cannot be justified&#x27;&quot;.<p>He does not say that in the video. The translation is wrong, and the title is wrong. He literally says &quot;It is a horrible incident&quot; (&quot;هو حادث بشع&quot;). There is no &#x27;heinous crime&#x27; in there.<p>That is the problem. In article after article, and video after video I have seen about this, people stretched things, did not call things by their name, talked about evidence, translated wrongly.<p>I am not saying that they did not do it. I am saying that this was a mess, and my initial point was that if something like this, with news organizations involvement world wide, a scandal that involved multiple governments, people still make a mess and a version that is absolutely fact based is still not there, then there is little hope for the things we don&#x27;t hear about.<p>You may be mistaken thinking I&#x27;m defending a government and you seem to think you&#x27;re producing evidence. I&#x27;m just telling you that what you think evidence is may not be. If you or I were ever accused of something, I bet we&#x27;d want the concept of evidence to be much more than the Times mentioning phone calls and video footage and people saying &quot;but bonesaws.. footage.. dismembered.. operative&quot;. The same way we&#x27;d like wars not to be waged because someone dangles &quot;evidence&quot; in a vial addressing the United Nations.<p>What I stated earlier is correct. &quot;Everybody knows&quot; because &quot;everybody knows&quot;[1].<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;saudi-arabia-now-admits-khashoggi-killing-was-premeditated-n924286" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;saudi-arabia-now-admits-k...</a><p>- [1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Argumentum_ad_populum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Argumentum_ad_populum</a>')
