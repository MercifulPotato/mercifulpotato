Improved security isn&#x27;t going to fix the problem, but we can make it less profitable and make that profit more difficult.  If our policy is to pay we&#x27;re just making it highly profitable with very little effort on the part of the attackers. If we refuse to pay, they will have to pour over our data looking for what may or may not be valuable to anyone, spend time searching for those people who might pay them for it, and then spend time convincing them to pay enough to justify their time&#x2F;efforts.<p>We should be refusing to pay and making sure we&#x27;ve got backups of our own stuff so that we&#x27;ll never have to.')
