Some times it happens that I type messages that are sent after _seconds_. So far it is the worst messaging app that I ever used.<p>I very much like the idea of Teams itself, but the implementation is really bad IMHO.<p>Since in the back it&#x27;s just sending HTTP JSON requests, I feel like an alternative client can be eadily written: but so far I haven&#x27;t seen anyone who tried to even write a library for it. I guess I&#x27;ll be the first then (:')
