That one paid off.<p>In another car (same mfr) I looked into getting one when the regular warranty was about to run out.  Sales guy looked and said: main thing that happens to these older cars is X and Y and you already replaced X so it&#x27;s not worth it.  I always wondered if what he really meant was &quot;main thing that happens is something expensive and I&#x27;d rather get paid retail to fix that&quot;.  Either way I skipped it and never had a problem.<p>I do consider it insurance.')
