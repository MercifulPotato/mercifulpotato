(That gives them two years before the House might flip.) In today&#x27;s we&#x27;re right and they&#x27;re wrong -- which is how each side sees it -- one-party rule could get interesting.<p>What people seem to keep forgetting is that only one Presidential candidate has ever gotten more votes than Trump got in this last election and that was Joe Biden. Both the far right and far left wings need to be reigned in.')
