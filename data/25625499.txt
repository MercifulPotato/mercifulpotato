A few angels DMed me showing their interests to invest. But...<p>1. It&#x27;s not a money-burning project. I have no employee, also no plan to buy ads.\n2. Idk what it feels like if I take someone&#x27;s money. Will it have too much pressure? So far I&#x27;m really enjoying doing this on my own pace.<p>Well, I also have three reasons to take their money:<p>1. Quit my day job without worrying financial stability\n2. Use Angel&#x27;s network to get more users\n3. I&#x27;m noob on this VC thing, maybe getting a good angel as a mentor would also help?<p>How do you folks thing? Should I take or kindly say No? Thank you!')
