Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611956082, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25962519, text='&gt; * What purpose does the Jury serve in 2021? Made sense in the 18th century, doesn&#x27;t now. Look at Oracle v Google, 12 totally qualified people made that decision (spoiler, they weren&#x27;t)<p>I&#x27;m speculating, but I think the idea was to put a check on the authorities by placing the actual decision-making power in the people.  I think that&#x27;s a valid principle.  Even if Oracle v Google was a bench trial (e.g. no jury), the judge would still probably have to be educated on the technical issues, just like a jury.<p>IIRC, technically a jury could even decide the law is BS and refuse to convict for that reason alone, but the system puts up a lot of roadblocks to reduce the change of that happening (e.g. the defense counsel can&#x27;t argue for it or remind them of that option).<p>&gt; * Why do such a mind numbingly high amount of public defender cases end in plea bargains, and why is the average time spent by a public defender on any given case in the order of _minutes_ in _any_ region of the wealthiest nation around?<p>Because public defenders are underpaid and overworked, and that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s an easier sell to the voters to raise taxes to hire police to lower crime than to raise taxes to hire public defenders for fairer government.  There&#x27;s also been a history of &quot;tough on crime&quot; rhetoric&#x2F;attitudes that makes it even more difficult.  Also: the suspects on crime shows are almost always actually guilty (whether successfully convicted or now), which creates the impression that it&#x27;s the job of defense lawyers to help the guilty go free.<p>&gt; * What&#x27;s up with private prisons, and how can they argue they don&#x27;t have a negative impact on recidivism?<p>I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;s arguing this, but my guess it&#x27;s probably someone who benefiting from that industry.  My vague recollection was that private prisons were sold as a cost-saving measure, like most privatization schemes.')
