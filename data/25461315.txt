Although they still don&#x27;t do two things I really like: 1) long, slow changes in light (my lights dim from 7 to 10 pm, but I think the app is limited to 1 hour), 2) color temperature shifts as part of that (my lights go from very warm at &quot;dawn&quot; to very cool at noon and back to very warm at &quot;dusk&quot;.<p>Mine is also more opinionated; I can turn on the lights manually, but they&#x27;ll go back in sync to the schedule after a bit. Whereas with the Hue app, if I change the lighting during an automatic cycle, it stops the automation until the next trigger point.')
