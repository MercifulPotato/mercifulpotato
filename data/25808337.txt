The NSA actually used to be good, and generally useful towards securing our digital borders. SELinux, for example, was a contribution to the linux kernel that is generally highly regarded and well vetted, and it was freely given to us plebs that don&#x27;t have nuclear arsenals to secure.<p>But now, everything is different. They&#x27;ve been telling us to use flawed crypto algorithms simply because they know how to break them and they can have access to whatever they want. With our current-day NSA, our least risky choice is to consider the NSA an adversary, just like North Korea, Russia, or China. Nothing they say should be taken at face value.<p>Pretty shitty that we have to treat our own government security agencies like that.')
