Item(by='fouric', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608568946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25495997, text='&gt; the Lisp languages never took off after the 2000s<p>&gt; I see no &quot;enlightment&quot; in learning Lisp<p>&gt; the Lisp family is almost dead<p>You&#x27;re conflating popularity with value, and the two are <i>very</i> different.<p>Moreover, you&#x27;re missing the fact that most of the features that were <i>invented in Lisps</i> (like GC, lambdas, first-class functions, and REPLs) are now wildly popular, with every modern language having taken several ideas from Lisp.<p>Furthermore, you don&#x27;t seem to understand that a language is not the sum of its parts. Python, Java, C++, and the rest of the languages that have been grafting on Lisp features do <i>not</i> have the unifying design philosophy that Lisp does, which is precisely the &quot;enlightenment&quot; that you don&#x27;t think exists.<p>Finally, by the nature of &quot;enlightenment&quot;, you can&#x27;t see or understand it until it hits you. As someone who is stubbornly refusing to learn Lisp, you by definition <i>cannot</i> judge whether or not you might have a galaxy-brain moment if you attempt to learn it. (it&#x27;s perfectly possible that you&#x27;ll learn it and have no moments of revelation, but you can&#x27;t even tell whether or not that will be the case until you try)')
