The only thing it&#x27;s missing is the ability to quickly filter by group. Currently you have to open app -&gt; 3 dot menu -&gt; filter -&gt; select group (4 steps total), whereas the authenticator I&#x27;m currently using allows you to side swipe -&gt; select a group (2 steps), or add a shortcut on homescreen that opens the app with the filter enabled (1 step).')
