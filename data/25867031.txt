They are the only provider that doesn&#x27;t lose by having heavily commoditized, open source backend software - they can support profitable operations at a much lower cost point than these mid-sized companies like Elastic&#x2F;Mongo<p>Elastic, and the &quot;open source business model&quot; companies certainly should have seen this coming. But the attitude in the early 2010s was &#x27;lol open source fun, figure out business model later&#x27; and somehow VCs bit and a company like Elastic could take off. They shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.<p>I would rather live in a world where a mid-sized company like Elastic could thrive than an AWS monoculture. Most things Amazon make me feel icky... but I also feel like this is the reality of open source... its not really open source if it&#x27;s entirely associated with one company..')
