Most people who value self-growth are ultimately doing so as a means to achieve vain values.  That is, the reason you want to continue growing is because you want to be better than others, or build wealth or status.  You may trick your mind into thinking you genuinely enjoy self-improvement, but I&#x27;ve found that the moment to moment experience of self-improvement is often grueling and if you enjoy the process, it&#x27;s most likely because of one of these vain values.  The exception is if you happened to have parents who instilled self-growth as a primary value throughout your childhood -- then, it will actually feel like an end in of itself.<p>Ultimately, I think people will be better off choosing intrinsic values that are not conditional on external forces or comparison to others.  That said, as long as you can achieve your values, however vain they may be, more power to you!')
