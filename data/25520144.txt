Fine, but make sure you know what your assert does, and when it does that, if you have a debug and release build (which I think you probably shouldn&#x27;t.)<p>I&#x27;ve spent some time with &quot;offensive&quot; programming in the context of both security (like key leakage) and safety (like firmware integrity). It was just kinda funny thinking about meetings spent determining what we could do if i2c or something wasn&#x27;t responding, and different approaches to try and fix it, and then a year later going back and saying, ok, if something isn&#x27;t working, we&#x27;ve got an easy answer. Lockdown and halt boot. Anything seems weird, just stop trying.')
