Developers changed that by realising that Macs were good dev machines and writing software that ran on Macs.<p>Non-tech people ask their tech-savvy friends for advice on what tech to buy. For years that was &quot;buy Apple; it costs more but they&#x27;re more reliable, the support is great, and they&#x27;re way cooler&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s no longer the case. There are manufacturers shipping great Linux laptops, that just work, and it is actually feasible to recommend one to a friend. And running Linux is way cooler these days - every muppet out there has a Macbook ;)')
