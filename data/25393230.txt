The <i>women</i> woke up in the morning and cooked for everyone else.<p>&gt; It was so nice to have that much support around all the time.<p>People have written about this in books that are now almost four decades old. Everywhere women entered the workforce in a highly compensated way, this arrangement came to an end, the number of children went down, etc.<p>Of course on Hacker News, where maybe 9% or less of the commenters are women, there are people fondly writing about these pastorals where the women do all this crappy work. It&#x27;s completely bonkers. Or it&#x27;s the men who come from immigrant backgrounds, looking at photo albums of grandmas and grandpas in school, not admitting how rare it was for the average person, in the 50s, to go to college - that your family isn&#x27;t average, it was rich in all the ways that mattered, even if in some superficial sense it was a destitute or hardscrabble life.<p>It&#x27;s easy to explain the rise in time spent alone among the oldest Americans. You&#x27;re really observing a trend in reduced dependence.')
