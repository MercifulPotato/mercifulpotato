As a result an entire field of science has been taken over by people who are convinced that the correlation between Alzheimer&#x27;s and amyloid plaques in the brain is proof of causation.  When attempts to treat people on the basis of this theory failed, they doubled down on the theory rather than questioning their reasoning.  The result has been decades of failure and suppression of all alternate lines of research.<p>As a result, billions of dollars have been spent researching only one idea.  Which means that the arrival of effective medications has been delayed by a generation.  Or possibly two.  As a result of which, each year we spend hundreds of billions of dollars treating the tragedy of millions of Americans living with dementia.  Most of whom likely would not have dementia today if alternate lines of research had been allowed to flourish decades ago.<p>There are some pieces of stupidity that we should be allowed to get angry about.  Here is a comparison.  The number of people trapped in misery RIGHT NOW from Alzheimer&#x27;s is a multiple of how many Americans would be projected to die if we all caught COVID-19 right now and nobody got treatment.  But Alzheimer&#x27;s happens in slow motion and there is no public awareness of the size of the debacle.  So only a small fringe gets upset about it.<p>Personal note.  About 20 years ago I got interested in the topic, and concluded all of what I just said.  However I&#x27;m not in medical research, and even if I was it would have been impossible to get funding for researching the myriad of root causes that had not been investigated.<p>I didn&#x27;t learn anything that added to this picture until 2 years ago.  That is when articles came out identifying that infection appears to have a causal relationship (rather than the mere correlation of amyloid plaques), and people became aware of research demonstrating that anti-viral drugs can reduce the rate of Alzheimer&#x27;s by 80%.<p>Now for evidence that adherence to theory really did cost us a generation.  As <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;observations&#x2F;could-alzheimers-be-a-reaction-to-infection&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;observations&#x2F;could-alzh...</a> points out, the correlation between HIV-1 and Alzheimer&#x27;s was demonstrated in 1997.  Clinical research demonstrating the anti-virals help with Alzheimer&#x27;s came out in 2011.  Both results sank without a trace for years.<p>By contrast if people studying Alzheimer&#x27;s had the intellectual honesty to keep saying that amyloid plaques are only shown to be correlated with Alzheimer&#x27;s, then the 1997 research would have likely spurred follow-up research faster.  And the positive 2011 result would have resulted in adoption much faster.<p>But instead they dishonestly doubled down through decades of failure.  And effective prophylactic treatments THAT ALREADY EXIST won&#x27;t be likely to become common medical practice for many years to come.  How many more lives are being destroyed <i></i>every day<i></i> due to this ongoing stupidity?<p>Basic epistemological mistakes have consequences.  The consequences of this one are staggering.')
