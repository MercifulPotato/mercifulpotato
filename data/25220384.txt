But I&#x27;m quite sure many see those features as a bit more than that, hence it is quite a popular tool to use in conjunction with browser extensions.<p>&gt; Why do I have to install Node<p>Because web developers who do JavaScript for a living find it easier to write JavaScript to support their developer tools. Not a huge surprise here. I&#x27;m sure if you find the time to write the &quot;simple text-mangling&quot; in Rust, support it and maintain it, people would be more than happy to use it. But why rewrite something that works well enough for the intended users?<p>Speaking of cargo-cultism, you seem to have a bit of that stench on yourself as well, where suddenly every utility &quot;should of course&quot; be written in Rust, or otherwise be rewritten in Rust if they are not doing it yet.<p>Programmers will scratch their own itch with the languages that are familiar to them. Of course web extension dev tools will be written in languages and platforms that are the closest to the web ecosystem, which today is JavaScript.')
