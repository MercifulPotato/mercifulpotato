Net fuel consumption&#x2F;emissions is different than &quot;rocket emissions&quot;.  Rocket fuel isn&#x27;t diesel.  The emissions from the actual rocket in flight do not capture the total emissions generated in the creation&#x2F;preparation&#x2F;compression of rocket fuels.  Some rockets produce literally zero carbon during flight (liquid hydrogen + liquid oxygen = water) but that doesn&#x27;t mean plenty of coal&#x2F;oil wasn&#x27;t used in the creation of those fuels.')
