Item(by='zapita', descendants=None, kids=[25577360], score=None, time=1609286527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25572710, text='If AB5 was bad, then a good reaction would be to lobby the state legislature to amend it. Prop 22 doesn’t just circumvent AB5: it makes it virtually impossible to improve it via the legislative route.<p>Here is the specific language:<p><i>After the effective date of this chapter, the Legislature may amend this chapter by a statute passed in each house of the Legislature by rollcall vote entered into the journal, seven-eighths of the membership concurring, provided that the statute is consistent with, and furthers the purpose of, this chapter.</i><p>This means two things:<p>1) To make a change that is <i>consistent</i> with the purpose of prop 22 (that is to say, that proponents of prop 22 would agree to), an 7&#x2F;8 congress majority is required. This is highly unusual, and not a coincidence: to achieve such a majority requires getting the California GOP on board. California Republicans are mostly irrelevant at the state level, but they have endorsed prop 22, and this is their reward: a permanent veto over any incremental changes to a crucial section of California labor law.<p>2) To make a change that is <i>inconsistent</i> with the purpose of prop 22 (for example to reverse it), a new ballot measure must be adopted. Although that is technically not impossible, in practice it may as well be. Uber and Lyft spent $80m on this ballot measure, and could easily double that if required. Their natural opponents, unions, could barely raise $5m the first time around. They simply don’t have pockets deep enough to compete.<p>Whether you supported or opposed AB5, it should be common sense that California’s democratically elected congress should have authoroty over California law. Prop 22 establishes a new reality where that is no longer the case: for $80m dollars, you can essentially buy yourself a permanent exemption. That is incredibly dangerous.')
