Item(by='mabbo', descendants=None, kids=[25894498], score=None, time=1611500544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25892188, text='&gt; That&#x27;s very condescending<p>You&#x27;re right. I apologize. Often times in tech, the people asking questions like that are uninterested in the answers.<p>My own view is that I have been blind to the advantages that my background (white, male, straight, upper-middle-class) has given me for my entire life over other friends and colleagues. And I&#x27;m trying to learn more, read more, and pay more attention to these things.<p>Ijeoma Oluo, who I mentioned above, comes from tech. She saw a lot of things that you and I wouldn&#x27;t notice. Things that matter, and we don&#x27;t even see it. So she writes, she talks, and she makes a lot of great points. And it&#x27;s <i>really</i> hard to read and listen to her sometimes because she makes points that part of me does not want to hear.<p>So that&#x27;s the <i>ethical</i> reason why it matters.<p>As to the original question: Diversity of backgrounds can lead to diversity of ideas. Not on every problem. Not every day. But often enough that it can matter. And it can happen in many cases that you and I would not expect or predict. More diversity of ideas leads to better solutions being found. That&#x27;s the premise- you don&#x27;t have to believe it and many don&#x27;t.<p>In the 1980s, Frito-Lay&#x27;s CEO, who had never imagined the Latino market, put out a call for ideas. A Latino janitor answered the call with his idea- Flamin&#x27; Hot Cheetos. It was a huge hit. Imagine how many markets they (and others) were missing because of a lack of diversity of ideas.')
