They allow margin trading and I think anybody would agree that buying GME at these crazy prices on margin is incredibly risky. If the traders can&#x27;t pay, Robinhood or their bank&#x2F;insurers are on the hook. Also even though the narrative here is Robinhood traders vs hedge funds, surely there are also a lot of shorts on Robinhood too, so there&#x27;s more margin risk from those too.<p>However why not just disable margin trading on these stocks instead of shutting them off altogether? I don&#x27;t really know enough to say. Maybe there are additional risks somewhere unrelated to margins? Or maybe the upstream market makers are forcing their hand. Or maybe it&#x27;s some combination of reasons, including pressure from people who are on the losing sides of these bets.<p>&gt; Why should Robinhood pick a winner (siding against their own customers)<p>As others have often pointed out, Robinhood is in some ways analagous to social media companies. Their end users are not their customers, because it&#x27;s a free service. The customers are the businesses on the other end, in Robinhood&#x27;s case the market makers who are paying for the right to front-run trades. If this is no longer profitable for them due to crazy volatility, they can apparently stop allowing trades at any time.')
