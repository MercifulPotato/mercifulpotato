I frequently use swiping for bilingual English + Romanian (a language which tends to have much longer words than English) conversations, and it generally works very well, even bilingually. I would note that I&#x27;m using some Microsoft keyboard for Android, I forget its name, and it is explicitly configured for both languages.')
