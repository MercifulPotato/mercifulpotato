For example, there&#x27;s been a long running series of LLVM bugs that has (several times) required  Rust to stop emitting that metadata because it would actually <i>miscompile</i> fairly simple vector operations that used `restrict`[1]. I&#x27;m hopeful that Flang (the Fortran LLVM compiler) will shake most of those out, since there&#x27;s a large body of Fortran code that relies on good aliasing optimizations.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;rust&#x2F;issues&#x2F;54878" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;rust&#x2F;issues&#x2F;54878</a>')
