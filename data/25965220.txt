I had to double check a bunch of time whether you can get HDR with 8-bit displays. It seems like not all TV panels out there are 10-bit and they still claim to support HDR.<p>That&#x27;s why I played the Spears and Munsil test pattern video with a 8-bit and 10-bit pattern on the same video. The 10-bit pattern was smooth which convinced me that it was outputting 10-bit signal. I also confirmed the TV and monitor I used has a 10-bit panel (not 8-bit + FRC).<p>&gt; monitor preferences and look for 10-bit or 422 or 444. If you see 420 or 8-bit<p>I tried the monitor info but didn&#x27;t find this information. Neither in the TV info. Also Apple hides this information in their System Report.<p>If you have other tests in mind, I&#x27;m happy to test more and get to the bottom of this :)')
