I think it probably plays a bit better on mobile than desktop, but it was still great amounts of fun.\nA suggestion for making it play better on desktop is to reverse the scrolling so &quot;old&quot; parts go below the &quot;current&quot; part, and maybe mess with some text alignment so options aren&#x27;t &quot;jumping around&quot; -- makes it easier to navigate quickly :D<p>Overall this is extremely fun, and looks like it was a very fun little project!')
