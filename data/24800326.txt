The green lines you see drawn on a Landranger map are just that: lines on a map. I don&#x27;t need to explain how having a routable database would make a project like Slow Ways so much simpler.<p>OS, of course, doesn&#x27;t have accessibility information like stiles, gates, or surface quality, which OSM often has.<p>I love OS maps, but they are increasingly being marginalised to B2B applications (particularly utilities) and keen walkers. Most UK cyclists have migrated to OSM and, judging from people I see out and about here in the Cotswolds, casual walkers are increasingly going that way too.')
