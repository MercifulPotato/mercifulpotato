Just download your mail using IMAP or POP3 and archive it locally.<p>I recently deleted my last Gmail account (that I had since 2001). Before doing it, I tried Google&#x27;s Checkout to get the data, but it was adking me for &quot;verification&quot; (i.e. more info about me) to finish the download.<p>I just fired up Thunderbird, configured a IMAP account and... done. Almost 20 years of e-mais are now backed up at home and on a Nextcloud instance I keep on a Linode VPS.<p>Web is not the only way to read e-mails, friends. Use a proper client and back it up.')
