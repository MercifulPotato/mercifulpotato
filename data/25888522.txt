The wave function gives you both a position and a momentum (and other properties).</i><p>It&#x27;s much better to imagine that electrons don&#x27;t have a property that is position and other that is momentum. Classic object have both. Electrons have neither. You can measure one of them, or the other, or some mix, but until you measure them, these properties don&#x27;t exist.<p>&gt; <i>we know that classical objects have identity.</i><p>It&#x27;s only an approximation. They can swap electrons using quantum mechanics or swap them using the thermal energy. It&#x27;s easier to see with two glasses of water a few foots away. There is a tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiny probability that a molecule of water decides to go from a glass to the other using quantum mechanics, but also it could just evaporate and after some time reach the other glass and dissolve. Anyway, the fact that both glasses are exchanging molecules classically does not prevent us to assign them an identity as an approximation.<p>About the canon with an electron and the benzene: When the electron is far away, you can assign it an identity as an approximation and all the calculation would be fine. When it is very close to the benzene of going thru the molecule, you must use the quantum mechanic version of the equation that assume all the electrons are identical. After a while, when the electron is far away, you can assign again an identity to the electron. The problem is: How are you sure that the electron that exits the molecule is the same electron that entered the molecule?<p>The answer is that you can&#x27;t! Because they are all identical. In similar experiments you must do both calculations, when the electron that enters the molecule is the same that the electron that exits the molecule, and when it is a different electron, and the result is a combination of both.<p>When you use a neutron you can almost assign an identity and don&#x27;t worry about weird things. (There are possible weird thing, but the probability is just too small.)<p>It is more interesting if you replace the neutron with a neutrino. When the neutrino is very close to an electron it can emit a W+ particle and get transformed into en electron. The election of the molecule that absorbs the W+ particle now gets transformed into a neutrino. So if you see that the neutrino went thru the molecule, you are not sure that it is the same neutrino or that it exchanged it&#x27;s place with an electron in the molecule, so you must calculate both cases and combine them.')
