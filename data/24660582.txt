It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s completely uncorrelated, but it is less correlated than other public companies tend to be.<p>&gt; It is also difficult to evaluate the volatility of an asset if the price is evaluated infrequently.<p>Yep, you&#x27;re absolutely right. This is sometimes called the &#x27;liquidity premium&#x27;. People tend to pay less for illiquid assets than liquid assets, all else equal. Which means that investing in illiquid assets should, all else equal, produce better risk-adjusted returns on average over time, especially if you are selling them after they become liquid.')
