Tether, even if fraudulent, has very little impact on bitcoin. How do I know this? There are currently 24 Billion dollars worth of tether in existence. The <i>daily</i> volume of bitcoin in dollars is almost three times that much. Even if tether wasn’t backed by dollars on a 1:1 basis, it would have a small impact on the current market cap of bitcoin. This is important because many people say tether is proof that bitcoin price is heavily manipulated and inflated. The reality is that selling $24 billion dollars worth of bitcoin won’t move that needle that much.<p>2. I have no reason to not trust tether. If it is one day revealed that there are no dollars backing the minting of tether, then so what? See point #1. People have been curious about Tether for years, and for good reason: it’s the first successful stablecoin (success in the sense that it actually gets used).')
