It&#x27;s quite literally like nothing else.<p>Living in a neighboring country I understand <i>nothing</i> of Finnish. Spanish, Italian, French â€” I can make some sense out of it without knowing the languages.<p>I must however add that I&#x27;ve witnessed, more than a handful of times, English speaking knowledge workers moving to Sweden who continue speaking English and only English for years and years.<p>It comes with a social price though. You will never quite understand all the social codes or become a part of the social fabric. At many parties and dinners I&#x27;ve seen the whole group having to switch to English because there&#x27;s someone in the group who has lived here for five or ten years and still haven&#x27;t gotten around even attempting to speak Swedish. Everyone will switch but but it will be a different night, without all the nuances we usually enjoy. In the end everyone loses.<p>If you plan to stay, do everything to learn the language. You will be happier person in your new country.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Finno-Ugric_languages" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Finno-Ugric_languages</a>')
