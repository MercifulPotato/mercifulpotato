Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=[24843287], score=None, time=1603232867, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24842576, text='I&#x27;d be skeptical of a definition of intelligence that had <i>no</i> correlation with IQ scores.  If you managed to put forth and defend such a definition, then that could turn into a valid objection; but that would then run into the &quot;psychological trait heritability&quot; prior.<p>&gt; Its equally hard to argue for an average of things which are not faithfully represented by numbers.<p>How do you represent, say, extroversion with numbers?  It&#x27;s messy and any particular measure is probably not a good one, but what people do is come up with a list of questions like &quot;Statement: I am excited when I go to a social event full of strangers; rate your agreement from 0 (Strongly Disagree) to 4 (Strongly Agree)&quot;, and add up the numbers to create a score.  It&#x27;s kind of arbitrary and has a lot of &quot;noise&quot; in it, but on the other hand there is enough signal that it is measuring something real.  If you need to turn it into a binary classification, you choose a cutoff number, which will again be semi-arbitrary and make errors, but again can be good enough to draw useful conclusions.  You can then apply that measure to, say, biological siblings who were both adopted, or (best) to identical twins separated at birth vs fraternal twins separated at birth, and see if genetic similarity correlates with similarity of your measure.  From that kind of data, you can get a vague idea of heritability.<p>If the thing you&#x27;re discussing isn&#x27;t measured by existing tests, fine.  If the thing you&#x27;re discussing has a logical definition and is important, but you think there <i>can</i> be no tests to produce even a vague measure, then I would guess you just haven&#x27;t tried very hard.')
