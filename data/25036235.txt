For example, the Equal Protection Clause guarantees equal protection for all â€“ it protects against discrimination. Under this protection, the federal government may pass laws to enforce this guarantee. However, while Congress may pass a law to regulate states or other public actors, it may not pass a law to regulate private citizens. Your police department cannot discriminate against you on account of your race. However, your neighbor in the house down the block can be as bigoted as he so desires.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;constitutionallawreporter.com&#x2F;amendment-14-01&#x2F;the-question-of-government-action&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;constitutionallawreporter.com&#x2F;amendment-14-01&#x2F;the-qu...</a>')
