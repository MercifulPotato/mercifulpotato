A lot of mental energy and time consumed in alcohol related activities. Planning, buying, drinking and recovery from hangover if you had too many. Not to mention physical effects like upset stomach, feeling cranky next day, headaches etc.<p>Just like we don&#x27;t like to overwork, so our body. Not processing alcohol and its side effects - few less things to do for our body. I feel very calm most of the time and less anxious than before. I also didn&#x27;t fell sick in last one year. No visit to doc.<p>Above all net positive in mental and physical wellbeing are too good to have one or two drinks.')
