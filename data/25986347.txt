Also prior to WhatsApp messaging was even more of a walled garden.<p>The ‘best’ was BBM - I lived in Canada for a year and you pretty much needed a blackberry to message friends because that’s what everyone had.<p>I had moved back to the U.K. when the iPhone came out, and I originally didn’t want it because a lack of BBM meant it would be more difficult to keep in touch with my Canadian friends. When WhatsApp came out and adoption was super quick I could finally jump ship, because it meant overseas texting for free without BBM.<p>Of course if blackberry wasn’t greedy and was forward thinking, they could have copied BBM and made it available on other platforms, and if done well it would probably have been a massive success.<p>So I agree that it’s not accurate to imply that everything was super open prior to WhatsApp - they spotted a gap in the market and wrote the best software to fill it that was available at the time.')
