And doesn’t address that the subsidized commodities are a small percentage of our food chain.<p>In fact, most of it isn’t even for human consumption.<p>It would make sense to see how other countries have dealt with subsidies and see how it works and doesn’t work. NZ for example has eliminated them. Canada has shifted its dairy subsidies from supply side the demand side. Etc.<p>We still have to consider population size and GDP etc. Canadian population is close to California’s population. NZ population(5 million) is half the size of LA county(10 million at least).<p>2011 opinion piece : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;01&#x2F;dont-end-agricultural-subsidies-fix-them&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;01&#x2F;dont-end-ag...</a><p>2020: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;29&#x2F;trumps-proposed-cuts-to-farm-subsidies-dont-go-nearly-deep-enough&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;29&#x2F;trumps-proposed-cuts-to-farm-s...</a><p>The situation is very nuanced.')
