Though I&#x27;ve noticed the volume varies a lot.  From quiet like the background sounds from outside where I live on a quiet day, or even quieter than the sound of breathing and my heart beating, to as loud as someone talking to me.  The tones vary too.  Fortunately they are usually higher frequency than what I&#x27;m listening too which reduces masking.<p>I&#x27;ve had tinnitus since I was a child, so I doubt it&#x27;s due to age-related hearing loss.  I don&#x27;t know a cause, but back then I noticed it was louder when I was ill and stuck in bed, and actually I found it comforting then, like it sounded like my body processing as it should.')
