IMO, it&#x27;s not useless knowledge or never used, but it&#x27;s not something I think most developers are going to use at their companies to accomplish their tasks so it feels like a weird thing to test and dismiss a candidate for.<p>I know developers who have written books on subjects related to development and are 100x the developer I am, but have no knowledge of DP beyond what was taught to them decades ago because they never used it when helping to build systems used by millions of customers.')
