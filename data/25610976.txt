I&#x27;ve never understood how much criticism the creator of TempleOS got.\nWhat stood out to me was that it was always mainly criticism on his technical ability. Is it really productive to harshly technically criticise a man that is plagued by mental illness?<p>Instead of being elitist and shooting down his contributions, the computer science crowd could have focused on getting this member of the community the help he would have needed concerning other parts of life.<p>Having all of that said, I aknowledge that he said pretty extreme stuff as well, I am not saying that any of that is legitimate.<p>I think I tried out TempleOS once, it really reminded me of old teletext in how colorful it was. Now I would love to look at its source code though!<p>HolyC does seem like a cool way of learning C because of the real time results, like coding in Python interactively.')
