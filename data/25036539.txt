I could list many of them in detail, for they are numerous but they range from the small, like the fact that you can&#x27;t even change the color of your mouse cursor to something other than black, to the large, like ability to run on any hardware.<p>You&#x27;re right that it comes down to what people find hassle-ful. That&#x27;s why I say that if you fit into whatever Apple limits you to, then good for you. But those limitations are why <i>most programmers</i> actually don&#x27;t use a Mac.<p>&gt; ...unlike Linux once I do a configuration there is generally no hassle _keeping_ the configuration over several OS updates.<p>That&#x27;s not my experience at all. Using a rolling release (Manjaro) for years I&#x27;ve rarely, if ever, had to re-configure anything major. I have kept three of these machines running without any hassle. They all just work (1 laptop and 2 desktops).<p>Meanwhile on my Macbook Pro, just upgrading through El Cap, Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave and finally to Catalina - each and every time there&#x27;s a major upgrade they&#x27;ve broken software that I use to the point where I just stopped using all the third party tools that I had to use to make my Mac work the way I want - tools like Karabiner, Better Touch Tool and so on... because I got sick of having to re-install or re-configure them after one of these updates. Also, Apple updates take forever and the update procedure is so clunky that even if you think you&#x27;ve updated something like XCode - the next time you open it you have to do more updates within the actual app. Package managers are soooo much nicer.<p>Haven&#x27;t you read any of the threads here on HN around the time Apple releases a major new Mac OS update? There are always tons of people complaining about what they broke. I think last time we lost the ability to even run 32-bit apps...<p>&gt; And there is a lot less hassle in some ways, at least compared to the last time I was trying to use desktop Linux, around things like WiFi, drivers, finding a laptop that will actually work, etc.<p>If you had said picking a distro [0], I&#x27;d agree with you. But finding a Linux laptop couldn&#x27;t be easier. Google for: Linux laptop. Also, if you&#x27;ve been scanning headlines here on HN for any amount of time I&#x27;m absolutely positive that you could name one right off the top of your head if you thought about it for thirty seconds. Here&#x27;s a hint: The model name&#x2F;number starts with XPS.<p>Regarding drivers - every Linux desktop distro I&#x27;ve used has a GUI for picking drivers. You check off a couple boxes, hit apply and restart. Meanwhile on my Mac, I can&#x27;t even get full functionality out of common hardware like a MS Natural Keyboard or a standard wireless USB mouse - so I gave up trying to do that too.<p>[0] I&#x27;ll save you some time if you ever want to escape Apple: Pick an Arch-based distro.')
