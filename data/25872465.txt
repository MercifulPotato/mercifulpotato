EU test inspectors must provide enormous amounts of leeway during testing.  Every time I&#x27;ve driven a new manual car the very first time I let the clutch out is always at least somewhat unexpected.  So the USA testers get to use smoothness as a proxy for experience.  If you let the clutch out like a guy who&#x27;s never done it before, you are probably lying about the many hours of required yet otherwise unverifiable pre-testing driving experience.<p>So in summary it enforces safety education and proves some level of experience.')
