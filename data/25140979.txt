The CPU is a plain-standard MIPS III, but emulating the console&#x27;s graphics chip hasn&#x27;t always been accurate for a long time. Disney-released games on the Nintendo Wii would toy with the write-back cache to prevent emulators from booting their games.[1]<p>I can imagine the largest amounts of difficulty are outside the CPU for a polished-enough project.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dolphin-emu.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;01&#x2F;dolphin-progress-report-january-2017&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dolphin-emu.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;01&#x2F;dolphin-progress-rep...</a>')
