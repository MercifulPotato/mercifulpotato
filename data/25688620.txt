Their official name was &quot;Life, the Universe, and Everything&quot;.<p>They got their notoriety by posting pornographic images all over the site, notably on Pokemon forums where children often came to discuss the game. It was a silly meme (&quot;Mods are asleep, post Tub-girl&quot; or whatever). But their memes were beginning to harm the site.<p>The LUEsers cried &quot;free speech&quot; and bemoaned the moderators for attacking their memes. Eventually, the admins shut down the LUE-subforum entirely (though with a &quot;Grandfather clause&quot;, so that old LUEsers can still talk with each other, but newbies couldn&#x27;t join their forum anymore).')
