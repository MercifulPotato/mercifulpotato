It says there are no particles at all anywhere period full stop UNTIL the precise moment of measurement. This is the &quot;Measurement Problem&quot;. The measurement CREATES the particle.<p>The famous Bell experiment proved that the view of quantum mechanics as describing how particles &quot;move&quot; is incorrect, because the probability wave is not actually describing any movements of any actual particles.<p>If you think of a single Hydrogen atom floating in space, no there is not an electron moving around it. There is no electron that exists at all  &quot;until&quot; something interacts (according to Standard Model) with the wave function and causes the wave to collapse and &quot;choose&quot; a place in spacetime to materialize an &quot;electron&quot; in and only then is there an electron.')
