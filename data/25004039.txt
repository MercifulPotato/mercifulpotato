The typical answer is $0.<p>Some maintainers are lucky to have some form of corporate sponsorship, others spend many cycles on some form of marketing to build up some kind of financial support (tip jars, Patreon, etc), but the pricing for Travis is astronomical for non-enterprise usage.<p>But as I said in the post, I&#x27;m grateful for what I got for the 8 years I had it. And I&#x27;m happy that GitHub&#x2F;MS is now running with that gauntlet.')
