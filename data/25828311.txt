There&#x27;s a difference between what you just said vs &quot;well, optimize it with gradient descent, yoloswag&quot; or &quot;just invert the matrix A&quot;. If you say something something pivot selection, Gauss elimination, iterative algorithms, QR, LU factorization, backslash operator, pseudoinverse, under and overdetermined systems and can roughly handwave your way around roughly explaining what these things are about, it&#x27;s probably already very good for this job. This prof probably wasn&#x27;t interested in the tiniest of numerical stability details.')
