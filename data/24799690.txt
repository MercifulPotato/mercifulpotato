I&#x27;m completely with you 110% that just throwing accusations this way is bad, and that it&#x27;s also most likely a &quot;I couldn&#x27;t disagree more&quot; leading people to a wrong conclusion about shilling and such.<p>What about the other side of it though? your reply didn&#x27;t really address it.<p>What I feel is happening now is that in those situations (and others), people downvote and flag things that they don&#x27;t agree with. They&#x27;re not shouting &quot;shills &#x2F; astroturfing&quot; yet the collective power makes it easy to silence opposing opinions, especially if those opinions are in a minority.<p>Completely anecdotal, but I reported to you two cases of flagged stories that in my opinion had value in them for the community (and in the discussions around them). Those stories were effectively silenced. I think it&#x27;s a shame. There&#x27;s no evidence require to flag or downvote, there&#x27;s no requirement to even give an argument&#x2F;reasoning for doing it.<p>Are there any plans to tackle this kind of behaviour in a similar way that empty&#x2F;non-evidence-based claims of astroturfing and shilling is dealt with?')
