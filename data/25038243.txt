Both internet and mobility. We have the CRTC (Canadian radio-television telecom commission) which is supposed to protect the public interest, however they do a piss poor job of even trying to cast themselves in that light.<p>There are like 3 companies that control the internet oligarchy. They used the government backed fibre expansion subsidies to build out infrastructure, then claim that magically made everything more expensive.<p>Our telecom is required to be all Canadian companies, but all their customer service is farmed out to India or other similar region call center&#x27;s.<p>We pay through the nose of asymmetric internet speeds. I hope starlink and other factors push for a price revolt.')
