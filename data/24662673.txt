Basically the choice of publishers is to cut off their arm while content aggregators suck the value from their unique content. It&#x27;s not exactly an elevator pitch to prove the point, but there&#x27;s countless parties that have elaborated along these lines.<p>Surely there is room for a search engine purely to point you to other places on the web, is where I stand. Google serving news is just them providing a reason for you to load up google.com rather than any other place, which clearly they&#x27;ve massively succeeded in doing, being a portal rather than a middle man.')
