If this latest gambit doesn&#x27;t work, it looks like their next step will be to file a lawsuit. But that doesn&#x27;t have to be the immediate step. Once taken, any somewhat more amicable solution is taken off the table.<p>They&#x27;ve pursued these possibilities:<p>1) Hey, maybe you&#x27;ve overlooked this, but you haven&#x27;t been sending me royalty reconciliation statements &amp; payments. (This actually happens without malice: I worked at a scientific publishing company, and when a reprint of an old book happens, or the rights to another book are purchased, the royalty obligations are not always 100% clear, or the 3rd listed author on something is overlooked, or the author is dead and an estate has to be tracked down, or any number of other issue)<p>Next they went to:<p>2) Okay, we&#x27;d like to sit down with our lawyers to figure out the specific contractual issues here and work something out.<p>Now they&#x27;re at:<p>3) It seems like you aren&#x27;t dealing with us in good faith.
