Both made their fortunes by being great business leaders who were able to take big risks, rely on the expertise of others, and probably use cult-of-personality tactics. Both probably have big personality redflags.<p>But Myhrvold used his initial fortune to co-found a patent troll corporation.<p>Musk used his initial fortune to accelerate the adoption of sustainable human transport, solar power, battery storage, and space exploration.<p>Does it not seem obvious why some would be willing to accept Musk&#x27;s faults? Would you rather have Satan help move us 10-20 years closer to saving the earth or tell Satan to fuck off cause he&#x27;s a dick and let the earth be closer to death?')
