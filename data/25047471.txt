The UK would have never succeeded in keeping the peace there were it not for having a good chunk of the population on &quot;their side&quot;.  The violence eventually came to mostly an end because the IRA blew up enough crap that the British were willing to mostly throw them a bone in the Good Friday agreement and everyone was sick enough of the fighting to reach an agreement.  The agreement was satisfactory enough for enough people that most combatants laid down their arms.  An agreement so favorable (i.e. favorable enough to get them to stop fighting) to the republican faction(s) would never have been reached without the violence spilling over into England to a greater extent in the 1980s and making people ask tough questions like &quot;why does what they do even matter to us?&quot;.  You can call that a &quot;loss&quot; or a &quot;win&quot; or a &quot;pivot to drug trafficking&quot; or whatever you want to make it compatible with your politics.  The framing doesn&#x27;t really change what happened.  Considering your characterization of North Ireland I don&#x27;t expect you to frame the issue in a neutral way.<p>Consider how the troubles might have played out without loyalist factions.  Starts looking a lot like some other, nastier, more resource sucking conflicts.  Local support is required any time you want to make a bunch of people do stuff you don&#x27;t want them to.')
