Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606761419, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25255065, text='&gt; I mean whats the fun in copying what a machine says to win chess games against strangers?<p>I mean, what&#x27;s the fun in beating everyone in Overwatch &#x2F; PUBG &#x2F; Fortnite &#x2F; Quake &#x2F; Doom &#x2F; etc. etc. with an aimbot?<p>To win. Because cheaters find winning fun, even if they&#x27;re not doing it on their own skill. I obviously disagree with the mindset, but cheaters disagree with me (and clearly continue to use aimbots &#x2F; chessbots &#x2F; whatever to rack up &quot;their wins&quot;).<p>Generally speaking, their excuses are along the lines of &quot;I don&#x27;t have the reaction speed of others&quot;, or &quot;I don&#x27;t find games of reaction fun&quot; (etc. etc.). Similarly, a chessbot user would almost certainly say &quot;I don&#x27;t like having obvious blunders in my games, and a chessbot prevents me from missing obvious blunders&quot;.<p>---------<p>I mean, Centaur Chess is a thing. Human + Computer, if you really wanted to fight fair. But these cheaters don&#x27;t go towards Centaur Chess servers, they stay on human-only servers and just wanna have an advantage on the opponent. Soooooo... yeah. That&#x27;s their decision.<p>There&#x27;s chess tournaments of 24-hours a move, no holds barred. (IE: Chess AIs are allowed to assist you). If you really wanted &quot;blunder free chess&quot;, people can play in those communities. Those who continue to use computer-assistance on human-only servers are simply cheaters in my book.')
