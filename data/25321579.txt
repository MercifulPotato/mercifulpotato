It&#x27;s much easier to implement and use higher order functions, if functions are treated like any other object. In Common Lisp, functions defined with DEFUN are not, by default. Common Lisp <i>supports</i> the functional style, but in order to operate on functions with higher-order functions, you must first scoop them out of their special namespace with FUNCTION; and if you want to apply a function you have as a value you must FUNCALL it.<p>Lisp-1s remove these extra steps, and to some programmers <i>that</i> is more understandable.')
