It was very code intensive and literally no one wanted to talk to me about unit tests I was adding to a virtually untested Java application.  If your son has an aptitude for writing tests, maybe he’d excel at that.  I also used to be a technical recruiter.  Feel free to contact me.  I’d be happy to have a no bullshit talk to you about your son’s situation.  The tl;dr are is that your son’s level of success will depend on how much he can operate on his own (e.g. could your son have asked this question on HN without your help?)')
