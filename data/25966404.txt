This would mean that allowing selling would pose little to no risk to brokers.<p>- If that&#x27;s not true, I wonder if Robinhood decided that preventing people from closing positions was an unacceptable risk. If GME tanked and people couldn&#x27;t sell, the outrage would be insane. So perhaps they did the math, realized that their available cash wasn&#x27;t enough to support both buying and selling, and decided that only allowing sells was the least bad option available.')
