So a script that starts with `#!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash` will be unable to use a lot of features.<p>If you only rely on `&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh` the user has the flexibility to point `&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh` to whatever shell on their system is fastest and most up-to-date (e.g. `&#x2F;bin&#x2F;dash` is a pretty good choice for performance).')
