It might take on slightly different shapes dependent on a number of factors (e.g. pH of the environment). Interactions between a protein and some other molecule might also alter the shape of the protein. So overall, a slight change in any of those values can have cascading effects in how it interacts with any other molecule (which themselves share the same problem).')
