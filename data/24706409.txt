A non-technical user would have zero chance of getting it to work.<p>For a technical user such as myself, it would be much easier to recompile libinput with some patch I grabbed from their issue tracker.<p>As a bonus, there&#x27;s less chance of getting malware from the latter than going to some Asian hardware manufacturer&#x27;s poorly translated website in search of a compatible driver download.')
