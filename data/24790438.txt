We&#x27;re similar to Hasura at first glance given the similarities with which we approach content modeling.<p>The vision is to reduce the complexity (and terminology) down to a point where one would need no prior knowledge of engineering to actually apply their business logic. Weâ€™ve been slowly pivoting towards citizen first development and the goal is to get there sooner or later!<p>Hasura on the other hand, I feel offers a superior developer experience but that comes at the cost of alienating non-technical&#x2F;citizen developers. Backend knowledge still plays a pivotal role in how well you can use Hasura.')
