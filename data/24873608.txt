In addition to being flat-out buggy (I&#x27;ve had it multiple times in the last week just decide to switch to a playlist it invented rather than the one it was directed to play), it doesn&#x27;t support basic music playing functionality like song or playlist repeat, and (surprisingly) its Google Assistant integration is awful, forcing you to use casting from a different device for basic tasks with an Assistant-powered speaker.')
