Item(by='hbosch', descendants=None, kids=[25461069], score=None, time=1608241398, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460628, text='&gt; Amazon suggests that Amazon reviews are worth at least something.<p>More and more it is proven that reviews themselves don&#x27;t mean much. You should consider your own personal relationship with the brand, or from people you trust. Of course we don&#x27;t all have the luxury of those things and sometimes you need to read a few reviews. After all, without GOOD and HONEST reviews we probably would not have a company like Anker, which I love dearly and who did it all right... but like with all things, you have to be critical of what you see and read and hear. Reviewers are not always honest, people are not always honest. Particularly when there is money at stake, <i>particularly</i> when you&#x27;re online.<p>I&#x27;ll have you know that the movie &quot;Wolfman&#x27;s Got Nards&quot; is currently sitting at 100% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Does that mean you should go watch &quot;Wolfman&#x27;s Got Nards&quot;?')
