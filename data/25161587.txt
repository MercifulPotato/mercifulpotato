Block them from viewing your Facebook wall until they do. Open every phone conversation by asking them if they have done so, and to send you a photo of the certificate if they did, or otherwise politely but firmly end the conversation and hang up. If they show up to a family gathering, leave immediately and take your children with you.<p>Ask them to send you a photo of their smallpox vaccination scar, if they have one.<p>It’s not about convincing them that you’re right, because you can’t do that - they’re addicted to Facebook, so reason is clearly not operating as it is. It’s about changing how they weight their decision using factors you can control, like your physical presence and your Facebook wall.<p>(If you don’t know them well enough to see them in person, don’t bother, just cut them off and block them from seeing and commenting on anything you post.)')
