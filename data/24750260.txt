Do a bit of research. I sent back a 24&quot; 1080p monitor and got a 21.5&quot; one instead, because the pixel density was too low. And it always will be, but still there&#x27;s tons of 24&quot; monitors out there at 1080p because people think bigger is better.<p>Make sure you&#x27;re going bigger and better in the right ways.')
