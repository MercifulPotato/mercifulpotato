Which is why the science on this is resisted so hard.<p>The idea of anyone being inferior to anyone else is completely something you brought into the conversation. Normal people understand that being short does not make one inferior, nor does skin color, nor personality, nor intelligence. It just changes statistical outcomes. Not moral value.<p>If you think genetic differences between people make some people morally inferior, I would say that&#x27;s a moral problem with you. Because even on the individual level, if not the group level, genetic differences are obvious and undeniable. Do you really think someone who scores low on an IQ test is morally inferior to you or deserves to suffer? I don&#x27;t. If not, what&#x27;s the problem with accepting the science on genetic group difference, especially given that it helps us reduce suffering in the world?')
