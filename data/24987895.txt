It has the ability to scale to 0 docker containers. My OpenResty API gateway takes 400ms to spin up and can serve a ton of traffic concurrently (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futurice.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;openresty-a-swiss-army-proxy-for-serverless" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futurice.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;openresty-a-swiss-army-proxy-for-s...</a>). This is much better and cheaper than minimum scale of 1 Fargate containers IMHO. There are a lot of legacy things you can put in Cloud Run (e.g. JVM application servers) that would not be possible in Cloud Functions. Cloud Functions are good for small custom node.js express apps. Cloud Run is awesome for heavier IO bound services as you can make use of the runtime resources when waiting for other services to complete (by serving concurrent requests).')
