Putting a 24-year old on beta blockers, topamax, cipro and a couple more I had to stop on day 2, just to see if that fixes it, sends you down a spiral of side effects that make the original symptom far murkier.<p>Even if the algorithmic approach is accurate for 80% of cases, the suggestions it gives you for the 20% makes treatment extremely frustrating. If you are in those 20% then treatment by an experienced, more fluid doctor is night and day. Unfortunately, there seem to be fewer of those in the US than in other countries, probably because of litigation risk you mentioned before.')
