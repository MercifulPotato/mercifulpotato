Didn&#x27;t know that type_traits was meant for that.<p>Indeed Rust proc macros, or Rust macros in general, are a better analog to C++ templates than Rust generics. They aren&#x27;t quite the same, as during evaluation time C++ can do a bit more, and apparently type_traits is an example of what C++ can do statically. Rust&#x27;s model is different, it wants macro expansion to be done by the time it starts even resolving any non-macro paths, let alone type checking or anything.<p>That being said, you&#x27;ll be able to emulate something like that once specialization lands (hopefully also included by min_specialization).')
