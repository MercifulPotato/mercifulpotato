Alternatively just keep using X until 2030-2040. If X does everything you presently care for well and major apps like gimp and firefox are apt to  support X for the next decade+ an alternative contribution might be bug fixes for X or packaging for distros that opt to continue to support it.<p>When about do you think firefox will no longer build for X?<p>Python 3 was ready in 2008 but 2 will be supported by RHEL until at least 2024 16 years later.
