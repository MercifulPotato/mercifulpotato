Item(by='_iyig', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608150190, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25447640, text='&gt; The real problem isn&#x27;t technology or even adoption, it&#x27;s that people who work at giant companies suck at making games.<p>Many companies besides Facebook have developed games for the Quest. I guess you could say Facebook sucks at working with game developers, but I’m not sure if that’s true either. Unreal and Unity have well-developed integrations with Oculus [0].<p>I think where Facebook really falls down is tying customers’ FB account to their Oculus Store purchases (and ability to use the Quest at all). They’re applying a social media platform’s aggressive algorithms to suspend or ban accounts which violate their expansive TOS, which is wrong in consumer product and digital marketplace space. For that reason, mixed with personal experience at the hands of Facebook&#x27;s algorithms, I have no interest in developing for Oculus.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.oculus.com&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.oculus.com&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;</a>')
