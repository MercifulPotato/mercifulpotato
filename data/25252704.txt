If we were to go with components over tools, I&#x27;d say very simple building blocks are very useful as components. It&#x27;s more complex dependencies where the issue lies.<p>To absolutely torture the analogy: say you have a general hinge that you can attach to any door. And that&#x27;s fantastic, but it&#x27;s a lot more complex than it needs to be (it being generalised necessitates this) and it isn&#x27;t actually completely optimal in most cases (it just works ok, ish). You can use Super Hinge on all your paid projects, and it will <i>work</i>, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s often better to make a hinge that exactly fits the required specifications.')
