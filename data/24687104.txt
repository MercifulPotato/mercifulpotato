High school and the beginning of college were a nightmare for me for essentially the same reasons you describe.  I still feel like I&#x27;m shaking off some kind of imposter syndrome when I&#x27;m interviewing for a new client.  Students used to seethe when my test scores were read because, despite testing top of the class I never did any extracurricular work or engaged in class very much.  Eventually even the teachers started to treat me like a burnout.  I&#x27;d start a new semester and the teacher would already know who I was from chatting in the teachers&#x27; lounge.  At least in community college the student&#x2F;faculty pool is wide enough that I can avoid those types of interactions, plus the switch to computer science and some decent ADHD meds have made all the difference.')
