Mix. Burn.&quot; was Apple&#x27;s slogan for iTunes in 2001, and it seems to have depended on the AHRA (and &quot;music CD-R&quot; media, which included the tape tax.)<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Apple subsequently argued that iPods were exempt from the tape tax and made it hard to record music off of iPods onto other media. One could imagine an alternate world where Apple(&#x27;s customers) paid the AHRA tape tax and Apple enabled easy &quot;rip&#x2F;mix&#x2F;burn&quot; across iPhones and other devices.')
