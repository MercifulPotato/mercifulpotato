Then they picked it back up again once the elastic.io hosted product got good enough that it was a much better alternative.<p>Another example is ECS, which was out in the wild for a couple of years with a very limited feature set while GKE was completely eating its lunch and upstream Kubernetes got a lot of major improvements. Then AWS released EKS which sort of seemed to replace ECS for a while, but they have gone back and forth now for a bit with ECS having some features that EKS didn&#x27;t have (e.g. fargate for a long time) and vice versa.<p>There are all sorts of other support bugs I&#x27;ve stumbled across in their forums, too many to recall. Often years old threads that have never really been addressed.<p>Edit: another one that comes to mind is cloudwatch&#x2F;the entire monitoring &amp; logging stack. It&#x27;s very basic, not really a viable alternative at all to something like splunk. As such an important thing, I always kind of expected it to get better but it just didn&#x27;t, you had to export your own logs&#x2F;events to a separate ES cluster, or to Redshift via S3, or something else, etc. Whereas GCP Stackdriver is a much better solution out of the box.')
