I guess my fear for my karma was unfounded. ;)<p>Two follow up questions: How do you objectively determine Parler is dedicated to extremism but Signal is not?  I think Parler would argue (even if incorrect or insincerely) that they choose not to be the arbiter of right and wrong too, or at least to do so as minimally as possible. Since we can&#x27;t see into Signal, we don&#x27;t have any data on the % of messages dedicated to extremism.<p>&quot;If a member of the public can get in then why can&#x27;t someone from the CIA&#x2F;NSA? It might as well be in clear text. If they can&#x27;t infiltrate these groups then we have much bigger problems&quot;.  \nIsn&#x27;t that an argument for allowing Parler to stand?  It actually _is_ (er, well, was) clear text, and I would be _shocked_ if CIA&#x2F;NSA weren&#x27;t monitoring it.  Wouldn&#x27;t we be safer with bad guys coordinating on Parler than on Signal.')
