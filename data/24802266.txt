EMV rests heavily upon cryptographic protocols, we <i>know</i> the highest possible level of security is achieved for such protocols by publishing them for evaluation and improvement by independent researchers. EMV didn&#x27;t do that.<p>There are many but here&#x27;s a particularly low hanging piece of fruit that results from not having independent researchers looking over what you&#x27;ve done:<p>It is <i>critical</i> to the EMV design that the payment terminal picks unpredictable numbers. These aren&#x27;t just nonces, where it only matters that they&#x27;re different, they must be random or a relatively cheap (worth doing to forge credit card transactions) attack succeeds. So what do you suppose those standards documents require? You might even have read it.<p>The certification document says for testing read two of these &quot;unpredictable&quot; values. Ensure they are different.<p>Guess what lots of <i>real</i> hardware actually deployed in the wild does to achieve that requirement? It uses a counter. Because <i>random</i> numbers might sometimes not be different leading to a tiny chance of failing the mandatory test, but a counter will reliably pass the test even though it&#x27;s insecure. Genius. So you go from &quot;Hypothetical adversary needs to guess a large random number&quot; to &quot;It&#x27;s just a counter&quot; and attack cost falls from billions of dollars to a few cents per transaction on top of R&amp;D.')
