And the ones with diamond hands who haven&#x27;t sold yet will (likely) lose everything.<p>So - this is like penny stock sellers in the 90s. Some little guys made a killing. Lots of little guys lost most of their savings.<p>It&#x27;s not like all the little guys are going to win and Melvin Capital is the one paying the bill. It&#x27;s like Melvin Capital went bankrupt, and some little guys on Reddit fooled a bunch of other Redditors into giving them a bunch of money.')
