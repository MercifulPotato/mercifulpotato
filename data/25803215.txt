Item(by='jsteinbach', descendants=None, kids=[25803292], score=None, time=1610814171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25802277, text='For VSC there is also Dendron [1], which I found nicer than Foam.<p>After lots of trial&#x2F;error and at the end of the rabbit hole I found Emacs with org-roam [2].<p>It has a steep learning-curve and often seems outdated, but it is also very powerful, has VIM hotkeys, and allows me to create the academic workflow I want - so far I can automatically create a note from my Zotero .bib library, fill it based on a template and the insert all my annotations from the associated PDF. Afterwards I also semi-automatically extract the references from that PDF, insert them into the annotations and then start to link everything into my Zettelkasten system.<p>Sometimes I wish I just stayed with VSCode&#x2F;Markdown, but then I remember that I can now put &quot;elisp&quot; on my resumee :)<p>Overall I think that the &quot;new&quot; note-taking&#x2F;Zettelkasten-systems is very cool and useful, but I wish someone would come along and create &quot;the next big thing&quot; which in my opinion is multi-dimensional notes.<p>Tiddlywiki&#x2F;Tiddlyroam [4,5], TheBrain[6] and even Scrivener [7] seem like a step in the right direction, but they also make some other things overly complicated (convoluted UI, no plug&#x2F;play export, bad editors, ...).<p>I want to be able to freely take notes on my computer the same way I can do on paper, and then be able to &quot;super-charge&quot; them by linking, aggregating, searching them. At the moment notes are &quot;one-dimensional&quot;, i.e. I can only write from top to bottom. Compare it to paper where I can freely change my style of writing, add drawing, annotations, change directions, ... Writing on the computer just feels very restricting.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dendron.so&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dendron.so&#x2F;</a> \n2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;org-roam&#x2F;org-roam" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;org-roam&#x2F;org-roam</a>\n3: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;inukshuk&#x2F;anystyle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;inukshuk&#x2F;anystyle</a>\n4: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlywiki.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlywiki.com&#x2F;</a>\n5: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlyroam.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlyroam.org&#x2F;</a>\n6: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thebrain.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thebrain.com&#x2F;</a>\n7: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.literatureandlatte.com&#x2F;scrivener&#x2F;overview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.literatureandlatte.com&#x2F;scrivener&#x2F;overview</a>')
