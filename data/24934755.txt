Just marketability? If you used non-IP infringing assets, maybe no one would pay any attention to a link like this: &quot;2D sidescroller implemented in Vim&quot;?<p>I&#x27;d just like to see the merit of something like this judged based not on nostalgia or fandom, but on its own individual novelty.
