Even the most basic precautions like wearing a mask were politicized while the scientists practically begged for people to wear them. They left the WHO and refused to enter the vaccine pool. How do you fight that? Blame science? It&#x27;s ridiculous and anyone claiming it&#x27;s primarily science&#x27;s fault I seriously question their good faith to debate here.<p>I was here the entire crisis (and I&#x27;m not a US citizen btw) and had easy access to the same advice Canadians, Europeans, and whoever else in the West got as well. The information was here, but the political leaders often downplayed it or simply refused to follow it. What did we get? The numbers don&#x27;t lie, and take a look at the results of the current political climate and the death count. This wasn&#x27;t a &quot;good way to go&quot; being overly skeptical of scientists. Like, there are problems with science, but this is if we&#x27;re being cute &quot;throwing the baby out with the bathwater&quot;--or if we&#x27;re being less polite--so incredibly stupid it&#x27;s largely contributing to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.')
