You can just use their products as they intended and it works well. If you run into limitations, there are alternatives. My kids love gaming on the Apple TV and iPad. And if they want to play a blockbuster game, they use a console. I can&#x27;t think of other limitations I ran into.<p>Is it perfect? No. But the &quot;it just works&quot; slogan is still true enough to relieve me from the duties of a system administrator for my own family, like when we were using Windows. Spending and entire evening reinstalling Windows because the sound card stopped working after an update is not my hobby. I have 3 Raspberry Pi&#x27;s running in this household and that&#x27;s enough sysadmin work for me.<p>Yes it&#x27;s expensive, but less than you&#x27;d think. Try reselling a year old Windows PC. Almost impossible. A year old Macbook? You can sell it within 15 minutes for a good price.')
