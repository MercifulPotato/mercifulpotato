It has a learning curve to it. Getting a basic Simulink License could set you back by 3000$. Also, if you just want to design basic state machines for your project, why should you pay the steep fee they ask for. It&#x27;s a great tool for modelling, simulation and what not. But what if you just want to design state machines for your project(not even simulate), why should you pay that amount for a single license?<p>QM again does a host of other things apart from state machine design. You have to work with their framework to get the work done and also getting the license is expensive.<p>You can design however you want in FsmPro. There is no model to adhere to. You can design state machines, talk to other state machines and just inlcude them in your projects with a single header file inclusion.<p>I make my argument clear in this piece: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@FsmPro&#x2F;introducing-fsmpro-a-tool-built-with-state-machines-in-mind-97faa0b6e0acpiece" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@FsmPro&#x2F;introducing-fsmpro-a-tool-built-w...</a>:')
