It starts off talking about a field that needs to &quot;gain those few crucial microseconds&quot; and then talks about a GC with an average and max pause rate of hundreds of microseconds.<p>I mean yeah those GC pause times are extremely impressive, but you&#x27;re clearly operating against a different set of performance requirements than those teams that care about several microseconds of difference and it&#x27;s a bit disingenuous to compare your own tech stack to them.<p>That being said I do appreciate articles like this that show just how far Java performance has come over the last few decades.')
