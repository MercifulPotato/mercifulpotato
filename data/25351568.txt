With go many people laboured under the misapprehension that they could have more input than was actually possible. Not so different with chromium.<p>The cathedral model is fine but be honest about it.<p>With the Linux kernel if you have a good idea and can defend it you have a genuine chance of contributing. So I know my limited spare time efforts aren&#x27;t wasted. With fuchsia I couldn&#x27;t be so sure.<p>I hope I am wrong but the fact they are only now taking potential contributions suggests otherwise.')
