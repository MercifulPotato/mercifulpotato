It turns out this was due to a defect in manufacturing.  Earlier this year (2020!) Lexus replaced all the door coverings and the dash, without cost to me.  They even gave me a loaner car to drive while the work was being done.  <i>On a second-hand, 12 year old car</i>.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any other manufacturer that would do that.<p>P.S.  The car still runs great.   Everything works as it should.')
