What I am trying to say if that is a jetpack it is unlikely to have taken off from the city. Possibly from a boat, although flying jetpack from a boat sounds sketchy.<p>edit: I was wrong, LAX arrival corridor is inland and takeoff corridor is over the ocean. So this has to have been spotted over the land. See below comment by taneq.')
