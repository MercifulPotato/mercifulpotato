Edit: current plans is 3 years for 7 EUR. and it expires with your passport. It hasn’t launched and price has doubled!<p>The annoying thing is that every visa-free country is going in this direction.<p>I’m sure it will trip up Americans the most when it launches.<p>The other issue with ETIAS is that there are a lot of dual EU&#x2F;xx citizens out there travelling on their xx passport. Technically they won’t be eligible for ETIAS.<p>I have a lot of family born... in a country that no longer exists. Dunno if ETIAS will bark because they didn’t get their EU passport from its successor EU country.')
