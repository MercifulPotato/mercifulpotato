Apparently burning hydrogen in a combustion engine is pretty straightforward. I think that&#x27;s the plan about future H2 planes, make them use turbofans slightly modify to burn H2 instead of kerosen.<p>However the big problem is storing H2 onboard. Most of the fuel is in the wings, and very cold liquid hydrogen (icing) as well as very heavy high-pressure tanks won&#x27;t fit there. That&#x27;s why I mentioned that an entirely new concept may be necessary to make room for the fuel tanks inside the fuselage.')
