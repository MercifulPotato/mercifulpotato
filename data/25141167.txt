Although we know perfectly well the amount of suffering the meat industry causes, most of us are fine with consuming meat and dairy, as long as we don&#x27;t need to see the images of how the meat gets to our plate. Mostly because it tastes good; red meat is actually unhealthy.\nThat&#x27;s just one tiny example that leads me to think we&#x27;re not reasonably moral.\nI&#x27;m not saying we can&#x27;t be taught morals, but we have a long way to go till we can say what&#x27;s happening is &quot;reasonable&quot;.')
