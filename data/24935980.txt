As alluded to in the blog post, we&#x27;ll probably look to enable clients to write directly to data nodes as a form of further scaling writes (so that the AN &quot;primary&quot; would only be strictly required for DDL), as opposed to a multi-master approach.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.timescale.com&#x2F;v2.0&#x2F;using-timescaledb&#x2F;distributed-hypertables#data-node-management" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.timescale.com&#x2F;v2.0&#x2F;using-timescaledb&#x2F;distribute...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.timescale.com&#x2F;v2.0&#x2F;using-timescaledb&#x2F;distributed-hypertables#native-replication" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.timescale.com&#x2F;v2.0&#x2F;using-timescaledb&#x2F;distribute...</a>')
