They asked me about numerous technologies, and I went to explain them, but wasn&#x27;t given a chance. The CTO poo-pooed my résumé like it was difficult to read. He must&#x27;ve felt threatened and so sabotage  my shot. They ushered me out the door almost like throwing me out by security; so incredibly rude. I didn&#x27;t get the job obviously but they later asked me to interview again but I told them to &quot;fuck right off.&quot; No, you don&#x27;t get a second chance to unprofessionally dis me, and I won&#x27;t work with or for such narcissistic slave-drivers. I didn&#x27;t care about my rep in this instance because they&#x27;re clowns who would never amount to anything. Don&#x27;t be unprofessional, even if someone else is.<p>A few weeks later, I got a $10k&#x2F;week consulting contract for a funded startup already in acquihire talks.<p>Don&#x27;t settle for BS or bend-over backwards for jerks because it will just get worse. It&#x27;s not worth your mental health.')
