Item(by='jtwaleson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609914805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650224, text='This holiday season I rebooted   <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;game.stackybird.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;game.stackybird.com</a> (try on desktop). It&#x27;s a project I started years ago when my son was born to teach him the programming mindset. He&#x27;s now 7 and it seems to be the right age. It teaches kids programming basics in a fun and gradual way. Right now there are only 6 levels, but I plan to have hundreds. Levels unlock instructions and with new instructions you can solve new levels, or old levels in a better way.<p>I&#x27;m not good at design so I picked the bird from flappy bird and the colors from 2048.  I will probably need to change that. Also I started the project in 2014 and bought the domain in 2018, but now there&#x27;s a trademarked app with the same name in the app store. Will probably need to change the name too.<p>Too bad this thread pops up now, next week the app would be more impressive ;)')
