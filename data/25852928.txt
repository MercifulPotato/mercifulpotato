Reducing consumption (e.g. internet, meat) means that less would be produced in the long run, thus it does have a positive impact on the climate. We can talk about details or exceptions but the general idea that less consumption = less consumption [sic] = less climate warming is firm. I think the greater point is that we have to look at a long time horizon with long lasting changes to really see this, that&#x27;s why we as humans have trouble implementing these changes.')
