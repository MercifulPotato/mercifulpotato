One reason being that the railways own the tracks and the stations (renting out some of the space, and having things like restaurants and hotels), and in built-up areas they can thus capture some of the value the railway provides through increased land values close to the stations. Apparently only about 50% of the income is from tickets.<p>Railway people also often say that railways are different from roads in that the advantages of vertical integration between the tracks and the rolling stock is much larger, and thus a privatization scheme where a single railway company owns both the tracks and the trains is better than the UK (and now EU following in the UK footsteps) model of splitting the ownership.')
