As all eggs have one X chromosome, that effectively creates a system three sexes: Female, Male (X-gamete predisposition) and Male (Y-gamete predisposition), which we can call F, Mx, and My. The &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; predispositions might also be heritable with some frequency (&quot;h&quot;). Perhaps the predisposition is not absolute, but just a probability &quot;p&quot; favouring one gamete over the other.<p>I wonder what kind of equilibrium this system would come to. For now I&#x27;ll assume that females have no preference for Mx over My or vise-versa.<p>For reductio-ad-absurdum, let&#x27;s imagine what would happen with p=1 and h=1. Then Mx fathers have only daughters, and after one generation, the population is entirely My and F. After two generations, it&#x27;s only My, and there is no third generation.<p>Next let&#x27;s see what would happen with p=1 and h=0. Again, Mx fathers have only daughters; My fathers now have 50% My sons and 50% Mx sons. Starting from a population that is 50% F, 25% Mx, and 25% My, the second generation is again 50% F, 25% Mx, and 25% My, and with all parents having an equal number of offspring. So at a glance that looks like a stable population, but we&#x27;d need to look deeper to see whether any initial small unbalance between F, My, Mx returns to that equilibrium or diverges, and also whether there&#x27;s any advantage to a higher &quot;h&quot; or a lower &quot;p&quot; that could gradually cause those traits to spread. For example if some kids with a &quot;p=0.5&quot; gene have an advantage over p=1, then over time the Mx and My distinction will get wiped out and we&#x27;d just end up with M and F.<p>I&#x27;m too lazy to analyze it but it would be an interesting system to simulate!')
