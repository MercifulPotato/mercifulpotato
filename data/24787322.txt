She is very upset with me and tried to violently render me unconscious last night.&quot;<p>The oih usually rhymes with boy, but really has a hit of a H, depending on how common&#x2F;drunk the individual speaking is. The a appended to words is like a &quot;to&quot;, but it becomes a running vowel sound, like &quot;gonna&quot;, but people do use it stand alone. I&#x27;ve heard &quot;see ya ah morrah&quot; (see you tomorrow) where the &#x27;ah&#x27; is a schwa and probably could be prefixed to &quot;morrah&quot;, I guess. Sometimes a K sound is quite aspirated, but only for effect, never consistently.<p>It&#x27;s weird. A lot less people use this accent these days. And whenever people apparently come from this area on TV they always put on a posh version and sound more like Farmers. Funny really.')
