Otherwise anything that follows couldn&#x27;t possible be rational on account of logic.<p>I also refer to my other comment in this thread (long, I refer to Apple and Epic) about why a definition of monopoly is necessary and also impossible.<p>I will add the exception of a government granted monopoly. In that case the government passes a law in which a company or whomever has the unique privilege to supply a product to the market, the precise definition of which will be given in the government&#x27;s law.<p>Whereas you have not given a definition of a monopoly I will define a free market as the array of voluntary transactions between people&#x2F;groups in a society, absent any threat of violence.')
