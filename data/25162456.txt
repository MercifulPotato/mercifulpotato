Item(by='ashika', descendants=None, kids=[25163428], score=None, time=1605892255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25157681, text='if someone is looking for a book where ancient philosophical ideas are critically applied to modern institutions and ideas, look elsewhere. this appears to be aimed at undergrad teaching, perhaps for an intro course, but despite the promising title, a quick read leaves me underwhelmed.<p>the main premise, forcing plato to engage with the modern world a la bill and ted, doesnt have to be bad. but this dramatization comes off quite patronizingly fellowkids. but if your students want to read about drunk people you can stick to the ancient texts! honestly, plato is one of the most accessible philosophers out there so this strikes me as doubly useless.<p>additionally, woe to the person looking for meaningful engagement with ethical topics where philosophical tools are actually used to answer modern questions. Here&#x27;s a spot where a topic comes up, but then is lost in the banality of the author&#x27;s stupid device.<p>&gt; <i>“So you’re telling me that the purpose of all this knowledge is merely to make money? Greed is driving the great search engine for knowledge? This bewilders me more than anything else I’ve gathered about this place. How can those who possess all knowledge, which must include knowledge of the life that is worth living, be interested in using knowledge only for the insignificant aim of making money?\nWell, what do you do when you’re faced with monumental cluelessness of this sort?\nPlato, I said, I think you have a somewhat exalted view of Google and the nerds who work here.\nNerds? he said. Another word I do not know.”\n</i><p>it goes on to explain what a nerd is but never revisits the question of google&#x27;s business model! the book leaves the reader at the end with a hotdog of chopped up, edited, and overly seasoned ancient philosophical ideas. i bet in high enough doses it causes cancer.<p>tl;dr - patronizing, <i>zero</i> actual engagement with technology ethics questions')
