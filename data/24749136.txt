I wonder if it made it more difficult for people to understand that this new virus is closely related to SARS-CoV-1. This, in turn, may have made it more difficult for people to use lessons drawn from the 2003 SARS outbreak to guide their response efforts. For example, observe the terminology used here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;coronavirus-vs-sars" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;coronavirus-vs-sars</a><p>It is obvious that China has been attempting to compete with (and eventually replace) the United States on the international stage. Does anyone have further political insight into why the acronym &quot;SARS&quot; was essentially suppressed when the World Health Organization chose the COVID-19 name?')
