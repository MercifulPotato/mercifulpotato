Grateful, but if I may I will decline - I really want to learn how things work here, and I&#x27;m making great progress. At the same time I&#x27;m trying to finish three software projects - one that has 60kLoC and started life in 2004. No shortage of stuff to do (and if I can turn one of these into a lifestyle business I&#x27;ll be well happy)!')
