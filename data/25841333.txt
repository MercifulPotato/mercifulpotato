GameStop is a middleman in a market where it is completely trivial for producers to sell directly to consumers. That&#x27;s not a good position to be in, and there&#x27;s absolutely nothing stopping anyone in the world -- even you! -- from setting up as a competitor and doing a fundamentally just-as-good job. Their business selling products to customers is thoroughly obsolete; it relies on the customers having computers (to run the games) but no internet access (to buy the games).<p>So it isn&#x27;t surprising that their business selling products to customers isn&#x27;t really considered an asset of theirs, and that strategy discussions look for something they can do better than a random guy on the street.')
