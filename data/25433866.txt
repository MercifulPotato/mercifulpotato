Killing people nonchalantly. Stabbing people with swords (with blood). Drug references. The enslavement of River Tam (and her appearing au-naturel in the pilot as a minor). Discussion about grenades being hidden in apples. Frank discussions about the horrors of war, and the psychological impact they have. Self mutilation. Torture.<p>A lot of what makes Firefly good is how the characters stand out and do good in a realistically amoral world.')
