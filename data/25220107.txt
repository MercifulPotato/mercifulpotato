Before that it was Xenix.<p>I remember my high school gf&#x27;s father had a SCO Unix machine in his office. This was about 1991 I guess. At the time I was an Atari ST user, and just salivated at Unix machines (my luckier&#x2F;older&#x2F;wealthier Atari user friends had TT030s and got to play with Unix on them).  Once she let me sneak into his office and play with it when he wasn&#x27;t around, illicit unixing... was very exciting for me :-)<p>A few months later I got a 486 for graduation present and installed Linux 0.97 on it.')
