How fast someone can learn, absolutely not. If you&#x27;ve never heard of dynamic programming there&#x27;s absolutely no way you&#x27;re going to come up with that in an hour. If you&#x27;ve never heard of binary trees you aren&#x27;t going to think that one up in an interview. (Of course, you should already know basic data structures, but my point is a lot of these things aren&#x27;t something you&#x27;ll come up with if you haven&#x27;t heard of them before.)<p>I had a FAANG interview question applying statistics to a unbounded input. It took me a while to understand what the question was really asking, followed by some shock because it was something I&#x27;d never even imagined before (since I haven&#x27;t needed to do much statistics in my line of work) and I didn&#x27;t have the faintest idea where to start. With some hand-holding I figured out some basics, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that interview was part of the reason that &quot;the hire signal was not strong enough&quot;. Now, let me take a walk for 15 or 30 minutes to consider solutions to something I&#x27;ve never imagined, and I&#x27;ll probably come up with a reasonable solution on my own, and also be able to extend it for the rest of the interview. That might measure my ability to learn. But expect me to solve it in five minutes so we can go on to the deeper questions? Yeah, not really. So this interview didn&#x27;t measure my ability to learn, it measured what happens when you give me something I&#x27;ve never imagined before and expect a solution in five minutes.<p>(What&#x27;s a little frustrating is that I&#x27;m not really sure how to expose myself to the problems I&#x27;ve never imagined but which FAANG interviewers are likely to ask. I&#x27;m not sure that leetcode would do it, although obviously it&#x27;d be a place to start.)')
