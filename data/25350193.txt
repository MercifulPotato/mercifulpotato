Item(by='munificent', descendants=None, kids=[25350663], score=None, time=1607455986, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25350064, text='<i>&gt; Dart seems to focus on usability, while other languages focus more on simplicity (Go) or expressive power (most modern languages).</i><p>Author here. I think we try to focus on all three, but the latter are largely constrained by the language as it was designed in Dart 1.0 (which was mostly done by a different set of people than the ones who work on the language now).<p>I do wish Dart was a simpler language and worry a lot about the added cognitive load of the usability features we add. But it&#x27;s <i>really</i> hard to take away features. In order to make non-nullable types a non-breaking change, we added a general versioning system to the language [1]. We have to use it carefully, of course, because users don&#x27;t like migrating code. But I have some hope that we can use that to gradually simplify the language over time. Complexity has a direct usability cost.<p>We also care a lot about expressiveness, but I think other languages tend to define that in terms of &quot;how many different things can you express in a minimal amount of code&quot;? With Dart, we weight more by how <i>often</i> you want to certain things, and by how you <i>want</i> to express that. We&#x27;re willing to make some things more verbose if it makes common things shorter or more familiar.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dart.dev&#x2F;guides&#x2F;language&#x2F;evolution#language-versioning" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dart.dev&#x2F;guides&#x2F;language&#x2F;evolution#language-versioni...</a>')
