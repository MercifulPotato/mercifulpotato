Can you compete (financially) with German private TV and pay TV? Not to mention Netflix, Disney+, etc? There is not really a way out.<p>So were stuck with Skiing, Austrian Soccer, Tatort and Gaming show clones. At least there is a lot of cooperation&#x2F;joint shopping with German and Swiss (public) stations.<p>The self-created German content could be worse though. Tatort can be quite nice, it is not aiming to be CSI - and that can be a good thing.')
