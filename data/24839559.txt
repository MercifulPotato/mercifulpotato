In most developed countries, government work is considered a public service job, and respected, appreciated and well paid. 30% of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and 25% of Finland is employed by the government.<p>The DMV being the most utterly soul sucking place on earth has little to do with being a monopoly, but rather, Americans belief that the government is worthless, manifest. People - and services - tend to behave the way you expect them to, and this is no exception. While not a uniquely American phenomenon, it&#x27;s not a function of being a monopoly.<p>As you&#x27;ll see virtually all Ontario DMV equivalents (ServiceOntario, broader in scope than the DMV, handling health card issuance, birth certificates, and a many other government services [2]) have wait times under 20 minutes [1]. They also do manage complaints quite effectively via the Ombudsman program [3], and as a last resort, fold neatly under media pressure.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.ontario.ca&#x2F;dataset&#x2F;serviceontario-wait-times-in-person" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.ontario.ca&#x2F;dataset&#x2F;serviceontario-wait-times-in...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ontario.ca&#x2F;page&#x2F;serviceontario" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ontario.ca&#x2F;page&#x2F;serviceontario</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ombudsman.on.ca&#x2F;contact-us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ombudsman.on.ca&#x2F;contact-us</a>')
