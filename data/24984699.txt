As others have mentioned, writing front-end code to be testable by E2E is not necessarily straightforward, and when you&#x27;re trying to add tests to a big existing codebase I think you kinda have to accept some flakiness and retrying.<p>What I&#x27;ve been wondering about recently though is: if you construct applications in a certain way do you still need real E2E tests? For example, React is declarative, and with a state-management system like Redux shouldn&#x27;t you be able to get the same kind of assurance that E2E gets you without needing an actual browser? Maybe things like animations, visibility etc are where that comes unstuck?')
