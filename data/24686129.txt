That defeated the point for me.<p>I ended up using a cheapo 600W microwave that cost 1&#x2F;4 of the expensive Panasonic but would actually make food hot.<p>I&#x27;ve also had other experiences of bad usability in Panasonic products. Pointless extra button presses to to tell it you actually want to _microwave_ at _full power_. Who knew you would actually want to use your microwave for microwaving? &#x2F;s Just let me press the time &amp; start, already.<p>I now have a Samsung with convenient controls and a cheerful tune.')
