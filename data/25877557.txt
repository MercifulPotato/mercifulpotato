You click through, and nod your head at number 6: &quot;Their milkshakes - so called - appear to have no relationship to milk, dairy products, or edibility, and all the flavours taste vaguely of chalk and despair.&quot; You laugh in agreement at number 8: &quot;The fries are mediocre when fresh, but quickly congeal under the heat lamps into a starchy, greasy, undigestible brick.&quot; But number 7 gives you pause: &quot;The chicken nuggets. The rich flavours, the unique shapes, the delicate breading. What tastier treat could be imagined?&quot;<p>You quickly jump onto social media and post an outraged rant - how could this man like chicken nuggets? You suggest that perhaps he&#x27;s not as good a critic or chef as imagined, and you float the idea of starting a petition asking for him to be fired. A man who loves chicken nuggets can hardly be trusted in, near, or writing about a kitchen after all, right?<p>But of course, this was <i>sarcasm</i>. It&#x27;s a list of foods he does not like, and tucked into the middle of this list of foods he does not like is a sarcastic description of chicken nuggets, which he <i>also</i> does not like.<p>Similarly, here, Scott is in the middle of a list of people he disagrees with who contacted him to offer unsolicited, unhelpful advice. One of them is Srinivasan, but his gently mocking description of Srinivasan&#x27;s advice is no more an endorsement of Srinivasan&#x27;s views than his description of the Gamergater&#x27;s offer is an edorsement of Gamergate or their PR efforts.<p>What the person you were responding to was obviously doing was <i>not</i> saying that &quot;threats against journalists is top notch&quot;, but that Scott&#x27;s writing <i>criticising</i> Srinivasan&#x27;s anti-journalist crusade was top notch. Which is, I think, a fair assessment; it <i>was</i> a well written criticism of Srinivasan.')
