It&#x27;s fun, but my computer can only run things at low&#x2F;medium quality (i7-7700, gtx 1060 3gb). I&#x27;m in a situation where there is literally no reason for me to buy a new headset until I have at least a new GPU.<p>It really doesn&#x27;t help that you&#x27;re basically stuck buying the facebook-locked Oculus (either the Quest with a more limited game selection or the Rift S which requires a good PC), spend a bit more and get a Vive Cosmos, or you can spend boatloads of money and buy the Index (or buy an old Vive and piecemeal the Index parts you want since the lighthouses are compatible).<p>Any VR that is not roomscale will feel limited, and any VR that doesn&#x27;t use some sort of tracking for the headset&#x2F;controllers (IR based, usually) will feel clunky and will lose track of the controllers constantly. I tried (and loved, despite its limitations) Google Cardboard and Daydream, but those definitely never took off. Playstation VR isn&#x27;t roomscale so you can&#x27;t move around in the environment, so it&#x27;s inherently limited.<p>The Windows Mixed Reality inside-out tracking works for 95% of what you need to do -- overhand throws don&#x27;t work reliably since your controller leaves the tracking area, so you have to throw things by doing awkward pushing motions most of the time.<p>So again -- I&#x27;m faced with: \n- Upgrade to a more expensive headset to get better tracking but still have low&#x2F;medium quality ($300-1000). \n- Upgrade my GPU to max out the quality on my current headset ($300-1000).\n- Do both ($600-2000).<p>In all honesty, for the limited amount of time I spend in VR (1-2 hours once or twice a week, mostly for exercise with Beat Saber or BoxVR) -- None of those options appeal to me. I&#x27;ll just keep using my headset until it dies, and then we will see where we are at. There&#x27;s not enough new features coming out (or enough new VR hardware in general coming out) to justify an upgrade every year or two, especially when it relies on my PC having sufficient specs to power it.')
