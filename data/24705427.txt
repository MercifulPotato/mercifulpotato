So basically, I&#x27;m doomed.<p>I&#x27;m on the spectrum and have no interest&#x2F;ability for social posturing.<p>I absolutely destroyed the triplebyte front end technical test and was FastTrack-ed. Then I received zero interest, twice, despite trying to express my interest to companies. Both pre&#x2F;post covid.<p>Right now I&#x27;m feeling extremely discouraged and frankly exhausted. Just had a phone interview for a local (Vancouver) startup. The outsourced HR person (blankslate partners) didn&#x27;t even call me as scheduled, nor provide me with a number, nor respond to my email, until trying to gas light me hours later saying there must be a problem with the phone lines.<p>I applied for a Vue contract, to be bait and switched to a platform (toptal) only to be faced with a ridiculous algorithms test. For the front end, which is even more bizarre. No wonder they can&#x27;t find Vue devs.<p>Everyone else just doesn&#x27;t even get back to me. So I&#x27;m stuck taking whatever insane contracts come along. Right now I have one where they want a visual programming environment plus basically a WYSIWYG survey creator in a week, with no specs, no design and no API. Turns out there&#x27;s no back end and it just needs to dupe investors I guess. Don&#x27;t worry though, there&#x27;s some terrible, uncommented existing code that is far worse than starting from scratch.<p>I&#x27;m technically very adept, I learn very quickly and I&#x27;m always pleasant and polite. Every contract I have ever taken on has been a smashing success. I have great reviews from people I have worked with.<p>I rarely complain but I&#x27;m just really having a hard moment. Just the act of writing a cover letter is emotionally and mentally exhausting. The mental gymnastics I have to perform to try and figure out what people are actually expecting and how my words will be misinterpreted are truly exhausting.<p>I just love programming. It&#x27;s given me a purpose and I have a knack for it. I hoped it would help me find a role in society, but right now I&#x27;m not sure. Everyone talks a big game about diversity but I&#x27;ve yet to see it in action. I&#x27;ve had very experienced people look at my resume, and said it was good.<p>Of course I&#x27;m going to keep trying.  I just needed to let that out.')
