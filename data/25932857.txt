Does the buyer have enough choices or alternatives to choose from when it comes to healthcare?\n2. Do those who offer services have a monopoly on the service?<p>When you look at the US market you&#x27;ll find that it doesn&#x27;t meet those criterias. Market forces are <i>prevented</i> from acting and being able to reduce costs.<p>The fact that there is a captive audience, as you suggest, means that we cannot just shovel money into it. You end up exactly where you are. Costs go up because it is a necessity. Same reason food prices go up when there is a shortage. It is not a luxury.')
