Whenever you play a piece on a melodic instrument, like sitar, it has a cyclic nature, where after X notes you come back to the same &quot;sum&quot; note.<p>The tabla player matches this cyclic nature. X is commonly 16, so then the tabla player will play in &quot;teen taal&quot;. This is any percussion of 16 beats (or 32&#x2F;64&#x2F;128 beats) that obey a very particular structure. For teen taal the structure being that notes 9-12 are played without the left tabla (no bass).')
