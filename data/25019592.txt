I finished it but I did not liked it&#x27;s strange behaviour and bloated docker image size. \nI rewrote it in 2 days with graphql-go&#x2F;go and then it became OK: predictable behaviour and ~16Mb docker image.\nI&#x27;m thinking about rewriting another service too.<p>On client side I used:\n- python client `gql`\n- .NET `graphql-dotnet`\n- Apollo client\n- graphqurl - js client from hasura team<p>The worst impressions are from Apollo. \nStarting from their documentation.\nIDK why they explain everything starting from UI.')
