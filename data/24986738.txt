Talking is highly convenient but value doesn&#x27;t extend over time because of forgetting. Messaging is better because of history but is hard to reference because of sheer volume. Emails and threaded conversations are better and easier to reference (alongside being parallelizable) but don&#x27;t hold up over decades.<p>To extend problem solving processes over decades, systems like Andy Matushak&#x27;s evergren notes [1] or supermemo.guru (site article is from) are essential. Having ideas in a place where they can be reused and built on is import for building up higher and higher level ideas.<p>Take this statement for example:\n&quot;In a society structured around the idea of a concept network [2], a new layer of conceptual organization can be formed in which humans, computers, intelligent agents, databases, executive agents, organizations, corporations, etc. can form an equivalent of advanced concepts.&quot;<p>Sharing a statement like this, and being at least sort of believed, requires that people can follow path of derivation. Shared, collective (or even individual) concept networks make this possible so that an idea I come up with today can be reused by me and others in the far future.<p>This is just for knowledge. In terms of networks of people that self-organize more effectively, some of the links at the bottom of the page are interesting. Haven&#x27;t gotten around to all of them yet but I quite look forward to reading about teal organizations [3].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.andymatuschak.org&#x2F;Evergreen_notes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.andymatuschak.org&#x2F;Evergreen_notes</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermemo.guru&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Concept_network" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermemo.guru&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Concept_network</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Teal_organisation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Teal_organisation</a>')
