But a &quot;browser compatible&quot; ad-hoc representation for the underlying PDF representation.<p>Lastly PDF are not formats for structured data, which is what XML is all about in the end.<p>So I have no idea why you thing HTML+Js is a sane replacement for XML use cases, it isn&#x27;t. It isn&#x27;t a replacement to a degree that IMHO it doesn&#x27;t even really makes sense (the JS part).')
