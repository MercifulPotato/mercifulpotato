If they think it will hurt them in some way, they won&#x27;t.<p>But I think it&#x27;s fair to at least consider the &quot;undermine&quot; possibility considering that on iPhones they&#x27;ve consistently blocked attempts to jailbreak or open that platform in the way an alternate OS does on their Macs. We&#x27;ve already seen incremental moves to make MacOS app distribution more centrally controlled. So I honestly don&#x27;t know where Apple believes their long-term interested to be on the topic of facilitating, or at least not actively blocking Linux.')
