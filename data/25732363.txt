And Ice-lake &#x2F; Rocket lake are proving that AVX512 is well within the power-budget of these chips.<p>M1 dedicates more chip-area to integer units, and also uses less power (thanks to the 5nm advantage). So what&#x27;s going on with M1 isn&#x27;t really a power-issue at all.<p>When Linus says things like:<p>&gt; I want my power limits to be reached with regular integer code, not with some AVX512 power virus that takes away top frequency (because people ended up using it for memcpy!) and takes away cores (because those useless garbage units take up space).<p>Its clear that he was unable to be forward thinking. He was unable to see that a future chip, like Icelake or Rocket Lake, could fix the AVX512 power-throttling so dramatically. (without even going to an advanced node !!!).')
