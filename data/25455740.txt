We too often forget about the other platform we should build that uses these tools.<p>People don&#x27;t complain about mass security holes in Heroku. That&#x27;s long been container based. That&#x27;s an example of building a platform that enables keeping on top of security issues.<p>This isn&#x27;t a problem of the tools we have. It&#x27;s a problem because of how we use them and what we build with them.')
