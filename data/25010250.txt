No play services on an Android phone in China only implies it&#x27;s an Android phone. In the developing world, it most likely implies a very low cost Android phone of Chinese origin.<p>Bundling things that need timely updates with the OS with no mechanism to update them individually is a design error. Things like root certificates, time zone databases, leap second information, and even TLS libraries need to be updated on a regular basis. These items should be distributed outside of the general upgrade process, even if the general upgrade process worked (which is clearly not the case). Alternatively, root certs and TLS libraries could be bundled with applications as needed. You could probably have a stable core x.509 library and cipher algorithms bundled with the OS, so that the application level TLS library can be kept small. You still need to get tzdb updates out though.<p>In an ideal world, large OS vendors could work with carriers to get this small set of updates zero-rated in exchange for making sure they are very small and background downloaded only at times of low network congestion.')
