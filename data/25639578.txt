There aren&#x27;t many experts in this field, so we don’t bother trying to hire them — we hire good people and turn them into experts. Accordingly, our prequisites are minimal. You should be:<p>- Comfortable with Go (or &quot;golang&quot;, for you greppers) or another systems programming language<p>- Familiar with blockchain, networking, and cryptography concepts<p>- Lazy, impatient, and hubristic (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;threevirtues.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;threevirtues.com</a>)<p>In a typical year at the Sia Foundation, you might:<p>- Help design, implement, test, and deploy a new transaction relay algorithm<p>- Develop a codegen tool that increases serialization performance<p>- Publish an academic paper or a blog post on your work<p>You will be compensated well. As a non-profit, we have no equity to offer; what we <i>can</i> offer is the opportunity to do careful, uninterrupted work on compelling problems. We don&#x27;t have to worry about extracting value from users, and we don&#x27;t have to run around with our hair on fire every 18 months trying to pull together another round of funding.<p>Interested?
