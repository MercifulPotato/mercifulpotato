Item(by='danso', descendants=None, kids=[25189657, 25189706], score=None, time=1606154215, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25186890, text='I know very little about the npm ecosystem or how popular&#x2F;ubiquitous the author&#x27;s library is, but its weekly downloads on NPM seem very high? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;safe-buffer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;safe-buffer</a><p>safe-buffer is currently at 45M weekly downloads with 1.3K dependents. By comparison, the 4 most depended on libaries have a much lower ratio of downloads to dependents:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;depended" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;depended</a><p>1. lodash: 38M downloadsand 128K ependents<p>2. React: 9M &#x2F; 64k<p>3. Chalk: 62M &#x2F; 62K<p>4. Requests: 22M &#x2F; 50K<p>5. commander: 50M &#x2F; 48K<p>I&#x27;m assuming safe-buffer has its ratio because c̶o̶r̶e̶ highly popular libraries already depend on it (and those c̶o̶r̶e̶ libraries, not safe-buffer js, are what other libraries list as dependencies). Because Switch system updates wouldn&#x27;t be downloading from npm, right?<p>edit: I was using &quot;core&quot; to refer to extremely popular&#x2F;depended-on libraries – e.g. mysql&#x2F;mongo&#x2F;requests depending on safe-buffer – but that&#x27;s obviously not the right usage in this context.')
