Item(by='just-juan-post', descendants=None, kids=[25226004], score=None, time=1606455179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25225734, text='&gt; but I found it very hard to scale it.<p>What were your exact issues (so we can help)?<p>My suggestion to scale is to find people to work for or with you.  Essentially create an agency for yourself.  If you want to create a formal business fine or if for now you want to sell &quot;your&quot; services and have trusted friends do your overflow work that is fine too.<p>Hire people to find customers for you (via e-mail, etc) but then you are the one who shows up for the face to face (your employee pretends to be you for initial outreach).<p>Hire a general purpose assistant to do things.<p>Upwork, Fiverr, FlexJobs, Freelancer etc.<p>Tip: assuming you&#x27;re legit charge MORE money than your competition.<p>re: product startup   well do you have an idea? lol')
