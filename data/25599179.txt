However, anytime someone lends bitcoin or shorts it on an exchange, they increase the bitcoin in circulation past the base count of 21 million btc (or however many have been minted at the time).<p>The idea that bitcoin would somehow escape fractional-reserve banking was only held by people who do not understand the difference between M0 and M1&#x2F;M2 in elementary macroeconomics.')
