However I found the author missed the point (as perhaps many commenters did?)<p>&quot;...nowadays, all arguments that say that indexes should be 0-based are actually arguments that offsets are 0-based, indexes are offsets, therefore indexes should be 0-based. Thatâ€™s a circular argument...&quot;<p>Yes, that is a circular argument. It&#x27;s not the one I would use. C made the decision that indexes and pointers are the same thing. It&#x27;s a logical argument and one that&#x27;s not circular. If they&#x27;re separate things, then yes, you end up in a circle.<p>For languages that are not C-like, you could argue &quot;pick an idiom and stick with it across multiple languages&quot; or &quot;make programming languages easier for humans to understand&quot; Both of those arguments are preferential arguments. Perhaps there could be a study comparing the merits of each, but I haven&#x27;t seen one yet.<p>I like chocolate ice cream. I like making pointers and arrays as similar as possible. I like being able to collapse pointer arithmetic down. I like doing huge mallocs and then playing around with large, empty hunks of memory. Some folks don&#x27;t. I get it. Code should look like the way we think about the problem. That&#x27;s an ideal state we&#x27;ll never reach, but it&#x27;s worthy of continued discussion.')
