They also recently issued an update to the HomePod that allows it to do low-latency audio (so you can use it with an AppleTV playing&#x2F;streaming games), but I think that&#x27;s using their own proprietary streaming (AirPlay 2) over WiFi, not BT (details on the feature have been scarce and it&#x27;s relatively new).<p>Interestingly, the low-latency audio breaks apps that provide their own video player (Twitch &amp; YouTube), since they aren&#x27;t aware of the low latency features and they try to compensate for a system feature on their own.')
