But it doesn’t matter if these small grammatical errors are made, because native speakers can still understand sentences with flawed grammar. However, if you are missing vocabulary you will have a hard time understanding what other people are saying, and when you speak you end up spending a lot of time trying to describe words you don’t know in terms of words you do know.')
