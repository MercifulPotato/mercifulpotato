One byte encodes four basepairs, so that&#x27;s 750MB in total; and it losslessly compresses to less than half that amount.<p>If you store more than one genome, any additional genome is only 4MB because human genomes are 99% identical.<p>So you could store the genomes of an entire city on your hard drive.')
