If they&#x27;re responsible for a vast amplification of the neocortex I&#x27;d expect them to be all over the neocortex.<p>Whatever the case, I wonder if the two relate and, in particular, just what upper-layer neurons do that lends them to such a vast array of applications?<p>Clearly though there was runaway brain growth at a particular point in time and I wonder how that worked in terms of Darwinian development?  It&#x27;s a striking change for what one assumes is a relatively brief period of time.   Punctuated equilibrium, right?')
