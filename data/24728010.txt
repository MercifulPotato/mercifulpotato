You say social networks come and go but Facebook is still very much the largest network as it was ten years ago. Now is it because of cool innovations and better products or because of copying and stifling competitors, it&#x27;s debatable.<p>But what makes this worse is the fact that Facebook hasn&#x27;t been very vigilant about their privacy practises or political influencing on their platforms.
