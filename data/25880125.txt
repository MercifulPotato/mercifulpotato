Item(by='MikeTheGreat', descendants=None, kids=[25880576], score=None, time=1611382757, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25879869, text='Because they&#x27;re memory objects that are managed by .Net.<p>If you said &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m done with this&quot; that&#x27;s great, but .Net can&#x27;t actually delete it until it&#x27;s checked for itself that nothing else is using it.  Otherwise you&#x27;ll inject an error into the memory manager when you delete an object that&#x27;s still in use.<p>So you can kinda fake a delete by releasing the last reference to an object and then forcing a garbage collection (in .Net I think you can call gc.collect() or something)(it&#x27;s worth noting that the .Net docs specifically said that .Net might ignore your request to do a gc so even calling that is more of a suggestion than a guaranteed garbage collection)')
