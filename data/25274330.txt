We analyze large amounts of geospatial data and express our views in commodities markets.<p>We&#x27;re fortunate to be able to spend the vast majority of our time tackling interesting problems.  No standups, minimal meetings, no status reports, no slide decks.  We survive on the success of our ideas in the markets.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an experienced developer to own:<p>* Data engineering: From designing abstractions to implementing ETL services.  Data &#x2F; scientific Python on Linux.<p>* Trading infrastructure: Backtesting (ie, a discrete event simulator) and live trading.  Currently in Python, but moving to F# (on Linux), so interest in functional programming a plus.<p>There is significant domain complexity in both areas, and we&#x27;d look to the developer to be able to architect solutions from scratch.<p>The ideal fit would have &gt; 5-ish years of experience, a strong interest in the business, and use a domain-driven approach.<p>We welcome non-traditional professional backgrounds.  The stronger the public record of your work (eg, a Github repo), the better.<p>Write us at commod.prop@gmail.com!
