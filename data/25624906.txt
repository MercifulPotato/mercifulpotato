Databases have a very high levels of internal complexity naturally, so there is a strong incentive to align the design with what the language can express without adding substantially more complexity.<p>I work on database engines and the impact of language choice on the design, architecture, and implementation of database engines is very evident. In the specific case of database engines, these differences in design can have a very large performance impact.')
