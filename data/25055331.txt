So even though a few miles from me it&#x27;s the Aryan Cowboys and Boogaloo Bois who are being prosecuted for property damage, it&#x27;s the antifa that people in rural Oregon and Oklahoma are afraid of. They&#x27;re also very afraid of &quot;white slavery&quot; (yes, I&#x27;m using the wording of the 1880s and 1910s [1] because it&#x27;s the same tropes gussied up for today) -- they&#x27;re afraid that some foreigner will come snatch their beautiful innocent daughter from Walmart; the reality is of course that their daughter&#x27;s more likely to start doing meth. And of course there is abortion, too; it&#x27;s wildly more likely that a Republican woman will need a procedure that will be forbidden under various proposed antiabortion laws than that a woman will have an abortion of a healthy baby in the 9th month, but the second scenario drives Republicans while the first is a fact to be swept under the rug (&quot;it&#x27;s different&quot;).<p>Dems don&#x27;t speak to the feelings in the way that modern Republicans do. Dems think that because something is unlikely or illogical, they don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time talking about it; Republicans realize those are the best things to spend all your press time on, because then there can be no metrics to look bad on. Republicans know much better how to tap into the fear of the white electorate in particular, and then add the carrot that once the temporarily embarrassed millionaire is restored to riches, there&#x27;ll be no taxes ;)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opendemocracy.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;beyond-trafficking-and-slavery&#x2F;white-slavery-origins-of-anti-trafficking-movement&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opendemocracy.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;beyond-trafficking-and-slav...</a>')
