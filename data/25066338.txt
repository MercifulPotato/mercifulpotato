(maybe you have set omething else in mind?)<p>While climate change is super-important, and we absolutely need to do whatever we can to negate it, it is not a threat to global civilization.<p>Even if the effects of climate change are orders of magnitude worse than we expect, the planet most suitable for human life will remain Earth. Because, um, we can breathe the air, drink the water and the temperature is within the ranges we easily tolerate. (not to even get into issues of magnetic fields etc)<p>Will the earth of the future support 7 billion people? Probably yes, possibly no, but whatever number it does support will forever dwarf the people living in venus or mars.<p>Will our &quot;civilisation&quot; look different 50 years from now? Undoubtedly yes. But it&#x27;s radically changed in the last 50,100 and 150. Certainly those times counted as civilised did they not?<p>There will be civilisations on earth for a long long time (baring nuclear anialation) - our adaptability (think Sahara &#x2F;Siberia) is, if anything, a little too aggressive.')
