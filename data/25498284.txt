Wealth is increasing for everyone, generally speaking. This observation is important because it recognizes that wealth is created, not allocated. This is not a zero-sum game.<p>You say it seems unlikely that actual value is increasing at the high end but I do not think this opinion holds up to scrutiny. I think it is very likely that value at the high end has increased by multiples -- white collar jobs have become vastly more productive with the introduction of technology. Correspondingly, low value work has not. In fact, many of our most common low value jobs (retail, driving) risk going the way of the switchboard operator. There was no conspiracy to devalue the work of the switchboard operator; rather, so called &quot;high value&quot; tech jobs made this type of lower value work entirely obsolete.<p>I think it is unsurprising that high end work is rising in relative value while low end work is falling. I don&#x27;t see any basis for imagining political or economic conspiracies: What we see in terms of value is exactly what we ought to expect.')
