My software is free and open source (MIT license) [1] but I also sell it for $5 and donate $3.50 of every sale to a cost-effective charity. My goal is to increase donations to the charity, and asking people for donations wouldn&#x27;t be as effective. My software now has generated almost over $9,000 in donations.<p>Personally, every purchase of my software feels rewarding. It&#x27;s probably not as great as a regular donation, but it&#x27;s a close second. Furthermore, since my software is pay-what-you-want (with a minimum of $5) people have been often giving more than the minimum. That <i>really</i> feels like a donation.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@whyboris&#x2F;charityware-doing-good-with-proceeds-from-software-purchases-e48e66a5d1a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@whyboris&#x2F;charityware-doing-good-with-pro...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;whyboris&#x2F;Video-Hub-App" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;whyboris&#x2F;Video-Hub-App</a>')
