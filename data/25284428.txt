If you throw everything and the kitchen sink at a problem, it&#x27;s very hard to figure out which of the things you did actually worked.<p>We were. But this was the only significant change during this period until stage 4 of lockdown started which reduced the reproductive rate further.<p>We clearly see the reproduction rate drop just after mandatory masks were introduced, in the absence of a better or even half plausible explanation it certainly looks like masks were the cause.<p>&gt; The mask mandate went into effect on April 16th, and there&#x27;s just zero correlation between that and the case curve.<p>As I said, they aren&#x27;t magic, they won&#x27;t stop the virus by themselves. You can&#x27;t just wear masks and go about life as normal, but that does not mean that masks don&#x27;t work at all.')
