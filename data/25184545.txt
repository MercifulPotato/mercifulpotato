And then I read a few of the truly interesting-seeming articles that bubble up on places like this here website, etc.<p>Pre-internet, I would only buy one newspaper, and occasionally pick up a second when I was out if there was something eye-catching. I would also occasionally buy a magazine or two at the bookshop once or twice per month. I have tried to emulate this method again with the web, and it seems to be working.<p>I was never a person who would read every available newspaper and magazine before, so figured maybe I should not do the same online.<p>I am much happier not to face the firehose anymore.')
