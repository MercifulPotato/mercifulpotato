It does use semiconductors for the memory and IO.<p>I built one last March and April, and found it to be surprisingly enjoyable and relaxing. Highly recommended for those who love clicking and blinking things.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;relaysbc.sourceforge.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;relaysbc.sourceforge.net&#x2F;</a>')
