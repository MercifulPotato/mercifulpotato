Everyone on their is so small and not working in co-ordinated way. There is considerable discussion in the thread about the legality of it.<p>There are entire threads and Discord channels dedicated to coordinating this. It will be extremely difficult to convince a court that there is no coordination or market manipulation, especially when there are people who are spelling that fact out. And reddit have all of their IP addresses.<p>&gt; Also - what do you think short sellers like Citron do all the time. Put out fake reports about companies to make money off their short positions.<p>If you can prove that those allegations are indeed fake, then they can be held liable for that. But Citron&#x27;s influence stems from the fact that they have published a large number of reports that were indeed correct, e.g. Valiant.<p>&gt; The sentiment on the trade is eff those short sellers and their sketchy tactics.<p>What sketchy tactics? Expressing their view that a company like Gamestop is not worth very much on account of their outdated business model that relies on physical retail in a sector that has been going fully digital for the last 15 years?')
