Assuming a 500k purchase with 1% earnest money, waiving the financing contingency means that the seller receives <i>at least</i> 5k.<p>Even with a financing contingency waived, if the buyer has 100k, and their financing falls through, there is no way for them to magically make 400k appear for the sale to happen.<p>If you are assuming that the buyer has the full purchase price  in cash <i>anyways</i>, and are only taking a mortgage because rates are so low, then ya, your point stands (waiving financing contingency along with proof of funds).
