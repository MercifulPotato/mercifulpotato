Item(by='trappist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604685094, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25007697, text='1) Know which problem(s) you want to help solve. A very bad city will have many of them. Many or most may share a common cause, but enumerate and analyze them in isolation before acting on that assumption.<p>2) For each problem in the scope of your project, identify &quot;better&quot; and if possible quantify it. It&#x27;s too easy to delude yourself that your efforts are &quot;working&quot; if you haven&#x27;t decided explicitly in advance what that word means.<p>3) For each problem, identify a cause. For a city, this will probably be a feat of economics and&#x2F;or public choice theory. Both are unfortunately riddled with ideology, and you have one of those, and it will be hard to keep them separate, but if you want to help you have to find a way.<p>4) Many of the problems are likely to share a common cause, a single point upon which to apply pressure to bring about large scale results. Analyze and study your way here, don&#x27;t let your ideological sensibilities identify it for you. Get those as far out of your way as you are able. Hint: if you think you&#x27;ve found someone to harm or penalize as a solution (rich people, immigrants, drug addicts...) you probably slipped up in that effort.<p>5) Assess realistically whether there is anything you can do to address the cause.')
