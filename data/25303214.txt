Virtual threads are not using the thread API. They <i>are</i> (Java) threads; no more and no less than today&#x27;s threads. Just as people don&#x27;t normally use the java.lang.Thread API directly to use today&#x27;s threads, there&#x27;s no reason why they should use it with virtual threads.<p>&gt; One advantage that colored functions do have is that you see it and &quot;know&quot; that the thing involves expensive and&#x2F;or blocking work.<p>It gives you the illusion of knowing something that you don&#x27;t really. The OS, or the Java runtime, can and do pause your thread <i>at any point</i> for durations that are between orders of magnitude shorter and orders of magnitude longer than some blocking operations. There is no useful semantic knowledge you can extract from knowing something is &quot;blocking&quot; to the point that it&#x27;s a meaningless designation. It does mean something in &quot;single-threaded&quot; languages like JavaScript, or when programming hard realtime software, but not in ordinary Java. You&#x27;re wasting a syntactic &quot;colour&quot; on zero bits of information.')
