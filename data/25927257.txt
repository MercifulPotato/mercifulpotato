Item(by='lloeki', descendants=None, kids=[25927415], score=None, time=1611749476, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25927038, text='Every single IKEA piece of furniture in my house (desks, tables, sofas, shelves...) is entirely &quot;lossless assembly&quot;, although when moving I didn&#x27;t have to put them apart down to individual parts because they&#x27;re also designed for whole components to be (dis)assembled and reassembled quickly. I think I have like one piece of furniture that is not entirely lossless and that&#x27;s the back panel on a closet that needs to be nailed (which provides diagonal constraint), which I&#x27;ve done three times over yet still has room for more.<p>Okay it&#x27;s not grandma&#x27;s stuff that&#x27;s made of thick solid wood and lasts centuries, but it has really held up well to reasonable abuse.')
