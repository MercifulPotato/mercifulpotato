And... it may take you days to confirm if a specific pill is &#x27;working&#x27; well or not.  If&#x2F;when you find a combination, buy a bunch to have on hand.<p>I recently received the book &quot;why we sleep&quot; and it discussed melatonin&#x27;s process.  If &quot;1 hour before bed&quot; works for you, that&#x27;s good, but it never did for me.  ~3 hrs did.  Or... at least 2-3 hours at this time of the year.   My routine has been taking a melatonin between 6 and 7ish, and by 10 I&#x27;m typically quite &#x27;ready&#x27; for sleep, and it&#x27;s usually a fast process.  It doesn&#x27;t <i>seem</i> like it in the moment, but my wife has noticed I&#x27;m &quot;out like a light&quot; (which I think is more just in comparison to months ago).')
