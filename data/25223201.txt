Item(by='karmakaze', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606421703, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25221831, text='There was a post or comment I read recently that mentioned different levels of developers and how&#x2F;why they&#x27;re hired. It came down to sometimes devs are hired for what they know or alternatively for what they can learn and that those two generally break down into intermediate and senior devs.<p>The point isn&#x27;t that you have a current &#x27;thing&#x27;. The point is that you went deep into some of these past things as deep as necessary and should be able to tell the story of how that went. This is one of the parts I always cover when interviewing for senior devs: tell me in your own words of a time you went deep into a problem and came out with a solution. If they can tell a coherent technically detailed story then they had first-hand knowledge of the issues and how the solution was found and applied.<p>Edit: A different perspective is that no company of considerable size <i>needs</i> a generalist dabbler, they have specialists in relevant areas. A person like that could be versatile as they could be part of any team or project but isn&#x27;t indispensable. Probably better to work at smaller companies where wearing many hats is a definite plus.')
