You can publish, customize and monetize your content.<p>It&#x27;s like &quot;If Medium and Patreon have a baby‚Äù, but with a focus on presenting the visual part of content.<p>The functionality is wider than that of the closest alternatives and the editor is completely free. It is simple to create pages on both the desktop and  mobile versions.<p>The page loading speed is x3 times higher than that of Medium (even with a larger number of contents).<p>It&#x27;s best to use these ench pages for Stories (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.), or for a personal blog.<p>Rolling out the beta now.
