JIRA doesn&#x27;t imply any sort of top down approach. In fact, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s the best tool for those tight feedback loops. Each ticket is a versioned history of the decisions, feedback and work history of a single task. Startups can get away without tools because they can communicate very tightly. That doesn&#x27;t scale much past an org of even 20 people. Not everyone can talk directly to the CEO or the budget makers, nor are they all sufficiently cognizant of the business constraints to make the right calls on prioritization. There isn&#x27;t a tier of professional managers as much there&#x27;s a tier of experts in their discipleship who have visibility across multiple teams and into the business decision making. People who need to allocate budgets and resources without attending every scrum or sprint planning.')
