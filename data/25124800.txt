That&#x27;s why I believe it is fair to take their word and compare it against my other options for a professional video editing rig. And in that comparison, which Apple has chosen itself, the M1 comes out woefully inadequate at a mere 24% of the performance.<p>Of course, for a notebook, the M1 is amazing. But I feel irked that Apple and Anandtech pretend that it&#x27;s competitive with desktop workstations by having such a misleading conclusion about it being on par with Zen3 - which it clearly isn&#x27;t.')
