Item(by='dylz', descendants=None, kids=[25336716], score=None, time=1607371534, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25336313, text='I&#x27;m going to point out that if you want to go down this route, it is insufficient to just check that the base drivers are untampered with and signed by Microsoft or whatever vendor still.<p>You now maintain a list of potentially vulnerable drivers that can be used as a jumping off point (such as virtually every motherboard RGB or fan control system), and ban users that have these or hard-disable them at boot. There are some games that have caused machines to overheat by disabling cheat-jumpoffable fan controllers.<p>On top of that, you effectively have to maintain a whitelist  of acceptable drivers, because cheat vendors are registering limited companies by the thousands (only $20 in the UK), getting an EV&#x2F;codesigning cert, and signing their own drivers. Higher end cheats cost enough to offset this, and there might be less than 5-6 people using a particular certificate. Some of the people behind these also release vaguely-useful legal tools signed with the same certificates to get a large install base for them so they don&#x27;t stick out.<p>That being said, IMO as a player, this is invasive as hell, and you should not be crawling through my flash drives, identifying my mouse, killing LogitechMacroSoftware.exe, etc. I&#x27;d rather you just collect snap&#x2F;targetting&#x2F;click timings server-side and run anomaly analysis on those rather than digging an asshole into my computer.<p>Also, now I have 5 different &quot;kernel anticheats&quot; running 24&#x2F;7 simultaneously, half of them are horrifically written and known-insecure, and the other half need to figure out how to not explode spectacularly when the broken half tries to probe and kill it.<p>Korean MMOs are particularly bad for this and when forcefully uninstalled might permanently destroy disk access, make Windows non-genuine and deactivate it, and send all their data over plaintext (no TLS) with a bizarre, homegrown &quot;encryption&quot; method that is trivially breakable to a bare IP somewhere.<p>With KMMOs as an example (many of these reward you for staying logged in, have daily rewards, and similar; the game itself is fairly low resource when minimised), GameGuard and HackShield and XIGNCODE constantly have slap-fights where they bluescreen or flop over or die if you try to run multiple of them simultaneously and they try probing and killing each others&#x27; services for trying to tamper with themselves. It&#x27;s like that ridiculous &quot;what happens if three programs all try to demand Always On Top for their window&quot;, except give all of them heavy weaponry. These also have severe NIH syndrome for things like homemade shitty crypto and plaintext everything.')
