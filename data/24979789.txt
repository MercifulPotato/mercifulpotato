We can be more efficient with our ressources, what I had in mind was the total ressource consumption&#x2F;extraction. Any efficiency we gain is largely offset by the rebound effect in our current system of production, i.e the GDP grows faster than the ressource intensity can catch up with.<p>And of course, the data has to be world-wide since the economy is globalized [1].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yearbook.enerdata.net&#x2F;total-energy&#x2F;world-consumption-statistics.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yearbook.enerdata.net&#x2F;total-energy&#x2F;world-consumption...</a><p>&gt; The universe of digital goods and services, for one.<p>Digital goods consume energy, more and more of it. For now gain in efficiency almost (not quite though) offset the growth [2], and that is discarding all the energy and ressources needed to build the servers and chips in the first place.<p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iea.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;digitalisation-and-energy#energy-use-by-information-and-communications-technologies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iea.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;digitalisation-and-energy#energy...</a>')
