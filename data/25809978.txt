That is roughly 3 times the memory bandwidth of current mobile M chip. Or DDR5 and pushes it to 400GB&#x2F;s. Although DDR5 is barely out.<p>Also worth noting, if they use 8 Channel DDR configuration, the minimal amount of RAM shipping would be 64GB.<p>None of the above hypothesis seems very Apple to me.')
