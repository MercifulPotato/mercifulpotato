I looked into implementing backpropagation on a Connection Machine CM2 back in the late 1980s. I got to the point of implementing the training algorithm in C* (an SIMD variant of C). However, I ultimately decided in favor of using a shared memory multi-processor. The main problem was that time on my unversity&#x27;s CM2 was very hard to come by.')
