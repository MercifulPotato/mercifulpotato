No one ever seems to understand each other better when this is brought up.<p>People seem to always assume&#x2F;project the other party is controlled by high levels of anxiety around using masks when in reality I see most people know that distancing&#x2F;masks are a risk mitigation technique (NOT a one-stop-fix, but a <i>risk mitigation</i>) used to bring virus spread rate down and flatten the curve.  Instead of being an emotionally charged subject, I think most people see distancing&#x2F;masks as a tool to reduce the spread of the virus so that we <i>can</i> go out more often as opposed to taking no mitigations and contributing to exponential rates of virus spread.<p>With this perspective, I think feeling violated by people avoiding masks is a healthy, normal response.  It&#x27;s not about feeling anxious for going outside, but that we have been violated by people spreading the virus to others causing us to have to extend the lockdown and keep our economy dead in order to not over-burden the hospitals.')
