Consumer debt (primarily credit card, but also HELOC) distorts the timely impact of purchasing signals upon pricing, but wages-offered signals are much quicker to respond. The debt acts as phantom wages, but only for awhile does this levitating act suspend disbelief in the pricing signals, until the debt service overwhelms consumers. By then, the purchasing decision has already long since been priced into the market, and the correction of the debt overwhelming the consumer is either completely ignored because it is by now disconnected, or attenuated away into irrelevance.<p>&quot;Awhile&quot; in this use case is longer than the time horizon of most consumers, on the order of a few months to a few years depending upon the individual, but in any case long enough to modify consumer behavior. The glass half-full perspective is this behavior implies a strong optimistic bias to consumers; nearly everyone believes they will make the debt nut over time. Looking at the historic patterns of US institutions laying off however, most working and middle class US consumers should be much more secularly pessimistic in looking after their own interests: they should be acting on a cash-basis only, and make very austere purchasing decisions therefrom until they can use capital to help themselves, instead of capital using them via debt (with extremely few exceptions, like home mortgage in very circumscribed circumstances which most of them do not qualify for).<p><i>&gt; Your medical bill comment -- you&#x27;re basically saying that when one of these families hits a statistically predictable snag, they&#x27;re instantly bankrupt because they&#x27;ve always been functionally broke, propped up by the consumer debt industry?</i><p>Correct. Most working and middle class families are under-insured. Using plans that only pay 80% of covered procedures. Or have very high annual deductibles to afford the premiums, which are orders of magnitude more than what they can pay from savings. Most such families struggle to find $400 to spare [1]. A typical high-deductible-low-premium health plan will typically set back a family $2-4,000 before the plan kicks in, and for many of these families, the plan offered by employers only pays 80% of covered procedures, and there are many exceptions to covered procedures.<p>Unless you are well-educated, persistent, have time to set aside, apply an extremely low time preference, and able to learn the ropes, these families are completely unprepared for the probable budget killing black swans. One bad broken bone, or God forbid a serious disease, they first get blind-sided by a $2,500 deductible. Which they&#x27;ll take on debt to meet. Then they start getting the bills and dunning letters. Many of which are wrong, but that&#x27;s where the &quot;well-educated, persistent, have time to set aside&quot; part comes into play: you have to be willing to pay the cost in your own time and energy to make the phone calls and figure out which bills are legitimately what you have to pay, and which the insurance company has to pay, and do other people&#x27;s jobs for them by pointing out where it says in the black letter policies their own companies wrote. So many of these families start good-naturedly taking on more debt for multi-hundred (if they&#x27;re lucky) and multi-thousand (typical) bills they shouldn&#x27;t, which they cannot afford.<p>It is not unusual for a mean household income of $68,000 to get blindsided with $30,000 in medical debt. At high double-digit interest rates. Mix in a chronic, terminal or serious illness, and they start racking up nearly that much every single year. The US system is fundamentally broken.<p><i>&gt; And so you&#x27;re saying that most commodity goods face deflationary pressure as a means to stabilize the market? So if the price of commodity goods does increase significantly beyond the capacity of debt issuance, we&#x27;re likely to see a depression?</i><p>Most commodity goods consumed by working and middle classes are facing deflationary pressure on the consumer buy side because the bulk of consumers in working and middle classes are barely staying afloat through sheer, literal luck of the draw. But yes, with those qualifiers in place, you rephrased what I intended convey.<p>Due to the US lack of adequate response to COVID-19, the presence of an unknown, yet statistically significant recovered population exhibiting what so far appear to be chronic after effects, and the above dynamics with medical debt, one factor to the US economic recovery story I&#x27;m watching is how many people go into bankruptcy because their after-acute-recovery conditions require too much care (in the US, any ongoing care is too much for such financially-stressed families). 19.9M infected is large enough to affect the margins if enough of them require even medium-term (3-7 year) care, not to speak of life-long care. I wish I had hedge fund-grade access to data, as this is tradeable information at the macro scale.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;20&#x2F;heres-why-so-many-americans-cant-handle-a-400-unexpected-expense.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;20&#x2F;heres-why-so-many-americans-...</a>')
