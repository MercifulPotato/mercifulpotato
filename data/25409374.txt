I got half way through chapter 1 before the author stated, as support for his argument, that The Bell Curve was &quot;overtly racist&quot;. Now, you could argue that lots of racists like that book, that the authors might be motivated by bias, etc etc, but no credible reviewer at the time it came out would call it &quot;overtly racist&quot;. This is retroactive moving of the goal posts, and the word &quot;overt&quot;, to me, still has meaning.<p>So I tried to read the tripe, but the arguments are not persuasive unless you already believe what they are trying to convince you of.')
