It&#x27;s hard not to mention my startup, The Factual, which is proving that people will pay a modest amount for ad-free, unbiased news on trending topics. I suspect this will get downvoted but I don&#x27;t know how not to scream &quot;we have a solution&quot; to a problem so many have. So as not to be entirely biased let me mention other good offerings: The New Paper, Knowhere News.<p>Of course, our solution is not for everyone. If you have a well-tuned Twitter feed, or have figured out forums like HN&#x2F;Reddit where you get news and commentary you trust, then we may not be as useful for you. But for the vast majority that just want the facts on topics of importance our daily newsletter is an easy way to stay informed and then get on with life. And we&#x27;ve priced it to be affordable for everyone so that factual news is not just for the rich.')
