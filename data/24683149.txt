Bring back editorial review. If it was good enough for Planck and Einstein itâ€™s good enough for everyone.<p>&gt; For instance, the Annalen der Physik, in which Einstein published his four famous papers in 1905, did not subject those papers to the same review process. The journal had a remarkably high acceptance rate (of about 90-95%). The identifiable editors were making the final decisions about what to publish. It is the storied editor Max Planck who described his editorial philosophy as:<p>&gt; <i>To shun much more the reproach of having suppressed strange opinions than that of having been too gentle in evaluating them.</i>')
