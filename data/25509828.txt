This is not legal advice so go seek your own licensed legal counsel.<p>If they don’t pay you the equity then they would not own your tech. Any revenue&#x2F;profit they derive would be unjust enrichment.<p>Not to say that I’d even leave them with working tech. I’d disable everything I built today until we had a more equitable agreement.<p>No chance I’d let them profit from this tech alone anymore. At best I’d offer them a license to use it.<p>Then go start your own company with it and be the majority owner.<p>No need for the bad business partner.')
