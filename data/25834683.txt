If I think the author of the GPLed project &quot;foobar&quot; is a jerk, and I fork it and maintain it without colaborating with foobar&#x27;s original author, am I &quot;abusing&quot; the GPL?<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think so, and I think I should have the right to do so. I wonder how this is different from Amazon behavior here. (I want to make clear that I&#x27;m not saying Shay or anybody at elastic is anything. This is for the sake of the example.)<p>Now foobar&#x27;s author can stop me from using his project name by registering a trademark on it. But the GPL is working as intented.<p>At the end, &quot;maintaning&quot; a fork of Elastic is wasted engineering effort and time, it would be better to collaborate. But I personally think Elastic should just ignore Amazon and keep doing what their doing, instead of making their product proprietary.')
