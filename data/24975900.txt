She believed in a woman&#x27;s right to an abortion, but also believed the basis for the decision in Roe V Wade was weak and its scope made it vulnerable to attack (and she was correct in hindsight.) From what I read, she believed a stronger argument could have been made from the equal protection clause rather than right to privacy. But she certainly believed the underlying right was valid.<p>But let&#x27;s be honest - almost no one opposing Roe V. Wade does so on the grounds that the argument from the fourth amendment is weak, they argue primarily from religious grounds that pregnant women fundamentally do not have the right to terminate, as they consider such to be an act of murder in nearly all, or all cases.<p>The crux of the matter regarding abortion for most people has never really been a legalistic one but a metaphysical and often religious one - the rights of the unborn versus the rights of a woman&#x27;s autonomy over her body.<p>While I would hope that Republicans who drape themselves in Christian piety and refer to themselves as pro-life in order to imply that their opponents are pro-death, and who have made an existential pillar out of repealing Roe V. Wade for forty years, would stack the courts with judges who would consider the matter without undue bias, I suspect that bias is the intent for stacking the court to begin with,and that the actual constitutional validity of the decision isn&#x27;t meant to matter.')
