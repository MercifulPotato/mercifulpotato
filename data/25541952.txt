And if the dispatcher doesn&#x27;t do it, we can easily just have the police officer responding to validate the match between the surveillance photo and a known photo of the suspect. Humans already have a false positive rate as part of existing policing procedures, and facial recognition doesn’t make the rate worse as long as it retains a human validating the AI’s match.<p>Also, almost every state has a process to expunge arrests even IF you were convicted (of something minor).<p>As for why I’m confident about net improvement - it’s because the amount of true positive arrests (and subsequent convictions) will be far greater than false positive arrests. Therefore relative to the status quo it’ll be a net positive of criminals facing consequences, victims being compensated or getting closure, subsequent reduction in crime through deterrence, etc.')
