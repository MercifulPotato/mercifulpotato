Proceed at your own risk :-)<p>Would you agree that given exact info of conditions one can objectively assign concrete probability? That would give objectivity to it.<p>Definition of &quot;real&quot; for daily life is hard (impossible?). I would say &quot;probabilities&quot; are as real as other useful constructs that impact our lifes. Examples would be &quot;countries&quot; and &quot;laws&quot;.<p>Is country X real? (what if it is recognised only by 1 UN nation?) Is law real? Is law real in &lt;insert-country-in-turmoil-with-very-very-selective-enforcement&gt;.')
