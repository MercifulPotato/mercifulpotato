All other positions are inexplicably extremist while I have carefully cultivated an intelligent rational position. Unusual among Mankind, I have been blessed with the power to apply reason to terrible subjects. It is sad that all the other people are such extremists for if they weren&#x27;t we could have had such productive discourse. I could&#x27;ve convinced them of how right I am by application of reasoned discussion of evidence. But alas, I stand beset on all sides by irrational fear-mongers, violent identitarians, and wishful communists. Disgusting.<p>Naturally, any rebuke of my position is evidence of their extremism, for steeped in their emotion they are unable to be rational. I, on the other hand, am wise beyond belief, empowered by the reason that Nature and my own path to self-growth have given me.<p>¹ To be clear, I always think about things carefully. I only mention this because it is clear that almost everyone else doesn&#x27;t, as evinced by the fact that they do not agree with me.')
