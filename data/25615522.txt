There are numerous reports of incorrect flagging of business accounts and ads managers and insanely long review processes (which, by the way, never result in an apology) on forums outside Facebook. Advertisers were moving to other platforms because Facebook became unpredictable and ads costs were skyrocketing just before the US elections.<p>It&#x27;s a bit better now but they still seem to have problems identifying objectionable content. If the system doesn&#x27;t work for ads, it won&#x27;t work for orders of magnitude more user posts either.')
