Item(by='wombatmobile', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610928081, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25815078, text='&gt; Einstein reports Hume&#x27;s influence on him and says that without Hume it&#x27;s possible he would never have come up with relativity. That&#x27;s as solid evidence of a link as could exist.<p>I see what you&#x27;re saying.  If Einstein attributes his thinking to Hume&#x27;s influence, nobody can deny it.  That&#x27;s true of admissions in a court of law, however, our understanding of how scientific ideas are generated lacks the same certainty.  Personal reflection is no guarantee of insight into the formation of ideas.<p>Einstein&#x27;s acknowledgement of Hume as an intellectual predecessor tells us he admires Hume.  It doesn&#x27;t tell us where Einstein&#x27;s own thoughts came from.  Our knowledge of neurology isn&#x27;t advanced enough to draw that conclusion.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;there-is-no-such-thing-as-conscious-thought&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;there-is-no-such-...</a>')
