I&#x27;m glad to hear that Kivy has larger aspirations than simply being a mobile focused cross-platform solution, and that it&#x27;s got enough of a community to sustain its efforts. Cool also that it&#x27;s able to leverage Python tools that the native mobile apps aren&#x27;t able to hook into. It sounds like Kivy does have a small community of avid Pythonistas.')
