There is no evidence on the interchangeability of the COVID-19 vaccines although studies are underway. Therefore, every effort should be made to determine which vaccine the individual received and to complete with the same vaccine. For individuals who started the schedule and who attend for vaccination at a site where the same vaccine is not available, or if the first product received is unknown, it is reasonable to offer one dose of the locally available product to complete the schedule. This option is preferred if the individual is likely to be at immediate high risk or is considered unlikely to attend again. In these circumstances, as both the vaccines are based on the \nspike protein, it is likely the second dose will help to boost the response to the first dose. For this reason, until additional information becomes available, further doses would not then be required. [2]<p>So we&#x27;re still waiting for what the actual rule is. In the mean time, rather than saying &quot;I&#x27;ll get back to you&quot; various ministers have insisted on both and a whole set of various levels in between. Including saying you can mix and match and that&#x27;s A-OK! Something not supported by the links above.<p>It it makes you feel any better, the UKs current Conservative government is probably a little to the right of Joe Biden rather than being close to the republicans. And they&#x27;re vastly below his dog in terms of communication skills, competence and IQ.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.england.nhs.uk&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;52&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;C0994-System-letter-COVID-19-vaccination-deployment-planning-30-December-2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.england.nhs.uk&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;si...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;system&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;attachment_data&#x2F;file&#x2F;948757&#x2F;Greenbook_chapter_14a_v4.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;...</a>')
