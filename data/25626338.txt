We have full socialized healthcare and great unemployment benefits. Yet we also suffer from the same problems in academia.<p>Having those is pretty orthogonal to actually getting results in science. No need to mix them in.<p>Universities should actually fund (so indirectly by the goverment from taxes) long term research. That’s kinda the whole point of Universities, in addition to education. Long term research that doesn’t have immediate short them commercial interest. Not make the scientists be basically startup founders that must constantly pitch to get money.<p>And the reason we want to support that is because on long term there often is very useful commercial benefits that then improve everyones lives.')
