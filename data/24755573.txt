Aside from that, the reason you don&#x27;t see more of this is because the really potent nerve agents and useful explosives (smokeless powders and beyond) have complex reactions that require trained chemists to produce.<p>It&#x27;s a good thing most people aren&#x27;t motivated to do that, but Aum Shinrikyo happened in our lifetimes.<p>I personally have the know how to create several things that are genuinely dangerous (like an EPFCG...I even have a copy of the 70s-era paper from LANL), but absolutely zero motivation to do so. It&#x27;s not regulation that&#x27;s stopping me.<p>You can build lasers that can blind people with the laser diode from your blu-ray player and people do it for fun. Nothing illegal about it here either and I&#x27;ve built a few.<p>[1]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;the-sciences&#x2F;how-to-build-a-usd1000-fusion-reactor-in-your-basement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;the-sciences&#x2F;how-to-build-a...</a>\n[2]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;12-year-old-builds-nuclear-reactor-at-home-with-equipment-from-ebay-2019-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;12-year-old-builds-nuclear-r...</a>\n[3]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instructables.com&#x2F;Build-A-Fusion-Reactor&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instructables.com&#x2F;Build-A-Fusion-Reactor&#x2F;</a>\n[4]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popularmechanics.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;a30917842&#x2F;homemade-nuclear-reactor&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popularmechanics.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;a30917842&#x2F;homemade-...</a>\n[5]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;teen-builds-working-nuclear-fusion-reactor-in-memphis-home" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;teen-builds-working-nuclear-...</a>\n[6]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalgeographic.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;150726-nuclear-reactor-fusion-science-kid-ngbooktalk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalgeographic.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;150726-nucle...</a><p>Regulation really hasn&#x27;t stopped any government from manufacturing nuclear weapons. Proliferation treaties have largely been a failure as you can see evidence of in recent years. The actual _use_ of nuclear weapons is something else and has nothing to do with regulation. The use of nuclear and chemical weapons doesn&#x27;t support any governments war objectives. It turns out you don&#x27;t actually win if everyone in the world simultaneously hates you, won&#x27;t trade with you and will sanction you into oblivion. It turns out that the ability to import and export goods is worth more than the dead bodies of your enemies.')
