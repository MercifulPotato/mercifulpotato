It sounds like rationalizing contentness with the status quo. We embrace life over death all the time, we fight disease, famine, and other causes of death all over the world. I&#x27;m not going to go against that instinct for promoting life because of some theoretical arguments of sein-zum-tode. The existence of such arguments in itself proves nothing: enough opposing arguments have been brought forth as well (like the fable of the dragon, linked in the other reply).<p>But again, to me the proper response is akin to Moore: I love living. We fight for life everywhere. That has more swaying power than the theoretical arguments of some philosopher concluding immortality leads to meaninglessness.')
