Engaging in it in good faith as in the linked article is a reasonable approach (that you don&#x27;t usually see represented in Klein&#x27;s oeuvre): consider tradeoffs, counterarguments, and historical context from different perspectives. Apple is flawed sure, because all complex solutions are inherently flawed. They have a responsibility to be more open and transparent, and I&#x27;d prefer to see more details and updates to their otherwise laudable security whitepaper [1], and clearer more accessible user-definable toggles.
