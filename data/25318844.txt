It&#x27;s there, they think, and they might think so rightly. But is it worth it? And never do they stop and ponder, in their never-ending fall. One day they realize that they&#x27;ve been spending the last five years, maybe decade, maybe more, in a non-sense lifestyle. Spending most of their time sitting in front of a computer, or pretending to change the world with their peers in rooms without windows. The bay is truly a prison. One where you are endlessly given what you want, in exchange of your time. So you give your time, and in return you buy the latest technological birth of the valley. In exchange you shop for the most comfortable and the most pricey sweatpants that you can wear at work. In exchange you subscribe for flavored bottles of water. Because you can, because you have the money, because you fucking deserve it you&#x27;re working hard and playing hard for fuck sake. And so once in a while, when you have some free time, you drop in wine country. They have subscription there too, they sell you the bullshit and you empty your wallet. It&#x27;s not worth it, but you don&#x27;t care, this is monopoly money. You cross the low souls of the San Francisco street, the heroin heads, the garbage of society. You don&#x27;t even see them anymore. You get your cheese matcha boba dairy-free latte for $10 and you wonder why all these cashiers have the same square point of sale that asks you for a tip. Should you tip? You don&#x27;t really want to tip. But someone dressed in a Patagonia sweater behind you is looking at the screen. So you tip the minimum. It&#x27;s fuck you money anyway.<p>Comes the night, you&#x27;re so lonely. All the streets are empty because tomorrow they need to wake up at CEO time. You still ask some friends on Telegram but they all live in south bay or the east. They probably have a worse life than you, that makes you smile. So you medicate yourself to sleep with some of that legal drug, then next day you wake yourself up with a few cup of another legal one. It&#x27;s a cycle, you know it, everything is a cycle. You either dream big, or you dream of leaving. But you&#x27;re vesting, and you&#x27;re going to make it, and if this one is not the one, maybe the next one will be. The people in LA sounds like they&#x27;re having fun, but we&#x27;re changing the world here. We&#x27;re fucking changing the world.')
