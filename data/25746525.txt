They didn&#x27;t make a billion dollars by sending people information about how much time you spent on the app. They analyse your chats and posts to see what kinds of things you&#x27;re interested in so they can build a sort of &#x27;person data structure&#x27; full of data points unique to you that they can package up and sell to advertisers.<p>This is just my best guess anyway, based on what I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere in the industry. It&#x27;s safe to assume Facebook is hoarding any data about you they can legally get their hands on, including contact info, speech info, facial info, information of people who don&#x27;t even use Facebook.. There&#x27;s almost no laws for this industry yet, you can collect anything.')
