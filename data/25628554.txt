When I joined the project, I didn&#x27;t understand it enough to feel how relational the model really was. It only became apparent to me later on.

Querying is surprising in many ways (less so if you&#x27;re used to MongoDB I guess).<p>As you can guess, joins across documents and the like are not  really great... and often necessary for relational data.<p>The correct approach, assuming that we&#x27;d want to continue with it would be to denormalize the data much further (which we did not do so far), and perform data reconciliation...<p>The offline-first case did sound convincing enough to me in the beginning, because we were targeting high level executives, which probably travel a lot more often than others, and still want to be able to work.<p>But the world ain&#x27;t static..
