High-risk groups succumbing to COVID-19 include those with preexisting conditions, such as diabetes and obesity, which are also associated with microbiome abnormalities. Current pandemic control measures and practices will have broad, uneven, and potentially long-term effects for the human microbiome across the planet, given the implementation of physical separation, extensive hygiene, travel barriers, and other measures that influence overall microbial loss and inability for reinoculation. Although much remains uncertain or unknown about the virus and its consequences, implementing pandemic control practices could significantly affect the microbiome.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;118&#x2F;6&#x2F;e2010217118" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;118&#x2F;6&#x2F;e2010217118</a>')
