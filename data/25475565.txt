When you really need to end up with a very large single system image at the application layer, the bigger architecture works out to be much cheaper than 256gb DIMMs or HPC networking.<p>8-socket CLX nets you 1.75x the cores, and 3x as many memory channels vs. a 2-socket Rome system. It also scales to a single system image with 32 sockets if you use a fabric to connect smaller nodes:<p>* 4-socket nodes: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hpe.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;servers&#x2F;superdome.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hpe.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;servers&#x2F;superdome.html</a><p>* 2-socket nodes: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atos.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;enterprise-servers&#x2F;bullsequana-s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atos.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;enterprise-servers&#x2F;bullsequana...</a><p>That&#x27;s 48tb of DRAM with all 128gb DIMMs, or 12tb+128tb when using 512gb Optane PDIMMs.')
