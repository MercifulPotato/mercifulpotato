That’s why sleep deprived creature dies from misbehaving organs. Some neurons are not required for this task, because they are too specialized. Namely neurons responsible for vision, conscience, movement. They receive random signals which don’t really mean anything and more like white noise. But brain is brain, so those neurons are trying to make sense from that noise and that’s how dreams are created.')
