I do believe, that if youre writing a prototypical, client facing, transactional application, a web framework is very useful.<p>I also advice any individuals coming from Django or friends to use a web framework.<p>But after some time spent with the stdlib, and understanding how some of those implementations work, it gets to the point where Id rather not read another set of documentation, learn a new mental model, and deal with bugs. This all comes with a framework.<p>After awhile you realize that the stdlib provides most of what you need, and that writing more vanilla Go can be simpler then learning a full framework.<p>I will admit, most my work in Go revolves around internal services, and dont deal with web technologies such as CSRF and CORS. So I do acknowledge my opinion here is leaned toward those use cases.')
