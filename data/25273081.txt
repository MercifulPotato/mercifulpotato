Between my partner and I, we&#x27;ve got about 30 burns below our belts and have led two different 3-story burnable structures centered on community, play, and curiosity.  Doing a comedy piece was new territory, but a lot of work went into making the most guady, out-of-place, consumerist looking strip-mall pawn shop we could.  So much detail, and all of it just a bit off.  It took people off guard, which for the older burners was a very welcome change, and for the newer ones it just seemed to confuse them.<p>My favorite memory was two satanist girls who were on a lot of acid and who knows what else absolutely losing their shit.  I think, in the end, we were all laughing at how depressing poorly regulated capitalism can be sometimes.  I still laugh whenever I see pay-day loan stores.')
