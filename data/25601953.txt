If you put a 24mm lens on a full frame 5D and a 24*1.6=38.4 mm lens on a APS-C 7D you will see the same angle of view.<p>The focal length numbers printed on an EF or an EF-s lens are the same thing for consistency. The crop factor isn’t included. So if you take a photo on a full frame 5D and also an APS-C 7D and crop accordingly to account for the difference in sensor size you get the same thing.<p>So what do the numbers printed on the lens correspond to?
