The law is sacred, the law must be obeyed, people are rightly punished for breaking the law, yet the law is enforced incredibly inconsistently, and for what are often quite political goals.<p>It comes to a particularly poignant moment at the top of the political structure, in the form of presidential pardons, many of them self-serving. (How their existence can be reconciled with claims about all men being equal under the law is mind-boggling.)<p>Rule of law is a sliding scale. Some countries have more of it, some have less of it, but from having lived in four of them, my observation is that none of them have enough of it. Violations of it simply manifest in different ways.')
