The economy is highly artificial. It turned into a giant ponzi scheme and it constantly needs to use media to brainwash its participants in order to give legitimacy to fickleness. Fickleness and fragility is what you get when you have a system founded on an infinite debt bubble which keeps spreading itself thinner over time.<p>People literally have to go insane to get by in this insane system. The industries which are closest to the money printers are incoherent and have nothing to do with capitalism.')
