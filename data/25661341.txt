You might be missing my point here, which is: relying on credentials isn&#x27;t working out as well as people might think for surgeons. They have a much stronger credential requirement, so if it isn&#x27;t working for them, it probably won&#x27;t work for hiring software engineers either.<p>But to answer your question, of the two links I included:<p>* the first is an artificial test that can be taken any time. Yes, it could be actually done during a job interview, and maybe it should. Alternatively, maybe it should be done yearly, whether that&#x27;s enforced by the medical licensing board, the hospital, or insurance (either the patients&#x27; insurance forces it or the doctor&#x27;s malpractice insurance).<p>* the second mentions criteria for ranking performance from a video of an actual surgery. No, I&#x27;m not suggesting applicants perform unnecessary surgery on a live patient during the job interview. They can bring a video of their most recent surgery instead.<p>The details of the best method for surgeons might not be that relevant to hiring software engineers, but I do think for both it&#x27;s better to evaluate current skill rather than rely on exams from school years ago. Software engineering does this better than most fields, even if it sometimes leads to really bad results like not hiring Dan Luu.
