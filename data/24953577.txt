The story isn&#x27;t 100% false but it probably needs some context.<p>I&#x27;ve actually heard the oven story before. Its an absurd (and very racist) aphorism, but I think calling it a &quot;lesson&quot; from a textbook would be a stretch. What likely happened was that the school selected anthologies that kids could read to develop their reading skills. It probably included that absurd story.<p>I think the American equivalent would be if a 2nd grade reading book included an old fairy tale with some outdated racist undertones (ie Zwarte Piet), and then the media ran with &quot;American textbooks claim a black elf will kidnap children if they misbehave&quot;.<p>PS. I&#x27;ll need to check of the textbook story.')
