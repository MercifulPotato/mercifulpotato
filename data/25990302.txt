To me, the reliability exploits the hobbyist&#x27;s inexperience; they don&#x27;t know how short a edit&#x2F;test cycle should be, so they aren&#x27;t upset by how long it is.  &quot;Hardware is hard,&quot; they&#x27;re told.<p>As other comments mention, the real innovation is not making them flash firmware at all -- things like Circuit Python have worked very well for me, and you can point your editor at a Python file right on the device itself and it starts running from the top when you save.  That is probably the ideal situation; nevermind how inefficient it is compared to C++ (people can learn C++ once they understand the basics of programming; no need to start there).<p>I&#x27;ll also point out that Amazon has STM32 kits; $18 gets you 2 STM32F103s and a programmer.  I have used those and they are probably my favorite microcontroller platform and the price sure is good.  There is no doubt about which programmer to use because it&#x27;s in the box, and the programmer is so cheap that buying one (and a backup microcontroller) is cheaper than most hobbyist MCU boards.  (&quot;Made in Italy&quot; ends up being quite a bit pricier than &quot;made in China probably from a grey-market chip&quot;.)')
