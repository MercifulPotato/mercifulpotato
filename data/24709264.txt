Going rate is £400-500 a pair. They&#x27;ll require new soles from time to time which will cost you £100-200 as well for professional refurbishment. Rubber soled boots will require a new heal every 1-2 years but if you keep on top of that the rest of the sole should last 4-5 years. Shoes will require new laces from time to time. You&#x27;ll also need quality leather cream polish which you&#x27;ll apply regularly.')
