M1 uses the AArch64 ISA, so for the initial port, the existing AArch64 support in OpenJDK can just be used.<p>Sure, they can make optimizations now or in the future for ARMv8.6-A or the Neural Engine (if they are ok with going through Apple&#x27;s framework). But M1 could pretty much use the existing AArch64 code from day 1 and have good performance.<p>(See benchmarks that float around the net where OpenJDK on AWS Graviton is competitive with Intel CPUs.)')
