While that is true, everyone speaks Urdu. If you have a regional language you can grow up speaking both languages fluently, or just one—depending on which you&#x27;re more exposed to—and even English if you were educated in it.<p>For example, my dad&#x27;s regional language was Seraiki, and my mom&#x27;s Punjabi, and they speak both and Urdu fluently. I grew up in an area where the regional language was Punjabi.
