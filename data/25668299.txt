While that is true, everyone speaks Urdu. If you have a regional language you can grow up speaking both languages fluently, or just one—depending on which you&#x27;re more exposed to—and even English if you were educated in it.<p>For example, my dad&#x27;s regional language was Seraiki, and my mom&#x27;s Punjabi, and they speak both and Urdu fluently. I grew up in an area where the regional language was Punjabi. But, I&#x27;m not as fluent in Punjabi or Seraiki as I am in Urdu.<p>However, I&#x27;ve never had trouble using Urdu with someone in Pakistan, even if their regional language was Sindhi, Pashto or Hindko. Also, I don&#x27;t know why if it&#x27;s just me, but most regional languages sound very similar—I&#x27;ve had conversations where I spoke Urdu while the other person spoke in a regional language.')
