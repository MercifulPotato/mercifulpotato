Then on the database server only allow connections from the internal IP of the VPN server.<p>Ideally the database is in a private subnet in the VPC (can&#x27;t accessed directly from the outside at all) and the VPN server is a public subnet with an Elastic (static) IP. That is how to set it up on AWS anyway, I am not sure the DO networking equivalents off the top of my head.')
