For example, I don&#x27;t think this will do anything for &quot;face privacy&quot; if you travel out of the EU. If someone snaps and uploads your face to a database like findclone.ru, how will this help finding and deleting that information from an out of scope database? Counter-intuitively, I think we need much better tools that enable us to actively search the entire Internet for our face, and only then can we begin to fix how to reset that data back to null.')
