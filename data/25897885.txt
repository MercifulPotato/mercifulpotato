However none of the other caps have failed.<p>As an electronic serviceman I&#x27;m certain that the Capacitor plague story is a myth. Yes, there was a batch of bad caps produced for a short time, but the effect was limited.<p>The myth is largely peddled by ebay sellers who sell kits of replacement capacitors. My experience is that more devices have been destroyed by inexperienced enthusiasts waving a soldering iron around, than those which actually had faulty capacitors.')
