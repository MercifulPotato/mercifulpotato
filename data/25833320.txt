It really is such a non problem imo.<p>I can definitely see the reasoning for using 1-based since you really are using cardinals (or ordinal or whatever). This is made maybe most clear looking at Haskell or other FP langs that usually have fst &amp; snd functions.<p>At the same time, I could also see an array as sort of a map between ints and a obj in the array. This would allow for any number to be used there and why not just start with 0 then, since that is the &quot;default&quot; &#x2F; first defined value of an int.<p>Actually haven&#x27;t read Dijkstra&#x27;s take on it. Will go do that.')
