Maybe the criteria aren&#x27;t so &#x27;similar&#x27;.<p>For the same reason no one designated GRU or Mossad operatives. The weight of the state behind them and absurdity of the act. But the US government has decided to stretch definition of terrorism (and frankly deflating its value even further in the process) to somehow limit actions of IRGC, which were clearly outplaying the US in the ME region, not in the last because of the Soleimeini&#x27;s masterful leadership.<p>&gt;These restrictions were not to be lifted immediately. That particular limit was due to expire only this October.<p>Sigh... Read the sources, ok?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europarl.europa.eu&#x2F;cmsdata&#x2F;122460&#x2F;full-text-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europarl.europa.eu&#x2F;cmsdata&#x2F;122460&#x2F;full-text-of-t...</a><p>&gt;The UN Security Council resolution endorsing this JCPOA will terminate all provisions of previous UN Security Council resolutions on the Iranian nuclear issue -1696 (2006), 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008), 1835 (2008), 1929 (2010) and 2224 (2015) â€“simultaneously with the IAEA-verified implementation of agreed nuclear-related measures by Iran and will establish specific restrictions, as specified in Annex V.<p>In October expired the UN arms embargo, which is irrelevant to the 1747 resolution affecting Soleimeini. If you read news just a little at the time, you may recall that economic sanctions against Iran have been lifted long before this October.<p>&gt;Maybe al-Qaeda + Assad and Iran&#x27;s support for insurgents during the Iraq war played a huge part. They encouraged fanaticism which shockingly turned against everyone.<p>Wow. Are you even aware that Iran is a Shia state and mostly supports Shia militia groups in other countries, while ISIS was predominantly Sunni? And that Assad is from the Alawite minority, who is also Shia? If anyone has supported al-Qaeda in the Syrian civil war it&#x27;s the US and Turkey. The former has acknowledged indirect &quot;accidental&quot; support of the  al-Qaeda branch via &quot;moderate&quot; rebels.<p>To conclude: you demonstrate utter lack of knowledge in this area.')
