So democracy is a hollow word, or worse: a facade, a lie.<p>I agree that lobbies have far more power than citizens, and that this is a problem. However, maybe I&#x27;m misreading you, but it seems like you might be implying that since we don&#x27;t have democracy anyway, censorship is fine? Of course, that&#x27;s not true; we don&#x27;t want to actively invest in <i>preventing</i> ourselves from getting back to something we can meaningfully call &quot;democracy&quot; by way of legitimizing censorship. Again, probably not your intended meaning, but I wanted to address it anyway.<p>While we&#x27;re talking about corporations having too much power, let&#x27;s talk about social media companies--they can influence our society <i>directly</i>. They don&#x27;t have to pay people to petition congress on their behalf; they can pay Twitter and Facebook for access (think &quot;Social Dilemma&quot;). Indeed, they have so much power that we were concerned circa 2017 that the Russians were able to indirectly use their influence over us to corrupt the 2016 POTUS election; how much more influence must Twitter and Facebook (and now Chinese-owned TikTok) have over our democracy given that they have direct access to those algorithmic levers? The super rich can now lobby <i>and</i> pay Twitter&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;etc in order to pass their policies.')
