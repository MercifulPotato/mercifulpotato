There was no reliable evidence that either drug reduces the risk of people with flu being admitted to hospital or developing serious complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis or ear infection. Used as a preventative measure, Tamiflu and Relenza slightly reduced the risk of developing the symptoms of flu. The review also found no evidence that these drugs can stop people carrying the influenza virus and spreading it to others.<p>&gt; The study also found that Tamiflu slightly increases the risk of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric and kidney problems in adults, and vomiting in children.')
