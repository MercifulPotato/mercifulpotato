Yes, you need specific pans, but all the good ones are induction ready anyway.<p>Besides that, it&#x27;s safe like any electric, can be fast heating like gas, is more efficient than standard electric, and the oven plates don&#x27;t burn you for more than a minute after taking off the hot pan or pot (since the vessel is heated, not the glass plate).<p>It&#x27;s seriously the best way to cook now, and it has gotten quite affordable.')
