When it ran on Windows, it tried to determine which version of Windows it ran on.  It broke on a new version of Windows, because Windows reported a version that the security tool didn&#x27;t know about.  So Microsoft &quot;fixed&quot; it.  They had a list of programs that, if the running program was on that list, Windows would lie and report itself as being the previous version.  (I think this was Windows 2003 reporting as Windows 2000.)<p>Unfortunately, that meant that we couldn&#x27;t fix it.  The right fix would be for us to update our code to know what Windows 2003 was, so that we could put Windows-2003-specific checks in.  But we couldn&#x27;t do that, because Windows would <i>never</i> report itself to us as Windows 2003!<p>I think we got around it by changing the name of the application before trying to determine the Windows version, and then changing it back...')
