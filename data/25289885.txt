The cost of student loans or lack of social safety net hardly warrants higher salaries. This is probably more related to the availability of the specialists (immigration rules, the local supply of devs coming from universities,etc).Very few companies even in the US can pay 200-300K salaries to devs,most don&#x27;t come anywhere near that.My main point is that European companies are less likely to reward employees,even though their contributions far exceed the costs. Similar trends are seen in other fields: recently, top tier law firms in London complained that the US companies with divisions in London can push graduate salaries to Â£100K. The same market,yet very different willingness to pay.')
