What I&#x27;d actually welcome these days is a web &quot;glue language&quot; which adheres to what PHP wanted to be in the beginning (easy HTML output, one file per page, easy database querying, easy CGI interfacing), but without any OOP bolted on (C-style procedural would be fine), without any of the horrible security decisions, and with strong typing.<p>It would make a nice counterpoint to all OOP-style web dev languages (Django, RoR, PHP8+framework + routing logic) and all frontend-focused frameworks (React, Vue). Super-simple, super old-fashioned, but rock-stable and easy to kickstart a small website or prototype, and great for teaching (nothing is easier than &quot;drop a index.lang&quot; file in this directory and you have a website).')
