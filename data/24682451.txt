The definition of a solution to a differential equation is quite straight-forward, and a value within the problem domain is not it, even if you use the solution to determine that value.<p>&gt; I want some numbers out of the equations that will match the real-life engineering problem.<p>If that&#x27;s what you want then what you want is not the solution to the differential equation. You seek something else, and in a scenario where you tolerate a significant margin of error.<p>Meanwhile, you can be taught to determine the exact solution.<p>&gt; Approximations&#x2F;estimates are fine as long as I know the limits of their applicability.<p>That&#x27;s not what Runge-Kutta gives you. You might get it with Galerkin methods, but not with numerical approximations.')
