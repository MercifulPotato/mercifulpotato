The truthiness of that statement seems in question as it&#x27;s now Jan 14 and Gab has pretty much already (struggled) to fill the vacuum left behind by Twitter and Parler.<p>Relevant part of the document:<p>&gt;Parler’s allegations of harm contradict its own public statements. Parler’s CEO has assured users that Parler “prepared for events like [the termination] by never relying on Amazon&#x27;s [sic] proprietary infrastructure,” that the site will be fully operational “with less then[sic] 12 hours of downtime” after termination, and that Parler has “many [companies] competing for [its] [hosting] business.”')
