I was extremely fortunate that both of my parents are industrial scientists (now retired), so I had good role models, and working in industry wasn&#x27;t a foreign idea for me.<p>I&#x27;ve been in industry for 25+ years, with no regrets. I&#x27;ve told people that there&#x27;s a good living to be made doing things that other people hate. In my case, I solve hard multidisciplinary problems, usually involving math and sometimes physics. Persuading people to hire me can be tricky, but persuading them to keep me is easy.')
