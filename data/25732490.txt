They are just banning trump supporters.<p>As republicans left those platforms, big tech also removed the new place Parler in a coordinated method. With shortage on servers, they aren&#x27;t going to be getting back up and running anytime soon.<p>At the end of the day this isn&#x27;t about censorship. Trump for all it matters could post to his own website. He&#x27;s not stopped from getting out his message.<p>The more important reality here is that big tech clearly played their cards. What used to be a political divide that was entirely democrats is now both.<p>If you thought the political divide in the USA was bad before the election. It&#x27;s now worse than ever. This is about silencing political opposition.<p>Oh and in the next 2 years you can expect the NRA will be disbanding. Right to bear arms will be getting shut down.<p>What do you think the republicans are going to do? I don&#x27;t know. Will it be civil war? I dont think so.<p>How about the election in 2 years? Anyone think there will be a free and fair election?')
