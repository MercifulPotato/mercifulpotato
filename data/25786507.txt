It is the news releases.  It is that Facebook is publishing about these cases on its website.  Facebook is always involved in litigation to protect its business.  It is that they are now highlighting these cases as if they are acts of &quot;stewardship&quot; or some defence of user privacy.<p>It is generally good that Facebook is taking these actions.^1  But the point I am making is that it is likely to be used as an argument by Facebook to try to hide the fact that Facebook created the problem in the first instance.  And they have historically  failed miserably as &quot;stewards&quot;.  And they are the much larger threat to user privacy than anyone they are suing.  Their interests are not aligned with users.  Facebook has reasons to keep others from obtaining user data that have nothing to do with user &quot;privacy&quot;, a concept Zuckerberg is in fact actively trying to destroy.<p>1 But I am wondering what Facebook would do if a user was &quot;scraping&quot; her own data and the data their friends have shared with her.  In other words, imagine the user writes her own &quot;bot&quot; to automate her Facebook usage and reduce the amount of behavioural data she gives to Facebook, i.e., the data she does not get if she &quot;downloads her data&quot; from Facebook.  Clearly this is not &quot;malware&quot;.  TOS would surely be interpreted by Facebook to not allow any sort of automation.  As anyone can see reading the public filings they make with courts and regulators, Facebook lawyers are heavy on the over-the-top rhetoric and arguments that border on the absurd.  The user is not the customer so no reason for them to hold back on going after users.')
