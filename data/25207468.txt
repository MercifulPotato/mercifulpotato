MacOS was already pretty efficient with RAM.<p>I&#x27;d like to propose tokamak-teapot&#x27;s formula for hardware purchase:<p>Minimum RAM believed to be required = actual amount of RAM required * 2<p>N.B. I am aware that a sum that&#x27;s greater than 16GB doesn&#x27;t magically become less than 16GB, but it is somewhat surprising how well MacOS performs when it feels like RAM should be tight, so I&#x27;d suggest borrowing a Mac or making a Hackintosh to experience this if you&#x27;re anxious about hitting the ceiling.')
