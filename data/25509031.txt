Phone companies make some sense because they have to serve certain geographic regions which can&#x27;t compete or collude with each other. Google serves the world, of which the US population is only 5%. Do you think the US government is going to split up Google such that &quot;South American Google&quot; is totally independent and brings back no revenue to the US? Same with &quot;European Google&quot;?<p>Or you you want it split up by US region? Maybe &quot;US-East Google&quot; gets to make money from Europe, &quot;US-West Google&quot; gets to make money from Asian countries, and &quot;US-Texas Google&quot; gets to make money from services provided to South America?<p>Is the goal to cripple Google so hard that companies like Baidu and Yandex can overtake the search market globally? Is that why the US congress should split up Google?<p>The only people who have a rational argument for <i>another</i> Google split up are governments of non-US regions that are financially invested in competing services.')
