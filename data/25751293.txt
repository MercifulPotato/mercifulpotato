They&#x27;re just a way to avoid copy-pasting code.<p>Having `Set&lt;Foo&gt;` and `Set&lt;Bar&gt;` is far more readable than `class FooSet` and `class BarSet`, where the code is exactly the same aside from a search-and-replace.<p>You also run into issues where someone finds a bug in `FooSet`, but doesn&#x27;t know `BarSet` exists, and forgets to patch both. Now, you have two <i>divergent</i> copy-paste classes.<p>Generics solve a bunch of real-world problems, in a very simple manner.')
