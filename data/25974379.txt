Nothing to be ashamed of.<p>&quot;life on the other side&quot; I refuse to treat others as less because of their skin color. You might be racist but I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m surrounded by successful people of all color (and sexs, religions, lifestyles, etc) who don&#x27;t cry victimhood.<p>You will continue to be either a victim or treating &quot;POC&quot; as victims who aren&#x27;t smart enough or good enough - IE treating people different based on their skin color. (IE: Liberals talk down to POC because they look down on them. You might want to check YOUR &quot;priviledge&quot; and how you treat others - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;nation&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;white-liberals-dumb-themselves-down-when-they-speak-black-people-new-study-contends&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;nation&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;30&#x2F;white-liber...</a>)<p>I refuse to treat minorities as if they aren&#x27;t good enough... society shows that is a lie and, as I was raised, treating people differently based on skin color is racism.<p>You may be okay being a racist... I refuse to be one.')
