It&#x27;s suggested because the author has a vested interest in 1Password.<p>As for why it&#x27;s better than the browser&#x27;s password manager... for an individual, it probably isn&#x27;t. For me, I will say that I like that 1Password allows my partner and me to share passwords to joint accounts, which iCloud Keychain can&#x27;t do without getting out of sync when a password changes. (iCloud Keychain also only works on Apple devices, of course.)')
