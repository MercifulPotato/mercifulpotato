And it&#x27;s typical of my experience as well, and I have a fair amount related to audio, though not as extensive as yours.<p>My mind works differently when it comes to language and the scope of possible meanings is something I always consider relevant.<p>What concerned me here was someone taking the colloquial definition of &quot;ultrasound&quot; literally, and making assumptions that are not valid in this context at all.<p>What the word actually conveys is both a matter of subtlety and frequency.<p>Turns out, having read the entire discussion, both are relevant in terms of threat assessment, and thinking about what is said more deeply can have a positive impact on a discussion of this nature.<p>All of which is why I chose to point out what &quot;ultrasound&quot; actually does mean linguistically.<p>Edit:  In my experience, such uses can and do happen.  I personally allow for it and use context to parse.  Where there is ambiguity, I generally won&#x27;t dismiss it out of hand.<p>Subsonic comes to mind here.  As does the question why the word did not appear regarding these watermarks.<p>The answer may just be someone with far less domain expertise attempting to communicate.')
