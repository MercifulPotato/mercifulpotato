The leaks seem mostly from large, upstanding companies that have had data breaches (Adobe, Myspace, ...), rather than from deliberate email address sales. It&#x27;s still very handy to be able to just disable an email address... can&#x27;t do that if you&#x27;ve used the same registration email on 1000 sites.')
