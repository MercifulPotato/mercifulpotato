I would make the argument that you aren&#x27;t proficient in any of these areas, so to advertise yourself as such is misleading. I file my own taxes, but I don&#x27;t refer to myself as an accountant.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to meet a bootcamp grad that can efficiently architect a relational database, for example. I know plenty of Sr. level front-end developers who wouldn&#x27;t think to call themselves full-stack even though they know how to submit a user form that persists to the database. Same with back-end developers who know HTML, CSS, and pick your flavor of JS framework.<p>If you&#x27;ve worked in the industry, you know things change too fast to stay up to speed on everything. It&#x27;s not impossible, but it&#x27;s unlikely and unrealistic to have that expectation of someone once they are employed.')
