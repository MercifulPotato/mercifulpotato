Because some do.<p>I get royalties on stuff I&#x27;ve personally written. Some of it is in technical books, and I&#x27;ve not checked, but I bet sci-hub even copies such stuff.<p>So care again to claim sci hub is not affecting any authors?<p>Finally, if an author wants his&#x2F;her papers spread, it&#x27;s easy to do. If an author only want their work in a certain journal, then the author can do that. Sci hub removes any author wish from the equation without author permission.<p>For example, there is no way for me to remove papers I wrote that sci hub has copied onto their servers (see above for an example link).')
