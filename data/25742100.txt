I think I can attribute to Imre Lakatos the thought that if you can completely discredit the experts, and make it impossible to decide on facts, then you create a power vacuum that can only be filled by those who are capable of acting in the absence of facts, such as thugs and tyrants. You have effectively censored the experts with greater efficiency than any government censorship program could ever dream of. I believe this is the precise reason for &quot;the war on the truth.&quot;')
