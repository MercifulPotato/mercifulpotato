And thanks for flagging that we cover in our FAQs. I&#x27;ll also say that we experimented with video as an option before launching publicly and it&#x27;s something we have thought a lot about. For the future. From our FAQs...<p>&quot;...there are two reasons we are not using video as an interview medium today.<p>First, video chat creates technical challenges when an Internet connection is spotty. This creates both sound quality and consistency issues, both of which are detrimental.<p>Second, we receive consistent feedback from customers that the idea of sitting for an “on camera” interview, while intriguing on first consideration, becomes both intimidating and unnatural as guests get closer to the interview. We’ve taken that feedback to heart. Our North Star at Artifact is:<p>Every interview guest comfortable.<p>Everything we do is focused on driving at this North Star. The reason is that we find that the more comfortable customers are when they sit for interviews, the better they express themselves. The better they express themselves, the better the product we can provide to you. It’s that simple.&quot;')
