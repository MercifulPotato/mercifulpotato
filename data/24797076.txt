I found opening my mouth and making a tone worked much better.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how many people think of hum the same way.  I&#x27;ve noticed lately some words being used slightly differently than I am used to (the one coming to mind right now is &quot;giggle&quot; in a story that in context I would interpret as meaning &quot;chuckle&quot;), and at this point it&#x27;s happening enough that I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a shift in perception of these words or if I just always interpreted them more narrowly than they were intended.')
