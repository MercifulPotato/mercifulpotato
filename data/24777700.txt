The entire political landscape has grown to this mess because of &quot;Click Bait&quot; style ad metrics.<p>Every single news outlet, media outlet and otherwise has been corrupted and perverted to seek instant gratification and has lowered their editorial bar so low that they&#x27;ll say, show, do anything that gets more attention. Because attention brings them more ad $.<p>Without the money flowing from ads via these false metrics, none of these media outlets could exist let alone thrive. And they, are the reason America is so divided. Sensationalism is what is driving the discourse, not intelligence or reason. The power brokers know this and the leverage it very, very well.<p>We have created a US where information is the ball, and our lives and the policy that governs us, is the sport.')
