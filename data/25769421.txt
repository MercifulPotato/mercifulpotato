Financial value is really just a function of supply and demand. Food and clean water may be a lot more important than megayachts, but they&#x27;re also also far more abundant than megayachts.<p>It happens that maximizing financial value also does a good job of improving people&#x27;s lives, so we treat as truth. Right now, we&#x27;re starting to see this fall apart as certain valuations stop making sense and certain negative externalities start coming to light. That said, I still think in general, valuations tend to be more right than they are wrong.')
