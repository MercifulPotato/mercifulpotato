Item(by='lostcolony', descendants=None, kids=[25211706], score=None, time=1606318031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209617, text='&quot;The top 1% in US pay more taxes in taxes than the bottom 90%&quot;<p>And yet the percentage is lower. It really doesn&#x27;t matter the comparative amounts; to put this to an even more egregious extreme, if the top 1% had 99% of the wealth, and paid 20% of that in taxes, and the bottom 99% had the remaining 1% of the wealth, and paid 0 taxes, it&#x27;s not a sign that all is well, and the fact that the rich are paying -all- the taxes does not somehow make it okay.<p>And, no, pretty much every business benefits. The whole &quot;keeping up with the joneses&quot; mindset that keeps the wheels of consumerism turning is predicated on class distinctions. Our economy is dependent on consumer spending, and the obscenely rich become rich, and remain so, because of that level of spending by the middle and lower classes (meanwhile they have so much wealth they can&#x27;t find ways to spend it without literally giving it away)')
