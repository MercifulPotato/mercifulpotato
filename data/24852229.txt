Amtrak and Acela do not actually own the railway they use and they can only go a certain speed due to the grade of the track.<p>I don&#x27;t think you would be willing to pay the amount of taxes you would need to, to completely redo the railways haha.<p>Anyways Amtrak are barely turning a profit as it is and while it would be great to have Euro quality train lines, the economics aren&#x27;t there. Even in Europe they&#x27;re having a hard time competing with flixbus.')
