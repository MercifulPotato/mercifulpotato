As an example:<p>save in Vim:<p><pre><code>  [esc] : w enter</code></pre>\n3 or 4 keystrokes involving two hands.<p>save in emacs:<p><pre><code>  C-x-s</code></pre>\none 3 fingered chord with the left hand.<p>And then I missed all the depth provided by emacs modes, perforce integration, org mode etc etc.')
