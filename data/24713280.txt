Item(by='cmrdporcupine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602108085, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24702838, text='I think you&#x27;ll find the &quot;low&quot; wages in software here are lowish in comparison to wages in the Bay Area but are comparable to other professional salaries.<p>But also, the cost of living in the GTA has gotten completely out of control so that&#x27;s part of it.<p>My wife and I bought a house in a &quot;bad&quot; neighbourhood of Toronto back in 2005. It was $280,000 CAD and that was the cheapest we could find in the GTA for a 3 bedroom detached home still on decent public transit.<p>At the time both of us were both employed in tech, and we still had to struggle a bit to scrape together a down payment. We didn&#x27;t perceive $280,000 as a trivial or cheap amount. And even back then we wondered how families that didn&#x27;t have our (pretty decent) income level could possibly be buying homes.<p>That same home would be now be worth over a million. I just can&#x27;t grasp how that&#x27;s conceivable at all. I make really good money as a Google employee, but I&#x27;d still find it frustrating to scrape together money for that. I don&#x27;t understand how my kids will ever own a home.<p>So I think it&#x27;s less that people are under-compensated in our industry as much as costs of living have just become stupid due to housing price inflation.<p>EDIT: wife went to go check the mailbox and it was stuffed full of real estate flyers only, including one from an agent who will give you a free lottery ticket if you come to his open house. I smell doom on the horizon, but I&#x27;ve been saying that for a decade, so don&#x27;t listen to me.')
