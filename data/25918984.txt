The interface takes several taps all over the display to accomplish basic tasks.<p>For example: Looking at a site and want to open your &quot;hacker news&quot; top site in a new tab?<p>1) Scroll up until you trigger the top bar reveal<p>2) Tap the boxed number button next to the address bar<p>3) Way at the bottom of the display, tap (+) to open a new tab<p>4) At this point the keyboard appears with the address bar focused.  I don&#x27;t want that, so tap in the tab home screen background where Top Sites can be seen<p>5) Tap on hacker news &quot;top site&quot;<p>That&#x27;s 5 gestures, each in a new area of the screen, just to open a web site.  Palm Pilot famously put nearly every common feature in the entire OS within 3 taps of the home screen.<p>I really hope Mozilla can do better than this!')
