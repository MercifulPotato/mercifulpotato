Wind, solar, and battery storage can provide the bulk of the 90 percent clean electricity. The report finds that new fossil fuel generators are not needed. Existing gas plants, used infrequently and combined with storage, hydropower, and nuclear power [my note: existing, not new, nuclear], are sufficient to meet demand during periods of extraordinarily low renewable energy generation or exceptionally high electricity demand. Power generation from natural gas plants would drop by 70 percent in 2035 compared to 2019.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s US centric; Australia is targeting 100 renewables by 2032, using only hydro, renewables, and storage. Let&#x27;s not say it can&#x27;t be done while it&#x27;s being done.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reneweconomy.com.au&#x2F;australia-could-be-100-renewables-by-2032-at-current-rate-of-wind-and-solar-installs-20759" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reneweconomy.com.au&#x2F;australia-could-be-100-renewable...</a>')
