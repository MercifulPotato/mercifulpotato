An 18-year-old delaying college by 1 year (for totally understandable reasons) does not equate to &quot;a life on hold.&quot; I can&#x27;t believe anyone would blame them for that choice, and in fact, it sounds like the ideal educational stage to be in during this time. You don&#x27;t have to stress yourself out with the horrors of virtual class. You can just take a break from school and wait for the world to get itself together before beginning the next stage of your journey.<p>I wonder if this person feels the same way about students who delay starting college to carry a pregnancy to term (or support a partner who is), or serve in the military? It seems like a very one-sided and rigid way to view personal development.')
