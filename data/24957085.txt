It&#x27;s basically a collection of DNA probes that each hybridize with a specific genetic variant.  According to a forum I read, they don&#x27;t have a probe for this specific CRY1 variant.  So if your friend doesn&#x27;t have the variant listed in their 23andMe tab-delimited list of variants, that doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t carry it.<p>You said you&#x27;re interested in writing a program to look for this in the raw tab-delimited data. It would be totally doable!   Just grep the tsv for the rs ID of interest. In this case it will be rs184039278.  If doing more exploratory stuff, you&#x27;ll probably want to connect variants with annotations.  SNPedia has a database of descriptions of what the variants do. Biostars is a decent, dedicated resource for help with stuff like this.<p>Hope it helps!')
