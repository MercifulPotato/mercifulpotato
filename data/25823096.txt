Yet, we feel that browsing through the scientific literature can sometimes be tedious and slow.<p>We hope our tool will help you solve this problem. Here are some technical details for the curious:<p>- The tool extracts a sentence embedding generated by a BERT-like model from the source publication’s title and abstract,<p>- It computes the distance between this embedding and those of other papers in our database,<p>- It selects the top 10 most similar papers, title and abstract-wise, and displays them in a graph view.<p>Please do not hesitate to use the tool and share it around you! Any feedback you may have is also very welcome, and I’m more than happy to answer your questions here :)\nBtw, we are interested in other Deep Learning work, so feel free to message me to discuss any project you might have (email in bio).')
