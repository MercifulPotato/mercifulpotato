The people I know who own Sonos products love them and already pay a premium for the product. How much can they honestly be making of this data?<p>We know from a few years back, that the experts in violating your privacy, Facebook, will make around $60 per year, for an American, somewhat less for Europeans and nothing from everyone else. I doubt that Sonos is able to make ANY meaningful profit from the data they collect, so why bother?<p>It&#x27;s the same with Samsung, how much does it cost to develop and maintain the infrastructure for collecting data, compared to how much money is to be made?')
