Many conservatives believe the state of many Indian reservations are due in part to the mismanaged “welfare state” policies of the BIA that hinder NA’s from improving their lives. Personally I don’t know enough about the situation to say. I was only a child the last time I lived on an Indian reservation and barely remember it.')
