I&#x27;m disturbed it never really occurred to me, probably because I am in part naive and take certain things for granted, like that I will never have a dispute with Google wherein they disable my account. But of course that is possible even at &quot;no fault&quot; on my part, and of course Google is judge&#x2F;jury&#x2F;executioner when it comes to their services.

For example, I just went to my Stack Overflow account and added my email address as a sign in method. But then of course I realized: my email address is Gmail. So what&#x27;s the difference? How are we supposed to put this into practice without running our own email? Email is just another form of third party auth.')
