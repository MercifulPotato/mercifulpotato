The `pijul git` command allows you to import Pijul repositories by replaying their history. It also works incrementally, meaning that if you already imported a repository, you&#x27;ll be able to continue new commits.<p>This uses a somewhat naive way of doing things, and can take a very long time on large repositories. One other way of doing it would be to add an &quot;initial change&quot; explicitly saying &quot;I&#x27;m coming from Git commit number #SHA1HASH&quot;.')
