The Raspberry Pi foundation can put some good money where other boards would rely mostly on enthusiasts. That&#x27;s the point: with the Raspberries you get their Raspbian&#x2F;RPiOS, while other boards manufacturers usually don&#x27;t offer comparable quality distros, therefore it is often much better to use a 3rd party community produced distros.\nSo, on par?
