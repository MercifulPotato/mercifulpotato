The problem (for them) was that Wintel kept shrinking the gap.  In 1981 they were selling stuff that PC&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t have for 10-15 years.  In 1991 they were selling stuff that PC&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t have for 5 years.  By 2001 they had been largely lapped on their core systems.<p>Had a company like SGI managed to survive their business model would have likely remained the same[1]: they might have looked like a boutique nVidia selling extreme high-end parallelism solutions (i.e. graphics, neural net hardware etc) that GPU makers wouldn&#x27;t yet be able to match with commodity hardware.  Probably some combination of extreme transistor count and boatloads of FPGA&#x2F;specialized silicon coupled with extreme power consumption and cooling.  They also would have been able to go after smaller verticals than nVidia can.  That was always their game: selling solutions that were relatively harder to produce because they had to be engineered and hadn&#x27;t been commoditized yet.  The problem is, those doing to the commoditizing can move faster than those doing the innovating.  When those doing the innovating die off, the technology doesn&#x27;t advance as quickly.<p>[1] I say this because all of these companies seemed to have a similar fault: they were never able to move down market so that they could scale up their volumes.  The same thing is slowly killing Intel right now.')
