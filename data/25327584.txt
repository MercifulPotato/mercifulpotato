The USA isn&#x27;t willing to invest in a branch of the FAA that can actually go through every aspect of the engineering of the 737-max in order to understand if it&#x27;s working effectively.<p>Even with the MAX disaster, aviation standards are significantly better than the 70s&#x2F;80s.<p>Boeing + Airbus have a very very very vested interest in making sure that aviation is safe, and appears very safe (which is why Airbus did NOT go on the attack on Boeing&#x27;s safety.  It would hurt the entire industry).<p>Building codes and fire safety are something that should damn well be simple &#x2F; codified enough that it&#x27;s inspectable by a reasonable person.<p>Boeing did lie about shit.  Middle management pushed some real bullshit with the max.')
