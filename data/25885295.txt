Though it&#x27;s true some miners erroneously believed arguments otherwise.<p>BCash, for example, some loopy &quot;large block&quot; clone of Bitcoin has only rarely had more than $1 in fees in blocks-- and not primarily because it has fewer transactions (though it does), but because there is no cause to pay more than negligible amounts when both capacity isn&#x27;t scarce and mining isn&#x27;t completely centralized.<p>The result is that the BitcoinUnlimited (one of the BCash clients) &quot;chief scientist&quot; proposes that security must be paid for by perpetual inflation... and they&#x27;ve been moving towards abandoning Bitcoin&#x27;s decentralized consensus-- e.g. bcash clients will no longer reorg so if there is a split deeper than a few blocks (caused by a network partition or a block race), their nodes will just split off into separate networks.  Quite a mess.')
