The pizza is pretty good, but I love their ease and extreme cheapness. They only have a few options, they are $5, $6, $7. You can just walk in and order it, they have vending machine-like dispensers. I&#x27;ve spontaneously driven by one before, decided to buy a pizza for myself.<p>No coupons, just &quot;I hand you $5 and you hand me a pizza.&quot;<p>For comparison, by me the equivalent dominoes pizza is $14.<p>Everyone else seems to be constantly trying to go upmarket. Not Little Caesars. They just make it as easy as possible to get the best pizza one can buy for $5, and that is amazing in its own way.')
