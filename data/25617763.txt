I use it to plan my cycling routes but I gave up on the navigation features. Creating a route from markers is a nightmare of complexity. Then there is the problem that with a bicycle I can ride on pretty much every surface and it&#x27;s impossible for the poor thing to guess an itinerary I would like. Not it&#x27;s fault.<p>What I do is discovering roads and paths with OsmAnd, checking them with the satellite view of Google Maps and sometimes also with Street View, then\nplacing markers in OsmAnd and following them when I&#x27;m on the new areas I still don&#x27;t know.<p>If OSM had satellite pictures I could do without Google Maps for that. I would still use it to check the opening hours of shops.')
