He talks about how TV is an awful medium that encourages even the most serious content to be treated as entertainment. I wonder what he would have to say about the media we consume today :)<p>My own view is there is some truth to what he says but overall he is too cynical. TV didn&#x27;t have the damage on our society that he expected. I suspect people who talk about the damage social media and cellphones are doing to us today are also too cynical. We are incredibly adaptive creatures and while initially struggle with new technology we eventually learn healthy ways to use it.')
