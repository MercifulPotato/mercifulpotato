They are giving moderate liberals a bad name.<p>Censoring the book at this point is going to cause a Streisand Effect.<p>The Tweets cannot be censored, and moderates have very little control over the narrative.<p>What should the narrative have been?<p>If the book is good, &quot;Author encourages you to form a strong relationship with your child so that strangers won&#x27;t tell them what to do. In this specific case it was something about gender.&quot;<p>If the book is bad, &quot;Author says some silly transphobic things, tries and fails to smear trans people. Rebuttal in the top comment.&quot;<p>But now that it&#x27;s censored....<p>&quot;Stealing things is okay because optics are not a real part of politics!&quot;<p>&quot;I will just do whatever I want, and in 1,000 years history will vindicate me and the moderates will finally stop voting Republican&quot;<p>&quot;The communist revolution is but Two Months away! Never vote in any election! Punch a moderate today!&quot;<p>And on the other end of the horseshoe:<p>&quot;The left wants to burn books!&quot;<p>&quot;Perhaps everyone left of center are the real Nazis!&quot;<p>&quot;When are they gonna start rounding up white people?!&quot;<p>&quot;Why do trans people drink the blood of Christian children?&quot;<p>Nothing but bad-faith arguments and strawmen. Somewhere, Scott Alexander is spinning in his office chair.<p>It&#x27;s gonna be a shitshow and the best I can hope for is a stop-loss mitigation. Please don&#x27;t shoot, I&#x27;m a centrist and I like private property rights. The only book I&#x27;ve ever burned was an old encyclopedia I found in a dumpster.')
