Their purpose is to serve their workers. Forcing all workers to behave the same way seems a poor interpretation of that duty.<p>Otherwise, sure it&#x27;s fine to have a position on an issue and communicate it to members. What is <i>not</i> fine is to imply to members that if they make their own choice then the union will never support them should they have a problem, even for an unrelated issue, essentially stripping them of union support. This is what I meant by bullying, and have myself witnessed.<p>But if you insist that a unified front, rather than supporting workers, is their purpose then we fundamentally disagree, and I&#x27;ll leave things by pointing out that the &quot;unified front&quot; can be to support worker choice &amp; flexibility.')
