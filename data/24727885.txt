Item(by='veddox', descendants=None, kids=[24728044], score=None, time=1602231346, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24724867, text='Oh, hey Vincent :D<p>I was thinking about mentioning that list, actually. Yes, there are libraries around for most common tasks. However, there are three things I&#x27;m not satisfied with:<p>1) I expect common tasks to be covered by the standard library. Third-party libraries are for specialised tasks.<p>2) There&#x27;s often three or four mediocre libraries for the a given task instead of one really good one. Of course there are some &quot;default libraries&quot; (alexandria, bordeaux-threads, etc.) but too often you basically need to pick one at random and hope for the best. Best example: GUI libraries.<p>3) Most libraries are side-projects by individual developers or only have small teams. Which means: poor documentation and (in some cases) frequent breaking changes or random interruptions in development. The lack of documentation is not quite as bad as it sounds, because the source code tends to be highly readable. But still, the lack of polish and especially stability is not exactly trust-inspiring.<p>The CL ANSI standard really needs an overhaul to significantly expand the number of inbuilt functions. The fact that my 1990 edition of CLtL2 still adequately describes any modern CL implementation is a testament to the thoroughness of its language design, but also to the lack of change and expansion in the 30 years since.<p>Alternately, the CL community should develop its own semi-official stdlib - like the R community did with the tidyverse. A single package that you can install via Quicklisp that pulls in a curated list of high-quality libraries, ready for use. The CL standard might not come &quot;batteries included&quot; any time soon, but a &quot;battery expansion pack&quot; would still be a major improvement over &quot;bring your own batteries&quot; ;-)')
