That&#x27;s good for the product.<p>The two way side of it is that employees must have the autonomy and time to fix the root causes of what&#x27;s paging them to reduce toil.<p>This is the root of &quot;you build it, you own it&quot;.  &quot;Own&quot; means having autonomy.<p>That kind of engineering work does come at the expense of feature delivery.  However, it&#x27;s also good for the product.<p>Regarding getting paid more for going on-call, from your description, the issue doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s a financial one.  If you received $X00 per week more, would that be an acceptable tradeoff for the constant anxiety of your phone paging you at any time or waking up at least once per night?<p>(source: am ex-PagerDuty and founded a company to help drive software ownership, so I&#x27;ve thought a lot about this)')
