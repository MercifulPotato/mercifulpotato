Was it and still is there need for it ? Yes absolutely,<p>however the efficiency of allocation is a challenge , some groups who needed it 70 years back don&#x27;t really need it anymore , however it is political suicide to even propose a reduction or a reallocation to reflect today&#x27;s problems.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean we should not do anything, however to ignore the misalignment of incentives inefficiency of allocation and stickyness of any action is not good either.')
