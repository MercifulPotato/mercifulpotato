The criticism is they stopped fighting once their issues were starting to be addressed.<p>The whole idea of reframing around class is to say &quot;I know you think race is the primary differentiator, but I really think it&#x27;s class&#x2F;money&#x2F;power&quot;.  That is a negation of BLM, whose purpose is to bring attention to black Americans&#x27; rate of being murdered by police.<p>Remember the response to &quot;All Lives Matter&quot;?  (Putting aside the bad faith actors), a number of people think police violence in general should be the #1 priority. The responses are often, &quot;yes, all lives matter - but right now we&#x27;re talking about black lives.&quot;  Remember the cancer-walk comparison?  If you show up to a breast cancer walk, trying to talk about prostate cancer, you&#x27;re being a jerk.  (The analogy here would be to show up to the breast cancer walk talking about how it&#x27;s not even about cancer - all diseases need more awareness.)<p>It&#x27;s very complicated.  Attention is a limited thing, and while it&#x27;d be great if we could care about BLM and poor whites and addicts and immigrants, that doesn&#x27;t seem to be how the public&#x27;s collection attention works.  Reframing the problem might be a better solution, but I don&#x27;t think progressives would be receptive towards the reframe.<p>Thanks for the thought provoking discussion.  I personally agree with your statement that it&#x27;s really about the &quot;shared fight against intergenerational poverty&quot;, but I&#x27;m not brave enough to try and lead the reframe because I think both sides would reject it.  I think this route would address many of the core issues that have led to the Trumpworld voters, who don&#x27;t care what the stance is as long as <i>someone</i> is fighting for them.')
