I have had terrible experiences in the past with neighbour cats. And if you don&#x27;t think cats are aggressive you clearly haven&#x27;t seen a caterwauling fight mess up the neighbourhood or scratch kids up badly.<p>Also, many people are allergic to cats. Some of them develop even serious health problems like anaphylaxis. Please restrict your cat <i>strictly</i> to your property.')
