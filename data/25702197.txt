Item(by='GiorgioG', descendants=None, kids=[25723018], score=None, time=1610212654, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25701164, text='&gt; FWIW, I own a hunting rifle here in Canada (.30&#x2F;06, Remmington 700) and I enjoy hunting very much.<p>It&#x27;s funny, I think hunting is pretty inhumane (though I understand the need to manage the population, etc.) I&#x27;m not an advocate for making it illegal, it&#x27;s just not for me. \nThat&#x27;s how I feel how guns should be looked at.  If you don&#x27;t want to own&#x2F;carry a gun, that&#x27;s your business - but don&#x27;t try to stop me from doing so based on your preferences&#x2F;opinions. Do guns wind up getting used to hurt people illegally - certainly.  So do a lot of other things (alcohol, knives, vehicles, etc.)  We don&#x27;t ban them, we simply regulate them.  We already have plenty of gun laws, and most people (99.999%) are law-abiding citizens.')
