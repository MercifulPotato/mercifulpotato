It&#x27;s similar to how there were numerous failed digital currency attempts before Bitcoin figured out all the mechanics necessary for success. Some of these mechanics are:<p>- There is no centralized party that owns Handshake. This allows for any party to step in and contribute to the protocol. We&#x27;ve already seen this play out in building Namebase (I&#x27;m the CEO) as numerous unrelated parties have come together to further Handshake adoption<p>- It&#x27;s not just about opening up the TLD namespace. Handshake&#x27;s main technical goal is to improve the security and censorship-resistance of DNS by shifting the root of trust from CAs to a distributed ledger. My article on the technical improvements Handshake can provide was previously discussed on HN [1]<p>- TLDs aren&#x27;t sold for a set price. There&#x27;s a vickrey auction which awards the TLD to the highest bidder. This creates a better distribution of names than selling at a set price or to the first buyer<p>- The Handshake coin (HNS) provides an incentive for miners to provide security to the network and for holders to support ongoing adoption of the protocol, similar to how Bitcoin holders have put in massive efforts to evangelize it (I recognize that on HN people may find the Bitcoin evangelists annoying but I believe Bitcoin wouldn&#x27;t be where it is today without them)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20995969" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20995969</a>')
