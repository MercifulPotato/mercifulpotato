Autonomy must be a strong driver.<p>However, once bootstrapped and operating, that can seem like a distant dream if the business requires more staff, with admin and management becoming &#x27;a thing&#x27;.\nLater, looking to sell the business can mean a whole load more work but if all the stars align well, can give a large return. Or not.')
