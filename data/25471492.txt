I wonder if there’s a way to quickly spool up a secure auction system. I’d be curious to know how much could be raised if 1% of the supply was reserved for that.<p>Still distributing the proceeds of the auction would have the same problem.<p>GPS trackers on tamper proof containers with computerized  scales? With some sort of self destruct system? Perhaps 24&#x2F;7 monitoring from a command centre? Or just post armed guards 24&#x2F;7 at each distribution point.
