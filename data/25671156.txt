Just generating sparse matrices, and adding elements to interact (add&#x2F;subtract) from these matrices would be a great start! Any way to do this in a compiled language ?<p>2) Are there any libraries out there that help you simulate traffic in an existing network of roads, extracted from OpenStreetMaps perhaps?')
