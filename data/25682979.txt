It&#x27;s so easy to get started in python and you can get pretty far without knowing the best ways to do things, so I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s things like this for newbies.<p>Maybe in the future, the statistics portion could be expanded. While I&#x27;m grateful for all this information, it is rather odd to leave out Bayesian stuff.<p>As an aside, HN comments with nothing to say except CSS comments is so shameful. Imagine collecting all this information and giving away this catalogue for free and having someone nitpick some silly sidebar zoom functionality. It&#x27;s honestly despicable how often it happens. I hope the author knows how much this resource helps people out.')
