Did they know that they were going to take psychedelics? That may explain the anxiety. The confusion alone may have induced the anxiety. I am not sure, I did not have that[1], but confusion could be low to severe. Low would be equal to a head scratch, nothing much to make out of it, where severe would be delirium. I highly doubt LSD causes delirium. For one, it is not a deliriant, nor it is an anticholinergic agent. Was the anxiety and the confusion present prior to consumption?<p>[1] I can imagine someone being confused on psychedelics though, especially if it is their first time, but I doubt it would be much of an issue, and could possibly be reduced by reading more about the effects to know what they should expect and so forth prior to consumption.')
