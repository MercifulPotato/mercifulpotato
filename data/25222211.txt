In accordance with specs, they aren&#x27;t very weird at all, they just support a few less than others. But in terms of quirks in rendering, they are arguable ahead of FF.<p>IE11 was known for way behind in every aspect, that&#x27;s not the case for Safari. It&#x27;s maybe a little behind in specs, but way  ahead in other areas. Here&#x27;s an arbitrary list of things it supports that Chrome doesn&#x27;t:<p>- better css filter() support, blur support<p>- font-variant-alternatives<p>- various font values: ui-rounded, ui-serif, etc<p>- improved selector list CSS<p>- Audio Tracks, Video Tracks, Web Share<p>- HTTP&#x2F;3 live in big sur<p>- better position: sticky &#x2F; display: contents<p>- Better web animations api support<p>And again, it literally feels about 2-3x faster than Chrome, battery lasts significantly longer, UI responsiveness is way ahead.<p>Safari <i>feels</i> far better than any other browser, supports a number of important features others don&#x27;t, and what it does support it renders as nearly as consistently as others.<p>I fully agree it&#x27;s dragged it&#x27;s feet on a few features, but that&#x27;s also partially in relation to Chrome tossing in the kitchen sink.')
