This is what a margin account <i>is</i>.  If you do not have your required maintenance margin (and that may be a complicated calculation), the broker can and will sell things for you to protect themselves.<p>This is, frankly, common sense.  If you deposit $100, buy $300 of stock, and that stock falls below $200, your account&#x27;s equity will go below zero and your broker is in trouble.  If this happens on a large enough scale, the market will be in trouble.  The broker will try to protect itself by liquidating your position before this happens, and they may even be required to by market rules.<p>(The actual calculation of required margin is quite complex for good reason.)')
