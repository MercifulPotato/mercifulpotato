Sadly the article was mostly fluff and just mentioned a possible &quot;manufacturing issue&quot;. I have been unable to find further details on this blurb. IF you are reading this and can link us more info on what &quot;manufacturing issue&quot; is being talked about that would be awesome. I really hope we replace this dish with something else that can do radar astronomy.')
