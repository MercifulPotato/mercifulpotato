Love it.It’s really good for SW development especially for experimenting and exploring languages. For work I still use windows but as soon as work is over i reboot into linux.<p>But Im no tipical user, I don’t play games and don’t consume a lot of modern media or crazy new hardware, but do watch some youtube, listen to podcasts and read a lot and linux offers more than what I need. Linux got to a point that installing it is way frictionless. I had some attempts to install linux 15 and then maybe 10 years ago and gave up quickly. Nowadays not only that it runs live off a usb stick, it also installs easily on an existing windows system with a choice of partition of any convenient size.<p>Also playing with python, racket, chicken scheme plays a whole lot nicer under Linux. I am really thrilled to be on Linux.')
