You had to act like you trusted the state to avoid the repressive force of the state.<p>But people did not trust the state at all, much more so than in today&#x27;s world. Everyone assumed their telephones were listened to. Everyone assumed that the walls had ears. The lies of the state were often obvious, and often discussed with very close friends and close family, and anything that wasn&#x27;t an obvious lie was thus considered a likely lie anyway.')
