And if I&#x27;m a serious business that can easily afford the &gt; 10x premium and engineering to configure the backup I probably wouldn&#x27;t want to entrust it to some company with what looks to be a bus factor of one and the apparent technical limitation that a restore might cost me a few DAYS of unanticipated downtime [1].<p>I mean, sure, if you are some unix nerd wanting to backup your dotfiles and a few small documents (or repos) for maybe around ~$50&#x2F;year, why not go with some artisanal backup service for HN street cred (and a laudable open source donation policy)? But what other good use cases are there?<p>Am I missing something obvious?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25621093" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25621093</a>')
