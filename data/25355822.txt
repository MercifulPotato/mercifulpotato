The author keeps telling something is &quot;a wrong question&quot;, but I feel that he is tackling a wrong problem. The problems shown here are rather syntactic&#x2F;superficial - it&#x27;s mostly a matter of language&#x2F;tool proficiency. The real problem I commonly see among students is to systematically verbalize a thought that you&#x27;re initially unaware of - e.g. take the binary search for example. The idea can be easily understood, but realizing that a range can be expressed with two numbers (high &amp; low) is hard. Another example is to enumerate all permutations of given items. It&#x27;s easy to imagine what are the expected result for a certain input, but it&#x27;s not easy to describe the systematic process - it&#x27;d require some mental leap. These are what many people are struggling with, and something we still don&#x27;t know how to teach.')
