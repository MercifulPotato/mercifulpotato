Afterwards, it continues with post-docs. It&#x27;s all about names and prestige from here on.<p>I saw enough of it to make me question ethics and morality in that space which is more akin to investment banking than the sort of ideal young students are led to believe in.<p>It&#x27;s not all for the lofty goal of broadening knowledge. That&#x27;s merely a side effect. It&#x27;s really about grants and impact scores because that&#x27;s how scientists make a living.<p>E.g. the mental gymnastics I have seen to make data fit enough for that Cell publication are possible because the enormous complexities of microbiology allow for it and these possibilities <i>are actively exploited</i> because that&#x27;s how you make money and talent flow. Otherwise, impact scores would also benefit from science that finds out how thing&#x27;s <i>don&#x27;t</i> work. That&#x27;s important knowledge too - but none that collects grants.<p>Science really isn&#x27;t a more ethical field than any given industry and one shouldn&#x27;t build their career on such idealisms.')
