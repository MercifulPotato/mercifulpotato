This right here is the perfect expression for why I love remote work. You play your part and make a difference, then the rest of your time can be enjoyed elsewhere. No “the next 8 hours are dedicated to being at the office, maybe I’ll get some work done and chat with my co workers and go to meetings...”. Remote work seems to condense all the dead space in between, by allowing you to fill it with other non-work parts of life.')
