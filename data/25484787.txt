Like dancing about architecture or movie adaptations of video games, there’s no way to use written text to convey the essential qualities of an image. Yes, you can get various historical perspectives on why it has come to be so reveled, or accounts of what people take away from it, but none of that can give you a better impression of what’s so good about the image than the image itself.')
