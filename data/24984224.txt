I have to improve the feature section.<p>As I just launched the MVP, I don&#x27;t offer yet some of the more advanced features, but I will focus on them for the coming months.<p>Here are some ideas I&#x27;ve been bouncing around with some customers:<p>- Filter by any dimension on the dashboards.<p>- More performance metrics (like time to first paint and Apdex scores).<p>- Automated insights and anomaly detection (i.e. &quot;XYZ page has a higher bounce rate than normal this week&quot; or &quot;Visitors coming from Y spend 50% more time on your website.&quot;).<p>As it&#x27;s an early stage product, I&#x27;m still pivoting the direction constantly to find my niche.')
