It has next to no architectural cost - all it does is specify a constant set of rounding and overflow flags instead of using the current fpu state. The only real win is a code size reduction.<p>JavaScriptCore didnâ€™t even use it when it was first made available because that operation is relatively uncommon and the cost is dominated by the fpu logic that precedes rounding - so it essentially does not matter for real world js. It <i>may</i> be possible to make a micro benchmark that it helps, though I doubt it.')
