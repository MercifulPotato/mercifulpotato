Orange Tsai is indeed quite talented at both competitions and research (but it would prove as little as my own anecdotes).<p>If I&#x27;m biased, it might be because I defined the &quot;cybersecurity industry&quot; too broadly, not too narrowly: One can acquire certain skills from competing in CTFs&#x2F;competitions, e.g. hard skills related to reverse engineering and vulnerability research...  but I believe <i>in most cases</i> further skills are additionally needed to succeed in the industry, e.g. software engineering, and softer skills such as communication, planning and negotiation (useful for other jobs as well).<p>Overly optimizing skills to win CTFs while neglecting other matters can be harmful, like badly assigned character points in an RPG. :-)')
