Personally, I espouse the &quot;copyright should not exist at all&quot; viewpoint. However, I think in the current legal framework, APIs are clearly copyrightable. However, re-implementing the APIs should obviously be allowed under fair use.<p>Remember that copyright exists <i></i><i>solely</i><i></i> for the purposes of increasing the production of otherwise-easily-copyable works that take time to create but then are &quot;worthless&quot; (i.e. the marginal cost of each additional copy is ~0 or negligible).<p>From the Constitution itself:<p>&quot;[the United States Congress shall have power] To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.&quot;<p>I can see how one can argue that software itself - the actual code - will benefit in the same way (though the myriad successful open source projects and SaaS platforms seem to suggest it&#x27;s not necessary......). However, I think it&#x27;s pretty dang clear that limiting the copying of APIs will broadly lead to <i>less</i> software being created. It&#x27;s well established that, for software, ideas are cheap, and that competitive advantages primarily come from excellent execution and excellent VC funding. If someone re-implements your API and your business folds, it&#x27;s not because your API was your secret sauce and they stole it. It&#x27;s because their re-implementation - which, by definition of an API, must be &quot;the exact same thing&quot; - was better than yours. They produced a better product, and the market rewarded them for that.<p>So, for a legal framework whose purpose, as outlined in the constitution, is to promote the arts and sciences, I think it&#x27;s pretty clear what the path forward is.')
