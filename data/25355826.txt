I know they&#x27;ve made a lot of acquisitions over the years, but I don&#x27;t recall any widely-circulated stories of &quot;Salesforce takes beloved thing and destroys it&quot;. The major open-source-friendly company I know of that Salesforce bought was Heroku, and a lot of people seem to use Heroku without even knowing that they <i>are</i> owned by Salesforce (and have been since 2010). It seems like it&#x27;s too early to say anything definitive about what their purchase of Slack is going to change, although Slack has been making itself quite enterprise-focused all on its own.')
