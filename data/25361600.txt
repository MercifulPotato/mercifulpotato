Unions can become corrupt or politically influenced too. In fact, organized labor is one of the main money makers for organized crime. I&#x27;m not saying all unions are bad, just that some can be. Just as any power structure like governments or company management can be too.<p>I wonder if the major unions have banned together to get that bill introduced and voted on? It could be possible that they wouldn&#x27;t support legislation like that because more legislative protections can make the union seem less useful.<p>If the unions don&#x27;t have incentive to push the bill and more workers are covered by unions and don&#x27;t see the benefit of the bill because they are already protected, then could that delay or even prevent the passage of those protections? It may end up as a long term fix that leaves non-uninonized groups and groups that seem unlikely to organize, like IT. Of course with widespread existing adoption, a counter point could be less opposition to it.')
