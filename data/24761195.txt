Item(by='xrd', descendants=None, kids=[24761207], score=None, time=1602550072, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24758772, text='I&#x27;ve read through a bunch of comments but don&#x27;t see anything to answer this question.<p>Is there a way to use one &quot;serverless&quot; framework in one place and then use another in another place?<p>For example, I love dokku. It is so easy to have the heroku like experience on the cheap.<p>But I wonder: what happens if I need to scale my application bigger than the dokku server it&#x27;s on right now? I really like the immediate prototyping possibilities of dokku but the long term plan seems less exact when I read their documentation.<p>So, is anyone else using dokku locally and Google Cloud Run globally? Or another combination?<p>This is why I dislike firebase (maybe this has changed). It&#x27;s incredibly powerful, magic. But, you have to go all in both locally and globally, and there were gaps that caused me a lot of pain.<p>The tendency would be to use a framework that gives you the best of both worlds, local&#x2F;dev plus production.<p>But, why couldn&#x27;t we use the best solution in one place and the other best solution in another.<p>Is that a naive question?')
