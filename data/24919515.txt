Weight&#x2F;volume doesn&#x27;t matter.  Charge speed isn&#x27;t a priority.  Discharge speed isn&#x27;t awfully important either.  Round trip efficiency and cycle life are even more important.  Temperature ranges aren&#x27;t as wide.<p>Overall, I think these differences will lead to separate production facilities and differing designs.')
