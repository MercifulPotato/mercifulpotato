For example, if a user wrote a method where one of the arguments did not implement ToPolarValue, they would get the following error:<p><pre><code>  fn blah(blah: Blah)\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait bound Method&lt;_, _&gt; is not satisfied\n</code></pre>\nAs opposed to something like this with variadic generics:<p><pre><code>  fn blah(blah: Blah)\n                ^^^^ the trait bound ToPolarValue is not satisfied</code></pre>')
