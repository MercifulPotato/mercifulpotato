One can be sympathetic toward the treatment of animals raised for food, and advocate for better treatment while still consuming animal products.<p>The funny thing is that your comparison is also just flat-out wrong: the technology in question is also in part a product of empathy!  Yes, there are efficiency and cost concerns around incubating eggs to maturity where the (male) chick will just be discarded, but there&#x27;s also a strong empathetic argument that terminating an egg shortly after fertilization is much more humane than killing male chicks after birth.')
