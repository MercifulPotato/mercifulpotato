Its fun speculation and poses interesting questions but there’s no need to interpret these formulas as scientific fact.<p>Its much more likely that our estimates are off or our calculations are incorrect than we can draw conclusions from these roundabout statistical inferences. Nothing I’ve read has convinced me otherwise. Its a great pop-sci discussion but I’m more interested in direct evidence rather than speculation for why no direct evidence exists.<p>Drake Equation fans please explain what makes these theories so compelling and I will be indebted to you.')
