Item(by='fabianhjr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604789453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25018724, text='&gt; illustrates, is what a poor set of choices we have had.<p>&gt; We need better candidates who generate real support and appeal other than just not being their opponent. Not sure how to get there.<p>This is in great part due to First Past The Post voting method[1] employed. The US isn&#x27;t interested in democracy if they can&#x27;t at least move from FPTP to something at least as good as Approval Voting. (Which is one of the simplest alternatives)<p>Some criterions FPTP does no meet from Wikipedia[1][2]:<p>1. Mutual Majority Criterion: if a majority (more than 50%) of voters top-rank some k candidates, then one of those k candidates must win.<p>2. Condorcet Winner Criterion: if a candidate would win a head-to-head competition against every other candidate, then that candidate must win the overall election.<p>3. Condorcet Loser Criterion: if a candidate would lose a head-to-head competition against every other candidate, then that candidate must not win the overall election.<p>4. Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives Criterion: the election outcome remains the same even if a candidate who cannot win decides to run.<p>5. Independence of Clones Alternatives Criterion: the election outcome remains the same even if an identical candidate who is equally-preferred decides to run.<p>6. No favorite betrayal: Can voters be sure that they do not need to rank any other candidate above their favorite in order to obtain a result they prefer?<p>At least consider how 2, 4, and 6 affect alternatives like Howie Hawkins, Bernie Sanders, or Gloria la Riva to name some examples. I find it hypocritical when US government officials criticize 1-party states when the US is a 2-party state and as if that was a big qualitative difference.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikiwand.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;First-past-the-post_voting#&#x2F;Effects" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikiwand.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;First-past-the-post_voting#&#x2F;Effe...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikiwand.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;Comparison_of_electoral_systems#&#x2F;Mathematical_criteria" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikiwand.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;Comparison_of_electoral_systems#...</a>')
