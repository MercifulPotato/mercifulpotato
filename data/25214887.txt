This was observed quite by accident and not part of an experiment at first. In fact the octopus waited for its human handlers to leave the room before going in for the kill; the incident was caught on camera.<p>* gently grasp the hand of a friendly human with their tentacles, and squirt water through their siphon at a disliked human<p>All spontaneously, without training or prompting.<p>That last bit is particularly interesting to me, because they are recognizable signs of affection and dislike. Octopuses show some semblance of an ability to bond with us, despite having <i>vastly different</i> brains from us.')
