Item(by='shakezula', descendants=None, kids=[25687610], score=None, time=1610127897, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25687227, text='They boiled down demographics and social issues to a bunch of &quot;categories&quot; but I&#x27;m not allowed to call them a &quot;type&quot;? That seems unfair.<p>They point out that in the last two months there&#x27;s been 2 different Capitols, one stormed by the right, one stormed by the left. On face value, that&#x27;s true, but they&#x27;re implicitly declaring them as equally bad. It just lacks the context or nuance of _why_ each of them happened.<p>One of them was a response to police brutality and extra-judicial killings of their community members, and the other was an attempt to overthrow a democratically elected President, or at least stall the process for it. You can be critical of the CHAZ (which I am) and still recognize that it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near the same as storming our nation&#x27;s Capitol with the intent of stalling and disrupting the election process for our President.<p>I&#x27;m probably what most would call a socialist, and I&#x27;m all for discussions about labor and wages and class consciousness, and that seems like what this author is, albeit in a hamfisted way, getting at, but they&#x27;re just coming across as a smug to me.')
