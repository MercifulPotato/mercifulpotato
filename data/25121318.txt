Item(by='tempytempy2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605601385, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25118850, text='dwohnitmok, I think you make a good point about Completeness missing out on the action in OP&#x27;s post, which is nevertheless a good post and better than popular treatments. In fact, I remember thinking in class, &quot;What, there is Completeness theorems as well as Incompleteness?&quot; This is due to a similar phenomenon as we see with quantum mechanics in popular writing, where mostly the sensational, which aren&#x27;t really sensational, is written.<p>In any case, my contribution here is something else: The most interesting part of the natural numbers object and its role in incomplete logical systems is to me the more humble notion of... unique prime factorisation.<p>If that had failed, so too would the Godel numbering system. I am not a number theorist, but this to me would be an interesting spin off from OP&#x27;s post. The divisibility lattice is a good starting point, but apart from such basic constructions, the actual proof of unique prime factorisation to me is more historic than informative, and steps such as Bezout&#x27;s Identity are just as &quot;mythical&quot; to me as Godel&#x27;s Incompleteness Theorem, if we are using bad word choices. Conversely, numbers are just permutations on prime generators, but crucially, usually we start with addition before we start with multiplication.')
