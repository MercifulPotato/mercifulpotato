How often does that hit you in normal code? It never bothered me in Lua, and certainly not in Julia. For me I just do a context switch. I know when I am in Julia I have to think about things like in my mathematics books. Just like  you index a matrix.<p>When I am in other languages like C&#x2F;C++ I tell myself that I working with memory addresses. For memory addresses 0-index makes more sense. For tables, matrices etc I honestly think 1-based indexing makes more sense.<p>Only time I dislike 1-based indexing in Julia is when I write code which is strongly related to how memory works. Like when I was implementing a CPU simulator and assembler.')
