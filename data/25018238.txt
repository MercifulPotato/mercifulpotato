A USPS employee was recently arrested for trying to take absentee ballots out of the country, another in PA said that he was told to back date ballots received after the election so they could still be counted, and they&#x27;ve also found ballots in the trash that were mostly for Trump. He&#x27;s exaggerating, but he&#x27;s not just making things up either.')
