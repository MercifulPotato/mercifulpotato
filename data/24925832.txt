(But you ca  end up in rebase hell if you do that). You also get a version history of all the different versions of your commit.<p>Ancedotally, during my use of gerrit, i never really wished to have multiple commits on a single changeset.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d prefer to merge as soon as something is accepted and use master at the main development branch<p>That&#x27;s what Wikimedia did, mostly. (There were weekly deployment branches but it was unusual to have something in master but reverted out of the deploy branch). It seemed to mostly work fine afaik (of course i wasnt on the team doing deploys, for all i know they might have horror stories)')
