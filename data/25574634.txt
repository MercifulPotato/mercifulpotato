It&#x27;s amazing.<p>It makes me a little sad more people are not aware of the ridiculously cool technical advancements going on lately. Many of my relatives and friends in my home country haven&#x27;t even heard about any of these. They&#x27;re not mentioned in the news or magazines whatsoever. Granted, they probably don&#x27;t have any use for this information for their daily lives... but I do believe learning about this keeps alive my sense of childlike wonder, and it&#x27;s sad to know others are missing out.')
