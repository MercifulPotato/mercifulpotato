Item(by='codetrotter', descendants=None, kids=[25341558], score=None, time=1607376779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25336185, text='I think time of day, novelty, luck, and whether any mods notice the post and decide to give it a second wind.<p>By novelty I mean something that is easily recognized as new and important. It doesn’t help that something is new if no one catches the point of reading about it. Could be a bad title or a bad article. Or bad luck.<p>In terms of good luck I mean a couple of specific things especially:<p>- If a few people see it that are excited about it, either from hearing about it the first time or from knowing it in the past, and these people write positive comments about it, then others who come across the post may be encouraged to check it out and to upvote it too.<p>- “Micro zeitgeist”. If it’s about a topic that recently hit the front page and it adds something new about that, it could luck out. Why luck in this case? Because you probably don’t know ahead of submitting that people will care to read even more about some topic even if it was popular the day before. Perhaps instead people are tired of the topic.<p>- The other things submitted the same day did not gain enough traction to push this thing away.<p>- Evergreen topics that have not gotten traction in a while but that people care about.<p>- Topics that people in university and college are currently learning about so it catches their attention. I dunno how big the amount of people currently in university is versus people that are in jobs. But I remember that I learned about HN from some other students in a student union I was in back then. And I don’t know how students HN reading habits are compared to people in jobs either. I remember reading HN a lot when at the university. But I still read HN a lot. These days I read HN in the morning, the evening and at night though, not when I am working. But even if you have a job you might read HN in the lunch break, or perhaps you have some downtime where you are waiting for something at work and you read HN for a while.<p>There are other possible factors too that I have thought about in the past but these are the ones I can think of right now.<p>Please note that all of what I am saying here is only my thoughts based on my own habits and from what I’ve heard other people say and what I’ve seen.')
