Both on Windows and Android. I&#x27;ve noticed that Firefox eats up far more memory than chrome with way lesser open tabs on both the platforms. I&#x27;ve had tabs die on me multiple times that I simply could not recover. At this point I am very conscious when I am using Firefox because I don&#x27;t want too many open tabs or leave them open for too long.<p>I&#x27;d love to use Firefox and ditch Chrome completely, but I don&#x27;t think its there yet.')
