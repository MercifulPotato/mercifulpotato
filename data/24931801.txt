I&#x27;ve been struggling with exactly what you mention - how to find out the &quot;correct&quot; way to apply patterns&#x2F;do relatively complex things, but all I get on search results are Medium articles written by bootcamp grads.<p>Can you recommend any sources of truth&#x2F;books that can guide down the right path? Of course I&#x27;ll be going through all the things you mention but I&#x27;m just curious if there&#x27;s somewhere I can get the right information besides just reading through Firefox code, for example.<p>Thanks!!!')
