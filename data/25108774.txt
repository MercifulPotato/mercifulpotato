The default state for JavaScript in my browser is off (has been for decades).  The prizes I get for turning it off are these:<p>•  Blindingly fast speeds.  My web pages usually render about three times as quickly as they do with JS on (you get spoiled by this and cannot turn back - it&#x27;s like a drug the difference in speed is so great).<p>•  Ads and other screen dross are yesterday&#x27;s business—even without ad blockers.<p>•  With JavaScript off, privacy comes almost by default.  Below, you&#x27;ll see the test results I&#x27;ve just obtained from EFF&#x27;s Panopticlick with JS off.  Wonderful results aren&#x27;t they.<p>•  This post was done without JavaScript.<p>•  The sites that I usually visit are either not heavy with or overloaded with JS scripts.  Moreover, the kind of sites I&#x27;m interested in contain the types of material that no one cares about if you switch JS off.<p>•  If sites don&#x27;t let me in or screw me around then I&#x27;m out of there as fast as I can hit the backspace key.  <i>(There&#x27;s more fish in the internet sea than I can ever visit in multiple lifetimes—so there&#x27;s no need for me to stick around.)</i><p>• If you must need to use JavaScript, then this fact alone is already violating your privacy to some extent.  I now know the types of sites you will most likely visit and also the kind of data that you&#x27;re likely to consume or use.  I  can also make assumptions about you without even going any further.<p>I won&#x27;t bother pushing the point further, as the cognoscenti who don&#x27;t use JS already know they&#x27;re ahead of the game.  They also know that trying to get JS fanboys to kick the JS habit makes converting Apple users away from Apple look like child&#x27;s play. <i>(Who cares? Just let them wallow around in their JS-ridden environment.  They&#x27;re not going to be useful allies in the war on privacy anyway, or they&#x27;d already be in a JS-free environment.)</i><p>EFF&#x27;s Panopticlick:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;panopticlick.eff.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;panopticlick.eff.org&#x2F;</a><p><pre><code>  Browser Characteristic value\n  User Agent                    Mozilla&#x2F;5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko&#x2F;20040413\n                                Debian&#x2F;1.6-5\n  HTTP_ACCEPT Headers           application&#x2F;xml,application&#x2F;xhtml+xml,text&#x2F;html;q=0.9,text&#x2F;plain;\n                                q=0.8,image&#x2F;png,*&#x2F;*;q=0.5 gzip, deflate, br en-US,en;q=0.5\n  Browser Plugin Details        no javascript\n  Time Zone Offset              no javascript\n  Time Zone                     no javascript\n  Screen Size and Color Depth   no javascript\n  System Fonts                  no javascript\n  Are Cookies Enabled?
