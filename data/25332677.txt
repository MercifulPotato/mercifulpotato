The original representation was &quot;-&quot; + &quot;=&quot; = &quot;â‰¡&quot; but someone got too lazy and rotate 1, wrote the two lines of 2 without lifting up the pen, and the three lines of 3 without lifting up the pen. I&#x27;m not an expert in number history, but these are some nice graphics of the evolution of the number system <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.archimedes-lab.org&#x2F;numeral.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.archimedes-lab.org&#x2F;numeral.html</a> and in particular the evolution of the representation of three <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kk.org&#x2F;cooltools&#x2F;the-universal-h&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kk.org&#x2F;cooltools&#x2F;the-universal-h&#x2F;</a> This alternative is a nice and ordered number system, but after a few centuries of use some will get lazy and change the shape to write them faster or to make them more different.<p>&gt; <i>And I&#x27;m annoyed there&#x27;s no way to represent it in standard Unicode!</i><p>Every few years there is a post about someone who added a few characters to Unicode. Take a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11958682" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11958682</a><p>&gt; <i>I haven&#x27;t looked into it enough. I suspect the simple pattern matching approach only works for some numbers. But even so, it gives an intermediate&#x2F;bootstrap step to learning (say) division that feels helpful for beginners.</i><p>The part of the video about sum and rest make sense, it is slightly easier, but there are many other representations for example with points. I&#x27;m a strong proponent of &quot;Use your fingers&quot;, but you must learn by heath the tables soon (but not too soon). In the video they didn&#x27;t explain too many operations with carry. This is possible with this notation, but it is not easier than with the current notation, and you must remember to use 5 for the bottom-to-top transition and 4 for the digit-to-digit transitions, so it may be a problem to remember.<p>The part of the video about division makes no sense. Division is just horrible in any representation. Try 76829&#x2F;5. (And I pick 5 because 5 is an easy case. If you think it is too easy try with 3 or 7.)')
