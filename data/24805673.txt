Still, you will never get it perfect and that is not the goal, the goal is to get it as good as possible (and we are not even there yet).<p>&gt; And because of the MIDI Tuning Standard, you cannot actually say a priori which notes (i.e frequency) a given note number corresponds to, although in practice most things will take the note number and map it to a a 12TET 440Hz standard.<p>This is true, but for a teaching application like this one it is simply not relevant.')
