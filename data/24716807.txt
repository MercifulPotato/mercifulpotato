The main one is that the browser loses its state at each page reload, and that the state on the server, if any, needs to be reconciled every time with that on the browser. It is fine only as long as your app doesn&#x27;t have any client state. The more state you put in your client (e.g. a text field with its contents) the harder it is to maintain the state across page reloads.<p>This is why now we design our applications with all the state in the frontend, closer to the user, and a stateless backend. SPAs are in fact enormously simpler than equivalent non-SPAs.')
