Of course there is a risk that you will lose your keys, so don&#x27;t and check your back-ups integrity and your ability to restore frequently so that when the time comes you will have it down to a routine.<p>The alternative is that one day you find that your precious backups have taken a stroll through the countryside and end up on pastebin or something worse depending on the contents. Backups are typically much less secure than the servers they are copies of, hence the good practice of encrypting them.<p>If your backups do not contain data that would embarrass you or someone else if it should get lost then you probably shouldn&#x27;t encrypt on the off chance that you will lose access to the keys. Lots of scientific data would fall under that description (but not all, for instance, studies could easily contain PII or sensitive info).')
