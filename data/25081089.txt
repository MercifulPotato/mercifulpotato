Item(by='grishka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605265344, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25080801, text='&gt; but the government preventing people from entering into contracts that you don&#x27;t like?<p>It&#x27;s not that. Plain and simple: in an ideal world, more money shouldn&#x27;t grant more power and immunity. Governments should disincentivize this growth into the sky by, for example, progressive taxation for companies. The world would be a better place if tech companies actually competed with each other by making better products, not trying their damnest to lock everyone into their walled gardens to earn even more money they have no clue what to do with. Currently, when choosing something like a computer or a phone, you just pick one that sucks the least. There&#x27;s no healthy competition.')
