The alternative is to build insulation and bumpers into the case that you can&#x27;t swap. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s better.<p>I tried to go caseless back when I was 22 and thought anyone would care how pretty my phone was, but it was slippery and accumulated damage for no reason. My next phone, I kept a case on it and when I sold it after a few years, it looked good as new.<p>I suppose something that&#x27;s going to live in a case has no real need to be so beautiful. But it&#x27;s also a luxury consumer good, so &quot;we cut some corners, so it&#x27;s ugly, but it&#x27;s in a case anyways amiright?&quot; isn&#x27;t really the best marketing message.
