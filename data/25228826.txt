The more you read the easier it will become to write a proper story. Lastly as you&#x27;re reading I&#x27;d suggest you start writing material yourself and maybe publishing it online on some web novel sites. At first people will be very critical of what you have written, but with time it should change for the better. Lastly, writing is a habit, just like coding. A habit should be repeated daily to become stronger. Read and write each day, unless you&#x27;re feeling foggy or in need of rest. After a certain amount of time it should just click, but realize that that amount of time varies from person to person, some may never break that threshold, others are talented and are able to break through just like that. Best of luck!')
