Granted knowing how to throw a punch or kick with decent technique helps, but what&#x27;s really important is having the attitude of being willing to inflict harm on another human being. And it sounds like that was what limited GP&#x27;s courses of action. Also of course GP could have been skipped grades or otherwise been much punier than the other students, in which case the amount of training one could get by that age would likely be irrelevant anyhow. In that case the correct strategy is to make friends. Middle school really is a remarkable distillation of human tribal behaviors.')
