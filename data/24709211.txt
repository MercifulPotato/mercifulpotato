Item(by='verst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602084431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24708867, text='GP is suggesting removing the 85k H-1Bs annual cap but keeping all other requirements in place (with or without new wage standards).\nEDIT: GP is also suggesting removal of the immediate deportation proceedings should someone lose their job in H-1B status. The status should follow the employee, not the employee&#x2F;employer pair.<p>This wouldn&#x27;t necessarily lead to a lot more immigration. It would lead to fewer people leaving who are already working for US companies on F-1 student visas in OPT status (they attended US institutions)')
