In reality that&#x27;s a minor point, what they really want is access to information without the knowledge of its owner. They&#x27;re OK with needing approval or getting a warrant to read your email just as long as it&#x27;s some 3rd party granting access so you won&#x27;t know. Otherwise just get a warrant for Alice and Bob&#x27;s email and compel them to decrypt it. No new laws or systems are actually required for that.')
