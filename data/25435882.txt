Item(by='sneak', descendants=None, kids=[25436172], score=None, time=1608070206, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25435162, text='&gt; <i>That&#x27;s not a true statement about HN.</i><p>I wrote &quot;HN is by and of a very specific part of wider society&quot;.  (I can see how &quot;by&quot; could be interpreted to mean the community, but I meant the authors&#x2F;operators.)  Are there any poor people who work on or for YC or HN?  Genuinely curious; I assume that YC&#x27;s staff and most everyone involved in maintaining and running both this site and YC in general is relatively prosperous, at least compared to the median in the US.<p>I&#x27;m sure that a website of this level of traffic receives all manner of visitors and participants, but I was specifically referring to the people who created and run it, and set the rules and general expectations of tone&#x2F;topic on it.  (I&#x27;m not calling you authoritarian, just &quot;of SV&quot; and not-poor.)<p>[edit: Also maybe I&#x27;m wrong and that the ratio of participants vs authors&#x2F;operators is so vast that the operators play no part in setting the tone beyond the rules (and of course your hard work), in which case my conclusion should be dismissed and the question about why it seems to skew authoritarian should be reopened.]')
