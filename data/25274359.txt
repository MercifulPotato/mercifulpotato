What is your suggestion to a lead developer of a big organisation? Let’s say to the CTO of Apple.<p>You can see at that level of abstraction the “make sure every one of your developers know how to write secure code in C and they never slip up” manifestly doesnt work.<p>You can fault individuals for bugs up to a certain point, but if we want to make secure systems we have to change how we are making them.
