It won&#x27;t be faster than filesystem unless you mount the DB directory to a RAM disk.<p>For my use case, speed was not the most important, instead it was using common tools on the DB, being human-readable, in JSON and git diff-able.<p>Also, I wanted small resource usage and small library size.')
