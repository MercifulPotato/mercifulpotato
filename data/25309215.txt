I&#x27;ve been finding more and more &quot;things everyone knows is true&quot; that turn out to be false lately, and they&#x27;re always things you&#x27;d never suspect.<p>I&#x27;d always assumed the idea of youngest siblings being the most extroverted, personable, bubbly etc. was supported by studies, it&#x27;s such an &quot;obvious&quot; fact. Very valuable to find out it&#x27;s yet another unfounded assumption!<p>Always useful to spread these things.')
