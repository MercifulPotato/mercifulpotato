It&#x27;s an extra 2 clicks and heavily obfuscated.</i><p>What are you talking about?<p>At least on iOS Safari, I can use the regular browser share button (1 click) and it shares the regular (non-AMP) URL.<p>AMP also provides a share button of its own in the upper-right hand corner (also 1 click) that brings up the identical iOS share sheet, again a non-AMP URL.<p>So sharing works perfectly at least on iOS. Zero obfuscation, zero extra clicks. Is it different on Android or something?')
