Depending on the day and weather, even my small airport is quite loud and annoying. My neighbor&#x27;s motorcycle is also louder than the planes, except the occasional military jet, but that noise is far less frequent than the planes. I think drone delivery will mean everyone in cities and suburbs will feel like they live near a small airport on a clear day. I too am not looking forward to the flying drone future. I think we should be working on reducing noise as much as possible, not create more in the name of slightly more convenient consumerism.')
