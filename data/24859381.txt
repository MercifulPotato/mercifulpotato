I&#x27;m curious why there&#x27;s any hesitation to ask? It seems there could be missing information because the questions posed aren&#x27;t tied to the relative harm an issue could pose.<p>IE, a user might complain that right-to-left editing is broken in some frustrating matter, but without some weighting related to demographics (or other) that complaint might get lost in the noise.<p>The outcome might be that a lesser-frustrating issue may receive more development time because it simply received more complaints.<p>IE, instead of fixing right-to-left editing and so broaden the potential audience the developer hours might be spent on spelling errors or integrating a melpa package into core.<p>This is not to say there exists a right-to-left bug! I am simply using it as a hypothetical example.')
