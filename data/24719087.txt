Item(by='mpweiher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602165126, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24717520, text='&gt; can ever have personal airplanes be as affordable and accessible as cars.<p>Sibling comment already addressed that Boom isn&#x27;t &quot;personal airplanes&quot;.<p>However:  why not?<p>I mean, apart from the current fact that not enough people <i>want</i> this.<p>Let&#x27;s look at a Cessna.  It masses around 800kg empty, so lighter than many modern cars, and that&#x27;s not due to exotic, expensive materials, and without that, cost tends to be roughly proportional to weight.<p>The engine is a four cylinder with 180hp.  My car gets 200hp out of 2l with a turbocharger, but aviation tends to use very old-school engine tech for reliability, so it&#x27;s got huge displacement, almost 6 liters.  So there&#x27;s some room for improvement there, particularly once we go electric, because electric motors are so much more reliable.<p>Fully electric is already viable for flight-training and other short-range needs, and unbeatably cheap for those missions.  (A friend and I had this idea of getting a used Antonov An 2 and stuffing it with electric bus batteries for a south-&#x2F;west- to east-bay commute...  The numbers worked quite well).<p>Hybrid electric could mean getting to use much smaller, cheaper, common, efficient engines and use the electric engine and some batteries for safety.<p>Avionics?  Yup, somewhat complex and expensive, but really not for too many intrinsic reasons.  The gold standard for GA today is (still?) the Garmin 1000.  An iPad has most of the same sensors (as does my Apple Watch), and the compute power is nothing to write home about.')
