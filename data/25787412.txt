Item(by='exclusiv', descendants=None, kids=[25787455], score=None, time=1610689210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783488, text='&gt; So people in committed relationships, homosexuals and people above the age where pregnancy is possible?<p>I wasn&#x27;t speaking in an absolute, because almost nothing is absolute.<p>I probably should have said &quot;I also have a theory that those that don&#x27;t wear condoms or use protection <i>are significantly less likely to</i> wear masks over the general public. And that a large percentage of the more religious are less likely to wear masks.&quot;<p>Since you went there, I&#x27;ll try to be more concrete.<p>Committed relationships across any sub-group you&#x27;d like to slice = no. Homosexuals that aren&#x27;t in committed relationships = yes as they would be in the general non-committed bucket. No risk of pregnancy of course but obviously STD. Above the age of pregnancy? If not committed relationship = yes. Again, still risk of STDs, in fact quite high for the age group most younger people don&#x27;t want to think of as having sex.<p>Above the age of pregnancy would have the kicker bonus of less likely to care due to being older and cynical. Once you&#x27;ve seen a lot of crazy things maybe this doesn&#x27;t phase you? Can&#x27;t tell you how many that have been fortunate to escape cancers or other more challenging problems only to go carefree on coronavirus which they have more control over. It&#x27;s an odd thing. Especially because those are higher risk and the ones that still have parents alive are in the highest risk category.<p>&gt; at least one of them is certainly not letting religion inform their sexual habits.<p>The condoms and religion in my theory need not crossover. Although I would guess the center of that Venn diagram would skew even less likely to wear a mask.')
