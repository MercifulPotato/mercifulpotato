If you mostly listened to one band, but then also to another band just once, should it be 50:50? If not, then you&#x27;re somehow going by number of plays.</i><p>Going by ratio of plays of bands <i>I</i> listened to makes total sense.<p>That being difficult, even a 50:50 between my 100 streams band and one I listed for 1 stream is still better that sending those money to third bands...')
