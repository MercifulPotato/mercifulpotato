So in the case of GraphQL, you get reference documentation that shows you exactly how it can be used. But it won&#x27;t show you _why_ you&#x27;ll use it, or _what_ it can be used for. It also doesn&#x27;t show what invariants you&#x27;re working with, or in what way the endpoints are otherwise restricted with.<p>Real proper documentation is not just a list of endpoints and their attributes but explanations of those as well as other things.')
