You can tell roads from trails from tracks, and all are there. In many places, everything is mapped down to benches and signage. Google Maps shows you a white line, and it&#x27;s up to you to find out whether your vehicle fits on it. This bit me a few times.<p>When I was in Central Asia, I used it to find gas stations and ATMs that weren&#x27;t on Google Maps. I mapped a dozen of them myself, and added information about the fuel octane they had. It&#x27;s also how I found accommodation and restaurants that wouldn&#x27;t be listed on Google Maps.<p>Google Maps covers people living in cities rather well, but if your use case isn&#x27;t &quot;take the train to a nice restaurant&quot;, OSM has a lot more to offer.')
