Item(by='oh_sigh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606000225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25172384, text='Mass surveillance is about indiscriminate surveillance(recording everyone that comes through in case a bad guy comes through), as opposed to specific surveillance(trailing a mobster to see where he goes). You can have mass surveillance on some roadways without most roads being surveilled.<p>You can have mass surveillance at a stadium and no surveillance outside the stadium. Likewise, you can have mass surveillance on a toll road and not on county roads.<p>Part of your point was the difficulty of inter-state cooperation in this regard, which is incorrect, or at least the difficulty has already been overcome, because this data has been shared with SunPass for ~20 years.<p>And no one made an argument that because we have a little we should have a lot. My point was that what you find intolerable of is already happening.')
