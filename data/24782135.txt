I&#x27;d recommend it to everybody. If <i>Stranger Things</i> just ended now, I might still recommend it to everybody, but I&#x27;d be decidedly less likely to do so, and it would always come with the caveat &quot;They didn&#x27;t actually finish it.&quot; So not only am I less likely to recommend it, but the caveat means the other person is less likely to watch it based on the recommendation if I do. (I might also say, &quot;Don&#x27;t bother watching past season X,&quot; which is still bad for Netflix.)')
