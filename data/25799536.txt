But I guess that&#x27;s only possible because I&#x27;m able to deal with the abuse messages directly now.<p>That said, the servers are handling a few terabytes per day each but I still have only received two abuse messages in the last 2 years. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s related to the fact that people complain less now than they did in 2015 and 2016, or that the exit nodes now clearly indicate they are exit nodes (when opening their IP or hostname with a browser).')
