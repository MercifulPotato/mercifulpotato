It is a reflection of the failure on the part of software engineers, product managers and standards bodies.<p>We are using a document markup language to create interactive UIs. Which, for some crazy reason, has taken over the rest of the industry as well. I have a TV with a React UI, which takes around a second to respond to actions on my remote control. Decades ago, TVs were responsive, even though they had a minuscule amount of processing power compared to modern ones.<p>You&#x27;d think that people would recognize that the web was not meant for what it is used today and would standardize on an alternative with similar benefits (easy debugging, quick feedback cycle, modern tooling) that would actually allow us to build proper interactive UIs, but apparently it is impossible to develop new software. Please, someone, kill HTML.')
