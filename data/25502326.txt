We &quot;know&quot; the universe is expanding because we can observe the effects (eg, red shift of further away stars&#x2F;galaxies), but the &quot;why&quot; has been the big, fundamental question for as long as it was predicted and&#x2F;or observed. It&#x27;s almost certainly related to some property of physics that we don&#x27;t yet understand, but ultimately, we may never know any reason beyond &quot;that&#x27;s just how it is&quot;.')
