Not in the short-term, and probably not much in the long term, except insofar as it increases the likelihood of such activists separating from the Church altogether (though, of course, from the PoV of such activists it will be the earthly heirarchy separating itself from the genuine Church), and thus no longer being regarded as <i>Catholic</i> conservatives.')
