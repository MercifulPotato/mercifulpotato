I chose FastMail for my new email provider. It&#x27;s $5&#x2F;mo, but honestly, I&#x27;m fine paying that, solely to get Google out of my emails.<p>I find their UI to be simple and clear. I enjoy the notes&#x2F;calendar features that come with the email. Their mobile app works fine on my android phone, and the push notifications from the Fastmail calendar are relatively unobtrusive.<p>Only downside so far was I had to cancel my NYTimes sub (honestly probably a plus) because it doesn&#x27;t recognize the @fastmail.com domain as a valid email address. It&#x27;s the only service I&#x27;ve had that problem with, including the important ones like banking, etc.')
