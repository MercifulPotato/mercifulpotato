There isn&#x27;t a lot of traffic. We get around 5-10 synthesis runs per day from .edu accounts. It&#x27;s been reliable, lightweight, and stable.<p>When developing the platform, we tried Ubuntu&#x2F;Debian&#x2F;CentOS, and at the time (about 1.5 years ago), Arch Linux was the most reliable OS for getting the 32-bit deps to work with existing commercial chains, and new toolchain compiles (IceStorm, NextPnr, etc). I think this is because Arch typically includes the development headers by default.<p>As long as the regression tests continue to pass, we will likely continue to roll with Arch Linux. We only tend to rebuild images once a month or so, since our backend is fairly feature complete already.<p>--<p>I think the trick is:<p>* Use containers, e.g. dockerhub&#x27;s archlinux<p>* Assume that you will never be able to run pacman on a live system. Instead, rebuild a new image with a Dockerfile with your new packages -- then deploy that.')
