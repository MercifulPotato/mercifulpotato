But they say it&#x27;s because low-income nations have fewer old people.<p>These numbers are not like constants from physics. They aren&#x27;t the same everywhere, they depend on the environment, and they can change over time. They depend on quality of care, which might improve due to doctors understanding the disease better, or degrade due to hospitals being overwhelmed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webmd.com&#x2F;lung&#x2F;news&#x2F;20201030&#x2F;covid-19-infection-fatality-ratio-is-about-one-point-15-percent" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webmd.com&#x2F;lung&#x2F;news&#x2F;20201030&#x2F;covid-19-infection-...</a>')
