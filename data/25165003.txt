It&#x27;s a pretty short paper with a whole pile of graphs at the end, so I encourage people to read it themselves. \n Quick notes from skimming:<p>- Treats it as an optimization problem for various levels of vaccine efficacy (10-100%), availability(10-100%), spread rate (R0 in {1.5, 2, 2.5, 3}), susceptibility to infection and symptomatic infection per age group.<p>- Four objective functions: symptomatic infections, deaths, non-ICU hospital usage at peak, and ICU usage at peak<p>- 5 age buckets: 0-19, 20-49, 50-64, 65-74, 75+<p>- Assumes 20% of population has immunity, and immunity lasts for a year.<p>- At higher efficacy and availability levels, there are some odd shifts to optimal vaccine distribution strategies.  It&#x27;s not strictly &quot;oldest first&quot; or &quot;youngest first&quot;, there are some weird discontinuities in the middle buckets as well.<p>I had some questions about the wide 20-49 age bucket but it appears that it comes from a CDC planning scenario.  It does look like that various curves start accelerating sharply past 50 or higher, so I guess treating the 20-49 group as one reasonably low risk group could be reasonable.')
