When Google Play Music died, and YouTube Music left an even worse experience in its place, I was done. So now people curate my music instad of machines. Whether that&#x27;s in the form of letting the artist curate it for me with albums, letting myself curate my favorites with playlists, or letting a DJ curate music discovery on a streaming radio station, I find that humans do it better.<p>College radio stations (and their streams) are great, by the way. I can&#x27;t evangelize them enough. Minimal or no ads, and some of the most interesting and creative sets I&#x27;ve heard in my life.')
