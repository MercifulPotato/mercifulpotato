And they looked at me shocked, as if I had spoken heresy. I pointed out how many records they could store on a 64GB machine and that is a <i>small</i> data center class machine and it sort of boggled their mind. Add read-only copies, shared from a NAS device gave them perfect scalability in terms of queries per second (their sales folks had their own database that they were updating). It was fun to watch their expression go from horror to wonder to excitement when they finally implemented it.')
