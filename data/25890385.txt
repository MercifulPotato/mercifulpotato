Or your spouse&#x2F;parents&#x2F;housemates take it and fill it out differently than you would have. Or you&#x27;re institutionalized and the employees of the institution apply for and take the ballots of all the patients and &quot;help&quot; them by filling them all out for the same candidate and submitting them.<p>&gt; So you think someone could sway an election by intercepting people holding mail-in ballots, &quot;forcing&quot; them to show them the ballot, and then bribing&#x2F;punishing(?) them as an incentive to change the vote? Like you think someone could do this at a large enough scale to change the outcome of an election?<p>One person doing this is unlikely to change the result. 0.1% of people doing this to ten people each when the margin of victory is 1% would change the outcome of an election.<p>&gt; And if that&#x27;s true, why aren&#x27;t there any documented cases of this happening?<p>There are documented cases of this happening:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;27&#x2F;project-veritas-uncovers-ballot-harvesting-fraud-in-minnesota&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;27&#x2F;project-veritas-uncovers-ballo...</a><p>The unknowable question is how many undocumented cases there are because the perpetrators are difficult to catch when the victims fear retaliation for turning them in.<p>&gt; As soon as someone forced you to change your vote, you could call your elections board, report it, file a criminal complaint, and submit a new ballot.<p>How does that help if the method of coercion used to make you change your vote is also used to keep you from reporting it?')
