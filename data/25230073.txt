Seems to serve a really really niche user base.<p>If someone wants a electric drive in a bike, it’s not for exercise, they want it for commute. It starts at around 5k, wouldn’t they rather go for a scooter&#x2F;Vespa at that price? They are more practical for chores.<p>The only reason to want a bike is to carry into the apartment  if they don’t want to be bothered with parking. So a super niche crowd?')
