Sure it’s more work for me and my team but if it makes shit fast then who cares how much work it was.<p>One of the best lessons I got when I was being inducted into the compiler club was: compilers are hard. It’s a hard job so other people can have easier jobs. It’s ok if compilers turn complex and managing that complexity is just something you have to learn to do. I don’t think it’s true that the need for that complexity leads to lower perf.')
