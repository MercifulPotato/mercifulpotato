I was simply unable to contact anyone at Comcast who was willing to entertain running fiber to a home.  So I simply had to buy a home that had an option other than Comcast.<p>In another instance, I needed symmetric fiber at one of my businesses.  I contacted Comcast, the business&#x2F;commercial departments multiple times, got numerous peoples&#x27; names, left voice and email messages left and right and got nowhere after weeks.  I ended up contacting a different ISP, signed up with them, and then on the install date, Comcast showed up to install the fiber modem (who were, of course, reselling it to the ISP I contracted with).  I ended up paying the other ISP $1,700 per month.')
