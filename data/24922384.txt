Item(by='beached_whale', descendants=None, kids=[24922506], score=None, time=1603909800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24920216, text='optional has a bunch of reason&#x27;s why it is better than a pointer too(it cannot be incremented, it&#x27;s not a failure to initialize, it doesn&#x27;t implicitly convert to things readily...).  Unfortunately we don&#x27;t have a monadic optional or an optional with a reference member.  Both would be very useful.  Value or suffers from having to evaluate the or part in all cases, but if we had .transform&#x2F;.and_then&#x2F;.or_else members would be really nice.  Optional of a reference would allow for a whole swath of try_ methods instead of the idiomatic at( ) interface for checking bounds and retrieving in one call.  at( ) suffers that it forces the choice of an exception or checking the index for being in range outside the call and then operator[] is what you want.')
