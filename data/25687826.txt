I know a couple in SF who don&#x27;t own a car but they make pretty regular use of car-share. (Although last I heard they had their ZipCar account suspended for a minor accident and the alternatives or not as good.)<p>I still stand by the broader point though. To the degree that you don&#x27;t really have the space for hobby&#x2F;recreational gear and that it&#x27;s harder to transport the things you need for activities, the less likely you are to do them.')
