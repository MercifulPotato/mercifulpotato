Seems to affect mentions also (something that didn&#x27;t until recently IIRC), so your original usertag should be completely invisible.<p>The only thing though I found out not possible to customize per server is the avatar picture, for some reason. But I already use the same for personal and professional communications so it didn&#x27;t bother me too much.')
