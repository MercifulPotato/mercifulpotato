Unluckily or maybe luckily from the first date after registration, I started to receive spams which I have no idea why. Contacted their support team quite a few times asking for sender blocking feature and the answer was always some arrogant bs like &quot;Nah, we have the best spam filter and thus sender blocking is unnecessary... blah blah...&quot;. As a result, I felt it might be a mistake to use Gmail as my primary email account. So I narrowly avoided Gmail but again, I&#x27;ve no confidence that other providers will not do something similar to this. Maybe it&#x27;s time to do self-hosting now.')
