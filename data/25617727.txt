A job graph for a VFX job can be well over 100k nodes, something that would crash k8s.<p>Secondly, tractor (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rmanwiki.pixar.com&#x2F;display&#x2F;TRA&#x2F;Tractor+2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rmanwiki.pixar.com&#x2F;display&#x2F;TRA&#x2F;Tractor+2</a>) is exceptionally fast at dispatching jobs to machines. I suspect its in the order of 50k a second, if not more.<p>Thirdly, getting k8s to talk to 25k machines without saturating the network is almost impossible.<p>fourthly, it doesn&#x27;t do to well on &quot;normal&quot; network, try getting decent network throughput on one of K8s batshit networking schemes(each server on a farm will have at a minimum 2 10 gig links, more likley 2 40gig)')
