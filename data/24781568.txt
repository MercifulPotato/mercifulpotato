In fact it was the complete opposite.<p>I was proposing that it was in fact <i>likely</i> and thus pretty much guaranteed to happen in a large universe, as opposed to being <i>unlikely</i> but still likely given a large enough universe.<p>So we&#x27;re working with different assumptions here.<p>In fairness I put my assumption way at the beginning of my post, so it probably got forgotten about by the end of it. Quoting myself:<p>&gt; What if amino acids and proteins are in fact likely to arise naturally and in favorable circumstances?<p>We haven&#x27;t yet conclusively found all of the pathways these can arise, and we continue to discover more. People just tend to assume it&#x27;s pretty unlikely. I&#x27;m not so sure.')
