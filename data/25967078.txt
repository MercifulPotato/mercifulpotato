I understand the case when someone initiated the cash deposit and money are not settled yet, and there is a risk for broker that they will never settle on broker&#x27;s bank account. But if we are talking about buying GME stock in non-margin account with settled money, what&#x27;s the risk there? \nIf people bought stock on 400$ with settled cash, this cash is already on broker&#x27;s account, so if it worth 20$ on Wednesday and poeple won&#x27;t show up, what&#x27;s the problem here? \nBrokers even blocked buying GME stock on non margin accounts with settled cash.\nedit: typos')
