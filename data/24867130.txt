You didn&#x27;t list the reasonable alternative of making a written response. My disagreement was with the situation presented in your comment and the one you were replying to; I live in a different country and don&#x27;t know New York&#x27;s actual legal system.<p>&gt; I never understand why people can&#x27;t understand: it&#x27;s a rules based system, if you don&#x27;t have to follow the rules, no one does and then it collapses. Americans in particular seem to really struggle with this but its just life...<p>I don&#x27;t think anybody here (and only a very few ideologues elsewhere) is arguing against a rules-based system, or for people to disobey laws out of principle. I am arguing that the rules must be fair and reasonable, that people of all levels of intelligence and income can afford to follow. It <i>would be</i> unreasonable to force people to travel long distances or pay for an hour of a lawyer&#x27;s time to address police mistakes. It would also be unreasonable to expect Pennsylvanians to know how to dispute a New York ticket in writing without clearly informing them (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what happened here, it&#x27;s just an example).')
