I&#x27;d love to invent something terminal-based for fun and for future occasions when I&#x27;m probably going to need that but I never actually needed that so far. I use GUI DEs 100% of time and I don&#x27;t really care to firewall particular processes on remote servers I SSH to - those have other security policies doing the job pretty well for them.<p>Perhaps it could be a named pipe a TUI app (TUI running in a separate virtual console, or in a terminal multiplexer) would connect to.<p>Vuurmuur is an example of a nice TUI firewall app.')
