Also the desks of communist party members in the company will usually have communist party emblems and chinese flags indicating their status as a Communist Party member, it&#x27;s not taboo to do so. Most top companies will gather top job candidates which will include communist party members who work as lawyers, developers, etc (aka normal jobs) and they will list their CCP membership on their resumes. So this is more doxxing I would say as the vast majority of communist party members working at a company are regular people.<p>Source on Communist Party entrance process: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daily.jstor.org&#x2F;communist-party-of-china&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daily.jstor.org&#x2F;communist-party-of-china&#x2F;</a>')
