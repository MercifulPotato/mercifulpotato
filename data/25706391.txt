I am 64 years old, and in the best shape of my life. Same weight (and weight distribution!) as in college, good muscle tone. I think three things were critical, for me:<p>1. Absolutely no soft drinks at all. Not with sugar, not with artificial sweeteners. Nothing. Just seltzer. I used to drink a LOT of Dr. Pepper, and was told that they were contributing to my frequent kidney stones. So I stopped cold turkey, 30 years ago. I&#x27;ve had, I think, two Dr. Peppers since then. (I try to avoid processed foods in general, but I&#x27;m not a fanatic.)<p>2. Find an exericse regimen that requires you to show up, on time, and be accountable to others. I want a trainer to tell me what to do, turn off my brain, and just do it. That external accountability is crucial. I could find crossfit routines online, but then I don&#x27;t do them. (I tried that, early in the pandemic.)<p>3. DO NOT treat exercise as a priority. Because then it is subject to your other priorities. Instead, make it a habit. You don&#x27;t schedule brushing your teeth, and it is never traded off for other activities. You just do it when you&#x27;re supposed to.<p>When circumstances pull me away from my routine (pandemic, extended family emergency), I feel like shit. My joints get creaky. Certain muscles start hurting. I have no energy. This all goes away once I return to my exercise routine. I hate it, but I love having done it -- I feel so much better in general. The high point of my day is when I am walking OUT of the gym.')
