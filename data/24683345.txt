Item(by='yowlingcat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601856860, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679019, text='&gt; The problem with psychedelics is they only make you &quot;more&quot; of what you are.<p>Not sure about &quot;only&quot; but I do think it&#x27;s a valid thing to be aware of. It&#x27;s only one half of the classical &quot;set and setting&quot; and the latter is really key. Are you doing it alone &#x2F; who are you doing it with?<p>&gt; these are extremely dangerous substances that can cause trauma and other serious psychological problems if not used extremely specifically and carefully<p>Don&#x27;t know about this one either. I think it&#x27;s certainly true that it can trigger latent trauma that hasn&#x27;t been dealt with. But that&#x27;s by no means a guarantee.<p>My take with this sort of stuff is that it&#x27;s not really healthy to have an absolutist prohibitionist approach nor a free for all. I think the right approach is for interested parties to gently ramp up in the setting of an experienced sitter who can help reorient them.<p>&gt; This isn&#x27;t something you can do on your own.<p>This is probably the only part of your statement I&#x27;d categorically disagree with. Again, depends on the person, the set and the setting. Highly situational. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s helpful to try and oversimplify this kind of thing.')
