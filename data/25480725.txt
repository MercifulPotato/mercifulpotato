Item(by='mattnewton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608408535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480579, text='&gt; What I did find is a lot of gameplay time padding. Wait for this or that to call you<p>You can just wait 24 hours instantly in the menu to get npcs to call you back. It was a narrative technique that I think balanced a sense of urgency while letting the player control which thread they want to pull on next, not meant to pad out the game. But I&#x27;d agree that the wait function in the main menu could have been introduced in a tutorial (As could most of the games systems)<p>The padding comes from the random events (Like assaults or robberies) that have no story, you just show up and start shooting (but don&#x27;t hit any innocents, or the cops will suddenly show up, despite being too busy to show up when the bad guys shoot them).<p>Are you really surprised &quot;the fat fixer&quot; gets what&#x27;s coming to him? He dies to show you how ruthless the corps are. He was already dead when the heist went south, and he knew it.<p>The character of Alt and the Johnny redemption arc was great for me. If you choose the right dialogue options Johnny basically realizes how being pure concentrated 80&#x27;s sci fi action hero has made him toxic to everyone around him.')
