I took the E&amp;M course for electrical engineers at my university, a very well-regarded engineering school. I ha no idea what I was doing. After every exam, I thought I&#x27;d have to drop the course. One of my scores was a solid B, another was the third highest. I got a B because I didn&#x27;t know how to do the homework.
