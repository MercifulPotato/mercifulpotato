Do you like having an unpatched system for days or weeks at a time when an embargoed security fix hits RHEL and has to wait for CentOS to build and distribute? I don&#x27;t. Security patches are top priority for me.<p>This is absolutely a False dilemma fallacy, there is absolutely nothing technically or legally prohibiting RedHat from releasing patches for both at the same time.  Nothing.  It is a sales&#x2F;marketing or a internal process choice to do it that way.<p>Changes to do this process, even moving CentOS to be ahead of RHEL is not the problem.  The &quot;rolling release&quot; or non-release, or what every model they are calling it now with CentOS Stream is the problem.  The fact that it will no longer be Binary Complete with RHEL is the problem,  the fact that CentOS will be used as a &quot;beta&quot; (and spare me the marketing BS claiming it is not that) is the problem<p>&gt; Would you have described RHEL this way?<p>RHEL is a targeted, Released Enterprise Operating system with a 10 year support cycle<p>CentOS was a targeted, Released Enterprise Operating system with a 10 year support cycle<p>CentOS Stream is not a targeted, released Enterprise operating system with 10 year support cycle.  CentOS Stream is pseudo-rolling release with no point releases, used to build a targeted, released enterprise operating system.')
