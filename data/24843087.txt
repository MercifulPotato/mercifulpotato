But it&#x27;s still doing it from that same mine.<p>And that&#x27;s exactly what AI is, garbage in, garbage out. I used to be a machine learning engineer in a company that is about as old as the dinosaur. They wanted to apply that gold digging AI machine google had on a landfill, which didn&#x27;t quite pan out the way they liked it.')
