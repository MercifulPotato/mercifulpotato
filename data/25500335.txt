For other things, like wiper control in the Model 3, I definitely do not like it and it is worse.<p>I think this might just come down to personal preference. After owning a Model 3 for a while now, I can&#x27;t stand my Audi (or other cars) that aren&#x27;t touch screens. There are far too many buttons and dials. It is overwhelming (and ugly to me). The non-touch UIs are clunky and confusing and often far more distracting for me as I try to figure them out.')
