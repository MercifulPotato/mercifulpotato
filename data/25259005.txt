I&#x27;ve already got a graphics card that can decode some video formats, but not new ones, and that will never change until it becomes e-waste. Now we get the same thing for image formats, ML, etc? And you&#x27;re even more locked in to these co-processors since they use space that could have been used to have a dozen general purpose cores. So good luck ever watching a video that doesn&#x27;t use a codec your hardware supports.')
