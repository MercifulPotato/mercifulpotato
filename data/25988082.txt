He convinced his base that mail-in ballots were a scam, then cried foul when all of the mail-in ballots came in for Biden. He launched innumerable lawsuits alleging fraud that were thrown out, then claimed the courts were against him. He tried to shake down Georgia&#x27;s secretary of state to &quot;find&quot; enough votes to put him over Biden.
