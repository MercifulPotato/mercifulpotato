If you make a similar conflation in software development, you&#x27;d say that a team member who pushes buggy code to your repo sabotaged your project instead of saying he made a mistake.<p>Also there&#x27;s a difference between an organization and its members.  Those individuals you mentioned may have lied, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the organization lied.  If a <i>disgruntled member</i> of your team does try to sabotage your project, that doesn&#x27;t mean your <i>team</i> is sabotaging the project.')
