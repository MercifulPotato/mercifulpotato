Item(by='matt_o', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604184102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24954893, text='&gt; Listen, personally I would recommend you visit countries abroad for a change - like China, Russia, India or Europe (pick any they are all nice) and leave your US bubble.<p>Russia invaded Georgia in 2008[0]. Russia has taken over Crimea, a part of Ukraine in 2014[1]. Sweden plans to increase their military spending because of Russia&#x27;s actions[2]. Estonia is upping its sea defenses[3].<p>I&#x27;m sure that the majority of Russians would prefer not to go to war. They have their own problems - a drug epidemic, a demographic implosion, and a quickly declining economy. Then there are the oligarchs. But, given the right carrot and stick (mostly stick), I see no reason why they wouldn&#x27;t invade a neighboring country. Because, the small group of people you mention, those gangsters at the top, they have a lot of big sticks to motivate people to sign up for the army and do terrible things to their neighbors.<p>FYI, I&#x27;ve lived half of my life in Europe. Eastern Europe. The threat of Russia is always present in the back of people&#x27;s heads. And they like NATO safety. No, they wouldn&#x27;t prefer to welcome Russia and learn Russian. They like their life, they like their cultures, and yes, they are even so barbaric as to want to defend their life and culture with their lives by standing up to Russia.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Russo-Georgian_War" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Russo-Georgian_War</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Ru...</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;davidnikel&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;16&#x2F;sweden-to-increase-defense-spending-by-40-amid-russia-fears&#x2F;?sh=dacb1b467ba2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;davidnikel&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;16&#x2F;sweden-to...</a>\n[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.defensenews.com&#x2F;global&#x2F;europe&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;estonia-moves-to-fortify-its-coastline-with-missiles-and-sea-mines&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.defensenews.com&#x2F;global&#x2F;europe&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;estonia...</a>')
