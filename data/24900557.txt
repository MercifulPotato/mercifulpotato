Item(by='usaar333', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603742016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900169, text='&gt; If a company does not figure out how to hire, retain, and promote people who are not white men<p>Agreed. Not hiring the best talent is always bad for a company. If you are biased against your best talent, you&#x27;ve selected worse talent.<p>However, diversity goals keep moving - they are well past bias issues. Note that tech companies aren&#x27;t hiring mostly white men at this point - they are in fact outnumbered by Asian men (Google was at 30% and 39% in tech hiring respectively last year.). And yet, we are still talking about the lack of diversity in tech (women remain underepresented, but in terms of ethnicity it&#x27;s a very diverse place)')
