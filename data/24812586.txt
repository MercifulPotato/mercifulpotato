Nathan Myhrvold is who you&#x27;re thinking of -- he was the former CTO of Microsoft, and among other things, now runs an outfit called Intellectual Ventures, who did both that work several years ago and is responsible for this paper (I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but there are references to Intellectual Ventures Labs further down into the paper).
