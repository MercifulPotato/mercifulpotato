Global warming is still at several major tipping points. Technology development and industrial switchover cost&#x2F;momentum&#x2F;economies of scale improvement curves for BEVs, solar&#x2F;wind, and grid storage are all improving at geometric rates. Synthetic fuel for aviation and ultra-long-range ground&#x2F;sea transport desperately need incentives.<p>We need policy that will give PHEVs with 50 mile all-electric range a multi-thousand dollar advantage over non-hybrids. This is important because it educates the general populace on electric drivetrains, transitions to BEV charging&#x2F;grid utilization profiles, maximizes the battery production to the 90% use case, and gets 90% of consumer driving to emissions-free electric.<p>We need a gas tax that starts to accumulate every year over a ten year period. As in it goes up 50 cents a year. Used cars should be subjected to initial registration taxes that increase $200-$500 a year. Triple that for ICE SUVs&#x2F;CUVs based on vehicle weight and EPA mileage numbers.<p>With this should come a large incentive for PHEV ($5000-$1000) that will gradually phase out over 10-20 years.<p>We need the home solar and battery storage incentive doubled down on, not currently phased out. While utility solar is cheaper, it comes with grid costs that I don&#x27;t think are necessarily included, and home solar will reduce grid complexity and durability, and incentivizes movement to a home green energy closed cycle.')
