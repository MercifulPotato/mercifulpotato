I&#x27;ve always been able to rely on bash both professionally and in my own projects.<p>I am however aware of people who have to rely on posix compatibility. One of them is as you said, docker environments and alpine Linux, the other is a former colleague was working on some airgapped system where security didn&#x27;t allow any additional packages to be installed, and bash wasn&#x27;t installed. So their only way of scripting was either posix, or an old version of python 2 (I think it was 2.3). I don&#x27;t know whose brilliant idea it was to install python, but not bash.<p>So it really depends on your use case')
