That is, you cannot copyright or patent a design (e.g. the cut of clothing), but what they did instead is plaster their things with iconography that CAN be trademarked.<p>Basically they made their brand &#x2F; labels part of the &quot;identity&quot; of the outfit. I mean you can get a $5 or a $50 or a $500 polo shirt, for the most part they&#x27;ll be the same but the more expensive ones will have the alligator or guy on a horse on them. The practical differences between them are minimal, and in terms of production it&#x27;s a few dollars (at most) difference.')
