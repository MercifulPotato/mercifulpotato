That&#x27;s a weird hypothesis and no facts to back it up with. The person might be conflating &quot;economies&quot; with some form of &quot;capitalism&quot;.<p>Nevertheless, I do think we know (for the most part) what is going on. It&#x27;s just that we reached feudal times again (never left them?), where decisions are made by our rulers and as long as the great ruler of america and the great ruler of china are friends, then there is no war. And everything else is waged on the backs of &#x27;The People&#x27;. Or something.<p>On a more serious note, the above comment mentions a job guarantee. That is part of Kelton&#x27;s MMT proposal.\nThere are two things I don&#x27;t like about it:<p>1. MMT is called a theory, but it&#x27;s actually a descriptive model, and it has shown in the last 3 decades, that it is quite the acurate model.\n2. Kelton conflates what MMT teaches us about monetary politics and fiat currencies with her own agenda, namely the job guarantee. And it&#x27;s hard to argue against the latter, when you acknowledge the first. And that is only possible, because MMT is called a &#x27;theory&#x27;.<p>Nevertheless, I believe you are right DoreenMichele, that we as humans should never stand still. I don&#x27;t think I could &#x27;not work&#x27;. As such a universal job guarantee or public programs are scary to me, because although I like work and won&#x27;t stop anytime soon, I feel like this will be abused by politicians to cement long working hours. And while I do like work, I think less working hours per person is what we should thrive for. This is a conflict in my head.<p>I am a fan of UBI, because I don&#x27;t see myself stopping to work anytime soon, and it would have just relieved me of a lot of stress when I grew up with basically nothing. At the same time, I can see that there are jobs people might not pick up if they had sufficient UBI. Thus these jobs need MUCH higher pay. Because the people doing them (mostly) do them out of passion.<p>Where does it lead us? Unfortunately where we have always been: the very classical class fight. It&#x27;s not a grand conspiracy theory, there is no one controlling entity with one mind, but in general laws and law making are skewed towards &quot;havers&quot;. Which you might as well just call our new feudal lords.<p>And until we put up some sorts of guards against (too much) abuse of power, dismantling of democracy, opaque deal-making and abusement of the planet&#x27;s resources (especially without pay or even subsidized) I don&#x27;t see it ending anytime soon.')
