I missed a few days and when I returned there was a pile of cards that needed review.<p>I later wrote my own flashcard app[1] with spaced repetition and ended up hiding the details of what was overdue and instead just let you set up a daily goal of number of cards reviewed. When you do a lesson, it picks up the overdue cards first, but if there aren&#x27;t any, it pulls in new cards instead.<p>It&#x27;s funny because I originally thought telling you how many were due each day would be a great motivator (at least for me), but I&#x27;m finding I actually don&#x27;t care. If you miss a few days, the cards still remain overdue, but when you return it doesn&#x27;t feel bad.<p>I think for me, it&#x27;s more important when learning to aim for the long-term commitment to it than to be perfect each day in your studies. If you aim for perfection, you end up not meeting your high standards and may end up quitting. Also, I think the &quot;deadline&quot; for when to review in spaced repetition isn&#x27;t exactly accurate to the day or hour that something is due, so there&#x27;s a little bit of malleability there, and I think that&#x27;s okay.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ussherpress.com&#x2F;freshcards&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ussherpress.com&#x2F;freshcards&#x2F;</a>')
