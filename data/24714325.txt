Then either<p>A) he shows a car and the odds of winning with this strategy are 100%<p>or<p>B) he shows a goat and the odds of winning with this strategy are between 1&#x2F;2 and 2&#x2F;3 depending on how the choice of door was made<p>If the choice is random, he shows a car with probability 1&#x2F;3. The probability of winning is 1&#x2F;3 x 1 + 2&#x2F;3 x 1&#x2F;2 = 2&#x2F;3<p>But that analysis is for the unconditional problem and what we’re asked is what to do in case B, after a goat has been unveiled.<p>If he shows always a goat, the probability of winning is 0 x 1 + 1 x 2&#x2F;3 = 2&#x2F;3. Here there is no difference between the unconditional and the conditional problems because A never happens.')
