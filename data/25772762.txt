Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25772897], score=None, time=1610604823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25772352, text='&gt; Being virtuous was &quot;being a virtuous citizen&quot;; no matter if you were a slave or an Emperor. If anything they tried to teach you not to care about the conditions you were in (rich, poor, young, old...) and focus on the outcomes only.<p>But stoicism tells you to focus on this &quot;virtuousness&quot; in defiance of the actual outcomes: it tells you you shouldn&#x27;t care whether other people acknowledge you as virtuous or not, or whether you succeeded or failed in a contest, as long as you acted rightly. I think this is actually a contradiction, because you can&#x27;t decide which actions are virtuous through pure reason without regard to their outcomes; or even if you could, how would you ever know whether your reasoning was correct or not?')
