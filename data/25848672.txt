Item(by='tremon', descendants=None, kids=[25848906, 25849266, 25849505], score=None, time=1611161500, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25848349, text='Which &quot;auth&quot; would that be? I get the feeling the article means authentication only, but halfway through it says &quot;When your [..] authorization systems are down&quot;. Outsourcing your authentication isn&#x27;t that much of a problem, especially in the context of decentralization of services. But authorization is rather tightly coupled to your service, and outsourcing that part would be much more of a challenge -- keeping authorization rules up-to-date with external systems is a difficult dependency management problem.<p>But regardless of which &quot;auth&quot; was meant, I feel this part is dangerous:<p><i>Auth may be unrelated to your core competency</i><p>No, please no. Both authentication and authorization must be considered a core competency for every online service, even if you decide to partly outsource it. You can&#x27;t afford to have blind spots there.')
