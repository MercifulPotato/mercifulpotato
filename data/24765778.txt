You can get a cursory understanding of Go in a few hours and you can master it in 1-2 months. It would be months and years in C++, respectively. C++ is just a much larger, more complex language, so there is a lot more to know. It&#x27;s not that C++ is inherently bad--some of that complexity allows C++ to be faster and more powerful than Go; however, we can&#x27;t pretend that the two are equivalent with respect to their ease of learning or number of footguns.')
