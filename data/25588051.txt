Almost every JSON library has the same limitations you mentioned, and yet many people find JSON useful for network applications.<p>JSON is a human-readable format which is hugely advantageous to develop and operate in many settings. Protobufs doesn&#x27;t have that advantage. Yet we&#x27;re paying all of the same costs to structure the data with both. That&#x27;s enough to posit JSON as a net winner over protobufs.<p>&gt; Unfortunately protobuf C++ can&#x27;t live fully within this arena model while it uses std::string for accessors.<p>Forcing std::string as a container for core components of a networking API (specifically for an accessor) is an exemplary demonstration of a lack of seriousness in a library.')
