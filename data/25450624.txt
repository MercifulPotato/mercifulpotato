Will they act out again? Probably, but that only requires more energy and intelligence from the parent to educate their child.<p>Corporal punishment is lazy, short-sighted parenting that is a &quot;chronic, developmental stressor associated with depression, aggression and addictive behaviors&quot; [1]. Honestly, I&#x27;m shocked this is being supported on Hackernews, of all places.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re right that Western parents are caught between an era of corporal punishment and not knowing how to parent alternatively. Does that mean reverting to violence against children? Absolutely not. Surely it means understanding how to communicate with your children better.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2896871&#x2F;?_escaped_fragment_=po" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2896871&#x2F;?_escap...</a>')
