Said laptop had been running Linux exclusively for several months (but it had previously been used with Windows). Interacting with the laptop made the expected xscreensaver unlock screen appear, and everything worked normally afterwards. The only explanation I could come up with was that, somehow, a snapshot of the Windows screen had survived intact in a corner of the framebuffer which the Linux driver didn&#x27;t touch, even after months of power off&#x2F;on and suspend&#x2F;resume cycles, and a bizarre driver glitch made it visible in that particular resume cycle.')
