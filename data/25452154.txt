You’ll continue to have access to your credits until November 25, 2020.&quot;<p>- Nov 4th: I&#x27;m charged once more and receive a token.<p>- Nov 25th: I finally lose tokens and my membership transitions to the canceled state. I&#x27;m never charged again.<p>I&#x27;ve run this experiment a second time when my girlfriend canceled last month (I also wanted screenshots of the cancelation wizard for the blog post I want to write). She was charged once more between the &quot;cancel request&quot;, the rebill date, and the actual cancel 30 days later.<p>What do you think is a more accurate, charitable description of these events? I think &quot;cancelation has a 30-day delay&quot; summarizes the post-cancel rebill much more charitably than it deserves.')
