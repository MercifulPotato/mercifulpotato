Now what you are saying is making sense, your original post did not.  Irreversibility (increase in entropy) across the shock does cause a significant temperature gain (and at re-entry speeds, nonequilibrium flow, radiation, etc.), but isentropic compression does as well.  Still, the shock is a compression artifact, and while you can draw an analogy between the irreversibility within a shock and that in a friction process like in a viscous drag, the original poster&#x27;s categorization of re-entry heating as compression heating is completely consistent with how practitioners in the gasdynamics community would categorize it.')
