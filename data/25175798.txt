I wonder if it&#x27;s the extended period inside that the pandemic has necessitated, that&#x27;s triggering this angst. I am also feeling the same way, but I can&#x27;t help but feel that to some degree, the months of isolation (not just from friends and framily, from the outdoors even) have a big part to play.<p>The occupations where you are out and about carry a big risk: physical injury can put you out of work <i>and</i> cause debilitating pain for the rest of your life.
