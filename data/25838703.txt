The man in question used his print publication to propagate that pamphlet.  That same man spent years using his radio program to promote the falsehood that the Russian Revolution was sponsored by &quot;Jewish bankers&quot; and the conspiracy theory that &quot;Jews&quot; were behind Bolshevism.  In response to Kristalnacht he said that the persecution of Jews by the Nazis &quot;followed&quot; the persecution of Christians by the Bolsheviks, as if Kristalnacht was a response to what happened in the USSR.  When he was challenged on his antisemitism he declared that he wanted the &quot;Good Jews&quot; on his side and that he was only taking a stand against the persecution of people generally (never mind his comments on Kristalnacht and support for the Nazi Party and the Bund).<p>So no, this is not an example of out of control censorship or a witch hunt or even a &quot;mere accusation&quot; ruining someone&#x27;s life, nor was it simply that he was an opponent of Roosevelt (who, like every US president, had many political opponents).  This is an example of someone who was fomenting religious and ethnic divisions by spreading the propaganda of one of America&#x27;s adversaries -- while also being indirectly funded by that adversary.')
