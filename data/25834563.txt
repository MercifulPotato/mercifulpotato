There are 16 tablespoons in a cup, 2 cups to a pint, 2 pints to a quart, and 4 quarts to a gallon, plus a few lesser used units in between (for example, a &quot;gill&quot; is apparently a half-cup) which is all well and good. But then there are 3 teaspoons to a tablespoon, and an assortment of units larger than a gallon: 63 gallons in a hogshead; a barrel, or half-hogshead, with 31.5 gallons; alternatively 42 gallons in an oil barrel.<p>Personally I think the &quot;best&quot; US unit is Fahrenheit, though only when used for human purposes. Going from 0-100 takes you from very cold to very hot, roughly the range of reasonable temperatures for a human to live in. A bit outside that range is also survivable with a bit more careful preparation. A place which experiences temperatures from 0-100 across a year isn&#x27;t outrageous. Compare to Celsius where 0-100 ranges from only somewhat cold to far beyond what humans can reasonable exist in. Fahrenheit temperatures are just a bit more friendly to work with in my biased opinion.')
