The upper end of that spectrum dominates in the trading employees&#x27; shares, however, so there is a fair point here.<p>That said, CartaX isn&#x27;t comparable to the open secondary markets. The latter are continuous. CartaX is periodic.<p>The better comparison is Nasdaq Private Markets, who offer a similar tender offer platform. Last time I checked, they charge a fixed fee plus something like $500 per trade. Compared with this, the 2% CartaX charge is only competitive for &lt;$25,000 transactions.<p>&gt; <i>won&#x27;t do anything below $100K</i><p>This is generally correct for open market trades. (Though folks like EquityZen are pushing the envelope on minimum transaction sizes.) It is not true for tenders.<p>CartaX looks like a pricier Nasdaq Private Markets. Perhaps that premium--and the ongoing disclosure requirements and lock-in--is worth paying for some issuers.')
