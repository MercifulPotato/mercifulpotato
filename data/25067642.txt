This meant that most work done on computers, with anything larger than a &quot;toy&#x2F;hello-world&quot; dataset, was going to be painfully slow.  That&#x27;s why they called it &quot;professional&quot; - because you were actually using datasets large enough to burden the beast.  Actually balancing a whole company&#x27;s finances with a spreadsheet, rather than tallying up a little 10-item list.<p>I want to emphasize that &quot;majoritarian&quot; aspect of it - it wasn&#x27;t just a few specific kinds, it was a majority of ALL kinds of work.<p>And that&#x27;s changed.<p>We&#x27;re now at a point where only a tiny minority of tasks done on computers actually have throughput limits based on the computer rather than the operator.')
