Hello world is how you get started in a university intro course, not in your parents&#x27; basement.<p>What happens there is that you have a pile of photos that are all in one folder and you want to organize them into separate folders by date. A problem you&#x27;re actually having, not a homework assignment. Which is possible to do automatically, because they all have metadata with that information in it. So you find a python script somebody wrote to do that, and it works! Then you realize the script is just a text file and you can modify it to sort using geotags or something else instead, and now you&#x27;re down the rabbit hole. But only if it&#x27;s easy to see and modify the code that runs on the device you actually use.')
