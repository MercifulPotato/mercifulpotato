If you think you&#x27;d want to do end2end against an environment entirely built by code, k8s is a really good building block.<p>If you think a one man band and his ruby app can probably go pretty far with self-discipline, but if I&#x27;m choosing to do any sort of IaC I&#x27;d probably recommend looking at k8s as a) a faster solution, b) a more versatile solution and c) largely vendor agnostic solution.<p>Point being, I&#x27;d probably recommend folks learn to use k8s before they invest time learning lambda, EC2, or ECS, but if you&#x27;re a small team and you already have lambda, EC2, or ECS, and it&#x27;s working for you, then it&#x27;s hard to argue for change.')
