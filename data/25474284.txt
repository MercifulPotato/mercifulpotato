Item(by='ebg13', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608343041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25474156, text='&gt; <i>Why don&#x27;t you quit</i><p>I did after several years. I, luckily, was in CS and landed on my feet. My partner and many friends did not quit. They, unluckily, were not in CS. So I have the displeasure of seeing it from both ends of the degree and many angles.<p>&gt; <i>Is it just sunk-cost fallacy?</i><p>Some but not all. You have to realize that the entire world is gaslighting kids every day into thinking that the hole-in-one once-in-a-lifetime shot is normal and common. But it isn&#x27;t. It isn&#x27;t normal. What&#x27;s normal is failing to make it after giving 7 years of your life for less than minimum wage because there are 1000 applicants for every hyper-specialized position and almost all of them have more experience than freshly-defended-and-posted you, even if you&#x27;re coming out of Harvard or Yale. But most people at the bottom never see this until it&#x27;s too late, because nobody at the top talks about this ever. Worse, people at the top constantly lie about it or dismiss how bad everything is because _they_ made it and don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so bad from where they are. They&#x27;re all stuck in pre-2009 mindsets before available job postings completely fell off a cliff and never recovered.<p>To pervert a common expression, psychological warfare is a hell of a drug.<p>&gt; <i>which means you all need to unionize</i><p>This does happen, but, I don&#x27;t know where you live, culture in the US is extremely hostile to unionization. Hell, the NLRB only decided that graduate students qualified as employees and were thus _allowed_ to unionize in 2016 after more than a decade of saying otherwise.')
