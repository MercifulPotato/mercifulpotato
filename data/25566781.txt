Item(by='adjkant', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609216688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566595, text='&gt; If the tribes are not equally powerful, the powerful one will kill most of them and take all the resources and the women.<p>This simply doesn&#x27;t describe humanity, nor many species of animals.<p>Yes, humanity is selfish and will do many things for self preservation. But we also have a large capacity for empathy and collaboration. Not everything traces back to those either even if you try to just say the modern world is a more complex version of this. Love is a classic example people point to of selflessness being instinctually in humans.<p>At its core, you are getting downvoted because you have a very negative view of humanity that is both inaccurate and harmful if applied. To extend that &quot;no morality, nothing belongs to anybody&quot; mindset just ends up with a worse world for no reason. This &quot;you follow those rules because otherwise the elites will come for you&quot; idea also just seems like conspiracy type handwaving, and I say this as someone who&#x27;s plenty anti-imperialist and the like myself.<p>Would you also not be concerned to be around someone who implies they would do whatever they please even it it harmed you but the thing stopping them is society? To me, that seems like someone who is neither empathetic or social and I, as a social and empathetic person, would avoid that and hope they don&#x27;t harm others. You may not have meant to imply that, but it kinda reads that way.<p>When you ask questions like:<p>&gt; What if the thing you&#x27;re stealing from me today was something I stole from you yesterday? Would it still be &quot;immoral&quot;? What if my great grandfather stole from your great grandfather many years ago and you steal it back today? What if the transactions aren&#x27;t that simple? What if the stealing happened in a much more complicated structure throughout many generations in a network of billions of people?<p>You aren&#x27;t showing that morality doesn&#x27;t exist, you&#x27;re pointing out its complexity. Moral questions are at the center of nearly all social and political debate. It&#x27;s hard to get agreement!<p>But going back to your latest post:<p>&gt; You could argue such cost benefits between families in tribes or individuals in families from the same framework.<p>Okay, why don&#x27;t we? What about the tribe of all humanity, or of all living things? One big flaw in your logic is that life is not a zero sum game, and that&#x27;s one thing that makes collaboration worthwhile.<p>Why do you think so many people would be guilty after killing someone? Because again, humans have empathy and other capacities that make them care about certain things. Yes, some humans like sociopaths&#x2F;psychopaths can lack this, but that doesn&#x27;t invalidate that its present in most, though it can create a wrinkle in the rules being so straightforward.<p>&gt; You could argue that the very set of rules which make for an optimal balance between individual, family, tribal and inter-tribal interests is in fact &quot;morality&quot;<p>See, I actually more or less agree here. I think that set of rules is more or less an objective set you can derive from human psychology (see moral psychology above) and that if you change what humans are, you also change morality. Most renditions of human civilization and history support that - we didn&#x27;t all, across the globe, just magically agree that senseless murder is bad - it was baked into humanity.<p>&gt; but when the resources and the power balance changes, whatever &quot;morals&quot; people thought existed will disappear and will be replaced by new set of &quot;morals&quot;<p>You&#x27;re mixing law and morality here. Laws can change or come and go, but morality (at least an objective view of one) is true or false regardless of the circumstances it exists in (again, beyond changes to human nature). That&#x27;s one option. Some ascribe to subjectivism instead, which you might. But that&#x27;s still morality!<p>This is a decent basic overview starting point of meta-ethics (what grounds ethics&#x2F;morality) if you&#x27;re interested: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FOoffXFpAlU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FOoffXFpAlU</a><p>PS: Sorry about talking about you but not engaging. It was frankly hard to tell if it was an actual belief or a troll at first, and addressing all of this takes some energy. I don&#x27;t mean to condescend either so know that&#x27;s not my intention if it reads like that!')
