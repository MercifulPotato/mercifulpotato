At this exact moment there are 13 commits on master ahead of the latest tag, who knows what that might be. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.zx2c4.com&#x2F;cgit&#x2F;log&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.zx2c4.com&#x2F;cgit&#x2F;log&#x2F;</a><p>Find a repo (apt&#x2F;PPA, dnf&#x2F;EPEL, AUR, whatever works for you) and use a repo to manage your server software unless you have no other choice than to hand-compile it. Hand-compiling server daemons like this means they never get upgraded with bugfixes and CVE issues regularly - this isn&#x27;t 1995, we did this back then because we had to do it. It&#x27;s not a good idea in 2021 to be doing this unless you&#x27;re going to hand-manage that cgit binary every day of your life going forward, this is an internet facing endpoint which will get people probing it to attack (assuming you used a cloud server).<p>If nothing else, clone off the last tagged release by the upstream authors not HEAD.')
