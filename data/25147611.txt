I <i>do</i> understand the premise (mentioned many times in the comments here) that semantic CSS classes have somewhat limited value when you&#x27;re doing all your HTML via templating.<p>Are there CSS frameworks that help with responsiveness, and work well with templating, but are designed to work exclusively with SASS&#x2F;SCSS and not leave utility classes visible in the compiled CSS? Preferably something that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> start with &quot;let&#x27;s make h1 and p and ul all completely unstyled&quot;, and instead has reasonable defaults that let HTML work like HTML?')
