If it is really all undamaged high quality clothing it could be more than $1 a lb, but generally what is sold in these big bales is a combination of it not being worth the time to sort and sell, and being damaged and not desirable. What isn&#x27;t sold is recycled into rags, or sometimes sent overseas where the labor costs and incentives are different.')
