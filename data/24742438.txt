No mention there, or in these comments, about using split boards vertically- I adopted this two years ago and won&#x27;t go back. It&#x27;s trivial to strap a split board to a box of approximately shoulder width. The result suits me best - forearms and hands stay vertical in the handshake position. I don&#x27;t understand why more people don&#x27;t try it.')
