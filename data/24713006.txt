Rather, some people are always trying to organise collective action, management usually calls their bluff, and the striking employees end up coming back to work or being replaced. When they can&#x27;t be replaced easily or they have alternatives to coming back to work, management is forced to the negotiating table.<p>There&#x27;s an alternative narrative where the government steps in and says hey, you have to allow unions. In practice, while some government support is necessary, this doesn&#x27;t seem to lead to powerful unions in the same way.')
