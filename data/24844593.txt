I&#x27;m curious how many people face the same pain point as I do and would even use my product as their solution.<p>I&#x27;m considering between building a landing page to collect emails and building an open-source project on Github to see its traction.<p>A landing page will take probably 1-2 days. Building a project will take a longer time - might take 3, 4 weeks to build something that is presentable - but I think it is easier for people to see how the product works and understand what it is trying to solve.<p>What do you think is a better approach?<p>On top of that, supposed I have talked to a few friends and they understand the pain point but are vague on whether they will pay for a solution, which approach (landing page or open-source project) should I use?')
