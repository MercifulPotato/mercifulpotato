But in practice, Doppler&#x27;s architecture implies a much larger degree of trust  (any server breach = secrets compromised) than EnvKey&#x27;s (servers can be fully breached and secrets still aren&#x27;t compromised). Doppler looks like a great product in many other ways, but I do think it&#x27;s important for users to fully understand the risks they&#x27;re taking.')
