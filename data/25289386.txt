And that those permissions somehow get propagated along with the data to third parties, who then also diligently segregate their data based on legal permissions?<p>It&#x27;s difficult to hold these companies accountable and even if you could prove they were misusing the data as an individual, it&#x27;s difficult to take legal action against them.  And even if you do manage to beat them in court, the compensation will almost certainly be a pittance - especially if you&#x27;re not covered under the GDPR.<p>Of course they&#x27;re not doing managing users&#x27; personal data responsibly!  Even with the GDPR, it&#x27;s still more lucrative to just not bother.')
