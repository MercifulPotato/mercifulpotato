I&#x27;m curious what your architecture&#x2F;design looks like and whether you ran into any sharp edges: ie is Web UI for a cloud platform really as simple as writing JS to call rest APIs?<p>Also, I&#x27;m wondering if the community has any other open source alternatives I could toy around with and peek under the hood.')
