Linux the OS may not be targeted, but Linux software like WordPress (and many others) is under constant attack. What is interesting is that the payload the hacker is trying to deliver often is not a rootkit - a bot node can run just fine as a user process on a Linux (or BSD) server. I&#x27;ve had to clean up: evil javascript injected into content, control servers for botnets, email relays, phishing farm software, chat servers and one time a whole CRM system. The one thing that was nice in every case was that Linux did a great job of isolating the hack to a single user&#x27;s files.')
