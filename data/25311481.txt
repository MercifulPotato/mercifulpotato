That presumably means 95% of the athletes had siblings.<p>Using 1999 data [1], 52% of US families had no children, 20% had one child, 18% had two children, 7% had 3 children, and 3% had 4 or more children.<p>That means that of children who had siblings in 1999, at least 59% had at least one older sibling, and at most 41% were the oldest sibling. If position within multi-sibling families was independent of chances of becoming a great athlete, we would expect great athletes to be more likely to be younger siblings simply because there are more younger siblings.<p>If we toss only children athletes in with the oldest child athletes from multi-child families, it doesn&#x27;t make much difference because with only 5% of athletes being only children there simply aren&#x27;t enough to tip the balance. It only brings it down to 56% have at least one older sibling, 44% do not have an older sibling.<p>This suggests that a better question would be &quot;Why are only children less likely to become great athletes?&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aspe.hhs.gov&#x2F;report&#x2F;trends-well-being-americas-children-and-youth-2000&#x2F;pf-21-percentage-families-children-and-distribution-families-number-children" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aspe.hhs.gov&#x2F;report&#x2F;trends-well-being-americas-child...</a>')
