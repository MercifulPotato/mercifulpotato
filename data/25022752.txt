Item(by='xenocyon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604807483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25019441, text='Since this isn&#x27;t explicitly clarified in the article, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that THD (or THD+N for that matter) is not always a helpful spec to compare two amps. You can easily have two amps where the one with the worse THD is actually the superior one because its distortion is in low-order even harmonics, while the nominally lower THD amp has more distortion in odd or higher-order harmonics. The distribution of distortion over harmonics is as important as the raw sum. (For the layperson who doesn&#x27;t care about the math: this is why tube amps sound good even when their nominal THD spec may be higher than low-end solid-state amps.)')
