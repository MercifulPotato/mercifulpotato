The violence in each case is disturbing to me, in different ways and for different reasons.<p>I&#x27;m merely trying to sort out why the response to, and consequences of, the violence of one side seems so disproportionate to that of the other side, seeing as we both seem to agree violence is harmful to a civil society.<p>So far, the only answer I can discern essentially comes down to &quot;because I agree with my side more than yours&quot;, in which case, the side with the bigger mob will always win, rather than an honest discussion of ideas.<p>Even if you disagree, if you set aside your hostilities and assume I say this in good faith for just a moment, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great of a stretch to see why this would be confusing.')
