I own a leaf and have been following the whole situation since it launched. They required every dealership to install chargers. Most have moved them to the corner of the lot in protest b&#x2F;c people just charge and leave.<p>One of the issues with electrics is that they need almost no maintenance. Dealerships don&#x27;t make money on sales. So it didn&#x27;t take long for the Nissan dealers to put two and two together. Fortunately, they are contractually bound to support the chargers at this point.')
