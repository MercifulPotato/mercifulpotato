In the case of food I guess there&#x27;s some shared responsibility. The customers of course have a lot of choice here, but the manufacturer still optimizes for tastiness (increasing consumption) without necessarily optimizing for healthiness. That could also be considered a design defect.<p>Perhaps for an owned autonomous vehicle the equivalent shared responsibility would be a user-selectable conservative (&quot;comfort&quot;) vs. aggressive (&quot;sporty&quot;) driving style. Or the option to drive yourself and only let the software intervene if it thinks what you&#x27;re doing is unsafe.<p>So, back to the question<p>&gt; We don&#x27;t really see consumer-facing products that, even if used as directed, kill a fair number of people and we just go oops.<p>The only very nebulous other case that comes to mind are unsafe computer systems in general. When a hospital or critical infrastructure gets hacked then this is treated almost like an unavoidable natural disaster rather than the responsibility of the operator or manufacturer.')
