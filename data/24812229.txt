I&#x27;d add that one of the biggest problem with free speech currently is that we allow actors to speak and publish content that we don&#x27;t even know are real Citizen of the US. And we allow people to speak and publish content at scales that are unprecedented.<p>I think this is a big issue that somehow people don&#x27;t talk about as much. It isn&#x27;t free speech that&#x27;s so much being attacked, more so we are trying to define the framework of free speech on the internet.<p>There is one perspective that could say the internet is like anything else, and so free speech applies the same. Except the internet isn&#x27;t like anything else. It hides people behind anonymity, it allows actors that arn&#x27;t american or even real to present themselves as if they were and speak to US affairs. It makes it trivial to decimate false claims to a greater audience at almost no cost. And the platforms of information built around it have designed automated systems to burry high quality discourse and instead promote sensational headlines.<p>To me, this is similar to problems of spam, phishing, fraud and abuse that say Amazon faces on its store front, like counterfeit, fake reviews, bot accounts, money laundering, etc. Democracy on the internet faces similar problems of fraud and abuse. And just like Amazon needs a framework to mitigate those fraud and abuses, our democracy needs it as well.')
