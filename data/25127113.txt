What&#x27;s their moat?<p>I recently rented a house for a weekend which was listed on both AirBnB and VRBO. I looked at both listings to get a more thorough feel for reviews etc. After a few days of contemplating whether to select this particular property, I ended up booking it on VRBO and I don&#x27;t think there was even a reason why I picked one site over the other. If a butterfly had flapped its wings in China I&#x27;d have picked AirBnB.<p>I don&#x27;t recall the user experience being much different on either site, and it seems like any property these days gets listed everywhere, so why is this particular market and AirBnB in particular such a darling?')
