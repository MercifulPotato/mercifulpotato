Get advice from a variety of people with different styles&#x2F;backgrounds then process that to make your own decisions. Even the most amazing investor will give advice that is wrong for you at times. Great investors respect that.<p>My other additional advice for founders is get support from other entrepreneurs at a similar stage - that peer support is super helpful especially on bad days!')
