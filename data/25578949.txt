Savings accounts also give 0 interest, and most Americans aren’t dumping their earnings into equities. Most Americans can’t buy a home either, so no real estate investment. Wages are not correlating to inflation either, so that fact is particularly hilarious too.<p>So, case study, Uber&#x2F;Lyft fucked drivers out of employee status, thus fucking the need to offer a retirement fund. Real piece of shit companies. Hopefully those people can store their money in a 0 interest rate Savings account, or get smart and dump their entire diddly squat income into AAPL for decades (you know lock up their capital and live frugally). This stuffs gonna come back on us if we’re doing this across industries.<p>There is no retirement, there is only social security realistically speaking for the majority.<p>It is what it is. Gotta love the new gig economy too, those people are truly fucked. Everyone’s going to work until they die basically. We see that current retirement age generation is fixated on social security&#x2F;medicare (literal single issue voters, don’t touch their retirement cash flow), but I don’t think anyone in Gen X&#x2F;Millennial&#x2F;Z realizes just how much more obsessed they will all be about those two funds going forward. You’ll have three generations that will literally only care about that, just like their grandparents before them.<p>Oh, and it’s going to be three generations worth of old people that will need a massive fund to finance all of those social security checks because we fucked them out of realistically keeping up with inflation.')
