MEPs sit as members of national political parties; the European Council are heads of national governments.<p>Passing the buck to the EU is a weak position, and in general a mistruth.<p>There aren&#x27;t many issues divides nations in the EU from each other - most, if not all, decisions that the EU takes have divisions within nations (between the political groups), not without (between national groups).<p>You can argue that &quot;blame the EU&quot; is a position that the UK government has taken successfully - continually blaming the EU for any problems that they have created themselves (sometimes blaming the EU despite incompetently avoiding the EU&#x27;s clear recommendations).<p>But, now that the UK has left the EU, they don&#x27;t have anyone left to blame for their own poor planning and decisions. We&#x27;ll see how that pans out.')
