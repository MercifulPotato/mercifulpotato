Item(by='timr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610679805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25773675, text='&gt; One is a post-epidemic estimate by independent epidemiologists, while the other is a confirmed-positive-death count subject to contemporaneous political pressure and institutional inability to confirm every Covid death.<p>...as well as almost certain over-counting due to extremely liberal criteria for &quot;Covid deaths&quot; (e.g. deaths within 30 days of a positive test, which is the standard in many areas.)<p>Point being: there&#x27;s uncertainty on the &quot;confirmed-positive death count&quot; in <i>both directions</i> and you&#x27;re assuming that it&#x27;s a strict lower bound.<p>Just today, the WSJ published an excess-death study that put the number at 2.8M, worldwide (or 3.5&#x2F;10,000):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;the-covid-19-death-toll-is-even-worse-than-it-looks-11610636840" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;the-covid-19-death-toll-is-even...</a><p>Higher than the JHU numbers, but still within reasonable statistical error of the 1957 pandemic estimates.<p>&gt; After a couple years once experts have had time to gather and crunch the numbers, the number of Covid deaths from a comparable kind of best-guess estimate is going to double or more. Even in the USA, we are probably missing on the order of 150â€“200k Covid deaths so far from our confirmed death counts.<p>Well, now you&#x27;re just making things up. Also, again: see the WSJ study above. Even if you count <i>every excess death</i> this year as Covid...it&#x27;s about the same as the 1957 flu season.')
