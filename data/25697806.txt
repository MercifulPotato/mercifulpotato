Banned people generally tend to be outraged regardless of the circumstances. There&#x27;s plenty of night clubs, but every person that I&#x27;ve ever seen getting thrown out of one was pretty mad, even if they were completely wasted and tried to get into a fistfight with the bartender. There are real alternatives to existing social media platforms, they&#x27;re a click away. It&#x27;s not clear to me at all what coercive power is being exercised here.<p>Keep in mind that a company having large market share does not imply they hold that position undeservedly. You actually need to show that this is the result of exercising market power, not consumer choice.')
