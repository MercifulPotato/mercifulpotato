Item(by='1_player', descendants=None, kids=[25147953], score=None, time=1605779105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25147709, text='I&#x27;ve been playing Ultimate Doom again and it&#x27;s incredible how tight the experience is, the level design, the difficulty progression (of course I&#x27;m playing in Ultra Violence). I&#x27;m using the GZDoom frontend and I didn&#x27;t have to configure it either, it automatically detected the WADs from the GOG installation folder.<p>I am _really_ enjoying it, even though I did play it in my teenage years already. Stoked to play Doom II for the first time when I&#x27;m done.')
