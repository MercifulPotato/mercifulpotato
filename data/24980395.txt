It reminds me of a throwback to 90s era RADs that wanted to encompass everything for everyone without really having clear intent or at least a platform company backing them to snare enough users to become a new platform.  Sometimes there are gems in the rough in things like that like Delphi, and I don&#x27;t mean to dismiss any of the ideas or dreams, but IMO platform companies are going to continue to monopolize the language space (for instance, I see great irony in they are using .NET because Microsoft basically does what they are trying to do).  So that&#x27;s why I bring up Delphi above, it seems this could be an opinionated framework on top of a .NET language instead of yet another language?')
