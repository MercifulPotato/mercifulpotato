Ingalls, the main programmer of Smalltalk-72, created The Lively Kernel and the Smalltalk Zoo site.  It&#x27;s great to see him continue his work.<p>I think that Lively Kernel has <i>huge</i> potential to influence the current web.  When you consider something like how this site (HN) operates, and could be implemented using something like the LK, perhaps we can start programming interactive systems better than we do.<p>Note that the Lively Kernel dates from 2007 (!) -- development continues to be supported by the Hasso-Plattner institute in Potsdam, Germany.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lively-next.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lively-next.org&#x2F;</a>')
