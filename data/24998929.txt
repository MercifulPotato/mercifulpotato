Industrial processes widely used today are based on fossil fuel (natural gas or coal). There is some research on electrolysis, but this process is not an easy one either: you have to heat oxides up to 1600 C, apply electricity, extract resulting iron, cool it down, powder it. Each step takes energy, so I guess the 80% are only for the electricity part, without accounting for other required steps.<p>And how do they get the 40% round-trip efficiency? Even if we assume the 80%, modern gas turbines have efficiency of up to 38%. In complicated combined cycle mode plants efficiency can be boosted up to 60%. And it is natural gas, a very convenient fuel to work with.')
