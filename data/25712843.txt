These types of governments have the commonality that they tightly control speech and thought.<p>This is all personal as a relative in my wife&#x27;s side of the family spent half his life in the gulag for having the audacity to suggest Stalin was not a good guy to his drinking buddies (who turns out are the ones that reported him).<p>If you&#x27;re on the left (or right), please do some soul searching on this topic. Also consider that it might not be your guy&#x2F;gal&#x2F;party who decides what speech is appropriate (and it&#x27;s a constantly moving target). And in the age of the internet archive, anything you&#x27;ve written in the past is&#x2F;will be open season. That&#x27;s pretty scary, at least for me.')
