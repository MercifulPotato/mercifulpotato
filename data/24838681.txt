Now those low margin SoC providers are selling a billion chips a quarter and financing a manufacturing behemoth that intel can&#x27;t keep up with. Same thing with IBM,  porting zos&#x2F;ztpf&#x2F;aix&#x2F;i5&#x2F;etc to x86 and making servers wasn&#x27;t something they could justify, so they spun the business off to lenovo which grew it 5x, and now IBM is stuck with hardware they can&#x27;t get enough volume on in a shrinking (but high margin!) business.<p>If they were selling POWER10 blue pi&#x27;s for $50 they might have a chance in the edge space or IoT, but that might cannibalize the business elsewhere.')
