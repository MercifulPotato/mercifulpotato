The concept is that militias are necessary for the defense of a free state - and the defense of the people from the state. Bear in mind that the US Constitution was written two hundred years ago and the US didn&#x27;t even have a standing army, and the Second Amendment&#x27;s primary purpose was to prevent the need for one.<p>This has led to a cultural belief within the US that the government&#x27;s fear of its own armed populace is the only thing keeping it from degenerating into tyranny, and the establishment of the &quot;militia patriot&quot; as something of a romantic folk hero like the cowboys of the Wild West.')
