That and the fact that due to data being very cheap most users will install all kinds of software that again collects data. Privacy laws in India are non-existent. FOSS doesn&#x27;t solve that unless FOSS  from private companies is also audited and the data being collected is clearly explained to the consumers and they are made aware of it.')
