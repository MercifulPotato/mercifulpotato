Not saying that they aren&#x27;t performant, but we need to say how and where pretty clearly.<p>For example, Spark makes it clear that its performance comes from exclusively in-memory compute across a cluster.<p>Spark may also be &quot;good enough&quot; from a performance standpoint for many use cases. New tools can get adoption among small players only if they are radically easier to use and deploy.')
