There are people on here seeming to argue that parler was booted “because of TOS violations” which they clearly were not. The winds changed direction and it became expedient to boot them, TOS rules don’t enter into the equation.<p>But the platforms aren’t being honest about this – they’re claiming that it was about terms of use violations.
