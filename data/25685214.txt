I have a PhD in Math and also the ~60% of a major in Physics.<p>I usually recommend to attend the classes in a university, but sometimes if you have a family and a full time job it is very difficult. (That&#x27;s the reason of my missing 40% major in Physics.)<p>Many universities have the material for the classes online, so you can try to study it. Don&#x27;t skip the initial classes for Classic Physics, they are important to understand how the Physicist think. Also, don&#x27;t skip the Math classes, because Quantum Mechanics without Math is only unintelligible handwaving.<p>So, assuming you can&#x27;t study Physics full time, this is a 5 year project. It&#x27;s not easy, it&#x27;s not short, but it is a fun one.<p>(There are also some crash curses that teach directly the &quot;important&quot; facts about Quantum Mechanics. I always think they are just a collection of rules that seam arbitrary unless you learn also all the other 90% part that is not in the  curses.)')
