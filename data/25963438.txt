The specific claim in this comment is one that is being made at &#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets, among many others. Over there, users seem to delight in repeating statements like this and not providing any supporting evidence or adding their own arguments. I think being an echo chamber is meant to be part of the fun of that subreddit at this moment.<p>But why do this on HN also? I can only guess that the users here are personally invested in GME and are hoping to increase their own profits by spreading the word and convincing more investors to join in with them. If this is the case, it seems to be at odds with how Hacker News is generally used and I am surprised to see it being tolerated so much by the administrators.')
