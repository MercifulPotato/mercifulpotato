People would hire private security to perform the security tasks they need, just like multinationals do in third world countries. If you don&#x27;t want that to happen, one has no choice but to restrict the freedom of at least one market. (The market for mercenaries.) Some countries go further and restrict other markets, for example the markets for weapons. It does not make any sense to call gun control a free-market mechanism, that&#x27;s just not the right use of the term.')
