But a small reminder that conspiracy theory doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about the truthfulness, e.g. that the Iraq War was based on made-up evidence was a conspiracy theory.<p>I think that&#x27;s interpreting the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; more broadly than it&#x27;s typically used.  IMHO, colloquially it pretty much only refers to outlandish theories, based little to no actual evidence, and usually requiring a conspiracy so impossibly large and impossibly well executed that it beggars belief.<p>I don&#x27;t think the idea that Jack Ma is being targeted by the CCP is just a plausible theory, not a conspiracy theory (in the colloquial sense).  You have a group with the motive, means, and MO to do so, you just need to find the proof.')
