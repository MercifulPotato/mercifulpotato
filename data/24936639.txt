I use one for work and seriously considered buying one privately.<p>Pros:<p>- It doesn&#x27;t have the new square styling I find ugly<p>- The trackpad is reasonably sized<p>- It already has the force touch trackpad<p>Cons:<p>- The bezels are looking a bit thick nowadays (though not preposterously so)<p>- The processor is getting a bit slow for heavy tasks<p>- It can&#x27;t output 4k@60hz via HDMI (only realized that one recently)<p>- It doesn&#x27;t have USB-C<p>This model with upgraded internals, ports (and upgradability, come on) would be a <i>very</i> solid offer.')
