Whether it’s good or bad, if your management are doing their job, everyone who needs to know about it should have known when it became relevant, not on the anniversary of your employment.<p>I suspect there is more value in some types of regular but short technical meeting at the moment, when many colleagues aren’t in close proximity at work and ad-hoc informal discussions are less likely to serve the same purpose. But as someone who’s primarily worked from home for years, I’d usually still prefer to arrange a group call or physical meeting with whoever actually needs to be there when there’s something specific to discuss, rather than assuming in advance that any particular tempo will be the right one.')
