Item(by='breck', descendants=None, kids=[25455731, 25453702], score=None, time=1608186745, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25451050, text='I&#x27;ve wondered this for nearly 20 years.<p>I think it&#x27;s for 3 reasons:<p>1) most people get their information from media sources that profit from copyrights.<p>2) academics profit from copyrights.<p>Therefore little research is done to showing how copyrights and patents are bad for equality and the economy, and the work that is done receives little to no attention in the media (which doesn&#x27;t want to go hunting for new business models to replace their current profits)<p>3) The industry has done a great job at marketing copyrights and patents as intellectual &quot;property rights&quot;, even though it is in fact the exact opposite of property rights (property rights and copyrights&#x2F;patents are logically incompatible). You have to hand it to them, dishonest but effective.<p>How do you solve this?<p>1. You need to reach a large number of people via channels outside the copyright driven media (and we have that now—twitter!)<p>2. You need research and data that shows how bad these things are (and we have that now—the China miracle; the open source revolution; the research revolution powered by scihub; the horrific track record of patents in medicine)<p>3. You need to start effectively marketing to the people and change the perception of these laws. Someone on HN brought up the term &quot;Imaginary Property&quot; as an alternative to &quot;Intellectual Property&quot;. I think it&#x27;s catchy and will grow.<p>My estimate is abolishing copyright and patents would be worth $100,000+&#x27;s for every person in America. I think it would be the single best thing we could do for our educational, healthcare, and media systems. I think the time has finally come when we can start spreading the word.')
