My group&#x27;s having a blast, and we&#x27;ve come to rely on all that healing to push our luck: jumping into more dangerous encounters, building our characters more for story and less for optimization, being able to play even when two of the five can&#x27;t make it (usually the healer).  If imagine newer players also need that healing, even when they&#x27;re trying their hardest.<p>That&#x27;s not to say you&#x27;re wrong for not liking 5e.  If it&#x27;s too easy for you, then it&#x27;s too easy.  You could try to account for that by using tougher or more monsters, but that makes balancing encounters harder for the DM.')
