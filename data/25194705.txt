Item(by='baryphonic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606185752, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25193867, text='&gt; I totally agree with you, but I think the clear implication of baryphonic&#x27;s comment is that the State of CA was being &quot;authoritarian&quot; here by denying the permit, as opposed to the sheriffs dept.<p>I&#x27;d argue that the state is slightly authoritarian by allowing local officials such discretion, but that&#x27;s more a matter of taste. However, if I was arrogant enough to think the Bay Area, LA and San Diego were representative of the entire state in terms of their approach to gun permits and this is actually not the case, then I apologize.<p>&gt; Which, I&#x27;d point out, doesn&#x27;t make much sense given that it is in fact the State of California which is bringing the charges against these people in the sheriffs dept for demanding bribes in exchange for a constitutionally protected government service.<p>Interesting framing. But the people who should have been entitled to these services and were coerced into paying bribes are also facing charges. The state&#x27;s foremost goal appears be defending its own authority zealously, and worrying about things like legal rights after the dust settles.')
