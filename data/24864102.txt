Generally, consumers don&#x27;t even notice the change until the file the taxes for the year.<p>Businesses have had low taxes since the Reagan administration, albeit brief periods of higher taxes during the Clinton and Obama administrations. Notably, business investment was at its highest levels during those periods of high taxes, and the economy grew at its highest rates since the post-WWII reconstruction era. During the periods of low taxes, US businesses actually accelerated off-shoring labor to foreign facilities, and the decline of Detroit and the Rust Belt can be directly correlated with the Reagan tax cuts.')
