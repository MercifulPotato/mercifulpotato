This is because the support people keep an eye out on upselling, maintaining subscriptions, and promoting consulting work. We&#x27;re not obnoxious about it, but there&#x27;s some awareness that part of the role of support is to promote the long-term growth of the customer relationship and sales.<p>I think if there was a stricter division between support and technical sales, there would be more of a temptation to focus on burning through support requests as quickly as possible. The flip side of this is that it is easy for us to get bogged down in a complex half-support half-sales opportunity situation and that can sometimes cause other support requests to fall through the cracks.')
