Its main competitors are idealism, dualism, and neutral monism, not &quot;mysticism&quot;.<p>And, materialism has no more physical evidence than its competitors do. Whatever observations materialists claim as &quot;evidence&quot; for materialism, advocates of competing theories will say that those observations are just as compatible with their own theory as with materialism. If competing theories can explain these observations just as well as materialism can, then those observations turn out not to be evidence for materialism at all.')
