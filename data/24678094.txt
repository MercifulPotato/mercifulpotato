I was forced to change orientation and I chose electronics&#x2F;ICT because &quot;I spent a lot of time on the computer (playing games)&quot; and that was the only computer-related orientation that was available. That year I discovered C++ and labview, figured out programming machines was my thing, suddenly passed all classes without having to study.\nAround that time (circa 2004-5) I got hold of those Ubuntu disks, messed up my only desktop machine trying to install it (wiped drives, broken Xorg, that kind of stuff), learned a lot trying to get everything back up and it snowballed from there.<p>Fast forward a few years to college, still passing classes without studying because I had to &quot;understand it&quot; instead of &quot;study it&quot;. Moved on from Ubuntu to Gentoo and learned a lot more.<p>Fast forward 12 years and now I&#x27;m a freelance backend&#x2F;devops guy working mostly for healthcare companies, trying to use my skills for good after I got sick of money-chasing in ad-tech companies.<p>Also, I was really lucky to have a couple of good senior mentors during my first 5-7 years of working. (Thanks @gbin if you ever read this). Now I&#x27;m mentor to some junior devs.<p>In hindsight, flunking all those classes in high school due to lack of interest was necessary for me to discover my true calling.')
