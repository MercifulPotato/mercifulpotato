Her main symptom was coughing up lots of bloody mucous. She said her doctors didn&#x27;t know what to make of her. She was tested her for SARS-CoV-2 when the test became available (February?). The test came back positive, and she was better by March.<p>I just retweeted Dr. Fiegl-Ding&#x27;s tweet about this story. There should be more discussion of #earlycovid (cases of COVID-19 before the pandemic was declared). <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TaxiCabJesus&#x2F;status&#x2F;1333627148607766528" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;TaxiCabJesus&#x2F;status&#x2F;1333627148607766528</a><p>Lots of other comments on Dr. Ding&#x27;s tweet are of anecdotes of experiences of #earlycovid, or about people who they think had #earlycovid.<p>Question: if COVID-19 was everywhere in the world before the pandemic officially started, what are the implications for the efforts to &quot;contain&quot; the virus? Should we not declare a cease-fire?<p>Question: Is there any point in getting the vaccine if you&#x27;ve probably already had COVID-19?<p>Quesiton: What is a better hashtag for efforts to falsify the Covid-19 narrative?<p>[0] quick-check line, woman in front of me came back with whatever she went back for. Me: &quot;Ma&#x27;am, I&#x27;m so sorry for invading your safety bubble.&quot; Her: &quot;don&#x27;t worry about me, <i>I&#x27;ve already had it.&quot;</i>')
