I would argue it&#x27;s actually worse to begin with because of the decoupled nature of the services. You have to build tooling to monitor traces across services or cross-system health\n * Any &#x27;well-designed&#x27; system will solve these problems. A monolith with good tooling and monitoring will be more easily understood than a poorly designed event-based system.\n * I think metrics and monitoring are really the key to knowing about a system, regardless of the architecture.<p>Basically, I think you can remove your first sentence and leave the last to make a truer statement. A great system should have design considerations and tools to make it understood at various scopes by various people of various skills. I think people have falsely conflated event-based architecture with systems health due to having to rewrite a system almost from scratch, which results in better tooling since it&#x27;s something you&#x27;re thinking about actively.')
