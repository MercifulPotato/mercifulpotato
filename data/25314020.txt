A few countries paying low support had money to do more. Blaming that just on long lockdown is missing all the other possible solutions.<p>As for the effect on mortality of the lockdowns themselves, it will be interesting to look at Australia in a few months where the infections stayed relatively low, but lockdown lasted months. Especially comparing Vic to NSW.')
