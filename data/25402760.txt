YouTube is run by Susan Wojcicki who&#x27;s a woman at Google and thus untouchable. She&#x27;s repeatedly imposed her own left wing views on it despite this obviously attracting severe and negative attention from the ruling parties at the time, despite there being no obvious business case for it and despite many of her mandates making no sense and being unenforceable. &quot;Anything that disagrees with the WHO&quot; was an especially idiotic one because the WHO routinely disagrees with itself.<p>Basically, the reason this thread is about YouTube and not Google is because Google now has weak and basically absent CEO leadership, so it&#x27;s split into fiefdoms where different moral standards apply. Chrome is content neutral, Gmail too, Android mostly but a bit less so and YouTube is flat out &quot;if you aren&#x27;t like Ms Wojcicki you&#x27;re immoral and should be banned&quot;. A strong CEO would sort it out so things are at least consistent but Pichai is useless, he seems to spend his time doing whatever he thinks will get him shouted at the least.')
