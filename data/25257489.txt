Levinthal (who postulated an early and easily refutable model of protein folding) was funded by NIH for decades.  Most of the competitors at CASP are supported by NIH and its investments have contributed to the modern results significantly.<p>That said I think the academic and pharma communities had engineered themselves into a corner and weren&#x27;t going to see huge gains (even thogh they are exploring similar ideas) for a number of banal reasons.')
