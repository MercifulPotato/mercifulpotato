They are therefore being mis-educated to the degree that their CS program agrees with Dijkstra&#x27;s philosophy.  (Which doesn&#x27;t mean that Dijkstra is wrong about CS.  It just means that a CS degree shouldn&#x27;t be the passport to a career in software engineering, or even a job as a grunt programmer.)')
