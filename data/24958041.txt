The UI supports a dark mode.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would want to use the original desktop Anki, which chains you to a PC or laptop. Though in the pre-mobile-computing era, such a program would have been attractive.<p>This technique begs to be mobile, so you can do reviews in any occasion when you would be otherwise idly waiting for something, like standing in line somewhere. Buses, trains, planes, waiting rooms, washroom stalls ...<p>You can micro-review. If you have just a few seconds to spare, you can whip out your phone and just do one review and put it away. That&#x27;s one less to do later.<p>I sometimes do AnkiDroid reviews lying down in bed, before sleeping. You can turn of screen rotation and work sideways.<p>I&#x27;ve woken up in the middle of the night and completed the last few reviews of the day. That&#x27;s possible from having the phone near the hand; no way would I get up, and sit at a desktop PC to do that, or even laptop.<p>The desktop Anki is completely pointless except for (1) serving as the reference implementation and (2) certain complicated maintenance tasks on large decks.')
