No one has unlimited capital for investment, so infrastructure companies will invest where they get the maximum returns. If they&#x27;re left to their own devices cities would get increasing fast internet, and everywhere else would be left stagnant. That drives more people to live in cities, which in turn makes rural economies fail. Then the people in cities start running out of food.<p>Slight reductio ad absurdum argument on my part there, but it&#x27;s just to illustrate the point. For a country to operate having significantly worse infrastructure in one place damages the entire economy. Infrastructure investment has to be managed carefully.')
