I don’t want to serve dinner with a pile of every dish that I touched during prep piled dirty in the sink. In an ideal scenario, after the last course is placed on a serving dish, I have exactly two things left to clean; the pan that cooked that last thing, and the utensil used to transfer it.<p>On a truly good night, the kitchen ends up cleaner by the time dinner is cooked than when I started.<p>Often the first thing I do before cooking a meal is some cleanup.<p>OK, I’ve abused this metaphor enough now. Thank you for that one!')
