One day it suddenly started indicating left at an intersection when I was going straight.  A car in the opposite direction was turning (their) left and almost hit me.  According to the other driver my bike started indicating (my) left as I neared the intersection so it looked entirely intentional.<p>Fortunately we both had left ourselves safety margins and had eye contact so we didn&#x27;t crash.  But add youth, testosterone and aggressive driving and that could easily have been a really dangerous misunderstanding.')
