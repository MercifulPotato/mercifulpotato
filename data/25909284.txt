Here&#x27;s an important slide:<p>&quot;Where will the next great programming language come from?<p>Academia? NO. No incentive to do engineering. Those that do are committing career suicide. Funding is drying up for fundamental research.<p>Industry? NO. Can’t fund anything that doesn’t have a return beyond a fiscal quarter. Incrementalism doesn’t move things forward.<p>Hobbyists? NO. No economic means. Modern implementations require multiple FTE and decades.<p>Will we just be stuck in a local maxima of Java for next 50 years?&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve personally attempted to create a sort of Manhattan Project of getting some top minds together in an off-site location to work on it in earnest.  (I&#x27;m not joking.  In 2018, I found a small 13-room hotel near Nice, France and made an attempt to get a bunch of us sequestered there for a year.  Alan Kay liked the idea, by the way.)<p>None of that is happening.  The sad truth is that the computer revolution isn’t even being worked on.')
