Generally in a legacy system we migrate by building all new features onto the new system. For instance, if the company wants to move their legacy jQuery based banking app to Vue.js, they can start by building a more orthogonal component in the new technology, so it doesn&#x27;t affect the other thing. Eventually once enough things have migrated (possibly years later), the benefits of the new system justify the cost of migration even more.<p>Stock of an existing company like GE is different than a company which is yet to launch (say Coinbase). The best way (perhaps the only way) to migrate is to start launching new IPOs on this new system. We did migrate from being on paper to computers, I&#x27;m sure we can do it again (and hopefully with better technologies in the future...again).')
