If you&#x27;re creating pixel art for a game, working on a &quot;retro&quot; computer might be more practical. E.g., if the software you&#x27;re using does everything you need, you get some nice benefits like fast startup time, often lower latency feedback, not having to worry about automatic updates rebooting your machine while you&#x27;re working on something, having a machine that&#x27;s much easier to understand&#x2F;modify to your needs, etc.<p>It may not be practical to have a &quot;retro&quot; computer as your <i>only</i> computer, but for certain tasks I can see them being <i>more</i> practical than a modern computer. And it&#x27;s honestly kinda sad that modern computers provide such a subpar experience in a lot of areas.')
