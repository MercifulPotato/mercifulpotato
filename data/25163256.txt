As another commenter pointed out - safe for children could be an issues where blackmail and extortion &#x2F; sextortion could be an issue -<p>for some parents, finding that on a PS3 while playing mine craft that another person created a giant penis on the screen would make that game &#x27;unsafe&#x27;. (I had that happen some years ago - had not idea what to say)<p>I&#x27;ve heard kids playing call of duty online that cussed and degraded people worse than some x-rated movies.. (and I&#x27;ve also played and heard a kid say &#x27;gosh darn it, they got me&#x27;.<p>anything with chat, anything with user generated content, can be abused to be &#x27;unsafe&#x27; in some ways - determining what level of outrage one could encounter &#x2F; and how uncomfortable one would be is a thing.<p>editing to add: what some others in the thread have mentioned about kill &#x2F; guns &#x2F; cops &#x2F; etc in some of the games are also a thing for some parents and &#x27;safety&#x27; - some might not see any of that in some games &#x2F; levels that people play in roblox and assume it&#x27;s not a thing.<p>I&#x27;d also mention some of my associates would have concern that some are based on things outside the game that may include certain levels of cross dress and other things.
