What if you die, or simply can&#x27;t afford to renew the domain well into the future? I know if I could look down from heaven after I die and saw someone re-registering my dropped domain, I would be furious!<p>Then there is the issue of even when you&#x27;re alive, you could simply refuse to renew for whatever reason and the domain is suddenly someone else&#x27;s.<p>MarkMonitor and Epik are the only companies that I know of that can safeguard against this. Epik has so called &#x27;forever domains&#x27; and ensure the domain stays active well into the future.')
