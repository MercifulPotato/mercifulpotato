The descendants of slaves are still owed for what we built with their ancestor&#x27;s labor. We still owe Chinese immigrants for exploiting them to build our railroads. We still owe the natives for murdering and enslaving them. There&#x27;s no separating race and class in america; we were explicitly built as a country with a formal racial hierarchy that formed the class strata we have now.<p>This is just to fend off class reductionism, which is counterproductive in our society.')
