However, I feel like server side languages still have a long way to go. Client-side languages in comparison have been only growing better (one could make a lot of negative points about TypeScript and node in general, but the ecosystem is a joy to work with). I feel like this is because people have accepted C and C++ with their respective pain points for close to 50 years now, because there really were no viable contenders. I like how this is starting to change.<p>I still feel Rust, Nim and Zig kind of get the right ideas, but they are not there just yet. I like rust with it&#x27;s expliciteness and correctness, but I wish some stricter features were opt-in. I do not feel that the borrow checker is the ultimate solution to safety problems. Its strictness can make working with Rust a pain. As the author demonstrates, sometimes you <i>know</i> what you want to do and how to write it in other languages, but it can take quite a while to get it down in such a way that the rust compiler will accept it.<p>I think enabling a language to be garbage collected in general, while making a borrow checker opt in for special, time critical functions is the best of both worlds. I also think Rust may focus a bit <i>too</i> much on the terseness of its syntax. This can make modern Rust hard to read because there are so many special tokens.')
