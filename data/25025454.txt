I just want to add some info how the install process ifself works so people get a better picture of it.<p>For the initial installation you actually have to set up the partitions and mounts inside the root filesystem manually similar to what you have to do to install Arch.<p>Then you run the install command. The install command sets up the system with a default (or customized) configuration and also  generates the hardware-configuration.nix file so that it matches the root filesystem you have set up before running the install command.')
