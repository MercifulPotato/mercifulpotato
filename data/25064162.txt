That has to make a huge difference in memory access time; it probably saves about a nanosecond in each direction just because it&#x27;s closer to the CPU. There&#x27;s probably other stuff going on like little or no microcode compared to the x86 ISA. So yeah, it&#x27;s plausible that the M1 is really faster in absolute terms than a desktop PC.')
