And the first thing angels do when they encounter humans is tell them not to be afraid, because of course the logical and proper reaction to skyscraper-sized interlocking, burning, eye-covered wheels with multi-faced, multi-winged beings in the middle is bowel evacuating terror.<p>And of course, many of Lovecraft&#x27;s eldritch horrors were simply aliens that were <i>so</i> alien that the mere sight of them broke human minds, and that were no more concerned for humanity than humanity is for a particular anthill.<p>That&#x27;s probably what an actual encounter with an alien is going to be like for us. We&#x27;ll try to understand why a living infinite-dimensional hypersphere made of flesh made of time whose eyes are our eyes all at once just showed up and &quot;unfolded&quot; our sun into a non-Euclidean shape we can&#x27;t even describe mathematically without being driven slowly to madness, while it won&#x27;t even know we were there.')
