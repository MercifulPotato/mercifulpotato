For me it seems, as traditional stock exchanges looks like in stone age compared to the crypto world, when I really need days to make the deal in the background. Also then I don&#x27;t understand how it needs one one side days to make the deal and on the other side there exist HF traders, who do many, some say as many as 1000 trades per second, maybe, I don&#x27;t know .., but  how does this work.<p>I remember some years ago, a normal banc transfer needed always 3 working days (so 5 over the weekend). Then came the crypto hype and the time dropped to less than a hour, even for normal people. I wonder if we see something similar here in future.<p>Also some crypto trading platforms, started to trade with stocks in different forms. I wonder how this will play out in future. I think traditional exchanges have to move forward fast now.')
