Humanity&#x27;s thirst for oil may never again return to prior levels.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s not what peak oil means.  Peak oil is exactly the opposite: when demand for cheap oil outstrips supply.<p>In this article they&#x27;re talking about there being more supply than demand: exactly the opposite of peak oil.<p>But, yeah, I guess if they redefine peak oil to mean what they want it to mean, they have a point.<p>Update:<p>I&#x27;ve thought about it some more, and I realized that what they describe <i>is</i> peak oil.  It&#x27;s not that the definition of peak oil has changed, but what counts as &quot;cheap&quot; has changed.<p>So there are really two ways to achieve peak oil.<p>The first way is for the definition of &quot;cheap oil&quot; to stay the same, but the supply of oil at that price level to permanently drop below the demand for oil at that price level.<p>The second way is for the definition of &quot;cheap oil&quot; to drop while supply at the previous price level stays the same.<p>The fact that &quot;cheap oil&quot; may be redefined shows that &quot;peak oil&quot; is a flexible concept, not something etched in stone.<p>When the price at which oil seems &quot;cheap&quot; rises, then the supply could still be there, and when that price falls then it&#x27;s no surprise there&#x27;s not as much of it any more.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m confused again?  What do you think?')
