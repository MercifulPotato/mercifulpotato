The only difference here is that the thief can re-sell it. That&#x27;s not a huge win for the user who it was stolen from.<p>With the latter, you need ongoing physical access in order to install and maintain a presence on the device. That&#x27;s a sophisticated attack, but sophisticated attackers already have ways of doing this.')
