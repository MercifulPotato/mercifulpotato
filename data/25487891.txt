That outcome was always inevitable, nothing could prevent it. Nations were never going to allow an unencumbered Internet or Web to remain in their territory.<p>If you think the Internet is geofenced now, just wait until you see what it looks like in another ten years. It&#x27;s going to get dramatically worse. It&#x27;ll be almost unrecognizable compared to the Internet of 2010. We&#x27;re only maybe 1&#x2F;3 the way to our fully balkanized destination.<p>There is also no going back. Governments now understand the technology and will increasingly tightly regulate it accordingly, no matter what it looks like or what it&#x27;s called. They no longer view it as a separate entity, they view it as falling under the same exact regulatory domain as everything else in the physical space that they claim dominion over.<p>If you have any business or development dreams you want to pursue on the Internet, do it as soon as possible, do not wait. The Internet and Web will only suck more in the future.')
