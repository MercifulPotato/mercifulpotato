They are trained to use less-lethals to outmanuever,  disperse and kettle crowds like this. They had advance warning and could have dispersed the early crowds. It was just this past summer that Trump had a crowd near the White House dispersed with tear gas to give a speech where he held a Bible upside down.<p>But when the time came today, there were no tear gas or 40mm rounds, no LRAD. The security simply didn&#x27;t show up when the expected crowd was percieved to be aligned with the police.<p>This is a consistent pattern throughout our law enforcement system.')
