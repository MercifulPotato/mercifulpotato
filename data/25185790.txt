Item(by='crispyambulance', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606132667, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25175138, text='There&#x27;s a common processing step in PCB manufacturing that occurs right after SMT (reflow soldering of components that have been placed on the PCB by a pick-and-place machine). It is known as AOI (automated optical inspection).<p>What happens during AOI is that a camera images every part of the PCB and then uses old school machine vision to identify problems like missing&#x2F;misplaced&#x2F;misoriented components, wrong parts, solder mishaps, and contamination&#x2F;foreign-objects. In practice, it&#x27;s not perfect, but it can detect gross problems and is valuable in high-volume or high-cost pcb&#x27;s. The images are usually not stored, but processed &quot;on the fly&quot; by machine vision applications.<p>It&#x27;s good to hear that Alitheon is taking this to the next level. As a MFG engineer, I&#x27;ve long felt that AOI has been under-utilized. There are multiple reasons to more fully analyze these images besides security concerns and given the low cost of storage, I think it&#x27;s becoming not unreasonable to store entire imagesets of individual high-cost PCB&#x27;s for the life-span of the product.<p>As for the big-picture of security, however, it really begins earlier in the supply chain before the components even arrive at the factory in reels. By the time that something gets to a factory, one can&#x27;t do much more than read-out things like id&#x27;s and perform functional screens. That&#x27;s why manufacturers have, sometimes, long qualification processes before they even consider a new component or its vendor.')
