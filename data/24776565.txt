And will they tempt changes to the already mature interface of so many libraries like flask, django, numpy, pandas, tensorflow 2 making yet another way of doing stuff (since they can&#x27;t break all past code)?<p>And in general, non-lisp languages with macros like Elixir even recommend never using them until exhausting all alternatives. Macros always break expectations (if it didn&#x27;t you wouldn&#x27;t use them), compose poorly, hard to debug without adequate tools and requires a lot more documentation. Great for removing boilerplate though, which is my main usage.')
