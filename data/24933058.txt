The former can setup private repos on github or any other of fifty approaches. The later however just means you have a different set of single points of failure (mailing list, mailing list archives, domain for mailing list, SMTP server, etc.). Mailing lists may allow the latter to fall back to the former a bit more easily but it&#x27;s far from a clean transition. So they&#x27;re at best a very partial band aid for the underlying issues so provide little value versus building an actual solution (ie: over Tor, etc.).')
