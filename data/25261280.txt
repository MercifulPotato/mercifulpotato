I <i>almost</i> got through this with Python before some planned huge life change took over last year. I just couldn&#x27;t get the final bit figured out but maybe this is the universe telling me I should attempt debugging it again :). Plus, not 24h ago some Michael Abrash notes were featured here on HN.<p>For anyone curious, I implemented it at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skytreader&#x2F;praytracing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skytreader&#x2F;praytracing</a> in a way that&#x27;s Pythonic, more software engineer-y, with experiments on the code outlined in the comments. It also has no dependencies (save mypy) which means it could turn your computer to a radiator for a short while, perfect for winter.<p>(Also used it to benchmark and experiment with PyPy, but that&#x27;s another story.)')
