It would have ben a very scary time to be a police officer, the burning of the vehicles from 2:28 to 4:00 for example looks  a lot like a threat of violence. Those protesters wanted to hurt the police.<p>The US has a pretty high tolerance for violence in its protests. If anything, I&#x27;d guess that rather than attitudes of the protestors the lack of police deaths in the BLM protests were because the police knew that they were going to be targeted with violence, and it caught them off guard coming from Trump supporters.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MCPzQg3668g" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MCPzQg3668g</a><p>PS.
