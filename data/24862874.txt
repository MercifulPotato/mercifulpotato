If you &quot;reinvest&quot; in the company you give up all the proceeds you received to buy back the shares that you just sold to the company. But you&#x27;ve paid taxes as a result of the initial buyback so you have less money than you received to reinvest, and now presumably the shares are all more expensive as well. Your position is economically worse off if you reinvest than when you started, because you have the same amount of shares (or fewer) but paid some tax to get there.<p>With a dividend, you can keep the dividend, or buy <i>more</i> shares of the company or some combination of both. Your economic position is improved either way regardless of the amount of tax you pay.')
