Seems tough to pick between them. For me, the most important things are:<p>* Catchall\n* Multiple custom domains (Protonmail charges for each additional?)\n* Desktop app support (Protonmail has the bridge but apparently it doesn&#x27;t work all that well)\n* Easy (or at least reasonable) to import my email history from Gmail into the new provider either via Download-&gt;archive-&gt;Upload (Microsoft 365) or direct migration (Fastmail).<p>Argh.<p>This is an interesting nut to crack. I&#x27;d be willing to bet there&#x27;s a SaaS space here for someone who can figure it out.')
