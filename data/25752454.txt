But also:<p>- Email doesn&#x27;t retain context very well. If I dig back through my email I might have all of the emails in a thread, or maybe not.<p>- Likewise, I can&#x27;t send someone a link to a previous emailed conversation so it makes for poor documentation. I can forward an individual email, but not the comment in context.<p>- Email is not easy to index or post up for reference. You can&#x27;t link it from a wiki or other documentation for example.<p>An internal mailing list with archiving would solve many of these issues and might be the best option, but it&#x27;s a slightly different solution.')
