Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[24944233], score=None, time=1604071177, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24942924, text='&gt; What they&#x27;ve added is a rule to shut out QAnon.<p>This is true, but it overlooks the fact that it can be used to shut out a lot more than QAnon.<p>&gt; Which is the responsible thing to do.<p>That is a matter of opinion, not fact.  What QAnon &quot;is&quot;, is a matter of opinion, and each individual opinion is based on what the individual knows about QAnon.  Based on my experiences, most people&#x27;s perception of QAnon is derived from reading stories <i>about</i> QAnon in the media, and most every story I&#x27;ve ever read in the media seems far more like propaganda [1] than reporting well researched evidence.  This might not be so bad if people realized that this is the case, but from what I read on forums, most people seem to believe that these stories are ~purely factual (I imagine this is what they believe because it <i>seems</i> that way, because each new story is <i>cognitively evaluated within the context of current knowledge</i>, which is of course based on the prior consumption of such stories).<p>[1] Example: QAnon &quot;is&quot; [X], &quot;QAnoners&quot; &quot;believe(!)&quot; [X, Y, Z, etc], etc.  These are estimates, <i>at best</i>, due to the fundamental of the organization&#x2F;phenomenon (actually, such statements are <i>always</i> estimates, it&#x27;s just particularly difficult with things like QAnon, conspiracy theorists, supporters of a political party, etc - and also, there is <i>psychological motive</i> (often not even consciously realized) for <i>framing reality</i> in a certain way).  What QAnon&#x2F;QAnoners is&#x2F;are, <i>precisely&#x2F;comprehensively</i>, is <i>not known</i>.  The human mind often seems to not willingly accept the notion of unknowness, particular on certain classes of topics [2], which makes this sort of propaganda particularly potent.<p>[2] Replace QAnon in the above with &quot;Jews&quot; or &quot;Black people&quot;, and observe whether your mind processes the examples differently.  I find thought experiments like this to be quite an effective tool for checking whether one is biased when reading the news - I would think that if politicians and the media <i>really</i> cared about &quot;fake news&quot; as much as they breathlessly proclaim, we would have seen some organized public initiative for <i>actually teaching</i> the critical thinking skills we&#x27;re constantly told are needed.  But what we actually see is <i>the notion of critical thinking</i> being used as a psychological talking point in the overall, unseen meme war.  But then, has this not always been more or less the case throughout history?')
