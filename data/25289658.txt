I would add that UX-first _can be_ the start of the conversation in a larger context.<p>Yes there are things that can&#x27;t be done without a thorough review by an architect.  But some things can be worked around without drastically affecting the UX, and that context can help an architect find places to hide the slow parts and inconsistencies.<p>I agree with the underlying drive of this article.  The user experience is the most important part of what&#x27;s being built.  Where this article goes wrong is in assuming the UX is solely defined by the designers.  The architecture is just as much ux as the visual &#x2F; motion &#x2F; interactive design.<p>The design isn&#x27;t finished the day a system architect shows up to review it.  It&#x27;s just gotten started.')
