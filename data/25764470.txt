It used to be the &quot;install and forget about it&quot; option for backup and sync.  My daughter and wife have both had to get my help in the last year in regards Dropbox failing to sync, failing to work well with Windows in regards to more than one Microsoft account on the same computer, and otherwise requiring me to think about it in a way that I didn&#x27;t used to.  I am a paying customer, albeit probably a small one.<p>I also notice they now keep pestering to convert to the &quot;all cloud&quot; option rather than having a local copy of everything and just using the cloud as the backup and sync infrastructure.  It feels like they have shifted from the &quot;make it easy to become a paying customer&quot; model into the &quot;make it hard to stop being a paying customer&quot; model.  That&#x27;s not a great sign for growth.')
