As someone who has recently been weighing the pros&#x2F;cons of seeking treatment for ADHD, this has been one of the best points I&#x27;ve read on the potential downsides to it. Currently, in my career (software dev) I&#x27;ve been feeling increasingly burnt out and like it&#x27;s impossible to focus on anything. I have to sit back and ask myself, is the problem that I can&#x27;t focus, or is the problem that I&#x27;m doing something that I feel is meaningless?<p>If I got treatment for ADHD, maybe then I would be able to finally churn through all of my tasks and be a top performer in terms of closing stories. If I didn&#x27;t pursue treatment, then maybe I continue to be unable to focus and completely burn out, resulting in the loss of my job. Maybe after that I pivot my career to where I&#x27;m doing something that I find to be more fulfilling. What&#x27;s the better outcome?')
