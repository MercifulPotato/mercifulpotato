Has been around since March 2020, is a really neat place.<p>As for actuators, it’s either ERMs or incredibly odd things like friction&#x2F;pressure systems (some with fairly off kinematics, for instance <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patreon.com&#x2F;tempestvr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patreon.com&#x2F;tempestvr</a>) and electrostimulation. No LRAs yet, that’s why I’m trying to get to supporting the nintendo joycon and vr controllers, to start thinking about how signal generation should work in that context.<p>And yeah the top level library is incredibly generic, mostly to just get people using the library at all. I don’t know how long that’ll last, due to the complexity of actuators we’ll be dealing with, but I’ve got some strategies to grow that out a bit. Happy to go into those if you’re interested.')
