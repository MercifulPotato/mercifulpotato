How the authentication works depends on the service, and it needs to be done on a per-URL basis. The authentication protocol may return some kind of token or key needed to use with future requests. However what this is and exactly how it is used is service dependent (for example, it might be supplied verbatim in an auth header or it might be a signing key and it might even be salted with some credentials etc).<p>So challenge that is introduced is that you now have hidden state that is dependent on the public state but which cannot be computed by users of the client or the parent class. In fact, code in the parent class can&#x27;t even know ahead of time what state might be needed to be retained.<p>I am guessing you will probably be able to propose that authentication be supported by some kind of pluggable authentication interface, but it will still be difficult to deal with the hidden state without introducing assumptions about the auth protocol or the type &#x2F; nature of the state retained and without having that protrude into the parent interfaces.')
