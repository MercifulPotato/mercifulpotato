A lot of the time the reason mainstream media &#x27;fears&#x27; to publish stuff is because it&#x27;s total rubbish, after all.<p>Seems like this site&#x27;s cracked it though. Can&#x27;t think of any examples where an organization kills or &#x27;disappears&#x27; a journalist to try to prevent a story being written and it turns out there&#x27;s nothing to see or our sympathies should have been with the organization. And as editorial biases go, I&#x27;m very comfortable aligning myself with an editorial bias against the sorts of people who kill journalists.')
