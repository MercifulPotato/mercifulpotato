Lots of people say it on the net, but it&#x27;s not. If you want it in one sentence: The Swedish policy was to do the things that seemed helpful and people would accept and be disciplined about in the long term.<p>So no lockdown, for example, because Tegnell thought the Swedish wouldn&#x27;t be disciplined for more than a few weeks.<p>Feel free to criticise the Swedes, but please be accurate. Don&#x27;t attribute to Tegnell what some people on the net wrote.')
