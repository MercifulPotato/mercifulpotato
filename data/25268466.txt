And on servers I use Alpine. I don&#x27;t hate systemd as such but I definitely don&#x27;t like it. I think OpenRC on Alpine is much simpler.<p>The ship has only sailed for the mainstream Linux OSes. With Ubuntu for example other things bother me too, like snap, I don&#x27;t want all this overhead. But I see more and more people moving away from those things.<p>&quot;Giving in and going with the flow&quot; is not necessary with open OSes. It&#x27;s exactly why I&#x27;m moving off macOS too, because I&#x27;ll no longer be locked into some company that decides what&#x27;s best for them (and not me)')
