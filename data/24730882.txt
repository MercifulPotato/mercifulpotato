As such it&#x27;s not really a mental overhead, and definitely not the Rust way of doing error handling (in the same way than using &quot;assert&quot; and a signal handler is not the way you&#x27;re supposed to do error handling in C++).<p>The Rust way of dealing with errors is to return a Result&lt;&gt; and in my experience it&#x27;s the best system I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t have the code flow breaking aspect of exceptions while being a lot nicer and less error-prone than C or Go style error handling.')
