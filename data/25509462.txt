Stars do that because it&#x27;s easiest for our local thermal system. If you think we&#x27;re insignificant, don&#x27;t be horrified by particle beams in orbit around the Earth or the Sun, providing some form of local state, reducing our stellar system to a matter wave and the universe as its interference pattern.<p>Pretty soon, we might not have a choice. Blow up an incoming asteroid with the Sun like tinfoil in the microwave. Send some awful tumor far away from the observable universe. Heat your home by making everything that could ever exist say a once cold distant dark region of space is now a burning hot galaxy out of nothing. Make space travel more about manipulating the traveler than anything.')
