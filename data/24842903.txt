Examples here are:<p>- Real-Time Sys&#x2F;App Dashboards (e.g. Graphite) =&gt; Datadog<p>- Collaborative Source Control (e.g. trac, hgweb) =&gt; GitHub<p>- Team Chat &amp; Bots (e.g. IRC, ZNC, Hubot) =&gt; Slack<p>- App Error Tracking (e.g. Raven&#x2F;Sentry project) =&gt; Sentry<p>In this case, the category is:<p>- Internal Admin Interface (e.g. Django Admin) =&gt; Retool<p>Like all of the above categories, this category is obvious in retrospect.<p>Every SaaS product&#x2F;company I have ever worked on or advised has leveraged a Django admin interface. Or, the team wished it had one once they went into production with real users, if the technology choice _wasn&#x27;t_ Python&#x2F;Django.<p>If you have never personally experienced a the Django admin interface, you can read about it and see screenshots in this tutorial: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Learn&#x2F;Server-side&#x2F;Django&#x2F;Admin_site" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Learn&#x2F;Server-side&#x2F;D...</a><p>Essentially, it gives you a web-based interface, hooking into your existing user&#x2F;group authentication model, for inspecting (and even altering!) live production data by introspecting your &quot;Django Models&quot;. That is, your Python classes which represent your production SQL tables lead to (controlled!) admin interfaces that can edit those tables.<p>You can extend that admin interface using simple declarative configuration, such that you can build functional, SQL-aware tables and forms without writing a lick of UI code.<p>Based on the demo video, Retool is even more featureful than the Django Admin (although perhaps a little less extensible, since it isn&#x27;t based on an open source framework). But, for anyone thinking to themselves, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t I think of this?&quot; -- perhaps give some thought to the root problems beneath some of the open source tools you&#x27;re using today, that could perhaps be turned into a widely-applicable SaaS tomorrow.')
