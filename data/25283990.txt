With parametric typing you can bind the contained type early, rather then being bound through runtime indirections and checks like a dynamic type system, handles to another container, interface compatibility, or other such tricks.<p>That&#x27;s an important role, especially in performance-sensitive domains, but outside of that, it never seems to work very well, which makes it a easily misused feature in every language I&#x27;ve used that offers it. Go&#x27;s original design  basically took the form of offering this for the built-in structures but not letting you roll your own, ushering you towards interfaces if you really needed it, and because Go makes interfaces convenient, it mostly works.')
