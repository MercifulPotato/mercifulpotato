I won&#x27;t even try because the possibility of letting others down is paralyzing.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this is even something you can fix, but, there it is.  And maybe there are ways to handle this gracefully without me letting the rest of the party down. In that case, maybe this is a communication&#x2F;education problem.')
