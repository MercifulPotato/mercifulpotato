Some things just aren’t designed to meet security goals.  Telnet is plaintext, in most environments that’s a pretty bug security issue.  That’s not a bug in the code, it’s just not designed to protect the data from tampering, evasedropping and hijacking.  It just can’t operate any other way.<p>Configuration errors are security issues, but they are not bugs.  Users can setup up things insecurely.<p>Human beings present their own security issues, and they are definitely not bugs you can code away.<p>The biggest myth about software security is that’s it’s all just bugs.  This leads to after the fact thinking (well just patch it), and a huge blind spot to the fact that security isn’t something you can just build, it’s an entire process that goes way beyond just code.')
