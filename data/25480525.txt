They can be aggressively kind and generous. They are just aggressive.<p>I&#x27;m also in the tech industry, which seems to have a very aggressive and competitive culture.<p>It doesn&#x27;t stop me from being kind and courteous, but it gets grating.<p>My experience is that, when someone mistakes courtesy for weakness, they start trying to &quot;game&quot; me. I put up with it for a bit, until they push too far.<p>Then the till gets slammed on their fingers.<p>They get very, <i>very</i> upset. Far more upset than if I had just disabused them early on.<p>I&#x27;m learning to enforce my boundaries earlier. It doesn&#x27;t make me as popular, but it also prevents those &quot;psycho freakouts.&quot;')
