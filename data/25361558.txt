From what I know in Europe, you generally have to pay tax in the place where you reside more than 50% of the year (additional taxes may apply for secondary residences, but that&#x27;s very regional). It&#x27;s fairly common for a tax agency of one country to demand proof that you actually moved and physically reside in another country so that they don&#x27;t double-tax you, so you better have documented the travels between both countries and kept as many receipts as possible.')
