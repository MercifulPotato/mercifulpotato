No buzzing sound although if you listen very carefully there is a faint &#x27;thrum&#x27; when it is active.<p>Visual feedback is from a number (1..9) displayed per induction ring. There is also a per-hob &#x27;h&#x27; when it is off but still considered hot.  When you activate a hob you can start it at strength 4 (of 9) or 9 (full-on). Or 1 and keep pressing up or down buttons to the setting you want. I&#x27;m used to this now.<p>Cleanability is awesome. Because the whole surface is flat, unused rings can also be used as a heat-proof surface when you have lots of hot pans that would scorch a normal work-surface. I think it keep things warm (without sticking) better than gas because the heat is better distributed over the whole bottom of a pan.<p>Main downside is that it is useless in a power-cut.')
