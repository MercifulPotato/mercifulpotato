Since last year sharing a little office space with another GitLab employee. Think like an „external home office“, just the two of us in two rooms. Since about a month back at home because COVID.<p>2) No offices at all :)<p>3) Definitely easier. No commute, no office shenanigans. I dislike communal spaces because a lot of folks are not caring about them, but I DO care. In the office before I was one of the few who took care of the dishwasher etc. Now at least it’s just me and my mate.<p>Being back at home is a bit taxing, as I work from the kitchen. Hopefully lockdown is over soon and I can get back to my shared space.<p>4) pros: Nobody gets sick (COVID and colds). no times I have to be at the office. flexibility around doctors visits, shopping, etc. No noisy or smelly people around me.<p>Cons: have to be strict about my work hours not to overwork myself, For example separating work and private laptop. You have to have friends that you socialize with outside of work, or it can be lonely. I feel it is harder to train junior folks&#x2F;mentor folks.<p>5) You should have a separate Home Office. Get good equipment for the team. Webcams, mics, etc. you need decent Internet speeds. Make sure you stop working after X hours, start routines around it. e.g. go on a walk after you stopped for the day<p>6) yes. I believe almost anyone can work remotely, but it likely needs adjustments that are not always possible.')
