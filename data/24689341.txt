They often choose not to put in place strong policies governing ethical behavior, conflicts of interest, and pay equity between men and women, as well as practices that promote teamwork and encourage people to treat others with civility and respect. On the flip side, they also frequently fail to sanction employees when they violate these shared norms. In effect, people get rewarded for less ethical, less collaborative behaviors, Chatman says.&quot;<p>That is true for some narcissists. Now there is a new breed  of narcissists that use all of the above to strengthen their positions in companies without doing real work. And they are more ruthless than their predecessors, who often at least had a sense of humor.')
