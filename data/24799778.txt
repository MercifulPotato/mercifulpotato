Maybe not since all posts theoretically would be temporarily visible in those 15 posts at some point?<p>Won&#x27;t posts that encourage quick responses (clickbait, memes, controversial posts, etc) be bumped up much more frequently, thus making sure they are amplified more than other postings (while burying other posts)? Sure this might not be much of a problem on a site where you only are following a small number of people, but I find it hard to imagine it could translate to a larger site that inherently isn&#x27;t just you following a few friends (i.e. Reddit).')
