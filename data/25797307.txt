If you vote for this union, we will allow workers here to chose other unions. We will never get in the way of firing someone. We will never create job roles that don&#x27;t let workers move laterally or up. You can lay people off. We will not use our members money for political campaigns. Our workers can move into management without us freaking out.<p>We will advocate for more pay, benefits, productivity, and training.&quot;')
