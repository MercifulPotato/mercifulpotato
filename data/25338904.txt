I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and have never faced any discrimination that would warrant an interaction with the police.

From the LGBT rights in Florida wiki:<p>&gt;In addition, several cities and counties, comprising about 55% of Florida&#x27;s population, have enacted anti-discrimination ordinances. These include Jacksonville, Miami, Tampa, Orlando, St. Petersburg, and Tallahassee, among others. Conversion therapy is also banned in a number of cities in the state, mainly in the Miami metropolitan area.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LGBT_rights_in_Florida" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LGBT_rights_in_Florida</a>')
