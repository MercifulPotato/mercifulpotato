Why take all this effort, cost and risk with the automation if it&#x27;s awfully slow in the end?<p>Germany uses (mostly) all paper ballots which are counted in each voting location by the local election committee, which is usually chaired by a government employee, and filled up with randomly chosen citizens. First results are often available 3-4h after closing of the voting location. With final results available during the next 1-2 days. All ballots will be collected on the next org level, to be available for audits&#x2F;recounts.')
