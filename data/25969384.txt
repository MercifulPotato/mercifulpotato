Item(by='YeGoblynQueenne', descendants=None, kids=[25978814, 25977177], score=None, time=1612017364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25963707, text='&gt;&gt; Section 5.4 which you quote from specifies that &quot;this section only shall include the United Kingdom&quot;. As written, this section does not relate to the distribution of the initial doses in Section 5.1, but instead is about where AstraZeneca _could_ choose to manufacture the vaccine. That is why it explains the process by which they might get prior written notice for non-EU manufacturing sites, and discusses how they could be contracted with if they are unable to deliver doses.<p>I&#x27;m not sure. You might be right. However section 5.4 also says:<p><i>If AstraZeneca is unable to deliver on its intention to manufacture the Initial Europe Doses and&#x2F;or Optional Doses under this Agreement in the EU, the Commission or the Participating Member States may present to AstraZeneca, CMOs within the EU capable of manufacturing the Vaccine Doses, and AstraZeneca shall use its Best Reasonable Efforts to contract with such  proposed CMOs to increase the available manufacturing capacity within the EU. </i><p>&quot;Within the EU&quot; in this particular paragraph encompasses the UK, so my reading of this is that if AstraZeneca can&#x27;t deliver the Initial Europe Doses as it plans, the Commission can propose alternative manufacturing sites that include UK sites. Which seems to cover the Comission&#x27;s current request that AstraZeneca use UK-made doses to honour its commitment to deliver the Initial Europe Doses (to its best reasonable efforts etc).<p>Again, IANAL, so I don&#x27;t know how to interpret this document correctly. I&#x27;m reading it as a lay person who does not understand the technicalities of legal terminology.')
