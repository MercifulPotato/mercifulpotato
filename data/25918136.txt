When a case is presented to the SC that &quot;is almost certainly not going to prevail&quot;, this often (and undoubtedly so in the texas case) means that there is a fundamental misunderstanding or misrepresentation of law that is so egregious there is no opinion to be had. This is exactly what the SC justices said in this case:<p>&gt; The State of Texasâ€™s motion for leave to file a bill of\ncomplaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of\nthe Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially\ncognizable interest in the manner in which another State\nconducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed\nas moot.
