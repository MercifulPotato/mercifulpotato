In high school I started practicing martial arts and also got on the hs wrestling team. What helped for me was that I gained confidence that if I was in another situation, I would be able to handle it. Another benefit being the physical training and the benefit to my appearance. As I became more fit, people were less apt to try bullying me.<p>Also, I came from a generation where most parents believed in &quot;spare the rod and spoil the child&quot;. So, I learned from an early age that it was ok for adults to beat the tar out of you - and you weren&#x27;t supposed to fight back.<p>I also suffered from the anxiety, and probably some ptsd. But through martial arts I got it under control and as I said, the confidence of knowing that I&#x27;d be able to fight back or defend myself goes a long way.')
