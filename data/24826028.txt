The meat is a ways down:<p>&gt;<i>The company told Noble providing the password would contravene a U.S. law — the Electronic Communications Privacy Act — written back in 1986.</i><p>and further<p>&gt;<i>Citizens of countries that have laws specifically addressing digital assets — including those in the European Union — don&#x27;t have the same problems. For those people, the terms and conditions of Apple services grant jurisdiction to &quot;the laws and courts of your usual place of residence.&quot;</i><p>&gt;<i>She[other person] got court orders, first from Ontario and later from a California court. Apple and Bell complied with the Ontario order</i><p>FFS. Do people want &quot;Big Tech&quot; to just blow off law, or not? It seems few have any real principles about it, they just want what they want conveniently without considering any further repercussions. The problem here apparently is (A) THEY DIDN&#x27;T SAVE THEIR PASSWORDS, (B) outdated US law, and (C) non-existent Canadian law. With A being the most important, particularly given the importance and spread of E2EE, but B &amp; C also important.<p>Digital is still new enough that we haven&#x27;t had full generations under our belts yet, dealing with mortality and passing things on could be a lot better organized and smoother. But concerns about people getting into other people&#x27;s stuff via hacks or social engineering, or mass surveillance, are extremely serious too. Just throwing around blame at the first convenient target is not helpful.')
