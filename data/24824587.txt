I don&#x27;t remember visiting IKEA until the early 2000s in the US. IKEA was nice because things were flat-packed, with simpler assembly instructions, and modular enough that you could repair or add on. I also noticed the furniture was significantly lighter--not so much that it was functionally flimsy, but way easier to move place to place.<p>I&#x27;ve bought non-IKEA furniture since and it&#x27;s just like I remember it. Even pre-assembled stuff is all veneer, so when your kid bangs it up you can&#x27;t really touch it up or buff it out.<p>I&#x27;d love to get all solid wood stuff. (IKEA does have some solid-wood stuff. I have a bookshelf I&#x27;ve moved 4 or 5 times and have had for probably 10 years) I hear some parts of the world still readily sell solid wood furniture at reasonable prices--just not around me. One issue with solid wood furniture is the size and weight. Fitting it through a door, into a car, or up 3 flights of stairs doesn&#x27;t make sense for a college dorm or a studio apartment.')
