Now that you mention it though, I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve ever written an algorithm mixing and matching negative&#x2F;positive indices in a way that couldn&#x27;t be trivially re-written with that kind of syntax. I&#x27;m sure such cases exist for somebody...<p>Looking for solutions, if you&#x27;re stuck with Python and hate that behavior:<p>- If you don&#x27;t need errors raised then a[~i] is already equal to a[-i-1].<p>- In your own code (or at its boundaries when wrapping external lists) it&#x27;s nearly free and not much code to subclass list, override __getitem__, and raise errors for negative indices while responding to some syntax like a[0,] or a.R[0].')
