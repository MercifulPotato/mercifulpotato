Item(by='dmix', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603614579, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24884513, text='&gt; When everything is moved offshore to lower costs, what will we do all day?<p>Provide a more productive and practical purpose for these people&#x27;s labour during their blip time on this planet to something?<p>Those &quot;something&#x27;s&quot; are practically infinite. People have developed (or been sold) this weird conception that there is only a small finite amount of work available, and therefore we must limit things like the total workforce numbers or other such nonsense.<p>When any (usually group) of people can come up with an idea, generate thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of value, then really the supply of &quot;what to do&quot; is hardly finite. Most of our limitations on these are self-created through well meaning legislation or through power systems like monopolies, which we have systems to break. But hardly all of them are limited by these two factors.<p>With simple B2B software alone theres millions of automations&#x2F;automations just waiting to be productized and profitizied. Consumer-wise we haven&#x27;t reached  anyway near the potential of smartphones, IOT, and desktops in every home.<p>This idea that there is a finite amount of jobs and there will be nothing left for the guy who figured out how to drive sophisticated machines or run teams&#x2F;logistics of such people is such a weird unreal fantasy to me. I don&#x27;t really get it.<p>Our problem is more of what are the older people going to do and we&#x27;ve come up with quite a few solutions already (UBI) but beyond that these transitions take a <i>lot</i> of time. A lot more than they ever should. And a lot longer than the doomsayers ever predict.<p>Plus we are a long long way from robots completely replacing labour jobs and things like being an electrician which can be a highly valuable and rewarding career (not everyone has to be a millionaire but middle class life in anywhere country is enviable by almost anyone not in a western country).<p>I&#x27;m so tired of these negative predictions than never seem to work out in reality. In reality we have failure of current systems (in one giant form in America prematurely shipping it all overseas is one). Not failures of the actual technological development.<p>But regardless you can&#x27;t stop this constant progress anyway. It&#x27;s going to happen. IMO our short time on earth is far better spent on fixing the failures of the past that are realized today (criminal sentencing reform, drug laws, the utter failures of political systems maybe due to voting or other factors like how policy is formed, etc, etc) than worrying about the future.')
