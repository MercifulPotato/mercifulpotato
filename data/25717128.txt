I used to really enjoy YC&#x27;s podcast&#x2F;interviews from 2017-2019 when Craig Cannon used to host them. Some of the interviews were my absolute favorites!<p>There were ton of great interviews with folks like Wojciech Zaremba, Greg Brockman, Daniel Gross, Tim Urban, Diana Hu etc.<p>I wanted to know why YC decided to stop those interviews. They were a wealth of information and Craig was honestly a great interviewer! I realize he has now left to start his own company, but I&#x27;m pretty sure someone else can continue the segment.<p>Please reconsider bringing it back!<p>Thanks')
