I&#x27;d be surprised if any of the new 50M users stick around after this fiasco. Also, this doesn&#x27;t seem to actually be a scaling&#x2F;hardware issue like they claim. They&#x27;re running on AWS so they should be able to throw more hardware at it in a matter of minutes, hours tops. As of now, they&#x27;ve been down for 14 hours! Not sure what&#x27;s going on but it&#x27;s the absolute worst time to have this happen :&#x2F;<p>Edit: worth noting that I&#x27;ve been a Signal user since ~2015, and I&#x27;ve stood by them through multiple amateur-hour mistakes (including one where the iOS app would simply crash on boot for about a week, rendering it unusable to me and every other iOS user). The app was just starting to get into a non-insanely-buggy state that I was quite happy with, so it&#x27;s upsetting to know that these sorts of mistakes are still being made.')
