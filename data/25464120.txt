It would be good for people who own capital goods, as they would spend their assistance checks on consumer goods without competing to provide them. The profit would accrue to the few who hold capital and those capitalists would have an enormous supply of reserve labor available, driving down the marginal cost of labor (so the people who did have jobs would have less bargaining power).<p>&gt; I would MUCH rather pay for them to be in school instead of just paying part of Bezos&#x27; and other Amazon investors operating costs.<p>Thats interesting, how many people can you currently afford to feed, house, and pay tuition for?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s almost like this is a stupid argument that there is no way to excuse, and no amount of indirect smoke &amp; mirrors or denial gets around that, and anyone even trying deserves to be among the first people rounded up for the new press gangs they think are so fair a great.<p>It may seem that way to you. Actually what we have is a bunch of people who are ignorant of economics but still have opinions about how the economy should be run, and a class of politicians who appeal to their ignorance by selling them fairy tales that ignore scarcity and appeal to wishful thinking.')
