I check System and other laptop vendors in their tier. Disappointment.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are a lot of economic issues that I don&#x27;t understand but here is my request:<p>. all the ram possible\n. pretty good CPU w&#x2F; lots of cores\n. a good keyboard (no numpad)\n. a good 4k-ish screen\n. a big battery (if you make this laptop, ppl will optimize the software to make it last)\n. decent speakers\n. is it too much to ask for a decent GPU?<p>Overall: please just make a premium laptop and charge a lot. There are more ppl on the Internet like me than you realize.<p>Things no one cares about:<p>. thin')
