Meanwhile, you would need thousands of coconspirators, and count on none of them ever leaking.<p>You&#x27;re talking about someone showing up at the polls to commit voter fraud in person, when the contention here is primarily about mail-in ballots.<p>If someone has access to the voter rolls from the previous election, how do you detect if they&#x27;ve submitted mail-in ballots for people who were registered but didn&#x27;t vote last time, on the theory that most of them still won&#x27;t? Or who registers new people without their request and then submits ballots in their names? That entire process would be taking place outside of the polling location.')
