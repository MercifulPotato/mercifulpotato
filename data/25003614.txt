Black people seem to be voting for Biden in droves this time, and not all of them are in cities. And per capita, the urban half is closer to 80% versus the rural 20%.<p>The narrative of &quot;urban vs. rural&quot; is populist propaganda, intended to imply that a solid half of the US supports Trump and that he represents the entirety of &quot;rural&quot; American identity, which isn&#x27;t true.')
