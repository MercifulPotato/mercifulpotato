Item(by='6gvONxR4sf7o', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608144355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25445587, text='I&#x27;d say non-financial usage is the appropriate measure. My dollars are a good currency because I pay my mortgage in them, I buy groceries in them, I get my paycheck in them, I pay my friends for my share of dinner in it. The usage towards &quot;stuff&quot; that the economy is made of (activities, goods, etc) should be the measure. I have yet to see bitcoin make a dent there. It seems like bitcoin has actually gotten harder to use there than when I first encountered it.<p>Until then a bitcoin is like a call option or financial derivatives or really exotic instruments. Financially very relevant, heavily used, but so niche that it&#x27;s of no relevance to basically everybody.')
