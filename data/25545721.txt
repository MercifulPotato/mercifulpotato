The tech is good enough to avoid hitting another car that slows down in front of you, but if someone was broken down(and fully stopped) in your lane, the car will hit them at full speed. It <i>might</i> start breaking just before impact, but not fast enough to slow you down from 150km&#x2F;h. No self driving or adaptive cruise tech can save you from this situation, because they are all trained to ignore fully stationary objects. I&#x27;ve also seen situations where road markings disappear on the road for whatever reason and Tesla goes from being 100% confident and in control to &quot;take over the wheel NOW&quot; in about 1 second flat. Best case scenario here is that the car would eventually realize that you aren&#x27;t in control and come to a gradual stop - the problem there is that now he is fully stopped on an active highway and chances of getting plowed from the rear are astronomical.<p>I think the biggest problem with all of these self driving systems is that in cars they can require you to be fully 100% aware of your surroundings and take over in a split second. People compare it to plane autopilot, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s quite right - in a plane, you will have at least a minute or two before you hit the ground, even if the plane takes a straight nose dive. In a car, you go from being fine to being headed for a head-on collision in no time at all.')
