Look at BP scientist model in the late 70&#x27;s and look how much we diverged. 40 years, if the model is false you will see it fast no?<p>Since you&#x27;re a skeptic, you have to follow the rule: look at the evidence that say you&#x27;re wrong before looking at the evidence that say you&#x27;re right. Luckily, those models can be the evidence of both at the same time, so you only have to do your own research twice!')
