The actual draw often happens in some order (e.g. numbered balls being drawn from a hopper), and it&#x27;d be even <i>more</i> unusual if the numbers were actually drawn in consecutive order, but drawing 5-2-3-1-4 would typically be presented as 1-2-3-4-5 and would still be remarked upon as unusual.')
