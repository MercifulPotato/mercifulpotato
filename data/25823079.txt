Pretty much every brand except Cree cuts corners in the DC inverter stage... they tend to overheat badly and fry. Often, you can apply DC directly to the LEDs, and they still light.<p>Also, you need to read the package, even with Cree: many state &quot;not suitable for fully enclosed fixtures&quot;. They make ones expressly for this, and are required to prevent the lamp from cooking itself.<p>On top of that, many of those scammy brands say things like &quot;x year warranty&quot;, when they really mean &quot;1,000 hours per year&quot; warranty. Cree warranties their bulb for tens of thousands of hours... I have a much older 100 watt equivalent that has been burning 24&#x2F;7 for over 5 years (somewhere around 50k hours), still ain&#x27;t dead yet.<p>Now that the government is (theoretically) back on track, I&#x27;d love to see the FTC go after LED lamp manufacturers that straight up lie about their lifetime estimates; I don&#x27;t care if their prices go up, all they&#x27;d do is start matching Cree in price.<p>Fun fact: Cree isn&#x27;t just the world&#x27;s best LED (as in, the actual diodes) manufacturer, they&#x27;re also one of the world&#x27;s leading GaN power module manufacturers, and all of their own in-house knowhow is used in their own consumer bulbs.')
