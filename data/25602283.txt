Or one tree per row, where keys are single integers, column index.<p>Unlike CSR, inserting elements is Log(n). RAM overhead is larger than CSR but still reasonable, much smaller than hash maps or red-black trees would be. Similar to CSR, reading rows is mostly sequential RAM reads i.e. pretty fast.')
