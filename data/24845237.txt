Finding a good recruiter is as hard or harder than finding a good employee - only do it if you expect to be recruiting for multiple roles over a period.<p>2.  Think a lot about what you&#x27;re looking for in an engineer, how you&#x27;ll evaluate candidates, what experience will be shows for the talents you need and then how to articulate that to the recruiter.  When they send CVs&#x2F;resumes make sure you give feedback on what are the bad and good qualities.<p>3.  When recruiting I&#x27;ve nearly always gone via recruiters that have gotten me roles or have worked with in the past (or atleast through them to someone else in their organisation).')
