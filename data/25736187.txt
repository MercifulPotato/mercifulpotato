There was a steady exodus of engineering talent through 2020. The CEO was focused on moving to countries where engineering was cheaper and employees complained less about constant crunch mode. If you search around, you can find interviews where he brags about closing the San Jose office because he thought everyone there was too entitled.<p>The saddest part is that we had many good engineers who could have continued to do amazing things with the UniFi momentum. So much time was wasted on dead end products like FrontRow. Most everyone I know left for jobs where we were treated better and paid more.')
