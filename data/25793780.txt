Now that it has many incumbents who&#x27;ve invested huge amounts of $$$ in it, those &#x27;vested interests&#x27; keep it alive along with the koolaiders.<p>Like NKLA stock.<p>It&#x27;s why for example the US&#x2F;China&#x2F;Canada&#x2F;UK&#x2F;EU just don&#x27;t magically &#x27;agree on a currency&#x27; in a big &#x27;trade agreement&#x27; because it&#x27;s not feasible, it makes no sense.<p>It&#x27;s why the &#x27;Euro&#x27; is a constant grinding problem hanging over the EU; while it has transactional and accounting advantages, the &#x27;single currency&#x27; cannot simply paper over the very fundamental differences between national economic systems. If the EU went &#x27;full fiscal union&#x27; - that would help, but it would also imply constant and massive direct wealth transfers from Germany and Netherlands to &#x27;everywhere else&#x27;. Those &#x27;transfer payments&#x27; would be one way of recognizing systematic imbalances. Having &#x27;national currencies&#x27; instead of the Euro would be another.<p>The &#x27;best currency&#x27; in the US is the USD, the &#x27;best currency&#x27; in the UK is the Pound.<p>If you want a &#x27;store of value&#x27; then buy real estate, commodities, stocks, bonds, a pool of other currencies, or better yet, a cheap ETF that&#x27;s spread among those things.<p>Frankly, if there were a &#x27;global currency&#x27; it would be de-facto something like a massive, well managed ETF fund whereby &#x27;credits&#x27; would map to a portion of said assets. It could be anonymous, and maybe transactions could be decentralized - but - there&#x27;s no getting around mapping the value of the currency or asset to some part of the system, they cannot be independent. And frankly it would need to be &#x27;so huge&#x27; that it would imply a kind of Global Central Bank of some kind, which we would never agree upon.<p>BTC is a very curiously novel and interesting thing but it&#x27;s not the right solution to anything.')
