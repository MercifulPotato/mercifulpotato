Their whole mindset is they want to review every version of the app manually and every bit of code that executes must be signed. They don&#x27;t allow a lot of obvious software engineering approaches as a consequence, like partially downloading the app and streaming the rest on demand even though it&#x27;s an obvious thing to do for mobile apps.<p>Note how in this story the Android and iOS teams started a big rewrite at the same time, but the story consists exclusively of fuckups on the Apple size. Apple impose an arbitrary cellular download limit. Apple designed a language that can&#x27;t handle more than 9 dynamic libraries before it hits scaling issues. Apple prevent you from using interpreters or other techniques to change the app after it&#x27;s installed, unless you use a WebView in which case it&#x27;s OK for mysterious reasons. Apple don&#x27;t help even when major brands are weeks away from wrecking their business by hitting these limits. Apple Apple Apple. Meanwhile the Android guys are sitting pretty with Java and now a migration to Kotlin, which is (a) a much better language than Swift and (b) is dogfooded at large scale on the IntelliJ project so you know it scales (had no scaling problems with Kotlin and I&#x27;ve been using it for the last five years).')
