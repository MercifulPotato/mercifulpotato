I&#x27;ve been filling it up once every 3 months so far, most of my journeys are done in fully electric mode, and when they are not I&#x27;m averaging 100-150mpg. Charging at home is pretty easy, but I do have my own driveway which I realize a lot of people don&#x27;t.<p>But yes, UK company tax structure around them is absolutely broken. You can get one, get a massive tax discount, and then simply never charge it, resulting in higher emissions than in a normal car, and yet keep the low emissions discount. It&#x27;s stupid. I think you should have to prove that you&#x27;re actually using the EV capabilities, otherwise it&#x27;s just straight up fraud.')
