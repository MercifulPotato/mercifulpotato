Raymond&#x27;s &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; essay in LaTeX. I was surprised to find that as I got more familiar with the text that I disagreed with it quite a bit. Raymond was the coiner of &quot;open source,&quot; and he&#x27;s pretty positive throughout the essay that open-source software is superior to proprietary software technically. As this article points out, that relies a lot on there being enough people working on a project. Raymond also discourages the use of the term &quot;free software&quot; in another essay.<p>Eric S Raymond concludes &quot;Cathedral&quot; with the statement that proprietary software is on its way out due to paid developers not being able to compete with the man-hours invested by volunteers. It&#x27;s a very whiggish attitude that hasn&#x27;t been borne out. He&#x27;s still saying stuff like this, such as that Windows will inevitably become a layer on top of the Linux kernal.<p>It was nice to see this article come along to HN when I was already thinking about this. I do think it&#x27;s important that free software be used on principle, even if it&#x27;s not better or set to wipe out its proprietary equivalent.')
