Government departments usually have elected representatives who are officially in charge, so there&#x27;s someone the public can blame when things like this happen. At least thats true here in Australia and in the UK - I&#x27;m not totally sure if it works the same way in the US.<p>That said, the politicians usually don&#x27;t get too involved in on-the-ground details like this. They have other things to worry about (like the next election). And the civil servants will usually understand the issues on the ground much better, because they spend their whole career dealing with them. (Unlike politicians who come and go.)<p>Blaming the politicians involved is like blaming the CEO when bugs happen in software. (Or in this case, when bugs from many years ago are discovered.) Technically yeah, they&#x27;re ultimately responsible. But the actual mistake was the fault of the people on the ground.')
