As a 15-year-old at Stuyvesant, in 1966, learning FORTRAN 4, I assure you it was the most natural thing in the world.  Especially instructive was the fact that usually two of the target statement numbers would be the same. FORTRAN 4 didn’t have Boolean data types, OR, or AND and += was still in someone’s nightmare.<p>Note also that when Microsoft put IF( , , , ) into Excel, the most widely used computing application in the world, they essentially used this syntax.')
