This is not a question of the correctness of any given interpretation.  Correctness can never be determined, there is no &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot; interpretation of the available information.<p>EDIT: So one thing to consider is that markets are predictive.  A &quot;correct&quot; interpretation is only correct if it can predict what will happen in the future.  And because the future is not predictable (proof needed but whatever) there is no way to know which interpretation is &quot;correct&quot;.')
