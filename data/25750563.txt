That they didn’t get a Senator to also challenge doesn’t change their own opposition to the election. Is Shiela Jackson-Lee deplatformed? Or course not. She’s a member of the congressional black caucus. She, an violence-promoting Maxine Waters get a pass from the hand-wringing of the tech and leftist “elites.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;house-democrats-trump-electoral-college-233264" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;house-democrats-trump...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;25&#x2F;politics&#x2F;maxine-waters-trump-officials&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;25&#x2F;politics&#x2F;maxine-waters-trump-...</a><p>People on the left are gigantic hypocrites. And liars. Conveniently ascribing to Trump what they have been doing since before November 2016. There are hundreds of not thousands of examples of outright hypocrisy.<p>Another example: violence committed against Senator Rand Paul was cheered by Twitter users. Accounts weren’t purged, nor users banned en mass. The assassination attempt of Congressman Scalise — no punishment of Bernie Sanders’ campaign for inspiring hatred of Republicans that led to a self proclaimed “Bernie Bro” from firing over 50 shots in an attempt to kill Republicans.<p>Where is the “community standards” enforcement around people on Twitter that celebrate this actual violence against elected officials?<p>Hypocrites and phonies. That’s what the tech “elites” and leftist are.')
