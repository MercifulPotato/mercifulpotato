Item(by='rsanheim', descendants=None, kids=[25323663, 25321505], score=None, time=1607234167, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25321364, text='&gt; Make no mistake, this is simply Apple&#x27;s attempt to gain complete control over its users.<p>This is unfair and just not true.<p>It is known that apple products can be rendered useless after being stolen easily by the original owner. Yes, they still get stolen, but it is a really nice feature that you can wipe the data remotely and mark the device as lost &#x2F; stolen. You also know the thief will mostly be stuck with a low-value device that is all but useless without some sort of jailbreak or scam to resell it.<p>Of course, this feature has tradeoffs, and some of them are negative for some people (like the OP sneak). Maybe it helps Apple &quot;gain complete control&quot; over users, but you are gonna need more evidence to support that claim.<p>To completely ignore the positive aspects is not contributing anything at all w&#x2F; these sorts of discussion.')
