Item(by='zimpenfish', descendants=None, kids=[24847393, 24832517], score=None, time=1603127396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24827759, text='&gt; - The laptop had emails on it that were previously not public<p>Have yet to be authenticated though?<p>&gt; - They have Hunter&#x27;s signature on the drop off receipt<p>Can&#x27;t find a source for this - only that it says &quot;Hunter Biden&quot;.  Do you have a handy URL?<p>&gt; - Hunter&#x27;s attorney requested the hard drive back (they have the request in writing)<p>Again, can&#x27;t find a source that doesn&#x27;t say &quot;allegedly&quot; in the sentence.  Do you have a handy URL with proof?<p>&gt; - The FBI subpeonaed the laptop<p>Given they seem to think it&#x27;s a Russian disinformation play being made through the campaign team of POTUS, yeah, I&#x27;d expect them to be going through it with a fine toothcomb to find out who, where, when, etc.<p>&gt; The DNI himself says it&#x27;s not a Russian disinformation campaign<p>Alas, his credibility is probably lower even than Guiliani&#x27;s.<p>&gt; that there&#x27;s not intelligence saying it is<p>The FBI seem to be approaching things from the point of view that it is a Russian op.  Awkward!<p>&gt; No one in the Biden campaign has denied the laptop itself is genuine<p>They&#x27;ve also not denied that Hunter Biden is a lizard person. SUSPICIOUS.')
