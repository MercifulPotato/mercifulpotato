The privacy policy isn&#x27;t particularly clear about how this is used, but it&#x27;s <i>very</i> permissive and vague. It also states that this collection is &quot;mandatory.&quot; In my experience this means it will be repackaged as &quot;analytics&quot; and sold for market research and advertising.<p>Be wary when using eCommerce SDKs, especially in the absence of exact, legalese-free clarification about what &quot;data processing&quot; means. Here is the privacy policy: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iubenda.com&#x2F;privacy-policy&#x2F;60591797&#x2F;full-legal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iubenda.com&#x2F;privacy-policy&#x2F;60591797&#x2F;full-legal</a><p>Keep in mind that if Chec is acquired, the durably stored data will also be transferred per this policy. Beyond the usual callouts like fraud and geolocation, the policy also allows the company to use customer data to &quot;improve its services&quot;, with no specificity on what exactly that would entail.')
