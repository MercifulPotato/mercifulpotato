When borrowing, like in the bond market, it is always easy to spend more of other peopleâ€™s money than the amount you made that year. The market only looks at revenues and hope they increase so you can always keep borrowing greater amounts if they do increase. The government looks at net income and also extends credits for certains ways that the revenue was generated.<p>The government incentivizes transactions, when you don&#x27;t conduct enough transactions you pay the government instead.<p>The people decided that taxes were too hard to comprehend, which isnt true for all of us, and vilify anyone who does comprehend. The collective understanding and reading comprehension is so low that they cant even effectively change the law, getting their representatives to just tax people that earn the same way they do more. Congratulations you taxed the most effective <i>wage workers</i> more you did it!<p>Its just another perspective on reality that also happens to be more accurate and effective.')
