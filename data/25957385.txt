I wouldn&#x27;t have the first idea how to pull off a plan like this; is this what people learn in the field of M&amp;A?<p>For example, how can you be confident that someone will be interested in acquiring you, and for a good price, instead of one of your competitors, or just building their own? How do you know your customers will be happy to switch to the replacement product that gets put in front of them? (I&#x27;d be quite interested to know what they did to make themselves an attractive target for acquisition, as a practical example)<p>With reference to the main topic - I think there is a place in the market for both stable long-term and high-growth shorter-term  businesses like this example. Sometimes the market is hungry for a solution <i>right now</i>, not something perfect in five years. Satisfying this demand is what causes high growth. And it&#x27;s natural that we see a lot of this in the tech industry, since we&#x27;re closer to the cutting edge than most.')
