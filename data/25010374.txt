If you go with version 3.3 (a good choice in my opinion) and then it&#x27;s really only a few function calls and you&#x27;re submitting vertices, and it&#x27;s going to be supported on any platform. Use glfw and you don&#x27;t need to worry about platform stuff (creating windows is a pain otherwise).<p>Counting the lines of a renderer I have lying around it&#x27;s 300 lines (including much whitespace). That&#x27;s very full functioned, it correctly positions the window in the center of the monitor, handles errors properly, takes mouse and keyboard input, sets up the view&#x2F;projection matrices, uses shaders, etc.')
