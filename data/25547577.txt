Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609028147, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25547143, text='&gt;&gt;The claim that “it’s physically impossible” doesn’t make sense to me: humans drive safely with such deltas using only “a video feed” and sound.<p>My logic is as follows - at 150km&#x2F;h, you are covering 41m per second, and an approximate stopping distance from that speed is about 130m. Human eyes are much better at recognizing objects from a distance than computer based vision is, and Tesla is in fact relying on cameras for its forward object detection, plus a rudimentary distance-based radar. There is no chance(that&#x27;s why I said &quot;physically impossible&quot;) that whatever camera is mounted in the Tesla can reliably recognize an object(and tell that it&#x27;s stopped!) at 130m. Of course the system needs to do the processing, make a decision, send a signal to the brake actuators and actually engage them. Let&#x27;s be generous and add a full second to this - so to stop from that speed Tesla would need to recognize a car, identify it as a hazard, and make a critical &quot;all brakes at maximum strength&quot; decision from 170m away. There&#x27;s no chance.<p>&gt;&gt;Anyways, I’m fairly certain I’ve come to a stop on autopilot from at least 60mph (100kph).<p>Ok, but there will be an upper limit to this, and I&#x27;d love to know what it is. I know that Deimler&#x27;s solution only guarantees full avoidance at deltas up to 50km&#x2F;h, and &quot;reduced&quot; impact at higher deltas - it just doesn&#x27;t see far enough. Tesla&#x27;s technology is fundamentally very similar, so I&#x27;d love to know what they consider as reasonable distance for full autonomous stop.')
