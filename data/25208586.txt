You have to build your fibre backbone anyways. That&#x27;s an even bigger trouble in countries with no culture to share fibre. And you would usually have to get much &quot;brainier,&quot; and more expensive fibre equipment in this case.<p>2. You still need to wire the fibre fairly close to premises.<p>3. High speed copper network equipment costs huge sums, more than commoditised GPON.<p>4. Copper often needs to be torn, to be replaced with higher grade copper<p>5. You still need to drill buildings to install niches for copper equipment.<p>6. You need to put extra equipment into equipment closets.<p>7. Copper needs more equipment overall<p>8. Copper has lower reliability overall, and costs more to maintain<p>So, in the end, you just do the same FTTH, just with copper as the last few tenths of metres. This is so obvious, but people keep dogmatising over &quot;it&#x27;s already wired with copper.&quot;<p>GPON by comparison does not require anything in the closet, but a piece of glass passive optical slitter.<p>You can easily have 1024 end-users on a single powerful GePON OLT, covering few square kilometres of 100% passive net.')
