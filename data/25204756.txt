Android uses more memory because most Android software is written to use more memory (relying on garbage collection). It has nothing to do with the chips. If you ran Android on an M1, it wouldn&#x27;t magically need less RAM. And Photoshop compiled for x86 is going to use about the same amount of memory as Photoshop compiled for Apple silicon. Sure, if you <i>rewrote</i> Photoshop to use garbage collection everywhere then memory consumption would increase, but that has nothing to do with the chip.')
