However Nintendo themselves have given limited information. While I think your point is more likely than not, that caveat I’m making is still worth noting; ie things aren’t as certain as you’re boldly claiming.<p>Now on to your point about the  complaint the GP and myself made being FUD; it’s really not. The closest to a monolithic kernels performance any micro kernel has gotten was L4 and those benchmarks was running Linux on top of L4 vs bare metal Linux. While the work on L4 is massively impressive there is still a big caveat, the actual workload was still effectively ran on a monolithic kernel with L4 acting like a hypervisor. So most of the advantages that a micro kernel offers were rendered moot <i>and</i> there was still a small performance hit for it.<p>Why doesn’t that matter for the Nintendo Switch? Probably because any DRM countermeasures in user space would have a bigger performance penalty and a micro kernel offers some protections there as part of the design. That’s just a guess but as I opened with, Nintendo are quite secretive about their system software so it’s hard to make the kind of conclusive arguments you like to claim.')
