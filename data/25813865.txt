Having a non-wasteful, nonindulgent culture. I&#x27;ve heard culture described as &quot;a set of rules for what you will tolerate&quot; and you don&#x27;t want to tolerate waste. If you&#x27;re trying to grow fast you typically need to spend money to make money, but it&#x27;s important that a culture of low-consequence spending doesn&#x27;t turn into a world where you&#x27;re throwing money at anything under the sun just because you have a lot of $ in the bank.<p>2. Having a handle on your gross and operating margins. It&#x27;s really hard to dig yourself out of a whole of low&#x2F;negative&#x2F;declining margins, as they are often indicative of structural assumptions that get built into your business model.')
