In last few years they where mostly focusing on embedded, automotive and desktop. I wish they provided more indie friendly alternative license for mobile market something similar like Unreal Engine had e.g. taking ~5% of your revenue.<p>I know they recently provide &#x27;small company license&#x27; and ~500usd&#x2F;year is justified as long it&#x27;s just hobby project if only your as a dev. The moment you reach $250k as a startup and have to hire few devs and pay $5k&#x2F;year per each developer is making this less affordable. On top of that if you focusing on mobile devices (android&#x2F;ios) probably you would need to have Felgo license (to cover some Qt limitations) which is crazily even more expensive.<p>At this point in few years Flutter, ReactNative, Unity, Unreal Engine and Electron will be slowly stealing more of Qt market.')
