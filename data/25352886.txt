Suppose they are getting 100% value from education.  If a less privileged student is only getting 20% value from education, a 10% relative decrease only makes them 2% worse off.<p>My point is not that this is the right interpretation, it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s settled about how much it will impact students, and which groups will be impacted disproportionately.  Points about nutrition, getting out of abusive homes, etc., are all interesting and relevant and outside the scope of what I mean, which is purely focused on education outcomes.')
