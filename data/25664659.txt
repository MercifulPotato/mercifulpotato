To try to inform their audience. To not say things they know to be false.<p>The people storming the capital right now have been told by (1) the president of the united states, (2) the news channels they watch, and very possibly (3) their religious leaders, that Donald Trump would have won the election if not for a conspiracy to rig voting machines and throw away millions of ballots. So of course, in that case, the right thing to do is storm the capital and protect democracy!<p>The basic problem is that too many public figures have decided to reject their most basic responsibility to society. And I just don&#x27;t know what to do about that.')
