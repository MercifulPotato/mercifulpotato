As such, you cannot replace to kill a mockingbird at the district level without banning it. I&#x27;m sure some teachers were already using a different novel (The Hate U Give is apparently popular, but is also banned in some places because it is supposedly anti-police). By barring the book from the curriculum, they force teachers to use better tools.<p>&gt; Only someone completely incapable of critical thinking would lump To Kill A Mockingbird into the same category as Mein Kampf.<p>I don&#x27;t see anyone doing that.')
