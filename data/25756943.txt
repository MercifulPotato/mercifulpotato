Because they are doing research on computer science - how different algorithms can be improved or new data structures (or ML techniques etc).<p>Software engineers are more likely to need to know the underlying machine and write code suitable for such - because they need to write working&#x2F;production ready code. It&#x27;s like applied science, vs pure research science.')
