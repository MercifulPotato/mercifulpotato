It seems like the biggest risk is it hitting a pedestrian or cyclist (of which I did not see any), and could result in perhaps a single person needing to go the hospital.<p>What happens when a half pound drone that&#x27;s going 15+ kph hits an oncoming car windshield going many times that speed?<p>&gt;hundred vehicles with one ton+ curb weights, driving at one another, piloted by what are most likely bored inattentive drivers.<p>what happens when you distract those drives with an aerial nuisance while they&#x27;re trying to cross a bridge that offers no positive outcomes if the vehicle vector is changed?<p>Things don&#x27;t have to be universally safe to point out a safety flaw with a specific variable.<p>Driving cars isn&#x27;t safe, but doing something unsafe while compounded with distractions and possible bogeys is even more unsafe.')
