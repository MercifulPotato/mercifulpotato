Apple could hire engineers to maintain this stuff, if they wanted to spend the money. It would <i>not</i> somehow make the rest of macOS worse—no one is required to use old APIs.<p>If you compared the amount of effort it would take Apple to maintain these systems, with the combined effort of <i>every single developer</i> migrating their software, I&#x27;m pretty confident the former route would be a lot less work. The alternative is that developers migrate to systems like Electron instead of trying to keep up with macOS&#x27;s changing base, and that&#x27;s not good for users.')
