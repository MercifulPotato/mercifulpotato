In EE-land we think too much about real and complex numbers, where Fourier analysis is more concrete. But spectral graph theory makes a lot of sense when you think of Fourier analysis as a way of decomposing patterns into their constituent parts, it just looks a bit funny when those patterns aren&#x27;t numbers.')
