The vaccine development and trials more or less happened in a science-backed way (not saying this was perfect but it was say 90% right way to do)\n2. The actual deployment : this is worrying because the scientists who have developed the Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna one haven&#x27;t tested delayed doses and are rightfully raising the alarms. The Oxford-AZ one is tricky because they have only tested the two full dose regimen with the right sample sizes and that&#x27;s the one approved. From memory, there was some noise about delayed doses being approved but this is really shaky ground.  Respected journals like BMJ [0] are questioning the lack of data around this.<p>tl;dr : Delaying doses not tested as per protocols and seems to be optimising for reach disregarding the fact that it wasn&#x27;t tested and should rightfully worry most of us :(<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bmj.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;372&#x2F;bmj.n18" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bmj.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;372&#x2F;bmj.n18</a>')
