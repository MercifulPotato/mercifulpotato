An an obvious example would be preventing Andy Rubin from getting a $90mil payday for sexually harassing people. Clearly that&#x27;s not only a serious injustice, but was ultimately always going to end up public and damaging Google brand.<p>If the solution is already of economic advantage for Google itself, you simply don&#x27;t need a union since it is already in the economic self-interest of Google to apply the solution. Employees unionize to have leverage against the employee for topics that employees have an interest in, but are of economic disadvantage for the employer (historically in particular salaries)')
