That&#x27;s fine.<p>I can rephrase: Reliable ranging should override other sensor mechanisms for detecting driveable space and presence of hazards.<p>Tracking with dense ranging (e.g., LIDAR) is not as challenging as the alternative: ensuring that  non-ranging system will reliably segment all possible hazards.')
