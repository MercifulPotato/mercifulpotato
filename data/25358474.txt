There&#x27;s no &#x27;hey, invest $20 Billion in my startup, maybe I will have customers some day&#x27;. No - you need a national strategy with the airlines buying in.<p>That said - concerns over central planning are real - not so much in impetus, but in execution.<p>If Europe could snap it&#x27;s fingers and for $10 Billion just have competitors to Intel just magically appear - it would be a <i>good</i> investment. Very good.<p>But unlike roads, tunnels and bridges, you can&#x27;t just buy innovation.<p>It&#x27;s going to take the right leaders, the right investments, the right kinds of innovation.<p>Which is extremely hard.<p>I don&#x27;t know the industry but it may may more sense to come at it from the periphery: possibly by creating design and fabs for more common chips.<p>Or maybe it makes sense to come at it from an academic&#x2F;open angle, and get the top Universities to publish open source designs that if industry buyers want, they can get subsidies for fabs.<p>Finally ... the other parts of the ecosystem are not there as much: there is no more Nokia. There is nobody making computers. There is no &#x27;OS&#x27; to guide deep integration.<p>I think it&#x27;s reasonable to be wary of this kind of top down sentiment as it&#x27;s risky and not preferable, and prone to fluffy words without action, at the same time, it&#x27;s reasonable to address the issue.')
