Someone who can&#x27;t afford it, will probably grade countries differently.<p>And there are so many factors to consider: culture, english speaking schools availability, weather, detached houses availability, real estate prices, if your spouse likes the country, anything that could be important for you.<p>I lived in Dubai and I&#x27;m not a fan of how they deal with personal freedom (eg. LGBT rights, alcohol &#x2F; drug consumption, sex outside of marriage) even if I like how they deal with economic freedom. Also racism towards American &#x2F; European expats from natives is pretty vicious (albeit not as bad as towards expats from poorer countries).<p>Some people are indeed happy to live in Dubai - personally I found that there are several countries which offer a better tradeoff for me, low taxes and a good quality of life (whatever your definition is).')
