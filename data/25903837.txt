The bus runs two to four times an hour to the downtown and local college campus.<p>The crowd at the mall seems a lot more racially integrated than at the Ithaca commons downtown.<p>These days the mall has the COVID-19 testing center and just opened a racket sports center where Planet Fitness used to be.  The people who run the mall definitely want to be part of the solution,  not part of the problem.')
