Defense of the liberalisation of sex work has become fairly dogmatic. I remember the same when it came to prostitution here in Germany more than a decade ago, and contrary to claims beforehand we saw a significant increase in human trafficking, criminality, abuse and so on. Due to the very nature of the industry it makes it hard to tell what&#x27;s legitimate and what is not.<p>&gt;<i>&quot;Sex workers are disproportionately women of color, transgender, and are by definition the most marginalized in our society. They don&#x27;t have people chasing their boats. They don&#x27;t have people seeking their contributions,&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m also all in favour of supporting marginalised groups in all sorts of ways including financially, but I also don&#x27;t like that it has often become an argument in these debates.')
