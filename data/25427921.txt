We soon write 2021, but still any business connected to sex is met with moral condemnation and resistance. The question of for how long OnlyFans will be &quot;run by the content providers themselves&quot; and not overtaken by pimps and an organised  exploitative porn industry, remains of course. Maybe the risk of this is connected to the morally restrained media- and tech industry')
