I wonder if the collateral of real identities means a greater or lesser degree of manipulation.I don&#x27;t use those other sites because I&#x27;m less interested in connecting online with people who use their real names, as it reduces to a personal brand performance divorced from ideas and truth.<p>Whether we&#x27;re engaged in discourse or politics seems linked to whether we&#x27;re using &quot;real&quot; or abstracted identities. While I think people who can&#x27;t abstract their ideas from their identities are the ones who get manipulated, consuming pseudonymously produced junk could have a similar but  different impact.')
