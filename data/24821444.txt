[1] To simplify, these are the lines along which particles move when no outside force is exerted on them--again, considering gravity to be a distortion of spacetime and not a force, very much like the well-known metaphor of steel ball on a rubber sheet, which would curve marbles towards the &quot;well&quot; it&#x27;s created in the sheet. But you&#x27;re right that once the marbles and the steel ball get to a point where one of the gravitational fields cannot be ignored, this framework becomes less useful.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geodesic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geodesic</a>')
