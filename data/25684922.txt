You can’t actually make any decisions based on it because the data you need to know if it’s premature is in the future.<p>Conversely we know you can’t make an unscalable design scalable after the fact. You may be able to do micro optimizations of hotspots or fix the egregiously bad parts but you’ve painted yourself into a corner.<p>The good news is that most scalable architectures are simpler and better in most other facets of the design so it’s largely a false dichotomy.')
