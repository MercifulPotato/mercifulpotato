I was starting to feel crazy—how can something with this bad an API (Matplotlib) be this popular in the Python ecosystem which is known for its lack of verbosity and clarity? How can it be integrated with every other package instead of some sane alternative?<p>I tried Seaborn (a wrapper effectively), and it is way better for doing basic plots. But as soon as you get beyond that you&#x27;re back in arcane Matplotlib territory. The best thing I could have done would have been to ignore its integrations and start with a better plotting API to begin with. The little bit of extra integration effort would have been worth avoiding Matplotlib. And there are several alternatives in the Python landscape.<p>No offense to the authors—it&#x27;s clear they&#x27;ve done a lot of great work. But I think they got stuck with a bad API that they started with and it became so common-place that they were forced to continually be backwards compatible with something that really needed an overhaul.')
