My initial comment that spawned this thread addressed exactly this. I&#x27;m copying it here for reference, because it is pretty high up the thread at this point:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll give you that, but it seems like a much simpler solution would have just been improving the flexibility for an H1B worker to be allowed to work at any employer for the term of their status.<p>If an employer used an H1B in order to hire a foreign worker and then under pay them, the worker would just get another job that pays market rate, without the work status concern. Without the artificial control over the employee, H1B fraud, in this manner, wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;')
