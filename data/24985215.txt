Something I can&#x27;t ever put my finger on is the mild squalor (my opinion, not saying this is true for your relatives) people are willing to endure. Sure, they do it for &quot;maximum privacy&quot;, but can&#x27;t you achieve the same relative privacy in ways that might lead to a higher quality of life? Generating power, drilling wells, boss cashing checks, etc... I get the sense there might be some form of mental health e.g. paranoia, but that&#x27;s just a guess. I&#x27;d be really interested to hear your take on it if you don&#x27;t mind sharing.')
