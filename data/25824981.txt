Even when purchasing shelter, people are not sufficiently informed to be able to make a good decision, hence the existence of electrical, plumbing, and structural codes and inspections.<p>With healthcare, people are extremely uninformed.  The costs are extremely high.  The government doesn’t necessarily need to vet the doctors’ diagnoses and prescribed remedies, but they could.
