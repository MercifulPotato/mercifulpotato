There are inherent relationships between various parts of eCommerce entities and it becomes very hard if just using noSQL with all the integrity constraints defined in application.<p>This is one of the reason many companies moved back to relational model after dabbling with noSQL. I believe the best way to model it is to use something like PostgreSQL with jsonb docs for some type of data.<p>If you are interested in noSQL database may be give a try to reactioncommerce (acquired recently), you will begin to hit limitations soon, given integrity constraint and ACID compliance becomes very important for some type of eCommerce data e.g. changing prices and inventory in real time which are consistent and correct. It becomes extremely hard and complex to manage it in application code, which comes free with relational database model.')
