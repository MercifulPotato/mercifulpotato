I love reading interviews like this because they always give away a bit of the secret sauce that enables people like Knuth to be so creative, and passionate about their fields. I thought this quote was especially awesome, because you get to understand that what one sees on the surface, is not the whole picture, especially for someone like Knuth.<p>&quot;I think that what I’m most guilty of is that I say something but I say it in such a smooth way \nthat people don’t realize that I’m being precise. They think I’m being informal when I’m really \nmeaning every syllable.&quot;')
