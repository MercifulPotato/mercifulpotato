However, there&#x27;s also the cost of an engineer&#x27;s time that you have to weigh. Is it cost effective to ask a dev who is paid $100,000 &#x2F; year to spend a week to save $1,000 &#x2F; year on your AWS bill? Probably not. That week of their time costs $2,000 and could be spent making progress on features or products that will make you more money instead.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;ve personally spent a week of time that saved my employer six figures per year in hosting costs, which is definitely worth it.')
