I mean, I live in the midwest too, where it used to be possible to get a modest home in the burbs for about that price.  But those homes are now gone, they disappeared over the past few years as they were purchased in all-cash transactions by flippers who threw some paint and flooring in them before selling them for twice the price.<p>Housing in the cheap areas is being hit really hard.  Lots of areas are seeing coastal-levels of YoY price inflation.  Mine is ~18% YoY according to Zillow.')
