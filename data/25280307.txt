Docker runtime imposes a lot of opinionated defaults on containers that are often unwanted by infrastructure projects. (For example docker will automatically edit the &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts file in containers, in a way that makes little sense for Kubernetes, so Kubernetes has to implement a silly work around to avoid this.)<p>Instead Docker Inc recommends using containerd as the runtime. containerd implements downloading, unpacking, creating CRI manifests, and running the resulting containers all without implementing docker&#x27;s opinionated defaults on top. Docker itself uses containerd to actually run the containers, and plans to remove it downloading code in favor of using the one from containerd too.<p>The only advantage to using docker proper for infrastructure projects is that you can use the docker cli for introspection and debugging. Kubernetes has created its own very similar cli that works with all supported backend runtimes, and also can include relevant Kubernetes specific information in outputs.')
