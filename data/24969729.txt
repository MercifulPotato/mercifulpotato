We even live in an urban area that is pretty bike hostile, car obsessed, hilly. We have one car that we share and the other bikes&#x2F;walks when needed.<p>There have only been two or three times over the course of about 7 years that having two cars would have been nice, but it obviously didn&#x27;t make that big of a deal.<p>It&#x27;s definitely helped keep us healthier as well, particularly compared to our similar aged friend group (~30 years old). We&#x27;ve both gotten comments from our physicians in the last few years because of this too!')
