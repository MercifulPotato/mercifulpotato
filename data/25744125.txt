I&#x27;ll bring my rifles&quot; and &quot;What time should we meet?&quot;.<p>You&#x27;d better believe I&#x27;d &quot;oppress&quot; such speech and ban the users, and you&#x27;d be severely hard-pressed to convince me that such a response is a human rights violation. Those messages, or whatever fabricated claims were used to justify the threats therein, don&#x27;t constitute &quot;political opinions&quot; just because political parties and politicians are named. Likewise, outright false&#x2F;fabricated claims that &quot;the Democrats&quot; fraudulently&#x2F;secretly changed the result of the 2020 election are, in no way, &quot;political opinions&quot; -- rather, they are statements of (false) fact, meant to incite viewers to violence for the fabricator&#x27;s gain.<p>For me to un-publish such posts from my web site cannot be considered discrimination against a political group; it&#x27;s refusal to allow my servers to help conspirators commit a violent crime. If you want to brand something as &quot;horrific&quot; here, it should be the posts I described and not the take-downs.')
