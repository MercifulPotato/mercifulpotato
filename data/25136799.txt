Merlin is very entertaining but for someone who spends so much time talking about his life, it&#x27;s amazing how little of it he seems to grok.<p>One of the best things that has really kicked into gear my utilization of GTD and also helping with my ADHD is learning about and incorporating the Pomodoro technique with my use of Omni Focus.  I found a great little play&#x2F;work timer on Amazon for under $20 - 30 minutes on the right side, 5 minute on the left side and a big toggle button on top that reminds me of a chess timer.  It&#x27;s very satisfying to whack the physical button (no stupid touch controls here - tactile feedback baby!) at the end of a session to start the other.  Once you get into a rhythm it&#x27;s amazing what you can accomplish.<p>I also block time on my calendar with meetings to give me chunks of time when I need to get stuff done.
