Item(by='haps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611592312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25904734, text='I tried various methods and programs for several years until i found Typora for my note making, which is just a simple markdown-editor with a file-tree to the left, so i can view my different folders and switch between notes easily. I&#x27;m an introverted individual who thinks a lot about different topics almost constantly.<p>The reasons why it helps me:<p>1. Thoughts are easily forgotten. I think a lot, but i also forget a lot. Taking notes helps me to actually remember those thoughts for a later date, so that they don&#x27;t go to waste and i can act upon them.<p>2. Thoughts clutter up my brain. When i don&#x27;t write down what i think, then they pile up in my conscious and leave little space for other things i would rather focus on. This might look like i&#x27;m contradicting myself with point 1, but there is a difference between trying to not forget something and having it memorised.<p>3. Thoughts aren&#x27;t formulated in comprehensive sentences. For a lot of these thoughts i have more of a feeling that i realised something or that i&#x27;ve made a break-through somewhere. Writing them down helps me make sense out of them and internalize them more.<p>4. I write down the things that i don&#x27;t want to remember. I would rather learn about the things i really want to remember, then what function B in framework A does and how it connects to C.<p>The way i take notes is really lightweight. I have build up a simple system on how i write everything, because i don&#x27;t wanna waste my time with reorganizing and building up smart structures for my notes. I don&#x27;t bother with making them look nice, because it is meant as a second brain for me and not something i can brag about in front of other people. I don&#x27;t care about grammar or doing something the &quot;right way&quot;, the knowledge is the focus.<p>In terms of getting in the way of productivity. I noticed that i can be more productive with taking notes, because i can prevent solving the same problem twice and everything i&#x27;ve learned is easily accessible somewhere, i just gotta look for it.')
