But what&#x27;s really weird is it seems to not be available anymore. I&#x27;m guessing export restrictions or massive demand for thermal cameras during Covid along with supply chain issues. IIRC it is also 25 frames a second, which is unusually high for thermal cameras due to export restrictions.<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s a post on creating panoramic images with therm-app. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;therm-app-users&#x2F;discuss&#x2F;72157652017273862&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;groups&#x2F;therm-app-users&#x2F;discuss&#x2F;721576...</a>')
