An anectodtal example, I&#x27;ve been thrown some racial &amp; very insensitive slurs at sports bar&#x2F;convenience store late night, but seeing the person&#x2F;the state the person throwing the slur is in (intoxicated) can make it way easier to just brush it off. Being thrown an insult in say, StackOverflow by someone that have provable trackrecord of excellence can be quite more demoralizing.<p>The absence&#x2F;existence of additional information about the person throwing the slur can make the whole difference, and that can exist&#x2F;not exist on both internet and real life.')
