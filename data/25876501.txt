React.createElement -&gt; Sub-classing the Component class -&gt; &quot;just use hooks everywhere&quot; in the span of a few years? Sure, Django went from function-based to class-based views, but the change was far less abrupt, and you can still use functional views if you want to.<p>As for TypeScript, I agree it&#x27;s amazing, but it&#x27;s neither a framework nor a library for building web applications. It&#x27;s more of a superset&#x2F;transpiler. It makes working with Node&#x2F;React&#x2F;Express better, but it doesn&#x27;t replace them.<p>With regard to Express, it&#x27;s decent, but e.g. do we really need to torture newcomers by expecting them to know they&#x27;ll need to also include&#x2F;install and require body-parser? I mean, why would I be using a web framework, even a micro-one, if I&#x27;m expected to bring in a separate tool just for parsing requests?<p>Regarding the suggestion that I like Python more, I would gladly choose TypeScript over Python (the typing tools there  are still immature) if there was less churn in the JS ecosystem. Deno is promising. :)')
