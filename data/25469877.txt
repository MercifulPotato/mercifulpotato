Stonepunk?  It seems a sufficiently advanced society could have Antikythera type computing mechanisms ground from stone.  And extravagant &quot;wood&quot;-working artifacts shaped by sharp stone tools (obsidian single point turning tools for your lathe?).  So you could have advanced looms for textiles, etc..  And then without metals you don&#x27;t have electrical conduction, but what could you do with electrostatics?  And telescope and microscope optics seem in the realm of possibilities.  How much of our chemistry knowledge depends on metals?  Could we have genetic engineering without metals?  Interesting.')
