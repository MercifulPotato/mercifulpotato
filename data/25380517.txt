UPS is solving for &quot;What is the best way to safely deliver packages to 300 addresses&quot;. There are a lot of ways to do cover that ground effectively without too much waste. The routes UPS drivers share little resemblance to the way normal people drive.<p>I&#x27;m solving for &quot;How do I get to work&quot; or &quot;How to get to the grocery store&quot;. I&#x27;m taking the highway 80% of the distance, then my work is on the left... do I take 3 right turns to get there circling a potentially large city block? The UPS driver might well have stops on those side streets, I don&#x27;t.<p>The idea behind this is sound, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily apply to the way individuals who aren&#x27;t driving package routes should drive.')
