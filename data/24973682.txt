I was outright asking.<p>&gt; I pointed out why.<p>By adding a non-existent condition that doesn&#x27;t follow and using it as a reason.<p>That&#x27;s unless you&#x27;re saying that if the remaining lower-caste also used these neutral names, that would <i>cause</i> the upper-caste that had chosen to also adopt these neutral names to return to using the upper-caste names.<p>What&#x27;s wrong with having these neutral names be used by <i>many</i> of the upper-caste (as they apparently are) and also <i>all</i> of the lower-caste? Am I not making sense? Because that&#x27;s the scenario I was asking about.')
