Half of the things on the Shakti mailing list are just Arthur getting really excited about how significantly he&#x27;s beating x or y or z in performance and giving numbers for it. `grep`ping it now I see 40 in half a year that explicitly contain the word &quot;benchmark,&quot; though not all of these are comparing to other things (some are just comparing to different k releases), and there are more comparisons without that word.<p>Arthur doesn&#x27;t work at Kx anymore, by the way. He&#x27;s at Shakti now. Shakti has a different (but still draconian&#x2F;non-(A)GPL) license. It probably doesn&#x27;t have the benchmark clause, but I don&#x27;t care enough to check (I prefer J to k and don&#x27;t have a proprietary k on my system).')
