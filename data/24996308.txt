They lost everything, even though the husband grew up on a family farm. Common sense isn&#x27;t that common.<p>On the other hand, I have friends who grew flowers until weed was legalized, and they switched crops and are making millions now. Already had the land, greenhouses and equipment, just changed the seeds one year. Bam!')
