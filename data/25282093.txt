Don&#x27;t choose any pattern of numbers as you are exposing yourself to having to share the win with other people. Don&#x27;t choose a date as it is more probable somebody will also chose a valid date than a completely random set of numbers. Don&#x27;t choose digits from your favorite irrational number, for the same reason.<p>Ideally, choose numbers that no other person is likely to choose. Not exactly random. Maybe generate a random sequence and check if you can see a pattern, do a search on the Internet, etc.')
