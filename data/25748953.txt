What you are failing to answer is that the people who think it&#x27;s not raining outside are refusing to apply any critical thinking; no amount of &quot;neutrality&quot; will fix that.<p>To go back to your topic about BLM; your counter-issues have been addressed many times. Remember that Kapernick started kneeling in 2016, during Obama, protesting to criminal justice reform. BLM activists had continually made the case that police reform is needed given:<p>1. Black communities are over-policed and black Americans were targets, for reasons including generating more revenue. [1]<p>2. White victims such as Daniel Shaver [2] received major media coverage from BLM and mainstream media.<p>I could sit here and list of articles and anecdotes about the BLM movement - and you can research them as well; but the solution comes with discussing police reform and as you can imagine they are certain institutions who do not want to have that conversation. The problem is, just how it&#x27;s raining outside, despite evidence for it, the &quot;not raining outside&quot; crowd will continue to regurgitate the same arguments like the one you have espoused. And in this 4 years of trying to convince them that it&#x27;s not raining outside we have hardly made a dent in the issue. At this point you can only make the assumption that one side is acting in bad faith; and if that&#x27;s the case why should anyone give a neutral position to bad faith actors? That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a solution - it&#x27;s not that the other side is &quot;misinformed&quot;, but they are actively impeding progress with bad faith arguments - in order to prevent having to reform our profitable criminal justice system and their attempts to tell us to be &quot;neutral&quot; is simply an attempt for them to slide us backwards.<p>How do you play neutral with a corporation that is dumping radioactive waste in your lakes?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;opa&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;attachments&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;04&#x2F;ferguson_police_department_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;opa&#x2F;press-releas...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theroot.com&#x2F;horrific-video-showing-arizona-cops-execution-style-s-1821126274" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theroot.com&#x2F;horrific-video-showing-arizona-cops-...</a>')
