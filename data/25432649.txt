For all the various reasons [0] I don&#x27;t use chrome any more.<p>I just downloaded Brave for my main web-development browser (...via finding the latest release on their GitHub page, since they insist on doing an admin-only install on the mac, grr...) in hopes that it&#x27;s actually faster than Firefox, and uses less memory (so they claim).<p>After startup, Firefox (that I&#x27;d been doing a day&#x27;s dev on, so this is totally unfair, but I&#x27;ll keep an eye on Brave) was using ~450M, and Brave ~140M.<p>Has the chrome-style dev tools, so that&#x27;s nice.  Don&#x27;t care about the &quot;rewards&quot; thing, since it won&#x27;t be my main browser.<p>Do you use it? What do you think?<p>I&#x27;m not affiliated with the Brave folks in any way, just curious.<p>Thanks!<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromeisbad.com')
