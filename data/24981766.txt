I think that applies to any host who doesn&#x27;t patch their vulnerabilities - if they thought it was a big deal, they&#x27;d do something about it. Actions speak.<p>Quoting from the post:<p><pre><code>  2020-07-21 Report sent to Github and triaged by Github security team. Disclosure date is set for 2020-10-18.\n\n  2020-08-13 Project Zero requests a status update.\n\n  2020-08-21 Github say that they are are still working on a fix and a deprecation plan\n\n  2020-10-01  Github issued an advisory[1] deprecating the vulnerable commands, assigned CVE-2020-15228, and asked users to patch and update their workflows.\n\n  2020-10-12 Project Zero reach out and proactively mentions that a grace period is available if Github wants more time to disable the vulnerable commands.\n\n  2020-10-16 Github requested the additional 14 day grace period, with the hope of disabling the vulnerable commands after 2020-10-19.\n\n  2020-10-16 Project Zero grants grace period, new disclosure date is 2020-11-02.\n\n  2020-10-28 Project Zero reaches out, noting the deadline expires next week. No response is received.\n\n  2020-10-30 Due to no response and the deadline closing in, Project Zero reaches out to other informal Github contacts. The response is that the issue is considered fixed and that we are clear to go public on 2020-11-02 as planned.\n\n  2020-11-01 Github responds and mentions that they won&#x27;t be disabling the vulnerable commands by 2020-11-02. They request an additional 48 hours, not to fix the issue, but to notify customers and determine a &quot;hard date&quot; at some point in the future.\n\n  2020-11-02 Project Zero responds that there is no option to further extend the deadline as this is day 104 (90 days + 14 day grace extension) and that the disclosure will be today.</code></pre>')
