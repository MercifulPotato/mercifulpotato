Kha does cross platform, hardware accelerated graphics like Skija (it abstracts OpenGL, Metal, and Vulkan). Haxe UI adds a DOM, standard components, CSS styling, etc. I&#x27;ve found it good (the small Haxe community makes author interaction brilliant), though not perfect. Great for the number of people behind it.<p>Using Haxe, the apps can be compiled for native or run in JS. That probably lands it in about the performance category of JVM or above, not that performance is the key factor here.<p>I worked awhile ago on Haxe UI&#x27;s text field emulation, and there are many tiny details that are easily missed. Line wrapping, text selection, keyboard controls (Home and End), everything. I think those details being spot on are as important as UI styling for most real users.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Kode&#x2F;Kha" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Kode&#x2F;Kha</a>\n[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haxeui.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haxeui.org&#x2F;</a>')
