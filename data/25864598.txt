As a similar example, instead of writing &quot;req.source = host + port&quot;, people would write:<p><pre><code>    if (host == &quot;load-balancer-1.internal.dns&quot;) {\n        req.source = HOSTS::LOAD_BALANCER_1;\n        req.source += PORT_MAPPING[HOSTS::LOAD_BALANCER_1];\n    }\n    else if (host == &quot;load-balancer-2.internal.dns&quot;) {\n        &#x2F;&#x2F; repeat\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAfter a few quarters of services, layers, and people being added and removed, it becomes a 500-line monstrosity and sits in every critical path.  And because now it&#x27;s a 500-line class (half of which is defunct, but good luck figuring out which half), nobody has time to read through it and figure out that it should have been a single assignment statement.')
