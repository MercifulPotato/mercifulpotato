I&#x27;ve decided to start a blog where I will go deep on subjects that many of us professionals find interesting but which we don&#x27;t have the time to learn about. I will go deep on these subjects and digest them for you without removing the substance. The first subject I decided to tackle was quantum computing, how it works, and how it breaks the secure internet. You will get the most out of this post if you have a CS or Math background but I&#x27;ve tried to keep the content approachable. Please let me know what you think and I would love suggestions for a next topic. All opinions and content my own.')
