I don&#x27;t know if we can count on individual companies to just do the right thing. They might be risk-averse, afraid of financial losses, but we need them to go full-steam ahead. Pfizer and Moderna should definitely be financially compensated for everything they produce. We could pay them above cost and basically guarantee their financial success in this operation.<p>It&#x27;s possible that the current generation of vaccines could end up being outdated, and there could be some amount of waste, but the important thing is the production rate. When an updated vaccine becomes available, we want to be able to produce it and distribute it as fast as possible.<p>On another note, there&#x27;s also research into oral vaccines. IMO that would be amazing if it could pan out. Imagine if we could just mail people capsules containing booster doses updated for the latest strain every month. We&#x27;d crush any pandemic in no time.')
