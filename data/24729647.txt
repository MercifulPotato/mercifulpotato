Every US president has a go and having yet another attempt doesnâ€™t win anyone awards until real results &amp; a resolution between the parties involved in the conflict is achieved.<p>There was no big win here, Bahrain &amp; UAE already had relationships with Israel, they were not in conflict. At best it can be described as possibly a small contributing factor to a future solution, if many other, much bigger and more relevant arrangements can be made. In reality not much has progressed. If anything, the few handshakes and promises made were a smokescreen for the unhappy status quo to go on as it was before.')
