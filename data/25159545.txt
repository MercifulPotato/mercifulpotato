And basically killed that too. (I&#x27;ve never done a Skype during Covid. Done plenty Zooms.)<p>My $0.02:<p>Skype (for private usage) is still around, and I still sometimes boot it up (to e.g. call my family or recruiters).<p>Skype for Business is in process of being killed by MS Teams. I only had one call on SfB recently - and it was by far the technically worst experience. Interruptions, people had to turn off webcams to conserve throughput for audio etc.<p>MS Teams works surprisingly well. I&#x27;ve not had any technical trouble with it during the pandemic, and it&#x27;s (together with Zoom) the most popular choice.<p>(I might be biased since I applied to many companies with a MS tech focus)')
