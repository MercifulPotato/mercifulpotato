People who don&#x27;t deserve the moniker started self applying it.<p>I&#x27;m not a hacker, I&#x27;m a corporate shill because I work for my own profit within a system that&#x27;s set up to ensure its own continuity.  I&#x27;d like to be a hacker, but I have a family to support and am too weak or addicted to lifestyle or scared or realistically-minded to actually commit to what&#x27;s required to earn the title of hacker.  Same with anyone working towards advertising, marketing, consumer data collection.  Doesn&#x27;t matter how intelligently you solve a problem in those fields, ain&#x27;t no starry eyed kids ever wanted to grow up to make the world a better place by more accurately identifying and individuals preferences on the internet.<p>Fuck fake hackers.  The best thing I&#x27;ve done with my life is being a good husband to a teacher.')
