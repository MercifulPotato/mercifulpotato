At 1024x768 especially, the pixel rate (47 MP&#x2F;s at 60Hz) and framebuffer size (2.3MB at 24bpp) are just too big even for large MCUs.<p>APs are the right tool for the job. It&#x27;s true that for hobbyists, documentation is lacking and DSI is complex to get started with. The best solution would probably extend DSI with something like EDID. DSI displays can then be plug-and-play (like HDMI &#x2F; DP) using an universal driver.<p>Another option is eDP, but it&#x27;s not so common on cheap APs or screens.')
