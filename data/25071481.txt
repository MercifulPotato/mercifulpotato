Isn&#x27;t Florida supposed to be wiped out - they re-opened months ago!  Remember a few weeks ago when Alabama made headlines for almost being at capacity?  What happened with that?  You forgot about it alraedy, didn&#x27;t you?<p>Where are the death and hospital surges that were supposed to happen after Easter, spring break, Memorial Day, July 4th, Sturgis, and on and on?  Georgia&#x27;s schools have been open for months how are they doing?<p>You are simply scared of whatever the media tells you to be scared about that day.  It&#x27;s a mix of funny, fun, scary, and frightening to watch the media drag people around by the nose like this.')
