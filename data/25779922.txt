And if for some reason you cannot leverage any of that either, the languages are still great on their own. Pattern matching and immutability are a joy, developers feel productive within the existing frameworks, and so on.<p>My car can go 260km&#x2F;h but I never went past 140km&#x2F;h (speed limit where I live) and I still love it (the best car I ever had).')
