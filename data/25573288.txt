Item(by='oarsinsync', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609267748, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25573012, text='&gt; One thing we&#x27;ve seen over the last century of western civilization is that cheaper wins over better. Cheaper toasters that don&#x27;t last, cheaper fridges that break down after their three-year warranty is up, cheaper laptops that come infected with bloatware and adware. If Apple refused to manufacture in China because of forced labour issues, then they&#x27;d lose out on sales to companies who kept benefitting from it, because consumers, as a whole, just don&#x27;t give a shit.<p>Apple customers have made it very clear that as a whole, they are not price conscious. Better beats cheaper, or theyâ€™d be all using cheapo Android phones.<p>Apple has very high profit margins compared to their competitors in the same industries. Apple can pay their suppliers more, rather than driving them down to the bone, which <i>of course</i> results in workers being exploited.<p>Or they could be more transparent that the only thing that matters is the size of their profits, instead of cultivating a good guy corporate image, as the hypocrisy stinks.')
