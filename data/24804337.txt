Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602877657, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24803401, text='&gt;You&#x27;re trying to get away from a service and tourism economy where everyone else is (somewhat rightfully) out to screw you for every dollar you&#x27;re worth.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t characterize this as someone trying to &quot;screw&quot; someone.  It&#x27;s just a consequence of demand outstripping supply, and hence the way society allocates the resources in low supply is by who can pay the highest prices.<p>If anyone comes up with a better way to allocate scarce resources, I&#x27;d love to know.')
