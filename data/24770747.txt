Such books are good for gathering a general knowledge about &quot;systems design&quot;, but you will be still clueless about the differences between Kafka and Rabbitmq until you actually read their documentation manuals.<p>There is no shortcut I&#x27;m afraid. If you want to &quot;understand seemingly endless options when it comes to data handling on backend side&quot; you will have to read the corresponding seemingly endless documentation manuals. How else would you know about the advantages or disadvantages of, let&#x27;s say, InfluxDB over Postgres if you don&#x27;t read their manuals?')
