But that&#x27;s not really the key point, it&#x27;s just how we feel. These features act as premium goodies, like old cruise control or whatever. People buy them, use them. They generate data. User-developer feedback loops. That&#x27;s already a fact. The debate is about the importance of this .<p>The core debate (of this article: waymo_v_tesla), is about technology paths. Do you start with driver assist and move up the Ls gradually as units are produced, KMs are accumulated and dollars come in? Alternatively, do you get as close as possible with a prototype and then closer with the next one..? worry about financial&#x2F;product viability once you have a working archetype.<p>This dovetails with the lidar question.<p>Ultimately, I find the disagreement fascinating. There&#x27;s probably value in having these two throwing their weight into opposing camps. IDK which approach will win in self driving. Every technology is its own example.<p>That said, I like Elon&#x27;s approach as a generality. To me, it&#x27;s about thinking of technology and invention as an industrial&#x2F;societal effort rather than a lab effort... even if reduced to <i>a</i> lab at <i>a</i> company. Learning curves exist. Feedback loops exist. A technology with products and customer and usage progresses, often.<p>You could not have &quot;produced&quot; Moore&#x27;s law the Waymo way, most likely.')
