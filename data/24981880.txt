Item(by='spoiler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604425199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24980080, text='Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not an UX designer&#x2F;analyst, but I&#x27;ve worked with people from the field closely.<p>&gt; I fully disagree. Consenting to a usability study means I want to provide feedback and actively state what I&#x27;m doing, why I&#x27;m doing it, and what I didn&#x27;t expect.<p>This is fine for an UX study that conducts in-person interviews as _one_ of the methods. This method is almost useless on its own, mostly because people behave differently when they know they&#x27;re being observed (eg they do things in a more &quot;optimal way&quot; in order to avoid looking stupid in front of the person conducting the study).<p>Also, while active feedback is valuable, it can be harder to interpret. People say A, but mean B and then do something between A and B or just do C. Not because they&#x27;re malicious, but because that was what came to mind when they tried to express something or just didn&#x27;t know better, so there&#x27;s an unintentional misalignment between intent, action, and what was expressed.<p>&gt; It does not mean I want you to see what I do, where I leave my mouse, what I click on, what input I type -- and what input I then delete. If I wanted that then I would take screenshots or a video and share that.<p>This is exactly the type of thing you (as a designer) _want_ to know in order to identify friction and remove it. Obviously, you track what the user types only under certain conditions. An example would be, a number input: do user always type the same&#x2F;similar values or increments of some values (isolated per user), should the input offer pre-defined incementors or buttons that just fill-and-submit it instantly (you&#x27;d do AB tests to see which work better then), etc.<p>I fully understand your concern about privacy, but not everything is run by reprobates who sell user&#x27;s data. Sometimes &quot;observing&quot; is the best&#x2F;easiest way to learn how to improve a user&#x27;s experience.')
