However, I personally would never pay for analytics more than what I pay for domain+hosting. Also, the niche of mid-priced analytics is already rather full - SimpleAnalytics, Fathom, Plausible etc. But there is nothing for casual bloggers&#x2F;developers, who a) value their users privacy enough to pay for it b) do not have a budget to pay 200€ annually.<p>I think the similar problem exists in many areas and that&#x27;s what stops people from moving away from Google and such - abscence of really cheap, simplified alternatives. For example, I wouldn&#x27;t pay too much for the email, no matter how good it is. But I would pay 1€&#x2F;month without a doubt. It&#x27;s how we perceive the value of the product. No way the number of visitors of my humble blog is worth more than my cellphone data plan or my gym. But I realise that there are people who could say that analytics should cost more than a cup of coffee.')
