There is nothing wrong with shorting a market. If the short is wrong, she loses money. The market remains balanced and often short squeezes are responsible for large bull runs.<p>Tether however isn&#x27;t balanced. There is no risk. There is no offsetting liability in the market for the Tether they create (unlike with a short future, which has an offsetting long side).')
