In fact, if no current was flowing, the resistor would cool down,” Thibado explained. “What we did was reroute the current in the circuit and transform it into something useful.”<p>Based on this I understood that it&#x27;d indeed cool down and create a heat gradient if it wasn&#x27;t doing any work, but the difference it&#x27;d create is instead used to induce a current, which means it probably wouldn&#x27;t cool down as long as that potential is used in this way instead (?)')
