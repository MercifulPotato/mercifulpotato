The goal was to not fully wake myself up, so I kept all the lights off. But since I was up anyway... why not have a little midnight of that leftover birthday cake on the counter?<p>I cut a slice in the dark kitchen and took a big bite. Why does this cake taste exactly like bleu cheese? OH SHIT.<p>Turned on the light and discovered I was eating cake covered in giant blotches of blue-black mold. It took a long time to get the taste out of my mouth.')
