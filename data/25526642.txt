This is incredibly useful to me as a Unity developer. Can almost be plugged right in to C# &amp; Unity Colors. Could be used for interesting real-time color effects. One of my favorite simple things to do in HSV is to animate the hue. This could be used to do something similar, but across that more attractive Oklab gradient.<p>Great post.')
