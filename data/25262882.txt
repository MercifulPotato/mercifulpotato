It&#x27;s important to consider how regulation comes about, how that process shapes the regulation, how research gets funded, and so on.<p>Our modern economic landscape of conglomeration over competition is important. It came about in part because of regulation, but repealing regulation would not undo it and return us to a Renaissance of competitive independent businesses. This strained, rigid, highly interconnected economy has made it so that only the big institutions can afford to take substantial risks, and already being the giant wealth funnels that they are, there&#x27;s little incentive to take those risks.<p>The greater the share of the economy made up by giant interconnected businesses with an aligned profit motive, the less risk taking, disruption, and innovation there will be. You shouldn&#x27;t need to be Elon to be entrepreneurial at the cutting edge, but you do, because you can&#x27;t compete with Elon. You shouldn&#x27;t need to have Amazon&#x27;s resources, but you do. Looser regulations are moot.')
