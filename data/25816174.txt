Item(by='humbledrone', descendants=None, kids=[25816585, 25817392, 25816512, 25819954], score=None, time=1610924628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25815975, text='The problem I have had more with &quot;free&quot; on Craigslist is that I get a lot of super-flakey people who reply immediately and then don&#x27;t show up to take the item after a bunch of coordination effort. I&#x27;ve stopped listing items for free on Craigslist, and I either (1) list it for a more-than-fair but nonzero price, or (2) put it out on the street with a sign that says &quot;free&#x27; (only for items that will obviously disappear quickly). Adding the price on Craigslist seems to weed out the worst flakiness-offenders.')
