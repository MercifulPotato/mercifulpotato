Item(by='bayindirh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607727143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25392152, text='&gt; I wondered if you&#x27;d omitted it because it wasn&#x27;t present in those people you knew.<p>Yes, I only mentioned people which were consistent with the TIV template in the article.<p>&gt; I kind of wonder though, if the way we end up classifying these things is unreasonably influenced by the existing classifications which maybe just sort of coalesced from observations that psychologists have made of their patients. Since they&#x27;re often things that people won&#x27;t get treated or don&#x27;t even think of as disorders.<p>Unfortunately, It&#x27;s possible. Moreover, some traits are not considered as illnesses until it starts to affect one&#x27;s life (hoarding, some forms of OCD, etc.).<p>Another problem is, as noted by some other comments, TIV looks like a siamese twin of narcissism when looked from a specific angle. It might be just narcissism without self esteem, or as I&#x27;ve seen in one person might be completely different trait because it can be devoid of narcissistic traits or  traces while being <i>extremely efficient</i> in draining someone without giving itself away until just before the victim <i>proverbially</i> dies.<p>Since psychology is not an exact science, it&#x27;ll always be up to debate I think, however this trait is a good candidate to think well on. It&#x27;s much more common than it seems.')
