Even if some of us do now, most people who used those machines <i>never</i> understood them.<p>I do agree with you in essence - I want that simplicity back, but I don’t miss actually using those machines.  I wrote some quite complex software in BASIC, and have no desire to return to that.<p>I want something  with the immediacy and programmability of that era, but with modern capabilities and programming concepts.')
