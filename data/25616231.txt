So if you can render X frames in parallel such that they all finish in 24 hours, that&#x27;s roughly equivalent to saying you can render one of those frames in 24h&#x2F;X.<p>Of course I&#x27;m sure things like I&#x2F;O and art-team-workflow hugely complicate the story at this scale, but I still doubt there&#x27;s a meaningful concept of &quot;wall-clock time for one frame&quot; that doesn&#x27;t change with the number of available cores.')
