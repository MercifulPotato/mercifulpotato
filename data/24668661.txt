For example, due to America&#x27;s pressure and as a part of the New NAFTA negotiations, Canada agreed to increase its copyright term from life + 50 to life + 70 years. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if what was once legal in France has become illegal since.<p>Decades ago, US decided it wanted banks everywhere to follow American regulations. It was a resounding success. That&#x27;s why US can now block Iran from trading with the rest of the world through national legislation rather than international sanctions, or make Canada hand over a Chinese national to be prosecuted in the US for alleged crimes done in Hong Kong. Now that banking is done, the new frontier is intellectual property. I expect national laws everywhere to one by one become like US laws.')
