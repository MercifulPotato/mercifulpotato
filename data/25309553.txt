Item(by='gioele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607123342, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25288303, text='The technical term for this kind of markup is &quot;stand-off markup&quot; or &quot;stand-off annotation&quot;.<p>There is wealth of research done on stand-off markup since the SGML times, with a renaissance in 2005-2010.<p>Historically, the main drawback (as highlighted by other comments) is that stand-off needs a way to refer to the content, i.e. a pointing mechanism. Pointers in a pointing mechanism can be either a) hard to write but easy to maintain or b) simple to write but prone to breaking after a change (and thus requiring support from authoring tools). Nobody has found a viable ergonomic balance yet.')
