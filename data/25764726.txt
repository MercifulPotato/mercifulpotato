Item(by='beagle3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610557076, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25762972, text='&gt; I think the only thing that I would miss is the apps can dismiss notifications that are no longer relevant.<p>That&#x27;s something I was thinking about a lot a few years ago.<p>I think this could work with a tiny email extension: If the email would include 2 extra header called e.g. &quot;X-Revisable-by-public-key: &lt;public key here&gt;&quot; and &quot;X-Revision-signature: &lt;signed sha512&#x2F;256 hash of message&gt;&quot;; Then, a future message with the same message ID (or perhaps X-Revises-Message-ID:...) properly signed, would replace a previous message in the notification UI - perhaps giving an indication&#x2F;view of the previous revisions.<p>A mail client that does not support this header would simply not dismiss the no-longer relevant notifications but would still be fully compatible&#x2F;capable, and the &quot;message read&quot; among different clients would still operate properly.<p>The main thing that makes me cringe about using email for everything, e.g. things like delta.chat, is that I accidentally do &quot;view source&quot; on one-body-line messages: The modern overhead hurts my engineering sensibilities. Seems like Google easily adds 3K of envelope and metadata to a 120 character email. Acceptable as transport for a 3MB email with attachment; Unacceptable for a 6-char &quot;ok lol&quot; delta.chat message.')
