Arguably the only evolutionary benefit of intelligence is the ability to bridge troughs between local optima farther than genetics alone can. It has limits as much as genetics does. We like to think of intelligence as some boundless forever bootstrapping superpower but all growth curves end up being sigmoid. The hard question is are we close to topping out or are we just waiting on the next punctuation in the equilibrium. I think future punctuations will be found in &quot;what comes after intelligence&quot; in the search for increasingly efficient energy utilization?')
