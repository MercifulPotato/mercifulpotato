There could&#x27;ve been a moment in society where people where supportive about it, when the costs weren&#x27;t clear enough. However, once the taxpayers realized these were not only huge endeavours, but had huge costs just for the rush of being the first at all costs + many catastrophic system accidents... clearly society put these things on hold.<p>Now, society is getting back to explore science more and more, but with a better, lasting attitude. See, for example, Space X. Likely, they&#x27;ll send someone to Mars without deaths or even huge accidents that could only be justified by a lack of financial responsibility in NASA&#x27;s early days.')
