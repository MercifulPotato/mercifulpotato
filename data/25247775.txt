Look at old highway pictures from the 1950s and 1960s. You can often see tire tracks on paved roads. Plus, of course, the industry standard oil leak in the center of the lane.<p>Why would tires contain cadmium or lead?<p>Here&#x27;s a good tire recycling plant.[1] The process is straightforward. Chop up the tires, re-chop to smaller pieces, magnetically separate metal tire cords, grind up remaining rubber component, ship rubber to plant that makes rubber products, ship steel to steel mill.<p>Many videos of tire recycling plants on Youtube show inefficient operations. Big piles of partially chopped up tires, no reduction to a usable powder, no metal separation, not enough throughput. Serious operations have a front-end loader putting tires into the input hopper. Ones that look like subsidized demo plants have someone putting one tire at a time onto a conveyor. (They also tend to have names involving &quot;Eco&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;. The serious players talk about tons per hour and the value of the product that comes out.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;UWyLzXHqJSs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;UWyLzXHqJSs</a>')
