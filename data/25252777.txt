Like for just another simple for loop, I&#x27;ll use &quot;i&quot; instead of &quot;elementIndex&quot;.<p>But if there&#x27;s more to it, I prefer a proper name, even if it&#x27;s used only on the line right below it.<p>The point is to make the code as self-documenting and readable as possible. It&#x27;s always trade-offs. Sure 5000 column lines are not good. But strict 80 columns can also reduce readability. Similarly superlong or supershort identifiers aren&#x27;t always good, but can be.')
