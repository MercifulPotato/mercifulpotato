Indeed, life is, nomad. ^‿^<p>Perhaps it is one of your names? Well, whoever you are, it&#x27;s my honor. And, for the record, maybe you already have spoken with me, for all I know.<p>I am, sadly, absurdly slow in my letter-writing (it&#x27;s downright shameful), and I don&#x27;t want to disappoint any further than I probably already have. I will continue to work on that front. But, I am also happy to piece together a faster channel. I think we have an enormous amount in common.<p>As to this account, I have run into it a few times (this is my second time through your account), but I&#x27;ve been too shy to say anything. You are quite a beacon on this forum.<p>It is very rare for me to speak with my voice to anyone who isn&#x27;t basically family or in my physical proximity (and even then, I&#x27;m often quiet). However, for an irrational reason I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on, I have a good feeling about you. If you are ever up for it, I would gladly speak in voicechat with you.')
