Fortunately it strikes at nine every morning.”<p>With writing (as with many things), there is this myth that you should only do it when inspiration compels you to write. But that is total rubbish. You need to create conditions so that inspiration will strike, and creating a habit of writing frequently will lay the groundwork for inspiration striking. Tyler Cowen, for example, talks about how he writes every morning - whether it&#x27;s the weekend, Christmas, or anything else [1]. This is an example you agree with his philosophy&#x2F;economics or not.<p>Other recommendations:<p>- &quot;War of Art&quot; is a fun little book that lays this idea out, and frames what&#x27;s stopping you from creating as &quot;resistance&quot;[2]. In the end, the book can be summarized as: create and stick to a daily ritual of creation. If you do that long enough, you&#x27;ll create something worthwhile.<p>- Someone else posted Writing Streak [3] which can be fun to use as well.<p>- Others use Julia Cameron&#x27;s &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Way&quot; [4] (&quot;morning pages&quot;) to develop a &quot;daily writing practice&quot;.<p>Honestly, they are all the same. No matter what you choose to do, the most important thing is <i>consistency</i>! Do it enough and you&#x27;ll get to some level of ability and more than a few finished pieces (Can&#x27;t guarantee a Nobel Prize in Literature, though, unfortunately :&#x2F; )<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.writingroutines.com&#x2F;tyler-cowen&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.writingroutines.com&#x2F;tyler-cowen&#x2F;</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_War_of_Art_(book)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_War_of_Art_(book)</a><p>3: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writingstreak.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;writingstreak.io&#x2F;</a><p>4: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Artist&#x27;s_Way" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Artist&#x27;s_Way</a>')
