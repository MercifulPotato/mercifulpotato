I specifically do not want to use Pulumi. The dependency validation wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to implement, but all the inter-resource and feature-specific logic would need to be duplicated.<p>The reason I won&#x27;t use Pulumi is 1) licensing and 2) corporate ownership. I&#x27;d rather use CloudFormation.')
