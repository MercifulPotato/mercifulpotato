Apple has gone to great lengths to reduce or eliminate the static electricity risk by integrating a special IC into the cable. The contact wear issue has not been addressed by them. Many of the cables I have show signs of eroded contacts and I think that is the main reason why some cables of mine have failed.<p>The USB-C connector surrounds the contacts with a mechanical shield that protects them from fingers or anything else. This is a standard connector design that has been used on pretty much every connector. It is boring, but it works.<p>The Lightning is great engineering, but is ultimately let down by the radical design IMHO.<p>BTW, I am also an electrical engineer that has designed MFI accessories and uses iPhones.')
