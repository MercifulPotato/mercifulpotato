Especially as it can be subtle and difficult to tease out the reasons we do things and make snap judgments.  When your mind tells you &quot;he just didn&#x27;t seem like &#x27;an engineer&#x27;&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t think he was a culture-fit&quot; or &quot;I got a bad vibe about how he&#x27;d treat the rental property&quot; --- we don&#x27;t necessarily see the chain to [because he&#x27;s black and not able in this instant to look 3x more professional than would be required of an equivalent white candidate for a positive impression].  There&#x27;s no <i>intention</i> there, even if the outcome is racist.  And in this scenario, it&#x27;s not impossible for the black person to get hired, but the bar is unconsciously higher.  That&#x27;s one reason why this is all so insidious and so hard.<p>&gt; Someone who buys a chicken sandwich only because they want a chicken sandwich has no such motive or intent.<p>Someone might have a hell of a lot more idea why they want a chicken sandwich than why they are making subtly biased decisions against disadvantaged people.')
