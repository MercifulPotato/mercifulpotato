They can be running in parallel with the same SQL inputs. You can have provisions for this in your middle ware, but there is also stuff for this in the db replication. Replaying SQL logs on test instances. It is possible to run quite sophisticated testing in this sort of setup.<p>Relying on ORM doesn&#x27;t make a difference, since you are still sending DDL commands to a live database.<p>Using stored procedures, views, and triggers makes it easier to add abstraction between your middle ware and the database structure.<p>But on the whole, I agree it&#x27;s probably not recommendable to anyone feeling hesitant about it.')
