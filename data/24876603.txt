China is building tons is alkaline electrolyzers.  Europe is looking to PEM. There are new MW-scale electrolyzers used for silicon production. There&#x27;s an active industry that is scaling and innovating and growing. Nuclear is in decline, with all the giants failing. The few startups are working on engineering projects where iteration is measured in decade time scales rather than months.<p>The hydrogen industry <i>exciting</i> right now, and honestly I can&#x27;t imagine saying that even a year ago. Europe&#x27;s investing tens of billions of dollars in it, which will result in massive changes and improvements for the technology. A similar investment in nuclear would not move the needle at all.')
