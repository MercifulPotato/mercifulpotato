After listening bits of those shows, I think having everyone on, more or less, the same audio equipment addresses my complaint about old school radio.  I always found my self having to turn up the volume to hear call-ins, and then turn it back down when the host started talking again. Having everyone dialed in via phone normalizes the audio across the host and guest somewhat. Keep up the good work!')
