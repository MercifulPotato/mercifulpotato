I want it to be as easiest to migrate (both in and out) and the most extendable experience for a Mac user (I also consider features like plugins, but I guess Apple will throw my app out of the App Store with that feature release, so I&#x27;ll do that when I&#x27;ll reach some bigger audience via App Store).<p>I don&#x27;t have any releases yet, because it&#x27;s my first that huge app. Also I&#x27;ve never been digging that deep into AppKit framework, so I enjoy writing this, but I also see a lot of downsides where I know that in future I will have to rewrite a few of complex core components of AppKit on my own.\nIt&#x27;s worth mentioning that app will operate on files (like Pages, Mindnode), not on the internal database, that would be hard to reach for an user that would like to open this file with some other apps (files are SQLite databases for now), like some SQLite manager.')
