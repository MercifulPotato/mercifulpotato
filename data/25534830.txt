A good thing MLFlow has added is auto-loggers - we also added them in our Maggy framework ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.logicalclocks.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;unifying-single-host-and-distributed-machine-learning-with-maggy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.logicalclocks.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;unifying-single-host-and-...</a> ).<p>I totally agree that where you have framework hooks, you should have provenance, but given there&#x27;s no standard for what provenance is, no defacto open-source platform, the sklearn and tf and pytorch folks rightly steer clear. We see that if you have a shared file system, you can use conventions for path names (features go in &#x27;featurestore&#x27;, training data in &#x27;training&#x27;, models in &#x27;models&#x27;, etc), to capture a ton of provenance data.')
