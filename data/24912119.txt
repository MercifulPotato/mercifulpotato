Item(by='Veserv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603833981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24911460, text='You state in a different comment chain that bus segregation does not mean no communication, so I do not understand how that is consistent with your claim that they are isolated.<p>The Jeep Cherokee also did not have only a single CAN bus as evidenced by the diagram on page 8 [1]. The problem was that the radio unit was on both CAN buses.<p>I ask for justification of your statement because you counter-argued the previous comment that stated: “It really should be illegal to have network connected cars. Any software security engineer knows that.” by stating that the safety critical systems are segregated and thus “the network bus in which your &#x27;compromised&#x27; infotainment system is able to operate is completely separate from Engine, ABS, AEB, ESP, Airbags etc.” which implies that solution achieves the desired security properties. I claim the desired security properties are: “safe enough to bet the lives of 471,000 people on them and take responsibility if they were wrong”. I think, and I think most people would agree, that is accurate assessment of the potential consequences of catastrophic failure. That is a consequence comparable to the detonation of a nuclear warhead in a city, so we should apply similar standards to the required level of security. Hardly any software engineer would make a claim that their software can be trusted with an amount of lives within 3 orders of magnitude of that number (note 3 orders of magnitude is 471 which is comparable to an airplane crash, so 3 orders of magnitude less is critical avionics level). Therefore, making a claim that implies that level of security has already been achieved is an extraordinary claim and should thus require equally extraordinary evidence to be believed.<p>Even with such justification I would still caution anybody else reading it since it would not be a legally binding claim by a liable entity, so even assuming you are commenting honestly and to the best of your knowledge  (which I assume you are), and even correctly describing the truth as it is today, there are no consequences for any liable entity if they betray your trust. It should always be up to the liable entity to justify themselves to the people to our satisfaction before deploying systems with such societal-level consequences.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;illmatics.com&#x2F;Remote%20Car%20Hacking.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;illmatics.com&#x2F;Remote%20Car%20Hacking.pdf</a>')
