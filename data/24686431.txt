In Win10 2004, if you do timeBeginPeriod(1), timers <i>in the same process</i> (other than using the deprecated multimedia timer) seem to only trigger every 15-16 ms or so instead of 1 ms.<p>This is bad.<p>As a sidenote about Win10 2004, after timeBeginPeriod(1), Sleep(1) seems to take about 2 ms per call. Or at least it seems to take about 1950 ms to call Sleep(1) 1000 times when I tested it. Confusing.')
