There is no such thing as squandering your talent.<p>People always told me: &quot;You&#x27;re so good at maths, you have to go into research. Your talent would be wasted as a middle school teacher.&quot; But then it turned out that I hated research. I work as a programmer now, a profession that I do enjoy, but it&#x27;s so mundane. I wonder where I would have ended up if people hadn&#x27;t discouraged me from becoming a teacher. I&#x27;m slightly jealous of people who get to work with curious kids every day.')
