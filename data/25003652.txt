I&#x27;ve been running a linux NAS with a few services (transmission, sab, nzbget, the other usual suspects) for over a decade now, starting with on-host services and later migrating to docker+compose (which greatly simplified the bootstrapping process). Recently migrated to TrueNAS to get an even more appliance-like setup, and was very impressed in how quickly I was up and running from scratch. I can have NextCloud deployed in about 10 seconds if I want. Maybe I&#x27;m just at the point where I don&#x27;t want to have to tinker&#x2F;micromanage my server, but the idea of running kubernetes for a home server gives me anxiety.')
