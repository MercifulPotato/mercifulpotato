The best I could guess based on my shaky grasp of radiation is to equate internally generated power to total radiated power using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=1+kW%2F%28Stefan-Boltzmann+constant%29%2F%28203+to+275+K%29%5E4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=1+kW%2F%28Stefan-Boltz...</a><p>Based on that, you need 3-10 m^2 of radiative surface area per kilowatt, but that&#x27;s assuming your equilibrium temperature is 203 to 275 K (-70 to 2 Â°C). Assuming I haven&#x27;t made some basic mistake, couldn&#x27;t you decide to heat part of your surface to some much higher temperature and radiate most of your internal power out of that part?')
