Even in an infinitely large eternal steady state universe, if we assume the total energy of the universe is conserved one cannot have an increase in energy density everywhere at once.<p>If in this universe stars live forever, you&#x27;d have eternal &quot;sources&quot; of energy, and for energy to be conserved you&#x27;d need compensatory &quot;sinks&quot; draining energy out of the universe, like black holes which don&#x27;t increase in size. In which the resolution of the Olbers&#x27; paradox would be that most of your lines of sight would end in such a black hole.<p>If, like is usual in physics, you assume local conservation of energy, stars cannot live forever, so in an eternal steady state universe there must be a mechanism recycling the radiation back into a star. In this case, again every line of your sight would eventually hit a star, but most of the radiation would never reach you, being used underway to make a new star. (This is a blatant violation of the second law of thermodynamics of course, which is the actually issue with eternal steady state universes).')
