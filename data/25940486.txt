Exchanging my contributions for the ability to do whatever I want with the software is a reasonable trade.<p>I&#x27;m also willing to contribute to projects using copyleft licenses, on the basis that a project that requires all contributors to leave all of their contributions and derivatives of the product in the open offers a fair playing field.<p>I am way less interested in contributing to this new breed of semi-open projects, which require me to sign over my contributions in exchange for access under a license which stops me from using the project in certain ways, but grants one entity special privileges to use it in that way.<p>I think the evidence suggests that both GPL and permissively-licensed projects can be wildly successful. There are good reasons for both approaches, with different benefits and trade-offs. It&#x27;s also legitimate to be irritated at &quot;bad neighbours&quot; who take without contributing back. I&#x27;m not convinced that this semi-open licensing approach is a benefit to anyone.')
