Currently, there&#x27;s lot of philosophical discussion on ethics, but little of solid decisions and conclusions from these discussions; all the discussion is still at the stage of increasing ambiguity and introducing hypotheses instead of increasing our knowledge about reality by eliminating and discarding most of these hypotheses.')
