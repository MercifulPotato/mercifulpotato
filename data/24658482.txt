It just leads to absurd conclusions. For example, 10x 34 million is 340 million, leaving 7.4 billion people yet to be infected, or about 20x more than currently. 20x the number of deaths would be 20 million people. That&#x27;s horrific. I don&#x27;t want to even think about that. I absolutely hate this calculus. Instead I want to stop this pandemic from getting worse, and we can and should have been working together to limit the spread of this thing.<p>I&#x27;m absolutely tired of having this conversation because it&#x27;s been 6 months of this throwing around bullshit numbers (only .1% die! no only 1% die! no only 2% die! oh look it&#x27;s back to 1.5%!) and people arguing from what is basically a completely selfish point of view where nothing changes, nothing impacts their lives. When in reality every time we have this conversation the absolute numbers have another zero on them.<p>Even back when it was only 50,000 cases worldwide, experts were warning of potentially millions of worldwide deaths. And idiots were arguing not to shut things down and not to wear masks because it was overblown. Goddamn. God damn. Now there are literally <i>one thousand</i> times as many cases. Now 1 million people are dead. And the conversation is still the same. We&#x27;ll have this argument again and again and forever and the millions of dead will keep ticking by because so many people are completely unserious about dealing with this. It is absolutely disgraceful so many people putting their own money and entertainment above the lives of others and don&#x27;t even have the decency to wear goddamn masks. Sickening.<p>Sorry, I don&#x27;t mean to unload on you personally because your comment wasn&#x27;t the above, but goddamn I am so tired of this throwing around numbers game. Can we just fucking fight this virus already?')
