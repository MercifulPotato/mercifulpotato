An attacker has many ways to easily bypass tools like Little Snitch and they only have to succeed at one of them, whereas you have to hope that you take time away from your job to successfully block all of them.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to prevent data exfiltration, you don&#x27;t trust the client at all â€” confine it to a dedicated locked-down system on a restricted network which only allows egress to the minimal subset of trusted services. That&#x27;s a much more winnable battle than trying to prevent every possibility on a general purpose computer running tons of things which are allowed to connect to the internet and legitimately uses lots of outside services.<p>Similarly, a lot of the data breaches you hear about are caused by people with legitimate access saving the data somewhere insecurely. Spending time on that is a lot more beneficial to most organizations than tracking every TCP socket.')
