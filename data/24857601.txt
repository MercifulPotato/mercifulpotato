The criminal is most likely in a foreign jurisdiction, and trying hard to hide their identity; the victim is in a local jurisdiction (otherwise, this law wouldn&#x27;t even apply), their identity is known (on the jurisdictions I know of, companies must be registered with the government), and the government has a large amount of tools at their disposition to enforce a judgment (for instance, freezing and&#x2F;or seizing bank accounts, or in extreme cases even suspending the company&#x27;s registration).')
