I think your first paragraph is right on point.<p>I don&#x27;t <i>mind</i> Apple going their own way with Safari to some degree, and there are things I just like about it as a browser -- it&#x27;s fast, I find its minimal UI a bit more to my taste than either Chrome or Firefox, and I like that it syncs tabs and bookmarks between all my devices. (Yes, I know I could get that if I fully committed to either Firefox or Chrome.) But adapting WebExtensions support and then requiring developers to wrap those extensions in Xcode-built Mac applications that have to be published on the App Store just seems like Apple shooting themselves in the foot. It may be a handsome space gray gun milled out of a single block of aluminum, but it&#x27;s still a problem.<p>(I&#x27;m also not sure why Apple won&#x27;t at least support Vulkan in addition to Metal, but that&#x27;s probably a different discussion.)')
