How many charging stations you can put on a highway? and how many chargers each station is going to have?<p>With more EVs during a travel season, cars would have wait in queues for long time to find free chargers on highways and road-trips will become problematic.<p>If you buy an EV today, you are still an early-adopter in my opinion. Prices are too high for what you get and range isn&#x27;t enough yet.<p>The best you can get right now is probably plugin-in hybrid cars. You get enough EV for your daily commute and short distance usage, and you still can go to road-trip without spending too much time at charging stations.')
