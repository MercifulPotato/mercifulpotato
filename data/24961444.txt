Use this 200k to build the product. Hire another developer for cash. Maybe 1-5% equity if you have to. The other glorified sales person (providing &quot;inside knowledge and industry contact&quot;... sounds dubious) can work as much as he wants on a pure-commission basis.<p>The CEO is expected to work for the company <i>for free</i> at a minimal level... that&#x27;s probably all he was planning to do anyway. Any investor putting cash into a young company should be willing to leverage their own expertise and contacts to make that company successful, since that&#x27;s the only way they will see a return on investment. You don&#x27;t need another un-named executive at this stage.<p>One additional thought: you talk about an &quot;interest-free investment&quot; that can also be reduced by 40k&#x2F;yr. That sounds like a loan. There&#x27;s something odd going on here: why would anyone invest in a company they think is going to be huge, but then also allow you to buy them out for no interest? Something doesn&#x27;t add up.')
