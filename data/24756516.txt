We lost over 300 on my Dad&#x27;s side, and there&#x27;s no number for how many we lost on my Mom&#x27;s side - everyone was killed. I grew up listening to my Grandmother screaming when she had panic attacks and night terrors, and the stories we heard were horrific. I&#x27;m so so glad that Facebook has done this. Maybe it hurts freedom of speech, and maybe it&#x27;s overreach - I don&#x27;t know - those are large and complex subjects. From the subjective point of view, it just makes me happy that they are putting a stop to it.')
