They also rent out their network infrastructure to smaller companies, which effectively means they control the price of phone plans. As a result, phone plans are comparatively very expensive where I&#x27;m from. It seems like separating the infrastructure from the phone plan providing would make the market more competitive, leading to lower prices.')
