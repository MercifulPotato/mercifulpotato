By doing this, Debian can ensure that when you upgrade the system, nothing breaks.<p>While it&#x27;s not uncommon for upstreams to offer a stable or LTS channel that mostly works like this (and generally stable distributions decide to package this version), the whole value of Debian is to offer a layer on top of many upstreams with different speeds &#x2F; practices &#x2F; release policies &#x2F; etc. and offer you a system that works well together and doesn&#x27;t break. So the work&#x2F;backports they need to do is mostly related to different upstreams working differently or in a way that doesn&#x27;t allow Debian to stay pinned on a certain version.')
