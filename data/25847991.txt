There&#x27;s value in that though, because there are many lessons that can be learned from history. Plus it&#x27;s just fascinating. We like stories, and history is our story.<p>However, people put way too much emphasis on history - their personal history - and it affects them in all kinds of unhealthy ways. In my opinion it&#x27;s so much better to leave the past in the past and focus on making a better future. Learn the lessons that can be learned and then move on (easier said than done.) I&#x27;m not an expert, but that&#x27;s my take on it from my life experience and also watching others struggle with their historical baggage.')
