I&#x27;ve always had a focus on trying to understand things, but I&#x27;ve also encountered people who would throw pragmatism and logic out the window as soon as I&#x27;d get real.<p>For me, (recreational) drugs are not the solution at all but they&#x27;ve been a part of my life and they&#x27;re part of an explanation of things, so any therapist who would dismiss the experience entirely also dismisses the nature of my approach to those experiences, and in doing so they create their own blind spot and less useful to me because they&#x27;ve already established that they&#x27;re unwilling or incapable of looking at the big picture.<p>The psychiatrist I&#x27;m talking about never mentions drugs actively, never sings praises of any of those experiences or even makes any particularly positive comment about them, but he doesn&#x27;t disparage them and he inquires about what the experiences were (&quot;what pills? what dosage?&quot; etc, usually when relevant - otherwise I&#x27;ll volunteer what I think is relevant without fear). And he is willing to answer my questions (&quot;what are the advantages&#x2F;drawbacks when taking a little bit more than the nominal dose for this treatment?&quot;), and is willing to try different approaches that we discuss and reflect on.<p>This builds a trust relationship that does more for treatment than people might think. I don&#x27;t need to amplify the meds using doses of Abilify and whatnot, I don&#x27;t need to deal with side-effects that go unadressed, etc. If there are issues, I can talk to someone who isn&#x27;t prejudiced, who is willing to offer alternatives, willing to discuss the compromises related to those alternatives, and willing to devise a plan that is medically sound to get from A to B.<p>As for the psychiatric help, I&#x27;m glad that for you not taking coffee and doing sports is enough. I&#x27;ve mistakenly thought that for years (more vitamin D, &quot;it&#x27;s S.A.D&quot;, no coffee for months, more exercise, etc etc), but I had to hit a wall hard before I encountered the help that I realized I needed my whole life.<p>For people who relate to this thread (with BPD) or people with severe depression and other psychiatric issues, proper psychiatric help is not really an optional thing but much more like the knee surgery required to walk properly or the wheelchair that is required to be autonomous: whether temporary (former) or permanent (latter), it&#x27;s an essential element that can enable some people to actually live, and live well.')
