We went through the process for automatically copying everything over from the old iPhone to the new one.<p>First thing it told us was to bring the two devices near each other and ensure bluetooth was on. Did so. Nothing happened. Rebooted the old phone, and for some reason it then worked.<p>Secondly it told us to sit there and wait for everything to copy across in 5-10 minutes. Supplied no visual feedback of progress and eventually after about 25&#x2F;30 minutes it just failed. Second attempt succeeded, but as before, no visual feedback of progress, which was annoying.<p>Not good enough, for the price of these devices.')
