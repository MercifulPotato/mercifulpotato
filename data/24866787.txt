I get that are more choices for third party manual focus lenses, and that they’re generally cheaper, but the amount of stuff they’re buying &#x2F; having to haul around to make this solution work seems to be pretty intense.<p>I guess this is most interesting for people who already use a gimbal, which is a tool that stabilises your camera for video, because until now you couldn’t use manual focus lenses, or at least not change focus during the shot, because operating the lens manually will interfere with the gimbal’s operation.')
