First in the Laptop with AMD graphics where the screen would be black on resuming after suspend. After updating I&#x27;m not getting the bug any more.<p>Then I got another bug on the desktop with a builtin Intel GPU. Those are usually regarded as the ones with the best driver support on Linux, but that didn&#x27;t save me. After waking up after it has went to sleep, sometimes, that means often, parts of the screen would flicker. It happened directly after the update from Ubuntu 20.04 to 20.10, or kernel 5.4 to 5.8. Now I&#x27;ve manually installed 5.10 and the bug is gone, but without my manual intervention the bug would have continued for months.')
