There is virtually zero mental healthcare out here. As in, I&#x27;ve been on waiting lists for dozens and dozens of clinics&#x2F;clinicians for more than a year, following up with all of them every few weeks. Money isn&#x27;t even an issue here -- I&#x27;m willing to pay the $450&#x2F;30 minutes out of pocket or whatever it costs to see someone. There just literally is not enough mental healthcare to go around. Virtually zero clinics are seeing new patients.<p>I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to be able to get treatment from my GP (who is actually a PA) for mental health conditions I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with previously in other states, and prescriptions for (admittedly lower stakes) meds that have worked reliably for me in the past. But she&#x27;s not able to evaluate me for ADHD -- only refer me to clinics where I&#x27;ve already been on the waitlist for a year.<p>Anyway, some of us self-diagnose because it&#x27;s literally the only fsking option. Not everywhere is the SF Bay Area where there are excellent free and low cost clinics on every other street corner and world class treatment options for those able to pay more.')
