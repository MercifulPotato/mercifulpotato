It&#x27;s not absolutely always worth it. Especially when you &quot;give a shit about it&quot; and then find it really wasn&#x27;t worth it. That&#x27;s really bad.<p>Also, giving a shit is not a dichotomy. I don&#x27;t just give a shit about either everything or nothing at all.<p>Give me a reason to give a shit about what you do in particular.\nUnless you are measuring one&#x27;s capability to give a shit in absolute terms, which is very hard to assess in terms of productivity gains.')
