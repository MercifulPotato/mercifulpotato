I think it&#x27;s still a space with a lot of potential, but there are now a huge number of competitors. I made a spreadsheet and add to it each time I see one of these products come up on HN: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1R5DXWtz4H7eIT5VbGYJEdY0fHasekDxL_x-FN84ItvE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1R5DXWtz4H7eIT5VbGYJE...</a><p>There are currently at least 18 projects operating in this space.<p>- The majority (maybe all?) of them are browser-based (probably because it&#x27;s easy to throw something together with all the JS webrtc example projects out there).<p>- Most of them seem to be trying to sell to enterprises or conference organizers.<p>- I suspect that most of them are ghost towns.<p>- None of them that I&#x27;ve seen actually try to originate events- i.e. the only way you would use them is if you try to organize an event or are invited to one through a different channel.<p>- Most of them are top-down, although there are a few 3d ones.<p>I still think that there&#x27;s a lot of potential for someone to come in and take over this whole space with a product more polished than is possible in the browser, and with a social element that can drive usage of the platform (similar to Clubhouse). I suspect that the winning team will come from the ranks of game developers, not webdevs who cracked open a webrtc tutorial one weekend. For now though, it&#x27;s probably best to sit back and let the majority of the 18 existing teams burn through their funding.')
