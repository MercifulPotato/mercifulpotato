It&#x27;s funny how you don&#x27;t bring up things like strong health care and training as anecdotes on the other side.<p>The question of whether or not there will be &quot;union shops&quot; or not is still yet to be seen.  Whether or not there would be is a question of the union and the employers (i.e. TBD).')
