Item(by='jbergens', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605016734, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25044515, text='GitKraken allows you to set &quot;pull fast-forward only&quot; or &quot;pull rebase&quot; as the default, very nice. This gets you out of most of those problems.<p>You can also do merge by dragging branches in the GUI which for me lowers the risk of taking the wrong branch. And it has a nicer looking interactive rebase than the command line which is very good for beginners.')
