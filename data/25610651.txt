The events of March are a damning indictment of letting small government do a big government&#x27;s job, but not more than that.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m happy to concede that the market will take about a month to figure out vaccine distribution. In fact, I said &quot;a couple of weeks&quot; in my original comment that said the market is &quot;extremely slow.&quot; So I suspect we have the same <i>actual</i> time span in mind, it&#x27;s just that you think that the description of that time is &quot;quick&quot; and I think it&#x27;s &quot;slow&quot;.<p>In particular, it sounds like you think it&#x27;s quick by comparison to potential alternatives. But I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s slow by comparison to the author&#x27;s argument - that additional days or weeks of delay cause serious exponential growth.<p>So we should at least ask what could be faster, before being satisfied with one month. I know of absolutely no way to make the market faster. I do know of ways to make the government more competent and faster, even if our current government agencies are not competent or fast.<p>For instance - do you think the military would take more than a month to do this?<p>(Also, the current government-run distribution regime is <i>actually vaccinating healthcare workers</i>, as we argue about this, and it&#x27;s taken much less than a month from approval to getting real people vaccinated.)')
