I&#x27;ve always considered myself a bit odd because I enjoy wearing different &quot;nice&quot; clothes. When I was younger I struggled because, ironically, I HATE shopping. But then came the internet.<p>Anyway, the site is pretty cool because it opens my mind up to new ideas. But I had a lot of suggested outfits that were the same color of different pieces (no contrast as you said) and multiple jackets.<p>Wonder if it &quot;learns&quot; my style over time? I&#x27;d like to see this continue to grow. And maybe instead of the schedule feature, it could give me links to buy. I imagine monetization isn&#x27;t far off if there&#x27;s decent traffic.')
