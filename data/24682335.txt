I don&#x27;t see anyone campaigning for higher property taxes (my recommendation is an annual tax of 7 to 9 percent[1] of the property value with a housing allowance to all residents physically present in the US) similar to the carbon tax in Canada.<p>[0] My off-hand recommendation for income above 50 x 2000 x minimum wage (for example, at a minimum wage of USD 15, it is USD 50 * 2000 * 15 = USD 1.5M), the progressive tax rate should be at least 90%.<p>[1] The idea being not paying this tax for roughly ten years ought to be enough to get you evicted with minimum fuss so we can &quot;sell&quot; the property to someone who will pay the property tax. No exceptions. No homesteads. No charitable work exception. Applicable nationwide.')
