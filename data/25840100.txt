I only drink sugar free Red Bull. What&#x27;s strange is I can stop for months without any withdraw from caffeine. I often go from drinking Red Bull + Coffee for a few months to just water for multiple months.<p>Once I finish this case, I think it&#x27;s time to go back to water and coffee for 6 months. :)')
