If <i>that</i>&#x27;s true, colour me impressed. I would have put getting the creep resistance, fracture resistance, and tolerances necessary for turbine blades from 3D printing as just about impossible.<p>I&#x27;m conflicted by agreeing with systemvoltage&#x27;s point, that it&#x27;s overhyped, with knowing it is empirically wrong.
