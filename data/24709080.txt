I&#x27;ve been in the consumer electronics spaces for 10 years &amp; from the very beginning I would hear reports about problems for 2.4Ghz WiFi any time you were transferring data on USB (&amp; usually EEs try to tackle this with shielding if USB + WiFi coex is important). I have not heard of this as uniquely new to USB3.<p>I have never heard of interference with Iridium &amp; GPS for USB2&#x2F;3 and I worked on a team that was responsible for GPS at Apple, but it&#x27;s entirely possible there&#x27;s shielding needing to account for this &amp; I just wasn&#x27;t closely involved in it. If this were actually an unsolvable problem though, I would expect CarPlay &amp; Android Auto would have a problem when you use your phone for navigation &amp; start playing audio through USB. Maybe that&#x27;s not enough traffic frequently enough to generate the noise needed to make it unusable, maybe the EE problem you were having was different, or maybe there&#x27;s just good shielding in phones to avoid this as a problem.')
