I don&#x27;t want to be the playground snitch, telling tales on other people here. But considering I&#x27;ve had HN accounts shadow-banned into oblivion in the past, just for making a single off-the-cuff remark that was deemed out of order, how come this person seems to be able to abuse the site with impunity, on an ongoing basis?<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;submitted?id=omiossec<p>Day after day, I see multiple posts fron this person [or bot?], every single one of which is spamming one of the same two websites and every single one of which has been flagged to death. Yet still they&#x27;re allowed to carry on.<p>Genuinely curious.')
