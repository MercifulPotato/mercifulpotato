I thought I clearly defined what a junior dev could be if I worked at it for another year. Having read all the stuff this guy doesn&#x27;t know and what I&#x27;ve learned at my internship, it&#x27;s almost any hint of imposter syndrome I might of had went away.<p>Now I&#x27;m not saying he doesn&#x27;t know how to program. I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s very interesting to me how little you actually have to specialize in to make it in this field. What my internship has taught me, it really makes me feel secure job wise knowing I won&#x27;t have difficulty being employed in the areas I know. I hate sounding so cocky but when I first started schooling again geared toward comp sci, I thought programmers knew just absurd amounts of stuff. Now I&#x27;ve found, they typically are just the average tech savvy individuals that weren&#x27;t afraid to poke around in an OS.')
