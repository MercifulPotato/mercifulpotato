Not only were the guards &quot;sleeping&quot; the day the Epstein was murdered, only a few cameras were working, and when it was time to bring the evidence to court the tapes were mysteriously &quot;corrupted&quot; to the point where the judge couldn&#x27;t view them. Also on the Chans a guard who worked at the facility posted how they came and killed Epstein and didn&#x27;t log a military vehicle who came to their post.<p>Now, if you have the balls to call any of this a &quot;conspiracy&quot; or that the US government isn&#x27;t as corrupt as a run of the mill crack-pot tyrant, come have a word with me. The audacity. Acosta told them Epstein couldn&#x27;t be touched because he&#x27;s &quot;intelligence&quot;. Fucking corrupt to the core.<p>Every day, I ask my self &quot;are the laws that impact me negatively even worth following?&quot; I think I&#x27;ve found my answer.')
