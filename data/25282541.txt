Saying 500k crabs will be drained with most of them surviving sounds better than 175k dies for sure... and we are giving the dead bodies to the fishing industry.  The math is going to work out to be the same in the long run (and in fact better in your scheme) but one sounds better as a one-liner than the other.')
