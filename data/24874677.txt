If I’m content to trust the client side hashing or encryption on the secrets why bother setting up my own server? Conversely, if there are nefarious things that can happen on the server to compromise the data without me knowing about it, then I trust neither myself (because I’d be a bad sysadmin) nor a third party (not knowing what they’re up to). Or if I do trust a third party just use 1Password.<p>Reading between the lines it sounds like being able to build from source or see and install the source gives some assurance you can’t get via third party and the strong files give some assurance over me being a bad sysadmin. That’s either a sweet spot or uncanny valley depending on your perspective. :)')
