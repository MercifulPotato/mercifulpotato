I also own the Sony epaper DPT-1 and while that one has a good feel it&#x27;s not close to the remarkable (mind you it also has a different aim, i.e. only note-taking no drawing). But in my opinion the writing feel blows anything with a regular LCD or OLED display completely out of the water. The texture gives it the closest to real paper anywhere. That said it is a very limited device, so if you don&#x27;t need something for note-taking and reading I would not get it.<p>I also agree with one of the previous posters, I wish this would be A4&#x2F;Letter size like the Sony. I read mainly pdf articles and the size is just sufficient.')
