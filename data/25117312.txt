I used the 7 day moving average to get more stable results and Germany is 2x better than the US in new cases&#x2F;deaths per million right now even while having 3 to 5x less cases&#x2F;death in total since the start which means it also has a more vulnerable population at this point. I didn&#x27;t pick Germany, you did, and claimed it was &quot;much worse&quot;. And it&#x27;s not the best case, there are several countries doing better or much better than Germany.<p>As for the other examples Europe is now having a second wave after successfully suppressing the first one. The US has never suppressed the pandemic, or at best is now at a third wave, and thus has a currently less susceptible population from all the cases and deaths it has already had. And even then it&#x27;s still having more new cases and new deaths than the well managed countries in Europe (Germany, Norway, Finland, Denmark, etc). It&#x27;s hardly in a better situation right now as you claim. The worst countries in Europe are at the US accumulated average, some are catching up but the US is also spiking right now.')
