Item(by='jsjohnst', descendants=None, kids=[25491714, 25491678], score=None, time=1608481039, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25483625, text='&gt; AMD has made a surprisingly quick move from the bargain basement laptops<p>I specifically called out niche as not a negative term for this reason. I didn’t mean to imply bargain basement, but more that high end processors like this would only be included on a few models. Things like gaming or developer focused machines vs something built for a wider audience (like the current M1 machines are).<p>&gt; So I&#x27;m comparing laptops available in Nov (although people I know couldn&#x27;t get theirs till Dec) to laptops I expect to be available in Feb, but that&#x27;s speculative of course.<p>I walked into an Apple store in November and walked out (in under 3min I might add) and had an M1 13” MBP. I think them taking my temperature at the door took almost as long as checkout. Having closely followed CES announcements over the years, I respectfully disagree that there will be laptops in February available for delivery&#x2F;pickup using the processor just announced the month before, but there is a slim chance so I won’t bet against it. Much more likely to be May&#x2F;June&#x2F;July based on past experience.')
