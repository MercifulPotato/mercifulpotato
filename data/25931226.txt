Like a lot of people, they don&#x27;t deal with issues until they are large and impact the market.  They are ABSOLUTELY going to intervene here.  First with some immediate action, and later they&#x27;ll craft a new rule to guide social media on stock advice being not allowed on their platforms (IMO).<p>&gt; why the f** is shorting legal<p>Short selling rewards investors who believe that certain stocks are overvalued or that the company is covering up fraud.  They helped bring Lehman Brothers down, as well as Enron, Wirecard, etc...   In those instances, the shorts were instrumental in reverting stocks down to correct (sometimes zero) prices.
