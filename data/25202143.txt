The result was about 100k lines of JS and Rails code that could be safely deleted in a single PR.  It had been such a long slog, though, that we felt the team deserved some catharsis.<p>We took a team-offsite day to gather on a nearby beach and burn the deleted code.  In the interest of not wasting that much paper, we burnt a complete list of the deleted files in super-tiny font on a couple pages.  We also each grabbed our least-favorite areas of the codebase to print out, including several dramatic readings.  My selection was a section of code from about 4 years prior with a comment like &#x2F;&#x2F;TODO: replace this asap.<p>I highly recommend it to anyone facing a long, clearly-delineated migration.  Gift your old, shameful code to the flame.')
