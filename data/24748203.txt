Energy does not have to be produced where it is needed. We can transfer it already. The grid would need upgrades but we can definitely transfer large amounts of energy over long distances.<p>Example from China: 12GW over 3300km at 1100kV DC, for others look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ultra-high-voltage_electricity_transmission_in_China" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ultra-high-voltage_electricity...</a> .<p>Europe is also building HVDC (high-voltage direct current) links connecting windparks and consumers with e.g. norwegian pumped hydro power plants for storing excess energy ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;High-voltage_direct_current" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;High-voltage_direct_current</a> )')
