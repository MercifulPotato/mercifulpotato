It&#x27;s looking at a paper and genuinely <i>not understanding why</i> something works.<p>I&#x27;m 100% - probably higher - that <i>if you make me do some random shit to use your product, I will not do it and will actively become a detractor</i>.<p>The papers show that satisfaction increases if you delay eating.  That&#x27;s because of anticipating a dopamine reward.<p>I do not get a dopamine reward when I want to change my kube yaml.  I do not get a reward viewing CI statuses.  I do not get a reward opening slack.  I actively dislike it.<p>Also, let&#x27;s just look at one line of this blog post:<p>&gt; Very few companies have successfully built a ritual around their products. Itâ€™s unclear how many have tried.<p>The title is also bullshit.  As the post says, there&#x27;s no proof it increases satisfaction and certainly not spending - AKA LTV, which is what you should drive. We should use our own critical thinking here and, if we try, at least try with ample caution.<p>And also, we should definitely distinguish between habit forming and ritual.  A ritual is a process we are expected to run through.  Things that we are forced to do, even if we don&#x27;t want to do it.  Habit forming may be gamification, rewards, etc. for normal activities we would be inclined to do anyway.  If we force people to do things they don&#x27;t want, it won&#x27;t end well.')
