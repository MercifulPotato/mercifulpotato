Magnets on the keyboard and keypad hold them in position on the desk. We provide specialized magnet kits for standard Apple products and a general-purpose kit to accommodate other products. The mouse pad has a ring of steel on its outer edge but no steel in the center. This allows the user to slide the mouse easily when mousing and store the mouse anywhere on the edge of the pad when not in use.')
