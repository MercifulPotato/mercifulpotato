It seems today if persons &#x2F; groups have an ideological opposition in anything, they must treat their opposition as if they are immoral and completely banish them from their lives<p>With out this base cultural respect for free expression the 1st amendment will become meaningless and will likely fail to protect from government censorship.<p>We need to get back to a time where people can passionately disagree on a topic with out being &quot;cancelled&quot;,  but I honestly do not see how to accomplish that')
