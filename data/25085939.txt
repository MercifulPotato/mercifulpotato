I&#x27;ve come across business cultures where people got ahead (really!) by &quot;outrunning their mistakes.&quot; Lots of rapid promotions and job transfers, leaving messes behind them -- and then blaming problems on their inept successors, or other saboteurs, etc. No accepting of responsibility.<p>Most of those places eventually go bust, but they can ruin a lot of people&#x27;s lives before the final collapse happens.<p>Step 3.2 feels forced and a little Orwellian. Even something as hazy as invoking &quot;bad judgment&quot; -- and leaving the scene -- is often sufficient, at least at first. If errant people need a bit more time to process reality&#x27;s sudden slap in the face, I&#x27;m in favor of giving it to them.<p>Eventually a lot of them do reach a fuller understanding. Or they redeem themselves in other ways. In the right settings, a little bit of mercy can be very powerful')
