This <i>also</i> means there are $17B USD in a bank account somewhere, and you can go hand $1M in Tether in and get $1M USD back. Problem is, nobody has ever managed to do that.<p>If, however, you assume Tether is engaged in a conspiracy with crypto exchanges: Tether prints USDT and buys BTC from a friendly exchange, demand for BTC will go up when people see the difference between USDT-BTC and USD-BTC and try to arbitrage. Tether then sells BTC for USD.<p>Which is more likely? You can be the judge, but the fact that &quot;exiting USDT for dollars&quot; typically means &quot;selling it for USDC&quot; makes me pretty pessimistic about the first.')
