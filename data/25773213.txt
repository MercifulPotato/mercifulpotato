Which the more rural areas were at the time.<p>The more <i>rural</i> states (like Virginia at the time) had most of the population, which is why they preferred representation based on population.<p>The argument was one of population (whether current or expected), as writings by all involved in it will tell you explicitly.<p>Regardless, the US Senate was created with two senators from each state provided equal representation to each state in that house.<p>Which was and still is, a counterweight to heavily populated areas.  Rural or urban really doesn&#x27;t make a difference.<p>Edit: Clarified rural vs. urban importance WRT US Senate representation.')
