Not because I think how they handled the case is wrong, but how they excluded him from a society he was embracing and trying to identify with.<p>For my own project I was considering to include a code of conduct. But currently decided against it because I do not think the purpose of a code of conduct should be written down as potential punishments as consequences.<p>A lot of people have a variety of backgrounds, a variety of perspectives and values that thet have been taught. If someone isn&#x27;t even aware of what they did to offend another member, how is that someone supposed to learn from it if they are just punished for it?<p>I want to create a culture of welcoming, and a safe space for everyone. Not a dystopian regime that punishes first and acknowledges their mistakes later. We&#x27;ve got a broken justice system already, and I think it is built in the opposite manner of what we&#x27;re trying to achieve.<p>If you punish and exclude as consequences, the logical conclusion is alienation and isolation.')
