At least where i live, the homeless all congregate in biggest wealthiest cities, because it&#x27;s easier to beg, their presence blends in more and also local communities are more atomized so they don&#x27;t fight off the homeless as hard as in smaller places. I&#x27;ve heard a story of one homeless guy who have recently been sleeping on a bus stop near my home - he&#x27;s basically travelling from one big city center to another, and stays as long as the police doesn&#x27;t chase him off the area.')
