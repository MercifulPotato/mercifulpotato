You could put an AQI sensor on it to run them as needed but generally they are either timed per hour and on a humidistat.  New homes also have to have gas appliances (except for the stove) with their own air intake and powered exhaust.<p>All gas stoves should be below a hood with a ducted outside vent, the more powerful the better.')
