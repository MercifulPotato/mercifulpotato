E.g. If you are archiving the previous semester&#x27;s homework assignments, instead of uploading a bunch of random documents, each item would be an archive of the assignments from a particular class. You could tag each item with &#x27;Fall 2020&#x27; if you want to improve the organization. I&#x27;m intending to make that an easy process, where you point the program at a directory and it packages, tags and uploads each subfolder.')
