Turns out the hospital was sponsored by the producer of the pills.<p>&gt; This is not just over-prescribing, this is intentionally creating addicts and should be criminalized asap.<p>I&#x27;ll devils advocate. But only barely.<p>So, lets say your friend didn&#x27;t take them, went home, and day 2 something gets way more sore. If she tried to go back to the hospital to tell them, there is a possibility she gets the wrong doctor, gets a note on her file as &#x27;seeking&#x27;, and then is up a creek without a paddle.<p>This doesn&#x27;t take away from the issues with overprescription and marketing. But speaking as someone who had to learn about some of this, the hospital did the shitty but correct thing<p>Source: because of the sheer -volume- of ADD meds I have to take and my aspergers, I got a good course from my doc on understanding how not to accidentally look like a seeker')
