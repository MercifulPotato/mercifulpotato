My desktop machines have done as well though!<p>Suspend&#x2F;resume to memory and to disk have been exceedingly reliable on every machine I&#x27;ve touched for a decade for me. On my old Dell convertible laptop, the wifi would only turn on every other time it woke up.<p>The machines waking up is a real problem. I have `HandleLidSwitch=ignore` in systemd&#x27;s logind.conf[1]. I see there are other options though, which I might also try setting to ignore. I too sometimes have unexpected wakeups. I&#x27;d like to learn more about how to debug these. I&#x27;ve asked twice on IRC &amp; gotten no reply. My backup plan has been to write a daemon to make the system go to sleep, and whenever it wakes up, put it back to sleep, unless I &quot;disarm&quot; the daemon. I&#x27;m in a fairly low-visibility environment now though- I feel like I should work the problem some, fix whatever is going wrong, rather than hack around, but I have not been successful at figuring out second steps in debugging systemd daemons, once `systemd status` &amp; upping the logging level falls short.<p>I too have problems with some desktop things intercepting my power button, which again, I wish I had better visibility in to. I don&#x27;t know other than trial &amp; error to figure out who might be grabbing the input devices.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freedesktop.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;man&#x2F;logind.conf.htmlloginctl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freedesktop.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;man&#x2F;logind.conf...</a>.')
