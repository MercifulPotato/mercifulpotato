I really do not understand how brick and mortar retails stores stay in business. Just today I needed to buy some plumber&#x27;s putty. I ordered it from my phone on Amazon in about 30 seconds, that&#x27;s not even enough time to put my shoes on and get in the car if I were to go to the hardware store. Going to the store is such a gigantic waste of time I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would do it unless they really need an item immediately.')
