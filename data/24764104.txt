Couple that with high water from rains and you’d typically get a high water alarm.<p>I think our system was setup to alarm if there were more than 3 or 4 gallons in a tank. These tanks are enormous. I don’t remember the capacity but they had many thousands of gallons of fuel.<p>Water goes to the bottom of the tank naturally and sets off an alarm. This alarm also stops the pump from running.<p>We’d call out a vacuum truck to pump the bottom of the tank (usually this cost A LOT of money. $1000 for 15 minutes of work)<p>Then we’d fix the entry point where water came in. If the alarm cleared on the system, we could turn the pump back on.')
