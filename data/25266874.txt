In my NixOS setup it takes literally minutes if you exclude the download&#x2F;build phase.<p>[1]: Yeah, I know about and use chocolatey. Still isn&#x27;t the same, since for example most programs still use their own update mechanism, installation of packages fail constantly (specially more complicated packages like NVIDIA drivers) and there is some other headaches.')
