Newspapers, websites, guidebooks are going to be fragmentary and often not very fresh. There used to be actual restaurant guides (like Zagat--which sold to Google) but, like everything else, most people want free. I miss the old Zagat; the demographic and preferences of people who filled out their surveys was probably pretty close to me. There&#x27;s still a website but it&#x27;s not what it used to be.')
