I have a shell script that somewhat does this but it&#x27;s not completely unattended and still requires a lot of manual config for certain steps.<p>Aside from that my main use case is being able to easily share a dev&#x2F;build environment with others for ensuring that they can compile a certain project exactly as I do. For now I just use docker but it&#x27;s frustrating not having explicit control over the layer cache and being able to tell it what to cache and what not to.')
