You can observe that red light has a wavelength of 620 to 750 nm, or that we&#x27;ve assigned it the RGB colour code of #FF0000, but neither fact actually captures or explains the sensory experience. Even trying is a fool&#x27;s errand, because sensory experiences are inherently qualitative, not quantitative.')
