If you read past the first sentence, it&#x27;s clear I&#x27;m referencing your logical structure.<p>GPT-2 actually produces decent grammar, but not any context-aware logical structure to the text it produces. Just a bunch of disjointed sentences with keywords that all generally lie on the same semantic vector.<p>More importantly, you are ignoring the entire rest of my argument.
