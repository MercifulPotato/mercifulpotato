Item(by='newbie789', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601769235, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24671368, text='I am somewhat confused by what the author is suggesting here. &quot;Best&quot; is a highly subjective term in this case. Also, the media described as &quot;the best&quot; was also once new.<p>There was a day before Star Trek:TNG came out, and then the next day it premiered. By the author&#x27;s own reasoning he or she wouldn&#x27;t have watched &quot;the best tv show ever made&quot; until after the invention of IMDB and its listing there.<p>I personally enjoy watching new content because it&#x27;s a bit like real-time anthropology. The media we create and consume says something about the society that forms the context around its creation and consumption.<p>I suppose not everybody feels this way, and that&#x27;s fine. I don&#x27;t really have any desire to tell people what or what not to watch or listen to. This blog post being so sure of its content is a bit... odd.<p>For example, using the term &quot;best album&quot; over &quot;the album I enjoyed the most&quot; kind of indicates a surety that feels somewhat like they&#x27;re talking down to you. I guess my question here is &quot;Why?&quot;')
