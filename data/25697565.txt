Item(by='geedy', descendants=None, kids=[25697880], score=None, time=1610170274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25697054, text='&gt; It&#x27;s not a great move to assume that conservatives are dumb, racist, and unsophisticated.<p>I don&#x27;t love labels, but I don&#x27;t think &quot;conservatives&quot; are simply any of those things.<p>This isn&#x27;t an original thought, but I think they are mostly afraid of losing their community if they change their mind.<p>Fear of disconnection is innate and biological. When my trump supporting friends say &quot;I believe it&quot; to somebody suggesting that the Capitol Hill rioters were antifa pretending to be trump supporters, their lack of interest in challenging their own beliefs stems from the risk incurred with disagreeing with their friends and loved ones.<p>This effect is so strong that our brains give hits of dopamine whenever our beliefs are confirmed. We are not weird to change our minds.<p>So no. &quot;Conservatives&quot; aren&#x27;t dumb. Just like the rest of us, they biologically afraid of social disconnection. And all that shouting across the isle makes it harder for them to see &quot;progressives&quot; accepting them.')
