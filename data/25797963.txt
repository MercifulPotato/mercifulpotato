Item(by='josephg', descendants=None, kids=[25798485], score=None, time=1610752909, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25797685, text='&gt; my favorite question for people who like 1-based is &quot;Given index and length N, how do I create index-1?&quot;<p>Create index-1? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever needed do that. What does come up all the time in practice in both JS and Lua is &quot;how do I assign past the current end of an array?&quot;<p>In javascript (if you don&#x27;t use .push) its arr[arr.length] = x<p>In Lua its arr[#arr + 1] = x<p>Even having worked with 0-based indexes for over 20 years, I still doubletake reading that javascript code when itâ€™s embedded in complex code before I can convince myself its inserting. But the lua code is intuitive.<p>Likewise &quot;read the last element in an array&quot;:<p>JS: arr[arr.length - 1]<p>Lua: arr[#arr]<p>I much prefer the lua version in all these cases.<p>And simplicity is important here because the code gets much worse when the array isn&#x27;t in a local variable, but instead is some complex expression. confabulate(foo.bar.baz[foo.bar.baz.length - 1]); &lt;-- Simple statement. Absolute mess.')
