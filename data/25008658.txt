Probably the same amount of work with JS&#x2F;TS.<p>My business is APP development (marketplace, fintech, social networks and saas) ... in the past 3-4 years NEVER ONCE have I regretted choosing Go and in fact the opposite. My team is super comfortable with it, and new members joining can pick up the stack in a day. It&#x27;s cheap &amp; efficient on the servers and require minimal overhead.<p>Rust has its perk and usefulness, but for very particular, niche, software applications. It&#x27;s not a productivity gain in backend app development in my line of business. In my opinion, Rust for app development is &quot;extreme premature optimization&quot;!<p>Deep down, I really hope Go&#x27;s generics do NOT happen so the language stays simple and readable. The new propositions are worrying my team and we&#x27;ll probably ban it in our dev process.')
