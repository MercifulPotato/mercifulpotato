Usually it&#x27;s a case of the lawyers keeping near 80-90% and the rest of the pittance is allocated to administrative overhead, with a few pennies thrown to plaintiffs that weren&#x27;t actually driving the lawsuit.  Or then the payout (if it&#x27;s big) goes to the state or federal coffers, is another one, with victims seeing no compensation at all.  I am actually very genuinely curious about how they managed to get even a $100+ payout to those affected.')
