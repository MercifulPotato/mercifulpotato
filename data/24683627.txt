While it may have good intentions, it doesn&#x27;t matter if it lets less experienced developers do absurd things that I now have to refactor<p>isn&#x27;t it everything? My exp in redux is the same. Mobx however doesn&#x27;t pretend to be for smart people and doesn&#x27;t encourage them to invent a bunch of weird conventions like redux. I&#x27;ve never had any problem with state management, react solved it for me already. What I need a library for is a clear pattern for where to put domain code (again is it reducer or saga&#x2F;thunk?) and never think about the library again.')
