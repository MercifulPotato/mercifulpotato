Given it is just one of the 3 major desktop operating systems an application is targeting (Windows, Mac), one cannot push the work back to the application. Applications should do what makes sense to them, distros should either put in the work or perhaps, standardize the mechanism to specify dependencies across distros so the work can be done once.<p>To your point about security patches in dependencies, Chrome auto updates itself to patch vulnerabilities. Their users on Windows&#x2F;Mac appreciate this behavior. Switching to a different model for Linux is work on their part, isn&#x27;t it?<p>Static linking based distribution like snaps might also achieve most of the goals listed above if the file system can share relevant file blocks across applications in a seamless manner. So Chromium could bring in its own glibc or use glibc file blocks already pulled in by another application.')
