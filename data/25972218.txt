Most people are happy with the corporate internet, or at least indifferent.  If you want to change that, you have to add some major value.  (And, people have added such value; there are users of Tor, after all.)<p>My point is, switching from HTTP&#x2F;1.1 to QUIC doesn&#x27;t really make a difference here.  The battle against centralized control of parts of the Internet has been lost and no protocol spec is going to change that outcome.  Instead, there needs to be major innovation from the camp that wants to fundamentally change the world.')
