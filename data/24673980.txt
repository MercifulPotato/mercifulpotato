Item(by='dnautics', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601751798, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24672773, text='right, that was around the time that everyone using the BSD network stack became a thing.<p>Did you mean to say thrashy (not that it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t also trashy)?  Because IIRC that was the main problem.  There were issues with, for example, the memory mapped area leaving the caches of the resident core that the process lived on; and also generally BeOS was terrible at pinning processes to CPU cores.  And I recall that the sentiment was also that the network stack needed low latency in general and that it was rather difficult to get a good implementation of a userland network for these reasons.<p>I imagine that at least some of these concerns may play out in more contemporary userland network stacks.  Possibly, worse so if you don&#x27;t know what is going on with noisy neighbors in containerized or even vm-ized deployments (though I would guess that Amazon&#x2F;GCP but maybe not Azure does a good job of quotaing&#x2F;throttling vms)')
