We do this all the time with regulations and laws because people can&#x27;t always be trusted to make decisions that aren&#x27;t selfish. Vaccines fit into a category of things that seem to be personal decisions but negative impacts are communal. I&#x27;m all for personal freedoms, until yours damage mine. I know many immuno compromised people and the antivax crowd is their second biggest medical problem, after the diseases themselves. Vaccines aren&#x27;t to protect you anywhere near as much as they are to protect us from you.<p>I&#x27;m 100% in favor of requiring vaccines and keeping the antivax crows in a silo, away from the general population. (That includes my family members who are antivax.)')
