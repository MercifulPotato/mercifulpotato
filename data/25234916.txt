Even though the website is horrible to navigate, you can order most of what you need on one site without searching for deals or coupons. Even though the site is filled with knock-offs and fake products, they ship quickly and are free to return, so there&#x27;s little risk.<p>People (myself included, though I&#x27;m trying to do more of my purchasing locally or on other sites) get suckered in by the convenience and then don&#x27;t have enough reason to switch to other stores, despite the overall subpar experience.')
