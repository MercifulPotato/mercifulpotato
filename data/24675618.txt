This article is largely about many research groups coming together to build a more nuanced understanding of our impact on the environment over the past thousands of years.<p>It also suggests the prevailing views of climate change are  simplistic. We, even in much more &quot;primitive&quot; times, have been mucking up the earth to our benefit. It&#x27;s bound to happen, of course. All that energy must come from somewhere.<p>I don&#x27;t think the article suggests that the situation we&#x27;re in now isn&#x27;t happening. The article reads almost breathlessâ€”in on the knowledge that we&#x27;re in a dire situation. Do we really need more reasons to illustrate our impact on the environment?<p>It also speaks to our strange compulsion to believe in the duality of human and nature. How do you get the public to recognize that there is no such thing, only one symbiotic whole? I hope we can figure out how to work together.')
