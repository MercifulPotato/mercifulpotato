Use this!&quot; Then they packaged that up as a module in the Engine they started building initially, and spent the next 5 years slowly deleting bits of CryEngine and replacing it with the engine they wanted to build in the first place.<p>Not that that&#x27;s much better, but I think it clearly speaks to the politics at play in the environment.<p>edit:<p>To add links to the code:<p>ly framework, clearly core engine systems unrelated to cryengine: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;lumberyard&#x2F;tree&#x2F;6b8dd98ad0e59b1817a79f6aaf5b89afb41b1086&#x2F;dev&#x2F;Code&#x2F;Framework" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;lumberyard&#x2F;tree&#x2F;6b8dd98ad0e59b1817a79...</a><p>Gems, the non crytek plugin system: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;lumberyard&#x2F;tree&#x2F;6b8dd98ad0e59b1817a79f6aaf5b89afb41b1086&#x2F;dev&#x2F;Gems" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;lumberyard&#x2F;tree&#x2F;6b8dd98ad0e59b1817a79...</a><p>A big dump of cryengine: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;lumberyard&#x2F;tree&#x2F;6b8dd98ad0e59b1817a79f6aaf5b89afb41b1086&#x2F;dev&#x2F;Code&#x2F;CryEngine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;lumberyard&#x2F;tree&#x2F;6b8dd98ad0e59b1817a79...</a><p>Which we can see has been dramatically shrunken in the time since the initial commit: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;lumberyard&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;dev&#x2F;Code&#x2F;CryEngine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;lumberyard&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;dev&#x2F;Code&#x2F;CryEn...</a>')
