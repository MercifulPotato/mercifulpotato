For a time it was possible to use by inserting an SD card in a particular way, but that did not work reliably.<p>Ironically, that reader didn’t support microSD cards used by my audio recorder (Tascam DR-05), so once I lost the microSD to SD size adapter (which happened very quickly) I had to use a universal memory card reader dongle anyway.<p>I never sent it for repair: this was my daily driver so I had to have a backup machine in meantime, but when I got another laptop I simply switched to it.<p>My latest USB-C SD&#x2F;microSD reader dongle feels surprisingly sturdy, though admittedly it is liable to getting lost (it’s been a year and it did not happen yet, but I’m sure it will at some point).<p>I’d say definitely P(port breaking) &lt; P(dongle breaking or getting lost), but on the other hand port breaking has higher cost.')
