It follows along the lines of the saying: You must learn the rules before you can break them. With that said, I have seen many 1st year graduate students spend weeks&#x2F;months going through the literature only to come up with project ideas that are close derivatives of published works. This usually happens because a student put too much focus on absorbing the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; of the field rather than starting with a question and seeing what research has already been done to address it.<p>However, there are plenty of scientists who disagree with this sentiment. I had a colleague who would quote Feynman, &quot;I never pay any attention to anything by experts. I calculate everything myself.&quot; Maybe that works if you are Feynman, but I seem to recall John Preskill saying that he didn&#x27;t think this mentality served Feynman well, at least in his later years.')
