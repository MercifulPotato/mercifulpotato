Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25832850], score=None, time=1611055462, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25831399, text='&gt;&gt;fuel cells that require hydrogen are a much more feasible solution and environmentally safe for the long term<p>I honestly, hand on heart, don&#x27;t understand how anyone still believes this. Honestly. Hydrogen is a PAIN to work with. We don&#x27;t have any elemental hydrogen on earth. Nearly 100% of hydrogen available in commercial supply comes from fossil fuel production and while it could still be produced by electrolysis it&#x27;s a stupidly inefficient process, especially since the resulting gas then has to be compressed for transport. And most importantly, no one has answered a simple question - with hydrogen being the smallest element of all, it leaks out of any container you put it in, making it brittle as it does so. 70kg lead bottles only store 1L of hydrogen, and all of it naturally evaporates through the metal within few weeks. Woven carbon fibre tanks are better at this, but it still evaporates with time and the tanks are incredibly expensive to manufacture.<p>I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s not feasible at all. It&#x27;s a pipe dream that people keep bringing up for some reason because it looks great on paper. In practice the production and transportation and then safe usage of hydrogen are significant obstacles, where batteries have none of them - the only advantage is the fueling speed, but even then I&#x27;m not so sure - have you seen videos of any commercial fueling stations for hydrogen? The Toyota Mirai with its tiny tank takes about 10 minutes to refuel since the process has to be done so carefully.  Yes it&#x27;s faster than electric charging, but the speeds we&#x27;re seeing on some cars(Porsche Taycan, Tesla Model 3) are already crazy, like 60 miles of range added in 5 minutes crazy.')
