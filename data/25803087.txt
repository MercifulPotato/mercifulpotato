After doing 10+ years of frontend, my theory is that frontend welcomes a lot of new self learnt programmers mostly because the browser is the runtime and almost every device has it. This means it’s pretty easy to stitch a few things and get something useful in the hands of customers. Npm makes it very easy to create new packages and libraries. All though not a significant % of community has computer science background and deeply understand what goes under the hood.<p>StateOfJS contains stats of new programmers : old ones. Things that stay the same after a long period of time and stay successful have been reasoned from first principles to satisfy its constraints in the most efficient way possible.<p>E.g svelte was built up this way, to track changes and propagate dom mutations in a very efficient way while still keeping the invariant of view= state of function.<p>My point is that many things in JS are made without such fundamental analysis, so you see churn.<p>I’m a fan of esbuild since it’s built from fundamentals (parse the AST from source only once and utilize all cores while doing it, it saturates available disk bandwidth since go is amazingly efficient at it)<p>Those ideas are here to stay for a long time.')
