I once saw my weapon glitch and be invisible .... until I changed weapons.  I&#x27;m sure they exist, but I am having so much fun playing the game (even with potato graphics from a 4 year old card).  I have hardly touched the plot, as I haven&#x27;t even gotten to the events that were completely spoiled by the game&#x27;s trailers, but I still feel like I&#x27;m exploring a living city.')
