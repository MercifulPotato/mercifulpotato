You can create poverty by increasing living standards faster than people can increase their income. You can create poverty by allowing people to increase their income beyond someone else&#x27;s income because poverty can always be relative. You can increase poverty by making it harder to get a job in the first place. There are so many reasons that have nothing with economics but politics.<p>Whether the coin flip game increases poverty or not is also purely about politics. If the one lucky guy cooperates with all the other players then everyone is better off. That cooperation can be implemented as a government policy.')
