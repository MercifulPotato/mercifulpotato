As a guy, I have a dog, every time I take him out to dog park without my wife, I get hit on.<p>But dogs are so much work and they are needy. If I had to do over, I would get a cat. My friends with cat can take wknd trip without taking or boarding their cats. Sometimes, they have no idea where their cat is.<p>My guess is having a dog is not about masculinity but it shows that this guy can handle responsibility and needs of others.')
