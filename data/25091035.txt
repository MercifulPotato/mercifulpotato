In the case of Qt, I recall that this meant changing the version this dropping other OS versions that were previously supported unless you duplicate all development effort.<p>Apple has NO incentive to not keep changing everything and breaking stuff thus forcing people to constantly upgrade and buy new hardware. For me, there werenâ€™t any material changes in the OS I was happy and started using.')
