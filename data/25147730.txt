In most cases our politicians would pretty much just tell them what they need to know.<p>In the case of the F35 it especially make no sense, AT ALL. The selection process for a new fighter jet was so heavily skewed in favor of the F35 that other manufacturers didn&#x27;t even want to bid. At no point did anyone seriously believe that any other plane was even an option.<p>It&#x27;s my belief that letting the NSA do their spying is a move done to ensure that our own politicians cannot be held responsible for informing the US about internal affairs. As you say, they show a complete apathy towards the situation.<p>The current generation of politicians has an unhealthy positive view of surveillance in general, while attempting to keep the press and public out from anything they deem to be &quot;confidential government decisions&quot;.')
