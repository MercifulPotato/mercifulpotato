Having the app on my phone too means I can continue a book in a queue&#x2F;taxi&#x2F;bus if I&#x27;ve not the kindle with me.<p>It&#x27;s not worth getting the one with internet connection if they still have that, the rare cases I want to buy a book on the go, I just make a hotspot with my phone.<p>Basically my favourite bit of tech.')
