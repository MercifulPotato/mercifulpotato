I think it depends.<p>From my back of the envelope calculations, it seems that the conditions necessary for a restaurant to break even or make a tiny profit with delivery apps that take a 30% cut exist but are narrow. For the restaurant to cover that fee, it would have to increase its online prices by 1&#x2F;(1-0.7) - 1 = 43%, which would make it less competitive to a segment of its consumer base.<p>On the other hand, if the app&#x27;s fee was 15% (which it is in Chicago, due to a city-wide cap), a restaurant only has to increase its prices 1&#x2F;(1-0.15) - 1 = 18%, which is more palatable and less noticeable.<p>It does also create cash flow, and there are various things you can do with cash flow.<p>If you can increase sales velocity, the increased returns might be able to help profitability (though the counterfactual is hard to prove -- if you didn&#x27;t have the apps, would velocity have been lower? Hard to measure).')
