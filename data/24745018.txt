I know from chatting to some doctors that eye surgery for example, isn&#x27;t exclusively cataract surgery, but it&#x27;s like 60% of their surgeries and typically done by a handful of doctors.  Back of the eye surgery is done at the same center, but by another set of doctors.<p>So while it&#x27;s true it&#x27;s not common to find the type of single surgery centers like they have in India, there are lots of surgeons who do the same surgery weekly or several times per week.<p>But yeah, if you&#x27;re seeing an ENT at a smaller center, they might be doing 100 procedures a year and no more than 10 of any given type.')
