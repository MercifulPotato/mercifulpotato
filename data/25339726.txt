This is the latter.<p>Arguments can be had about the <i>relevance</i> of that distinction, but relevant or not, the distinction does exist. Thanks for clarifying!<p>(I&#x27;m not participating in the &quot;Is this distinction relevant?&quot; discussion today, sorry, just trying to understand what was passed. See other threads for pro&#x2F;con arguments.)')
