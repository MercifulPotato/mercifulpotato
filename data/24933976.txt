There are a lot of posts here saying you have to trust his integrity over the editors due to all of his accolades.<p>All of Glenn&#x27;s accolades are from the reporting around Edward Snowden.  I&#x27;m a big fan of that reporting and I think that story needed to be told but it was most strategically beneficial to Russia where Snowden eventually took sanctuary.  This was also during Obama&#x27;s presidency.<p>Now, he seems to be very biased to the point of being a hack, pulls a stunt like this on the eve of an election, has continuously made an effort to discredit the Russian interference in our elections and comes to Trump&#x27;s aid fairly frequently when it matters (as well as sometimes critiques him and his admin when it doesn&#x27;t i.e. &quot;he lies&quot;)<p>I don&#x27;t know what his motives are but it sure doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s about getting out the truth.')
