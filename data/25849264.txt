I&#x27;ve been around HN since 2011, and tone has definitely shifted in the last 5-6 years. I used to stumble on HN posts that infuriated me relatively often, it was part of the deal (i.e. understanding how the self-appointed entrepreneurial classes actually rationalize certain things). That doesn&#x27;t really happen anymore.<p><i>&gt; those overlaps would probably translate to some overarching strains of belief, for example, the tendency toward libertarian viewpoints</i><p>The opposite is actually true, in my experience. Hardcore libertarian views on HN have been largely quashed into irrelevance, they only survive in lore. New commenters who join and expect HN to be a nest of hyper-capitalists are quickly downvoted into oblivion. Which is not a terrible thing in the great scheme of things, from the personal perspective of somebody who would likely dislike their point of view; but it has definitely taken something away from the HN experience, and possibly pushed some people towards worse (more radicalized) forums.')
