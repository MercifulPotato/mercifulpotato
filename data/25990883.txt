If tracking goes away, FB ad revenue will fall to that of banner advertising at roughly 1&#x2F;100th to 1&#x2F;10000th the price per impression that FB currently receives.<p>Such a change would effectively force a rethink of the entire consumer technology business, and see FB&#x2F;GOOG re-structure to some form of subscription revenue or shutdown large feature sets and product offerings which would no longer be tenable.')
