Their pubs are open. All because they mastered lockdown.<p>When a case occurs they close for a bit. But they&#x27;re open 90% of the time. That a lot more of the time than uk pubs are managing.<p>I&#x27;d accept a working test and trace program too. Like Singapore used.<p>Don&#x27;t think me greedy but... We could even do both, as we have more resources than Aus and Singapore combined and we&#x27;ve had a lot more time to do all this.<p>Once again, I have to ask: why hasn&#x27;t my government managed such a thing? Could it be that it&#x27;s impossible (despite Singapore having done it) or are they just too complacent?<p>Instead were stuck with the shitty parts of a long lockdown (closed pubs) without achieving the desired outcomes (single digit daily death rates).')
