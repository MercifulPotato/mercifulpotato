Item(by='hogFeast', descendants=None, kids=[25958756, 25959610], score=None, time=1611935907, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25958276, text='Dick Fuld has said that several times publicly, there are interviews with the FCIC where he said that there was a conspiracy against LEH, and almost every part of the meetings at the NY Fed are public knowledge...you have no behind the scenes knowledge (you sound like every person: I met X who did Y terrible thing, he isn&#x27;t actually a bad guy, I am going to ignore all the public information about X and prioritise my super special &quot;insider&quot; knowledge).<p>I will ask you a different question: if LEH was so strong, why didn&#x27;t the Koreans invest? Why didn&#x27;t BARC invest before BK? The issue, again and again and as explained at massive length in several books, they had very shaky funding, they had a lot of stuff that no-one knew how to value, they insisted to everyone that this stuff was very very valuable...it was not. If the real estate was so valuable, why couldn&#x27;t they sell it? Every single person who I have ever met in the same position (I have met many) is in denial...that is why they are in that position. Fuld made numerous mistakes that can be summarised as: he thought he had pocket aces, he had 72o.<p>Asking Dick Fuld for opinions on Dick Fuld is not smart.')
