Thankfully, that didn&#x27;t happen. My friend rides herd on all the python code written at BigBank. He said they now have over 1MM python scripts, &quot;Most of them written by people who had no business writing code in the first place.&quot;\nPython certainly lowers the barrier to writing code, but I seriously doubt many Excel power users will jump on the Python bandwagon.\nIf you are not up to speed with the latest BI tools for Excel, you are missing out. Power Pivot is brilliant and dynamic ranges are the cat&#x27;s meow. With LAMBDA there is no need to try cramming Python into Excel.
