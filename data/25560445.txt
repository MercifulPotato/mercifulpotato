Oh wait, they&#x27;re not disinterested in cars. There&#x27;s a popular series of movies called Cars, and kids&#x27; toys include endless variations of cars like remote controlled cars and collections of miniature cars. When playing, kids will happily make vroom vroom noises and simulate car jumps and stunts and crashes, but I have never seen children&#x27;s play involving the scenario of walking to a restaurant instead of driving there.')
