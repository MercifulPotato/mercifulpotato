If it&#x27;s possible to hire someone for minimum wage, you hire for minimum wage.<p>If it&#x27;s possible to import and indenture a guy for whom a crowded shared house with an actual bathroom looks like a palace, you&#x27;ll do that. If you don&#x27;t, your competitor will.<p>&gt;why would you put the burden of that on immigrant workers<p>You don&#x27;t put it on immigrant workers, you put it on industries whose demand exceeds supply.<p>Also remember that immigrant workers don&#x27;t come out of nowhere. You imported 100 nurses, India and Pakistan have 100 nurses less. Vacuuming up the brightest people from everywhere doesn&#x27;t help global development.')
