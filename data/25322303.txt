This is smart.  However, it will require Slack to change to fit into the product catalogue, and that change is what will kill Slack.<p>This is unlike the Heroku acquisition in 2011, where Salesforce just wanted to enter into the &quot;cloud&quot; market but didn&#x27;t really need to bundle the product into the rest of their systems.  As far as I can tell, Heroku came out fairly unscathed and used the money to improve themselves&#x2F;continue operations.<p>I think the Slack as we knew it is probably not long for this world.  It will be absorbed and mutated to live inside Salesforce.')
