Like saying you knew some technology that you didn&#x27;t on a resume or selling some product that you hadn&#x27;t built yet.  They framed it as a positive.  Finding opportunities and using them to your advantage. But a negative framing would be that they were looking for people that exploited whatever advantage they oculd find.')
