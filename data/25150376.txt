Item(by='JAlexoid', descendants=None, kids=[25151417], score=None, time=1605799300, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25143777, text='&gt; I think this is the cynical view that paints it in an arrogant light.<p>Because it is arrogant to say that vegans must subsidize milk production(which they do), it is arrogant to say that an atheist must pay compensate for Church tax exemptions... and the farther away the taxing authority, the more arrogant it is. The biggest issue that I have with my taxes here in US - subsidies for military to fight a war on behalf of the Saudis in Yemen.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to pay for or contribute to something bigger&#x2F;better - then why use tax for it?<p>&gt; I mean, isn&#x27;t this par for the course in any group environment<p>When you voluntarily join said environment - sure.<p>Funny... Being gay, growing up in Lithuania and living on $10 per week(between me and my mother) - I got to be libertarian well before I got to earn those 6 figures.<p>PS: I also detest Ayn Rand.')
