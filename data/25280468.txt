The FDA and UK had a head start so of course they can make an informed decision sooner.<p>Maybe the EU should say &quot;We haven&#x27;t seen the data, but it is good enough for the UK so good enough for us.&quot;. However what if the data shows it is good enough for anyone from north-west Europe, but not anywhere else in the world - then the approval would just needless divert the vaccine from where it would work (the UK) and give people it won&#x27;t work on anyway a sore arm.  This is an extreme, unlikely situation, but it is the type of thing they EU needs to know about.')
