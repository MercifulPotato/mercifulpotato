As far as I can see, the golden years for doctors were 80s to 00s, but now they are having to band together as it&#x27;s big insurance company vs big doctor group vs big hospital group, and if you&#x27;re not big, you get crushed.  Sucks for the younger doctors, but the decision makers are many times still older doctors.<p>&gt;And the ACA mandating the minimum medical loss ratio for insurance companies had the unintended side effect of incentivizing health insurance companies to pay more expensive medical bills, because they can only pay their exec staff a fixed % of what they spend on health claims. The more they spend on claims, the more they can pay their executive staff.<p>Yet the rate of increase in healthcare costs went down after ACA went into effect.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;720767&#x2F;medical-cost-trend-in-us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;720767&#x2F;medical-cost-tren...</a><p>&gt;Doctors can be corrupt in many ways, but not being transparent about what they&#x27;ll bill isn&#x27;t an important one.<p>That is an incredible claim to me.  Literally, the only time someone asks me to hand over an infinite amount of money is when I purchase healthcare, and if one can&#x27;t see the moral hazard there, then I don&#x27;t know what to say.  We&#x27;re not talking about a person in the ER with unknown ailments and required work, we&#x27;re talking about completely routine procedures that healthcare providers are refusing to give information about.<p>They could provide me the codes so that I can ask my insurance company what it will cost.  They could take those codes and look up what they negotiated with my insurance company.  But they do neither.  Because why not get a blank check from everyone.')
