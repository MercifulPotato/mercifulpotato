It&#x27;s clich√©, but portrayal of hackers in films always implies that they could get into anything, with reasoning in a similar vein to if I knew all about windows and used that knowledge to smash the window of someone&#x27;s house, then claimed it was a flaw I could get in that&#x27;d be on me.<p>Then, there is the problem of communication. An external person discovering such a flaw is already going out of their way to do something for the maker of the software, and I find that those being communicated with often find this interaction grating.<p>I think the psychology is complicated but it&#x27;s somewhere between alarm that such a flaw was found, fear that the finding of such a flaw is a reflection on you, or your engineering team that will harm you and that researcher, unpaid and not expecting anything isn&#x27;t there to hold their hand and reassure &#x2F; explain such things. As a researcher, I want to spend the minimum time on this.<p>The only thing I&#x27;ll insist on is that it gets fixed in time, and if this draws out for months I eventually get in a position where I <i>have</i> to make threats of disclosure or nothing will get done.')
