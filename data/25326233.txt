You have to read and write back the data, you just simply can not perform faster than your memory bandwidth.\nex If you have 2GB model ( 1G float16 ), which does not fit in any cache, and have to perform calculation on all of the data, than for 1 operation on all of the data 4 GB bandwidth is required.
