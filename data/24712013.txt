It&#x27;s more an argument that if you don&#x27;t have mass because all the mass has decayed, through Einstein&#x27;s relation of mass and energy and Planck&#x27;s relation of energy and frequency, and frequency involving distance and time, with no mass, you lose notions of distance and time. Then the infinitly large distant future universe and the infinitely small distant past big bang become indistinguishable with the loss of &quot;large&quot; and &quot;small&quot; to distinguish them. They are both &quot;at infinity&quot;, they both &quot;contain&quot; all the energy in the universe, and what we see as a tiny big bang, aliens on the other side saw as a huge expanded universe.<p>From what I (layperson) can tell, it&#x27;s like the expand&#x2F;crunch cyclic universe theory, but without the need to crunch back down again.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=orMtwOz6Db0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=orMtwOz6Db0</a>')
