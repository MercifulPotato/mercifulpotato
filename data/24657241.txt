You know, the funniest thing is that in a divided government, there is no possibility of movement on this subject. The Republicans want one type of change to section 230, which would prevent the suppression of conservative-adjacent voices. On the other hand, the Democrats would like the opposite: greater responsibility of the platform to limit racist, sexist, and violent content. It seems like compromise on this subject is extremely difficult when the two sides want directionally opposite changes, and each controls one half of the legislative apparatus.<p>What kind of bargain could they strike? &quot;Well, we&#x27;re going to have YouTube ban sexists but allow unlimited racist content. Ok, deal?&quot; It&#x27;s hard for me to picture any amendment of section 230 that would be both material and palatable to both sides. Not to mention that there&#x27;s the whole constitutionality question, where corporations have enhanced rights of political speech post Citizen&#x27;s United, and any legislative infringement on that can probably be challenged all the way to the top.')
