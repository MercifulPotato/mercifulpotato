The user should be allowed to do what they want, right?<p>The web needs to be secure against untrusted code, so it makes sense that there might be things you can do in a native application that you can&#x27;t do in the browser.<p>&gt; Why should I _have_ to use native apps if I don&#x27;t want to?<p>It&#x27;s not an affront on your freedoms to impose sensible restrictions on browsers&#x27; capabilities.<p>&gt; As a web developer, why do I need to learn Qt or GTK or whatever to ship something useful to end users, when I already know HTML and JS and could easily deliver my product if the right native API was exposed?<p>If you want to use your web-dev skills to build native applications, there are various frameworks that let you do exactly that. You can call C&#x2F;C++ functions from Electron. [0] Of course, you also have the option of learning and using C++ for your own GUI code, with frameworks like Qt.<p>&gt; Remember splash screens? Random freezes? Running out of RAM because some random app in the background decided to malloc 80GB for some godforsaken reason? How is that a better experience than a web app running in a sandboxed tab you could easily kill whenever you want?<p>This is a straw-man. The people you are caricaturing are just people who want technically excellent software. This includes (but is not limited to) the efficient use of computational resources. No-one is pining for the instability of Windows 98.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;39569062&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;39569062&#x2F;</a>')
