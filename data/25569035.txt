Almost exactly a year ago my wife and I bought a digital piano (Yamaha Arius YDP-164). She learned to play in her youth. However I thought if we have this at home I will learn it. I love listening to piano music, be it classical or jazz.<p>Back then I started to train about an hour every evening. I used a few books like &quot;The Russian School of Piano Playing&quot;. I felt that I made good progress in the few months until the Corona madness hit. Then time was scarce and I totally stopped.<p>Now I want to start over again and wonder if you have some tips on what I should play&#x2F;practice especially. How do divide my daily hour? My plan is to do it in the evening&#x2F;night with headphones, so a teacher really is not an option currently.<p>Thanks in advance.')
