[1]<p>I will point out that it has been the position of the American people since WWII that we are happy to foot the bill for global security. So while you might not feel that way, Americans feel differently. I&#x27;ll give a bit of background on how that came to be.<p>While Hitler was cutting through Europe there was a extensive internal debate in the US whether just focusing on defending the Pacific would be sufficient. During the time leading up the Battle of Britain, we decided the US view of security needed to be global-- if Hitler overran Britain the threat was just too large. It would turn out that the Brits won one of the most significant military victories in history [2], but prior that fact emerging American policy had come to the firm conclusion that we had to defend east as well as west. The Brits handled it, but it was tough to know that at the time.<p>Since WWII we have not really reevaluated this policy. Some in the US believe it is time to do so and the current election will decide much of this. But in the last 10 years we have witnessed the biggest land grab in Europe since World War II [3], so now might not be the time to dissolve the world order.<p>This may be more detail than you were expecting, but I hope you found it interesting. The world is a much more fragile place that I wish and at the end of the day we all need to chip in for global security.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25004863" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25004863</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Battle_of_Britain#Aftermath" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Battle_of_Britain#Aftermath</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;order-from-chaos&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;17&#x2F;crimea-six-years-after-illegal-annexation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;order-from-chaos&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;17&#x2F;c...</a>')
