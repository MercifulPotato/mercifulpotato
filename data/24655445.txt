There were plenty of identical connectors (or ones that would fit together at least) in the past that were absolutely incompatible to the point of risking frying your electronics. At least with USB-C, if a capability can&#x27;t be matched between the connected devices and the cable, it just doesn&#x27;t work. Nothing will go up in a puff of smoke.<p>And for anyone complaining about needing different chargers for your phone and laptop, how is that any worse than before? You needed to do the same before USB-C. Now at least you have the option to plug your phone into your laptop charger. (Though if your complaint about USB-C for laptop charging is in regards to fragility, then I agree. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to break them. Never had that thought about a barrel plug)')
