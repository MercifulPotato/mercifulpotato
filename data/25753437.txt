My personal income is the same I would get in Toronto, but it&#x27;s anecdotal. I know they are slightly lower on average, but when you factor in the cost of living (rent is 2x higher in TO) it is probably very similar. On the other side, I would say the quality of life is much better in MTL, as the public transportation is better, people do not live as far and are closer to the various activities, etc.')
