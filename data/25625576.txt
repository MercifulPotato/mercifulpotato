Interop with a library means interop&#x2F;conformance with its type system. Which means if you want languages with new &#x2F; innovative type systems, someone will need to build a library system to resolve this.<p>Either an untyped library system as large as the .NET or Java library systems, or a library that has a trivial way to tack on type transformation of some form so that each language that interops with it can minimally add a type translation layer between the two. What that looks like, I&#x27;m not certain.<p>But as long as engineers need to be productive, they need a robust modern library system. No new lang will get adopted if the lang author also needs to build up a complete library system, so it must be a general component.')
