Non-partisan does not mean neutral on political issues. The ACLU has never been neutral on political issues, going back as long as they&#x27;ve existed [1]. Non-partisan means they pursue their vision of civil rights regardless of which party that brings them into conflict with. If they come info conflict with one party more than another, that doesn&#x27;t make them partisan. It just means that their vision of civil liberties has been taken up more by one party than others.<p>[1] Just skim their wikipedia page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;American_Civil_Liberties_Union" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;American_Civil_Liberties_Union</a>')
