They are public spaces for all and, let me point out, that you usually need a permit to speak or have a rally. So they are not that free as everyone thinks.<p>Twitter is more like a mall owned by a large corporation and while there is some trouble there, they will kick people off the property that are too offensive. If you try to start an insurrection at a mall, you will be kicked out and banned.<p>It is in Twitters and mall owners best interest to start insurrections on their properties because there will be ramifications for allowing that to happen, that is not good for business.')
