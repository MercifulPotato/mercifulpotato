What you&#x27;re saying is true in some provinces but not all. However, even in the provinces without material barriers, no private sector exists. The article actually provides some solid theories.<p>Your information about MRI waiting times isn&#x27;t accurate in general - or rather paints only part of the picture. Even with the COVID situation happening now, in Ontario... Patients who should be scanned immediately receive a scan, immediately. Patients who should be scanned within 2 days are in fact scanned within 2 days. Patients who have a target of 10 days for a scan wait closer to 18 (but 53% are scanned within the SLA). Patients who have a target of 28 days wait closer to 90. [1].<p>If you don&#x27;t need one now, you&#x27;re wasting capacity by getting one now. This capacity should be allocated 100% to the public sector on a need basis. That would reduce wait times for all priorities. This is in fact what the British Columbia government did [2] to excellent effect [3].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC80881&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC80881&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hqontario.ca&#x2F;System-Performance&#x2F;Wait-Times-for-Diagnostic-Imaging" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hqontario.ca&#x2F;System-Performance&#x2F;Wait-Times-for-D...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globalnews.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;4481951&#x2F;b-c-to-purchase-two-private-mri-clinics-to-reduce-wait-times&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globalnews.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;4481951&#x2F;b-c-to-purchase-two-priva...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globalnews.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;5256655&#x2F;wait-times-mri-procedures&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globalnews.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;5256655&#x2F;wait-times-mri-procedures...</a>')
