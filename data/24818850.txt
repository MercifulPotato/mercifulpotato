I think all the platforms like Google, Facebook, Instagram and so on should be forbidden to collect the data they don&#x27;t need to conduct business. That is they should not be allowed to package the data and sell or develop new products using this data.\nOtherwise we should consider whether people using their products could be considered their employees and had to be paid appropriate wages? In the end entering data to their systems is a job.')
