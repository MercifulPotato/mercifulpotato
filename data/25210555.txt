What would an external adversary do in that situation? Traffic analysis of updates to the cloud-side E2E-encrypted bundle. That alone would <i>still</i> be enough to create a useful advertising profile of the customer&#x27;s reading habits, since your app is single-purpose — the only reason for that encrypted bundle to be updated, is if the user is flipping pages!<p>And, together with the fact that your ad-tech department <i>also</i> knows what books the customer is reading (because your device can only be used to read books <i>you sell</i>, and thus books you have transaction records for selling them), this department can probably guess what the user is reading anyway. No matter how much your hardware-product department tries to hide it.')
