There is no sandboxing of foreign code at this time.<p>If the code you are calling isn&#x27;t thread safe and you run your Pony program with more than 1 scheduler thread (pony actors get run on 1 or more scheduler threads- generally 1 per scheduler thread per CPU) then &quot;bad things canhappen&quot;.\nBecaue you are running unsafe code that can be accessed from multiple threads- but... well, maybe you can structure the Pony API so that you don&#x27;t do that.<p>It really depends.')
