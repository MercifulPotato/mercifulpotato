Erlang doesn&#x27;t magically make it so you never have to add more servers. Actually, it&#x27;s the opposite. Erlang is pretty computationally inefficient compared to most statically typed languages like Java. If there is any VM out there preventing your from needing more servers, it&#x27;s the JVM. Generally speaking you can do more work with fewer resources with the JVM than you can with the BeamVM...it&#x27;s just that the BeamVM makes it easier to add more resources.')
