Usually 2-5 km&#x2F;hr below my cars number. So I always assume now that my car&#x27;s number is more of a projection of the acceleration levels combined with the current speed to give a picture of how fast you&#x27;re going to be traveling very shortly.<p>I&#x27;ve long been curious which one is more accurate.  Apologies I&#x27;ve yet to do the rabbithole of figuring out how speedometers work vs how the radar speed sign works. I just assumed the radar device (on an empty road) is more accurate to real life than my car since it&#x27;s a fixed external measure.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Radar_speed_sign" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Radar_speed_sign</a>')
