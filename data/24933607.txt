That doesn&#x27;t seem like it qualifies as a story to me that needs to be on national news because who cares? I also do think there is like an 80% chance they hacked his iCloud account though.<p>I think that there is no source for this information, which is required for hard journalism. Like who is standing by this information and saying it is genuine? I think it bears all the hallmarks of Russian intelligence, and they even did this exact same thing in France.<p>The entire &quot;story&quot; here is unclear. How is Joe Biden involved? Can you even prove these business deals are real? You can&#x27;t even verify the contents of these emails are real. Journalists aren&#x27;t even being allowed to verify the hard drive.<p>The tax returns did have a real source that the journalists themselves verified. That isn&#x27;t possible here because the story of the laptop is wildly unbelievable.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;wsj-newsroom-found-no-joe-biden-role-hunter-deals-after-reviewing-bobulinskis-records-1541553" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;wsj-newsroom-found-no-joe-biden-rol...</a><p>The media isn&#x27;t ignoring this, but it is incredibly sketchy.')
