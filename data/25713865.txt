The worst thing western nations did is physically invade nations through wars. Providing internet services is in the &quot;lets sit in a circle peacefully and share things&quot; bucket. It&#x27;s about the furthest you could go from a war.<p>&gt;I think this illustrates how unbalanced and agenda-driven these media and social graph services have become who bring in foreign values to local elections.<p>Considering the existing rulers fail to live up to their responsibilities that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.<p>&gt;This interference used to be called neo-imperialism not too long ago by the same people who now advocate for these narratives.<p>The countries who accept them can often be more successful than those who refuse them. Hong Kong is a pretty good example. Democratic values and capitalism forced down the throat of people. This became a threat to the authoritarian regime in the Chinese mainland and the rulers have to make concessions to their population. They built special economic development zones and simply copied the ideas that worked out in Hong Kong and were compatible with Chinese values at the time. Western investors suddenly had a reliable business partner in Hong Kong and a large &quot;proxy&quot; workforce that was manufacturing goods on the mainland which got shipped to Hong Kong and could be sold to the west. The story ends with China becoming a world leading economy, not because of the west but rather because the west forced the government to listen to the people.')
