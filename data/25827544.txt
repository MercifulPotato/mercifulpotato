But I will admit that I do feel somewhat more <i>precise</i> at my current job than I was at my previous.<p>I used to work in an agency and we would charge by the hour so you needed to find a safe space between speed and safety. I wrote some nice, and some not so nice code there.<p>I now work at a much larger company and the environment is vastly different. We focus heavily on metrics, are very careful with testing, make sure to design design components, security reviews, and have plenty of documentation.<p>I really do wish software engineering could be used as the term to identify this kind of environment where it&#x27;s not just about the code, but about all the stuff you do around code to ensure it&#x27;s safe.')
