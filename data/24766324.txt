Unprecedented amounts of venture capital money are now available to promising startups, regardless of stage and location<p>This should be taken with a massive grain of salt and skepticism. Capital is available to those who are either 1 or 2 degrees separated from the VC community. In my experience, the VC community is incredibly hostile and skeptics themselves, only entertaining leads that are at the very minimum, luke-warm. If you&#x27;re a founder just starting out with no connection to the VC community, you&#x27;re gonna have a really rough time just getting a meeting, let alone a term sheet. It&#x27;s kind of ironic but again, this is my experience.')
