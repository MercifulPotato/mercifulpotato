Do you feel it was worth the alienation of Canada as an ally?  What advantages do you feel have been gained in trade with China?  Wouldn&#x27;t it have been more productive to work with allies on that front, rather than launching a unilateral trade war? Are these really the reasons you like him, or are they justifications?<p>I agree that not starting wars is good (except potentially when it&#x27;s the only way to stop a terrible human rights abuse, like a genocide), and Trump certainly has a better record than Bush there. He does also seem to have made progress with middle east treaties. So I am with you there.<p>What on earth do you like about his <i>style</i> though? His style is to lie about everything, making up whatever supposed fact suits him at the moment, launch ridiculous ad hominem attacks at anyone he views as an enemy, and just basically stir up anger and discord. The way he &quot;pushes back&quot; is that of a childhood bully. He has ramped up partisan division and anger to an unprecedented level in modern history, and is in the process of undermining confidence in the democratic process itself. He&#x27;s also alienated the rest of the world with his narcissism, incivility and pettiness. These do not seem like good qualities in a person, and especially not in a president.<p>I can understand people who vote for him because they&#x27;re staunchly pro life. I&#x27;m not, but I can understand their ethical position.  And I can understand those who have fallen for conspiracy theories.  But if you&#x27;re existing in the same reality I am, reading the things the man writes, and listening to the things he says, I honestly can&#x27;t imagine how you can support him. I&#x27;m not one of these that thinks all Trump supporters are racists, or conspiracy theorists, or Russian bots, but I do find that any I&#x27;ve met who seem reasonable, once I dig deeper, believe things about the world that I don&#x27;t just disagree with but know to be factually untrue. I&#x27;ve also met some who see the world the way I do, but aren&#x27;t reasonable - basically those who just enjoy the fact that he makes the other side angry. I would truly like to understand what, besides a genuine belief that abortion is murder, could bring a reasonable, knowledgeable person to vote for Trump.')
