Item(by='morganvachon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602465702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24750439, text='I recently built a system based around a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and Radeon RX 5600 XT GPU, and in both Windows 10 and Linux with a 5.4+ kernel it&#x27;s rock solid. Gaming in Windows is simply amazing and it pairs well with my 1440p monitor. On Linux gaming is also extremely good, with only a couple of &quot;Windows only&quot; titles acting buggy under Proton&#x2F;Steam. Considering Proton itself is in its infancy, that&#x27;s to be expected.<p>With native performance on official Linux games on par with or better than the Windows equivalent, and more and more games getting Linux ports due to Vulkan, I just about have no need to boot into Windows at home anymore apart from Fusion 360.<p>As a workstation in Windows, since I don&#x27;t overclock I don&#x27;t see any stability issues. Fusion 360 is fast and fluid unlike my 8 year old Sandy Bridge dinosaur at work, even after adding a GT 1030. Good quality Crucial RAM and a no-frills AsRock B450 board make for a rock-solid build. Ditto on Linux as a workstation, everything just works and works well, and it&#x27;s superb for 3D modeling and music creation (two of my main hobbies).')
