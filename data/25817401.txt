A Raspberry Pi 4 is only $10 more and immensely more capable, as well as well-supported and heavily documented.<p>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not in manufacturers&#x27; best interests to make these devices hackable. All costs considered, Amazon is likely selling these near at-cost. They&#x27;re not selling the hardware as an independent product. They&#x27;re selling it as an extension to their larger platform (Alexa). As soon as a product becomes hackable, some portion of sales are lost to enthusiasts who buy one thinking they might hack it some day. If this gets out of control, eventually the company is subsidizing enthusiasts and the whole proposition becomes a net loss for the company.')
