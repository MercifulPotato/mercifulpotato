I work through a vendor that finds contracts for me at different companies. I recently found out that all the major vendors in Poland have non-compete agreements with each other, meaning they&#x27;re not allowed to poach each other’s engineers.  It actually goes beyond that, I recommended a friend of mine who was looking to switch from his current vendor and got refused an interview with my vendor because of the no compete thing.  I think this practice artificially drives down the price of an engineer’s salary and generally is not good for the market.  I think HR divisions do something similar as well.')
