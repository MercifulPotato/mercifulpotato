Now if you voice your opinion online, it can be challenged instantly by people from all different backgrounds all across the globe.  <i>Of course</i> the result of that is that more controversial viewpoints face more resistance than they did in the past.<p>However I do think it&#x27;s worth thinking about how the structure of online communication affects idea formation and the perception of consensus.  The gamification and quantization of social interactions which exists on social media platforms does have an effect on which types of ideas are mainstreamed, and which ones are marginalized, and I think it can be argued that this has not always been for the better.')
