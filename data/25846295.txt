I really hated the adobe cloud concept... I just don&#x27;t like the idea of renting software instead of owning it. Then it kept getting worse as far as resources it was consuming and number of softwares that were required to install. What really ticked me off was having to pay to upgrade photoshop whenever I got a new camera because you could only get the newest &quot;camera raw&quot; with the most current version. So basically you end up buying an entire new version of photoshop just for an updated nikon raw codec (in my case) just to be able to import your images.<p>I spent a good deal of time and money in 2020 getting myself untangled from Adobe. The only thing of theirs allowed on my system now is a pdf reader and left such a bitter taste in my mouth I will actively never purchase another one of their professional products again. $300 for Black Magic&#x27;s Resolve Studio is wayyyy worth it, and a better product now that I&#x27;m more proficient at it. I know many professionals in the film&#x2F;video industry who have left them and won&#x27;t look back. I was a hold out for too long.<p>The only thing that makes me particularly sad about it now is that I have no way to open my old projects, because you rent adobe - you don&#x27;t own it. Well I can open things that were created prior to version 6 as I do still own 5.5 Creative Suite and can use it... If I can find a damn dvd reader.')
