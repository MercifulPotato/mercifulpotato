Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610228197, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25704904, text='Yes, I agree, people should be doing the &quot;easy, obvious, low risk&quot; stuff first (if they can -- lots of people don&#x27;t have the money, can&#x27;t exercise adequately because of lock down, etc).<p>One of the problems is that is an inherently hard sell. People are terrible at measuring the disasters that <i>should</i> have happened but didn&#x27;t.<p>If you convinced everyone to take their Vitamin D supplements, you would have an extremely hard time measuring the deaths that didn&#x27;t happen but should have and an even harder time convincing the general public you weren&#x27;t making up BS as click bait.<p>This is the bane of my existence. I have a serious medical condition and I know what <i>the path not taken</i> is supposed to look like and I&#x27;ve been getting better for nearly two decades when the condition is supposed to involve a steady and irreversible decline and I get told all the time that I am full of baloney and I can&#x27;t possibly know that what I&#x27;m doing is effective and &quot;X number of years of steady forward progress is just a wild coincidence -- stranger things have happened&quot; and on and on.<p>Even people who believed me and took my advice have told me &quot;I gave x, y and z nutritional things to my child and they are in the ER less but they aren&#x27;t on less medication.&quot; by which this person meant the child&#x27;s maintenance drugs were the same. But they implicitly failed to count the fewer antibiotics, steroids and other emergency treatment drugs as &quot;less medication.&quot;<p>If you normally are in the ER every couple of months and need antibiotics for a month afterwards, being in the ER less constitutes a very significant reduction in use of medication. So this person was seeing results and going &quot;But my child still needs just as much maintenance drugs, so the drug use is <i>the same</i> as before&quot; when it absolutely wasn&#x27;t <i>the same</i> as before.<p>So what you will see here is that the general public is much happier if you can tell them &quot;X number of people were saved by a vaccine&#x2F;antibiotic&#x2F;ventilator&#x2F;hospitalization&quot; than if you tell them &quot;We convinced the entire nation to take its vitamins and saw a dramatic reduction in incidence of disease.&quot;<p>If you tell them the second thing, the entire world will rise up and go &quot;You are so full of shit. That&#x27;s just a coincidence man. We didn&#x27;t even need to take our vitamins. It just fucking died out for no apparent reason and you made me waste all this money on vitamins, you shit head, you.&quot;<p>So I&#x27;ve mostly quit trying to talk about &quot;Things you -- yes, you as an individual -- can do to try to cope with this global pandemic.&quot; because I&#x27;m tired of being attacked with bullshit accusations of &quot;practicing medicine without a license&quot; and other crapola of that ilk.<p>I&#x27;m pretty damn sure I will survive this -- unless I stupidly try to be helpful, in which case an angry mob may decide I am somehow to blame for something. So: Whatever. &quot;You fools do whatever the fuck makes sense to you and leave me the hell alone.&quot;')
