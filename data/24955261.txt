I can think of multiple angles of attack if they were reselling it or distributing it under another license (MIT&#x2F;BSD&#x2F;GPL&#x2F;other), that&#x27;d instantly give you the right to sue them, but because it doesn&#x27;t have any license and doesn&#x27;t claim anything, I don&#x27;t know.<p>It could probably be considered to be defacto AGPL since the AGPL is contagious so there&#x27;s nothing to complain about. It&#x27;s tricky ^^<p>edit: The other thing is what&#x27;s the purpose of attacking? You attack for a purpose, usually damages and&#x2F;or shutting down the project. There&#x27;s nothing to gain here. For reference the last GPL cases I&#x27;ve seen were self-defeating for the defendants, the user&#x2F;customer&#x2F;client sue the contractor&#x2F;company&#x2F;vendor who gave them modified GPL software, the defendant wins but loses the right to use the software they paid for, which is dumb!')
