Item(by='tb100', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603992706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24932842, text='Hi all,<p>I&#x27;m the guy in the walkthrough video.<p>ZapBox started as a Google Cardboard-inspired approach for video see-through MR, but we&#x27;ve now completely redesigned the physical product for the ZapBox use case.<p>The linked video shows a walkthrough of the older cardboard version, just because the tracking code for the new designs isn&#x27;t production-ready yet.<p>Thought I&#x27;d share this with HN rather than the general Kickstarter campaign for the new design, as it goes into a bit more technical detail and shows some interesting issues in bringing stereo MR to existing smartphone devices.<p>Happy to discuss anything technical ZapBox-related here, relating either to the old or the new version. And of course if you want to back the current Kickstarter campaign, that&#x27;d be much appreciated too :)<p>Simon')
