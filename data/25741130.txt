Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25743148], score=None, time=1610415236, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25741007, text='&gt; I think the government would be very interested to initiate an investigation if Shell decided to not fill your tank because they discovered you are a neo-Keynesian, even if there is a Chevron station 3 miles away.<p>Even if that was true, which it is not generally in the US, that&#x27;s not analogous to what is happening. It&#x27;s more like if Shell, instead of selling gas for money, was a peer-to-peer gas exchange service, and they decided not to let you participate because the traits of the specific formulation of gas you were providing didn&#x27;t conform to what they wanted in their exchange network.')
