I can’t pay my taxes in Yen but that doesn’t mean Yen isn’t real money.<p>This is an example of a tech person extrapolating their expertise outside tech. Bitcoin is an experiment in economics as much as it’s an experiment in technology. Just because the network is slow to process transactions doesn’t mean the entire system is worthless.<p>The first 90% of the article isn’t bad, but IMO author didn’t really backup his claims.')
