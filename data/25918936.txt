Every little tidbit of court minutae at the venal Trump White House was covered (which press secretary was leaving, who was getting pardons), but not this enormous crisis that the US has direct control over.<p>It was disgusting how easily MBS was fawned over (see this absurd feature on MBS by Thomas Friedman [1]), how the Western media only cared about one of their own (Khashoggi was a WaPo journalist), and how quickly companies are coming back to back MBS&#x27;s fantastical investment schemes like the Jetsons city-from-scratch NEOM, after stepping back for just a year.<p>The US doesn&#x27;t even import all that much oil from Saudi Arabia! It&#x27;s only use is as a lever to press other countries that rely on Saudi oil to come under the US fold.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;saudi-prince-mbs-arab-spring.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;saudi-prince-mbs-...</a>')
