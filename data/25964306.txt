Right-clicking to produce a context menu in Windows was easy to explain to my mom, and she very quickly started to use it everywhere to discover the available actions - and <i>it worked</i>. In mobile UIs, on the other hand, to this day, she is struggling to figure out where you&#x27;re supposed to press-and-hold, where you&#x27;re supposed to swipe etc. Quite often, she&#x27;ll do press-and-hold to do something that worked in one app, and it doesn&#x27;t work in another. Desktop apps are much more consistent in that regard.')
