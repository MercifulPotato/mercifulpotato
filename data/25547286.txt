Item(by='gerhardlazu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609025032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25546964, text='I use Digital Ocean, Scaleway, Linode, Google, Cloudflare &amp; Amazon on a daily basis, and I have experienced networking issues on all providers this year. It&#x27;s all public, some even wrote lengthy post-mortems, most have been posted on HN.<p>When failures happen, it&#x27;s always a series of unfortunate incidents. When we&#x27;ve hit issues with Linode, we reached out and worked on what we can improve in our changelog.com setup, and discussed about the improvements that we can expect on the Linode end. Our common interest is a more resilient system, which requires a healthy collaboration, and Linode has been a great technology partner for us. Expect to see these write-ups on changelog.com as soon as these improvements have shipped, and we have hard data to support the claims ; )<p>I&#x27;m sorry to hear that things have not been as smooth for you on Linode. I hope that you will find an infra provider that you will be able to rely on and work with as we do. Not all collaborations will work out, and that&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s also OK to be annoyed, fed up with the way things are and look for something different, something more suitable for you. My only ask is that you share your migration story with the changelog.com community. That is something that I would want to hear about.')
