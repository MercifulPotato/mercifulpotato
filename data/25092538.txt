Why?</i><p>The answer is actually very simple: spam.<p>AFAIK pretty much all disabled Google accounts come from Google believing they are part of a spam-sending (or malware-spreading) network.<p>The ability to sign up for free Google accounts means this is a prime target for spammers to use and abuse -- signing up for free Gmail&#x2F;Drive accounts, as well as using stolen credit cars to sign up for paid ones.<p>As to why the legal system doesn&#x27;t want to be involved, it&#x27;s because incorrectly disabled Google accounts are actually incredibly rare -- they make the news and cause uproar when they occur, but precisely <i>because</i> it&#x27;s so unusual -- it&#x27;s incredibly rare to personally know someone it happened to. So there isn&#x27;t any kind of democratic movement against it because in the grand scheme of things it isn&#x27;t common. It&#x27;s like worrying about being struck by lightning.<p>That&#x27;s why.')
