If I had spread that endpoint across 25 commits, I&#x27;d have to actually debug the issue in QA and figure out what I broke.  Reverting quickly lets me debug the issue on my time instead of keeping our test suite broken.<p>It&#x27;s not always feasible, and I try not to be a stickler when people on my team don&#x27;t do it but the fact is, if you&#x27;re working in a world when you&#x27;re delivery code quickly into real environments, having a back-out strategy is paramount.')
