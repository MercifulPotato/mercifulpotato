It&#x27;s only an issue if Apple sells their processors to other companies as components. In that case they are required to comply with ARM&#x27;s certification requirements, because ARM doesn&#x27;t want the market for ARM cpus to become fragmented. If Apple are only using these CPUs for their internal products I don&#x27;t think those requirements apply.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like the way the GPL has requirements that apply if you distribute the software (you have to release source code), but if you use your modified code internally the requirement doesn&#x27;t apply. In this case &quot;distributing&quot; is equivalent to selling the CPUs as components, in contrast to using them in your own products (even ones you sell to customers) which counts as internal use and so the requirement doesn&#x27;t apply.')
