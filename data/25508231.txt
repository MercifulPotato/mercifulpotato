Sweden may not care to intervene, but the way for Russia to secure the Baltic States from NATO is to seize Gotland.  That is something Russia has the capability to do, and Sweden is not very well prepared to defend against.  NATO membership would relieve a lot of that risk.<p>NATO is actually a positive organization in terms of promoting the peace.  It is and probably always will be totally ineffective as an offensive alliance.  But it is unbeatable as a defensive alliance.  So everybody wants to be a member to save on defense spending.  I don&#x27;t think that is awful.')
