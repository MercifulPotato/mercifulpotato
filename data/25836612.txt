It is quite hard these days to get it to do something different between x86, ARM, and Power, except relying on memory model features not guaranteed on the latter two; and on M1 the memory model apes x86&#x27;s. Given a compatible memory model (which, NB, ARM <i>has not had</i> until M1) compiling for the target is trivial.<p>The x86 memory model makes it increasingly hard to scale performance to more cores. That has not held up AMD much, mainly because people don&#x27;t scale things out that don&#x27;t perform well when they do, and use a GPU when that does better. In principle it has to break at some point, but that has been said for a long time. It is indefinitely hard to port code developed on x86 to a more relaxed memory model, so the overwhelming majority of such codes will never be ported.')
