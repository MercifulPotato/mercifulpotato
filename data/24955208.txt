Wouldn&#x27;t it be hard to do without effectively making a derivative work?<p>Suppose that you remove the code, reimplement it but end up with something that&#x27;s extremely similar to the original (which is very likely since after all you&#x27;re doing the same thing). Couldn&#x27;t the original author argue that it&#x27;s still their code? How do you prove that you did the work and just happened with the same code because that&#x27;s just the most straightforward way to do it?<p>It seems like the only way to avoid the problem altogether would be to have some sort of clean room design:<p>- Dev A reads the code to be removed, writes a spec for the functionality.<p>- Dev A removes the code.<p>- Dev B takes the truncated code and the spec and implements the feature.<p>But that seems very painful to do cleanly, in particular one could argue that B should be a third party who is not intimately familiar with the codebase, otherwise it could be argued that they knew the previous code.')
