It&#x27;s not. Why do you think the US can bomb a hospital or school, civilians be damned? That&#x27;s a war crime but the justification &quot;but terrorists&quot; or &quot;but democracy&quot; wipes it away. How many war crimes do you think were committed in the Middle East and how many were condemned by that &quot;international law&quot;? How much outside interference do you think the elections in Ukraine got and how much of it was condemned? There was no &quot;innocent side&quot; in the whole Crimean issue. Whether local or on the other side of the world, all parties involved played the same game to try to gain something. Civilians as usually took the brunt of the conflict.<p>Russia doesn&#x27;t get sanctions because it &quot;guilty&quot; while the US does not because they&#x27;re &quot;innocent&quot; in the eyes of the law. International law is as negotiable, debatable, and esoteric as it gets. If you have enough power and support from others you claim it&#x27;s on your side and do what you need to do. And that support is critical, it&#x27;s why the US needs the EU on their side: legitimacy. That&#x27;s why the EU could contribute pocket lint to the NATO budget and still benefit from US spending.<p>Google &quot;civilians dead in the middle east&quot; and you&#x27;ll see how &quot;international law&quot; works. Let&#x27;s not play with words. Superpowers go to extreme lengths to maintain their status. The bigger the status, the longer the lengths, because they can afford to do more and more of that.')
