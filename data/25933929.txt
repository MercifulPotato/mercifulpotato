Are you saying that people shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to tweet their trades? Also it&#x27;s ridiculous to think WSB isn&#x27;t full of bagholders - I&#x27;ve seen people blow up their accounts on completely ridiculous trades they had researched on their own. Are you saying people shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to make bad trades?<p>Chamath answers the question correctly; the question you&#x27;re asking implies that you don&#x27;t think retail should be trusted to invest. If that&#x27;s <i>truly</i> what you think then say it proudly.')
