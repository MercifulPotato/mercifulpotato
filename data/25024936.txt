So when creating those models I write code directly, no need to use a pseudo language like GraphQL.<p>&gt; (not really keen on writing my application logic in SQL)\nMaybe you should learn it, as it&#x27;s really simple and powerful as opposed to the GraphQL language.\nBut for the record, neither do I write SQL queries using my generator and last time I had to write SQL was in the 2000s when I was still using PHP.\nNowadays I just write my data models and generate the backend and implement the frontend.\nAnd I don&#x27;t need GraphQL for it.\n@ngrx-data for Angular simplifies communication with the backend. And since I generate my notifier&#x2F;updater too I have real-time updates via websocket.\nThere&#x27;s nothing GraphQL offers I don&#x27;t already do since 2016.')
