Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604339190, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24970058, text='<i>&gt; In the case of second-order logic, although it seems like we&#x27;re getting a precise, single semantic model, in fact all we&#x27;ve done is push the ambiguity to the metatheory which we use to interpret the semantics of second-order logic.</i><p>So how would this work in, say, the case of the natural numbers? What ambiguity gets pushed to the metatheory if I claim that the second order theory of the natural numbers pins down a single semantic model (the &quot;standard&quot; natural numbers and that&#x27;s all)? If it matters, assume we are using full semantics, not Henkin semantics (see further comments on that below).<p><i>&gt; Even the choice to use full semantics instead of Henkin semantics (an example of what is essentially multi-sorted FOL as @pron refers to) is an ambiguous choice one must make in deciding second-order semantics.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure I would call this choice &quot;ambiguous&quot; since the difference between the two choices is perfectly clear, and only one of them (full semantics) preserves the key property of second order logic, of pinning down a single semantic model.')
