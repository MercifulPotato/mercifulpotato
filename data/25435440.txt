Within months multiple competitors are nipping at the heels of the record.<p>I also see this in video game speed running. When a new breakthrough record is set suddenly the competitors begin to catch up to the new record now that they see it is indeed possible. Even new people playing the game don&#x27;t take 10 years to catch up skill wise when they can learn from previous attempts from the &#x27;old masters.&#x27;<p>It seems like even in the arena of AI breakthroughs as soon as some paper gets published others quickly catch up. I do agree there is no replacement for 10 years of research and work, but future people studying in the field can and do catch up.')
