Instead, I usually do something like that:<p><pre><code>    h1::first-line {font-size:2rem;}\n    h1 {font-size:1.5rem;}\n</code></pre>\nIt will show the first line of a heading in a larger and all further lines in a smaller font size. Additionally, you could hyphenate headings.<p>edit: And fluid typography might be something to look into. Currently, you seem to have a single breakpoint where font size is adapted. That does not work well on larger phones.')
