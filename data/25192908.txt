I relied on it a lot. Later I started using <i>The So What Strategy</i> which I refer to regularly as a consultant.<p>I also spent some time setting up my writing workflow. For me that was Markdown supported by Zotero (now Jurism) for references and Pandoc to generate a PDF for submission. But that workflow reflects my nerdy UNIX origin story and isn&#x27;t suitable for everyone. My wife uses Google Docs with Zotero quite happily.')
