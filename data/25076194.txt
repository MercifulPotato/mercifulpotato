You will either develop a need that isn&#x27;t addressed, or they will change the rules so you are no longer able to satisfy an existing need.<p>We&#x27;re seeing this now with Google - Their motto was literally &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; for a long time. And during that golden period their users <i>loved</i> them.
