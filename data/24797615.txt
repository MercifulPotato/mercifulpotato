It is really early. Joining open source software projects to help synthetic biologists will non-trivially affect the future of the field (they don&#x27;t know how to program)<p>If I had to predict what is coming in the next 10 years, I&#x27;d say that improvements in biotech networks are going to enable cool stuff. The BioBricks Foundation&#x27;s Bionet Project (worked on that a little) was a good foray into this idea. Basically, networks of materials and software are going to cause the price to participate to start dropping into early home-computer hobbyist realm.<p>Synthetic biology right now is in very infant stages of networking. We have Addgene, which is alright, but large scale collaboration on important projects are really unheard of. I think that&#x27;ll change.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve had the combo of visionary (Drew Endy, Tom Knight, etc) and pragmatist in academic synthetic biology yet to move forward on important projects. I think a new a group of synthetic biologists are incubating right now that may change that.')
