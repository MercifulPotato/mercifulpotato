That is to say, whether or not someone has committed a crime, for which they may or may not have been convicted, they have a moral obligation not to perpetrate violence against you. Post-hoc detention or punishment does not &#x27;correct&#x27; or remediate aggression, and I am not aware of any right to prevent hypothetical aggression.')
