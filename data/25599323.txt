There should be a section on MQ gotchas. Here&#x27;s my war story:<p>Back in the days when we didn&#x27;t know what we were doing, we had a system where MQ was used in Request&#x2F;Response style for querying databases.  On the beginning of this was a web endpoint. Frequently we end up in a cascading failure whenever we hit an overload situation, because the web client would time out, and retry another call. Meanwhile, there&#x27;s a bunch of query messages enqueued to be executed against the DB despite the fact the client had already disconnected. If you are trying to web scale, you&#x27;d end up paying for IO twice, first to query the DB and second to persist the results in a queue. The big take away for me was to be wary of coupling an unreliable synchronous RPC with a reliable asynchronous MQ.')
