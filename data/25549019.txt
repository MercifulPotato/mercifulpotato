It makes kingdoms exciting it there&#x27;s an occasional race to pick up lots of one card. I might ask to skip Minions if it&#x27;s on the board twice in a row but it&#x27;s one of my favorite cards. If there were more effective reaction cards, it might play a bit more dynamically.<p>If Chapel were nerfed, adding a condition where buying it caused that player to gain curses would be interesting. More so than increasing its cost.<p>Btw if you haven&#x27;t played an all-star kingdom before, where you put 10 of the most famously powerful cards on the table at once, it&#x27;s a hoot. Mining village, chapel, minions, harem, etc makes for a dynamic game.')
