Basically you could encode two bits as one qubit, which looks like some type of &quot;physical compression&quot; and the algorithm is almost the same as teleportation.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superdense_coding" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superdense_coding</a>')
