If you have narcissistic personality traits people will still cheer you on if you run a successful company, people with manic traits sometimes turn out to be great artists, but depression is uncomfortable because it can&#x27;t really be integrated into this fairly fast paced environment we&#x27;re in, even if it functions as a protective mechanism.')
