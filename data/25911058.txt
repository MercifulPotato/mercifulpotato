All they had to do was then turn the cutoff switches.<p>The EA crew for a couple minutes, bringing the trim back to normal twice. The trim activated again, and this time they turned off the trim while the stab was hard over.

It&#x27;s not complex, either. It&#x27;s bring the trim back to normal, then turn it off.<p>&gt; if it hasn&#x27;t been drilled into you<p>Being a memory item means it&#x27;s supposed to be drilled into you.<p>&gt; the very point of the MCAS system was that Boeing didn&#x27;t want clients to pay for additional training<p>Stab trim runaway procedure is the same regardless of MCAS causing it or some other reason with the older 737.<p>&gt; defending a safety-critical system<p>I&#x27;m emphatically not defending a safety-critical system that was far too susceptible to failure. I&#x27;m saying that the MCAS failures were recoverable by a crew that followed runaway trim procedure. This is especially true for the EA crew that  received an Emergency Airworthiness Directive that laid out the two step process.<p>Consider an analogous situation. An airplane catches fire. This is NEVER EVER EVER supposed to happen. Even so, the airplane has fire extinguishers aboard and procedures for dealing with fire. I expect crews to be trained in how to deal with the fire, and to be proficient at it.<p>Every accident has multiple causes. All of them need to be addressed to make flying safe.')
