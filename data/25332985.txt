But none of this is enough to scale, and because you don’t have any constants between product, price and market you don’t really know what to test first. Go back to the beginning. Talk to your users, prospects and customers. Narrow your market focus and experiment with price. Simplify the product (or at least present it as simpler, don’t waste cycles with more engineering) and test a new market. Find the pain that really matters to a specific group of people and point yourself in that direction. Keep at least one of product, price and market constant (ideally two) and focus on the simplest, quickest experiments you can run around the other variable(s). You won’t get things right the first time, but you’ll have more opportunity to iterate faster, which increases the likelihood of success.')
