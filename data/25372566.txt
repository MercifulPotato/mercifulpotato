I&#x27;ve blogged about doing offline object detection on raspberry pi and facial recognition is much simpler [0]. I&#x27;ve done it using the face_recognition [1] python package although I never released anything and it works fine. Only catch is you can only process a few frames a second, but unless you&#x27;re trying to capture faces in fast moving environment, this should be fine.<p>I will note that aws facial recognition is far superior to the python package. If you need accuracy I would suggest an ensemble method where you use an inferior model (python package) to some level of confidence then offload it to the superior model that&#x27;s off device for the final call and saving down the vectors.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;ml-everything&#x2F;offline-object-detection-and-tracking-on-a-raspberry-pi-fddb3bde130" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;ml-everything&#x2F;offline-object-detection-an...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ageitgey&#x2F;face_recognition" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ageitgey&#x2F;face_recognition</a>')
