That time at CCC, he was working on exploiting the Wii U. A bit later he called me over, and I was staring at a blank assembly file. He had just completed a full stack Wii U exploit, from WebKit to the kernel to the security CPU to its kernel, and expected me to dictate some assembly to him to dump the eFuses where the keys are held. I stumbled something like &quot;Uuuuh.... I guess we need to deal with banks.... well how much memory can you dump? Uh.... yeah let&#x27;s just treat it at linear.... errrr.... make a loop? I guess load a register with 0 and loop until, uhh... 0x1000? Yeah and you need to set the top bit and store that into, er.... 0xd8000...dc? I think? Let me check... uhh yeah and then read the data word from e0. I think. And put that somewhere you can dump.&quot;<p>Made me feel like a complete idiot :)')
