There&#x27;s at least 2 different kinds of unfree regimes, the first being monarchies and dictatorships that use force in a top-down manner to control their subjects, and the second being the system of mind control which enslaves people by feeding them simulations that convince them that they are sufficiently free and safe.  The latter version of an unfree regime still benefits from creating a form of slavery, but it&#x27;s slavery of the mind.  Imagine a civilization comprised of figurative Uncle Toms of the system.  Sex trafficking is concerning, but it&#x27;s a form of slavery that can only work in the 21st century by staying underground<p>Forgive me if I&#x27;m misunderstanding your point.')
