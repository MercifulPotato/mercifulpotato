And why is your reason any better than a different one provided by someone else who wants to argue the opposite?<p>&gt; Replace &quot;assume&quot; with &quot;pretend&quot; it&#x27;s the same thing.<p>We&#x27;ve now turned science into dogma. At what point do we then need to become aware that we&#x27;re pretending? Surely there comes a point where pretending costs us epistemic legitimacy. Where is that point? And what response do we offer to an interlocutor who insists the earth is flat and our logical deduction of it&#x27;s spherical shape is &quot;pretend&quot;?<p>&gt; Sure but this can only be done in conjunction with logic. If you observe evidence and the evidence leads to a conclusion the &quot;leading to a conclusion&quot; is done through logic.<p>&gt; If I observed a pig, then pigs exist by logic. If logic wasn&#x27;t real then the observation doesn&#x27;t imply pigs exist.<p>Both of these statements are nonsensical and are debunked in the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>.<p>&gt; Getting deeper into this dives into paradoxes which are ultimately uninteresting dead ends to me because it&#x27;s unresolvable.<p>I have a feeling we&#x27;re dealing with a small bit of motivated reasoning with respect to interestingness here.')
