In practice, even if you as the manager don&#x27;t notice, the team will tell you that another developer isn&#x27;t pulling their weight. However, you can&#x27;t just fire someone in most organizations because their teammates have a gut feeling -- you need to have evidence as you get a case together.  Further, some causes of poor performance are temporary; some are an indication of a lack of skill that can be remedied; some are that someone is a good worker in the wrong place in the organization; Sometimes, a developer is just lazy. A good manager will be able to discern this and determine if the solution is to change the environment in a way that brings success to the dev.<p>But if the case is that the developer needs to be &quot;managed out,&quot; you need to build the case as a manager. This is where those metrics help.')
