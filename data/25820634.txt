For instance on everything related to music I very often talk with J.S. Bach (a good approximation for God in this case). I also almost always have long dialogues with authors of the books I&#x27;m reading. These days I&#x27;m reading Ibn Khaldun, therefore I sometimes speak with him about the world, or Islam (of which he was a true &quot;doctor&quot;), or politics, etc.<p>However usually imagining a telepathic communication of some sort is enough. I rarely need to imagine them as actually present in the room if ever, unless it&#x27;s to &quot;show them&quot; something in particular.')
