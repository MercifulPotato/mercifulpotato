This will work temporarily, and if you want to stay on a permanent basis, the only way I found was to get a non-EU eligible work visa, which requires you to leave the country, apply and get approved, find an employer, and only then re-enter. You cannot just find a job while on a 90-day.<p>Most emigrants I met in Zurich where employees of multinationals who managed the visa process for them. If you don&#x27;t work for an international bank, you&#x27;re second best bet is to go there on vacation and fall in love :P')
