The Industrial revolution certainly introduced part of the idea of the modern workforce; see &#x2F;Discipline and Punish&#x2F; [1] for a good overview of the evolution of attitudes, but extreme specialization of &#x2F;worker skills&#x2F; was an alien idea.  The existence of cottage industries prior to the Industrial revolution is illustrative of this fact.<p>&#x2F;Collaboration&#x2F; has been a hallmark of civilization; but it is revisionist to say that we have always specialized to this extreme or seen it as a necessary goal. For example, the blacksmith of feudal society didn’t only make spoons, nor the farmer a single crop. If we want to critique previous civilizations; we even need to be wary of the fact that such systems were determined primarily through morality, such as &#x2F;Plato’s Republic&#x2F; or &#x2F;Confucianism&#x2F; rather than any ideal of prosperity. The farmer was a farmer because that was his&#x2F;her place not because they were better or worse at it.<p>Even if I’m being charitable and equate division-of-labour to specialization; which, I think is a &#x2F;huge&#x2F; leap — it does not counter the original point which is there is little autonomy in what you choose to do for a living in the logical conclusion of a system where you must specialize to compete.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Discipline_and_Punish" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Discipline_and_Punish</a>')
