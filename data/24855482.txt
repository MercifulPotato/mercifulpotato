Subsidies are not negative externalities. We can talk about a carbon tax to address externalities. I agree there should be one. We can talk about eliminating energy subsidies. I agree there should be none (in the US renewables get more subsidies per kWh). But asking me to pay for your luxury train rides is not OK.')
