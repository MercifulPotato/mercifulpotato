It looks like nvultra&#x27;s concept of folder based notebooks is an improvement and a nice feature.  In Bear I just have every note in reverse chronological order and rely on the excellent search to find what I need.<p>I have been using Bear daily for over 3 years and the features and Markdown support are great.<p>Not affiliated, just a fan&#x2F;customer.')
