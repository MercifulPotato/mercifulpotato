If the U.S wants to show its moral superioriry it needs to actually try becoming morally superior. Which I am not sure it is. Otherwise it reeks of hypocrisy and people rightly suspects most Americans do not care about China&#x27;s morals at all but about losing their hegemony to China. So its easy to become a cynic when seeing these debates.')
