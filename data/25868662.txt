Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=[25868734], score=None, time=1611293539, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25868578, text='The judge in this case wrote at some length about the bar Parler&#x27;s argument needs to clear to make an antitrust claim, and Parler hasn&#x27;t come close. To make a claim under antitrust, according to the judge who will decide this case, Parler must show (1) the existence of an agreement between Twitter and Amazon somehow regarding Parler, and (2) that the agreement was in <i>unreasonable</i> restraint of trade.<p>In reality they will be able to do neither thing, because we are all aware that Twitter is not in fact worried about Parler, and that Amazon could give 3&#x2F;5ths of a flying fuck whether Twitter is worried about Parler regardless. It&#x27;s a fantasy which has taken on a cloak of plausibility because we have <i>other</i> antitrust concerns about Amazon. But that cloak will not do Parler any good in this trial, nor will our other entirely reasonable concerns about tech consolidation.<p>Similarly, the judge didn&#x27;t so much poke holes in Parler&#x27;s contract claims so much as singlehandedly demolish them, pointing out that Parler&#x27;s claim about their rights under Amazon&#x27;s contract were directly contradicted by the very next paragraph after the last one they cited in their complaint.<p>It would be helpful if you could acknowledge the ruling we&#x27;re commenting on rather than continuing to argue as if this was entirely abstract. We have some (imperfect) authority to rely on now, in the form of today&#x27;s ruling.')
