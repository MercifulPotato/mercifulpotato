Code compilers are easy, data compilers should be also.<p>Think of gperf, or unicode tables, which do change every year, and it&#x27;s not clear which strategy should be used, eg. to find the script property of a codepoint, or if it&#x27;s a valid identifier or such. If it&#x27;s a three way array lookup or a perfect hash or a binary range search. For perfect hashes I already wrote a tool (phash), but for different data containers and strategies I&#x27;m missing the cost models. eg. gperf is limited, and I routinely create faster hashes with better strategies. I even made memcmp 2000x faster when knowing the data.<p>Does anybody know such a thing?')
