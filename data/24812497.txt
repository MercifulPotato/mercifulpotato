A and B are your own fabricated strawman arguments.<p>You say &quot;you don&#x27;t find valuable&quot;. Its not just me. People, in general, don&#x27;t find cryptocurrency valuable. Nothing backs them up, and besides that you cannot widely use them in the clearnet&#x2F;sneakernet.<p>What happened is it hasn&#x27;t replaced the default currencies such as USD and EUR. Its been mainly adopted by criminals&#x2F;crooks (e.g. drugs trafficking), tax evaders, people who live in banana republics (hyperinflation), speculators, and a bunch of libertarians&#x2F;preppers.<p>So next time you say &quot;you don&#x27;t find it valuable&quot;, please realize you&#x27;re talking to the vast majority of honest, casual people in the world. Of the above mentioned groups, the _only_ group I have respect for using cryptocurrency, is the people who live in banana republics (such as Venezuela).')
