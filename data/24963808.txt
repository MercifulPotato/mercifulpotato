It&#x27;s not like he had much of a choice though.<p>My grandfather&#x27;s dad (other side) had to work in Germany during the war. He sure as hell couldn&#x27;t &quot;just visit his family&quot; and there was no realistic option to say no.<p>And then you have things like Anne Frank hiding in a bloody broomcloset for years. But the above are just two examples of &quot;regular&quot; folk who were not especially persecuted (or indeed, even the occupier).<p>Good heavens, this has got to be the most ignorant comment I&#x27;ve ever seen on HN. Please, study the daily lives of people in countries occupied by Nazi Germany and you&#x27;ll find that any comparison to current events is absolutely ridiculous.')
