It shouldn&#x27;t be in an ideal world -- making these things more auditable and rigorous only makes them less prone to questioning in the long term, but I suppose many feel faith in the system is more important at this moment than incremental improvement.<p>[However this really doesn&#x27;t answer the n=59 conundrum, which I think requires a different lens]')
