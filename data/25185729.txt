While this is bad, it could not be worse than the disease itself - since it is the disease itself, no worse, no less.<p>Regarding risk of Gullain-Barre syndrome due to vaccination, Wikipedia has this to say: &quot;In fact, natural influenza infection is a stronger risk factor for the development of GBS than is influenza vaccination and getting the vaccination does reduce the risk of GBS overall by lowering the risk of catching influenza.&quot; So here I also find it hard to believe the vaccine would be worse than the disease,<p>I&#x27;m also sceptical of the claim that Polio or the 1976 Swine Flu would unambiguously be worse than Covid19. 70% of Polio case have no symptoms, and less than 0.5% cause permanent injury, according to Wikipedia. The 1976 Swine Flu outbreak seems to have caused a few hundred cases and only one death.')
