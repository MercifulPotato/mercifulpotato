You can join an instance that looks decent, and have the whole thing cut off from the network because a few bad actors gave your instance a bad rep, or because it&#x27;s in the wrong political block, or because your admin decided to throw a fit about one of the instances you want to interact with.<p>Functionally you end up stuck in some narrowly scoped insular community, large swathes of-which you could be cut off from without much prior notice.<p>Everytime you join an instance, you&#x27;re rolling the dice on the quality and breadth of your experience.<p>The alternative is the overhead of running your own instance, which seems to be the route taken by most of the people I know who use Mastodon, and recommend it.')
