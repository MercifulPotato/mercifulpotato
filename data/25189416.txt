At this point I trust NSA more than these private companies.  At least NSA has some government oversight and subject to FOIL request with these private companies it is basically the East India company all over again, wild  wild west. They can do pretty much what they want.   And like the Federal Reserve has  their own private armies.<p>Vote with your money and internet usage.')
