The legal system was already equipped for this, in theory. The bigger problem recently has been that when someone is willing to lie about their faked evidence, it&#x27;s harder to detect and impeach the testimony introducing that evidence.<p>So it&#x27;s a problem, but not a structural one. The existing structures are already designed to handle forged evidence. The issue is that it&#x27;s more expensive and technically difficult for parties to audit evidence in search of that forgery.')
