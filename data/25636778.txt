As Matthew Walker, of &quot;Why We Sleep&quot;[+], reminds: you want your brain to associate your bed with <i>sleeping</i>.<p>A related point is that if you&#x27;re not feeling sleepy, don&#x27;t lay around in the bed waiting for sleep (go to a different area of the room, if possible)â€”just as how we don&#x27;t (?) sit around at the dinner table waiting for hunger to arrive.<p>[+] With warts and all, like any book.  Don&#x27;t let the so-called &quot;egregious errors&quot; pointed out by some guy online distract from the main points made in the book.')
