We&#x27;re a family of 2.<p>Zipcar was nice, but I avoided using the car most of the time. When I bought a car, I found some sort of relief, and I of course ended up using the car way more frequently than Zipcar, while still biking around in SF most of the time. I did many more outdoor&#x2F;weekend trips, in the order of 5x&#x2F;6x.')
