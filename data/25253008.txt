If I speak French with a heavy English accent (as in pronounce the words as I would in English, not with what is commonly thought of as an &quot;accent from England&quot;) any native French speaker will have a hard time understanding me and likewise non-native French speakers who have learned to understand words as they are pronounced in French. What you are proposing would amount to the creation of a new creole but that in itself is a systematized blending of more than one language by a large group of people.
