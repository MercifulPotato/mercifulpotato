Item(by='sjy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602927990, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24808654, text='Similar experience here – I tried desktop Linux in 2003, 2008 and 2013 but couldn’t handle it and switched back to either Windows or macOS as my main OS. I tried again in 2018 after upgrading my Windows hardware and being told yet again that activation had failed and I’d have to call Microsoft. Now I use Arch. My desktop still breaks regularly (eg. I just spent a week not being able to use the terminal properly because alacritty was crashing on launch), but I had similar issues on Windows (eg. all Microsoft Store apps, including the calculator, crashing on launch for a month). Arch gives me useful error messages, a place where humans respond to my bug reports, and freedom from licensing bullshit.')
