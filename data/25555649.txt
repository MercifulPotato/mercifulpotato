This is why I and many others like aggregators. That’s not to say we don’t also have New Yorker subs. I do, through my library–I can read it on my iPad–but I don’t have time to read every issue cover-to-cover. And I definitely find less than one article per issue really resonates with me personally, for any given publication and depending on where I’m at in my life when an issue goes to press. I bet there are plenty of people who don’t even know what the New Yorker is; your suggestion doesn’t help them. HN very well could introduce them, just as it’s introduced me to plenty.')
