And then you have another function somewhere in the code, that takes a list, sorts it and uses the max value to send a notification email.<p>If it&#x27;s done your way, then you&#x27;ll have to add an assertion in that function, such as<p><pre><code>    if(input_list.length &lt; 1) explode(&quot;Bug! Bug! You can&#x27;t call me with an empty list&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nAnd you will have to write multiple unit tests _each time_ you call this function from somewhere, to make sure it&#x27;s not called with an empty list.<p>If you use a compiler... all of this goes away. The function just expects you to give it a non-empty list and if you don&#x27;t the code just doesn&#x27;t compile.<p>Less code to maintain = win.<p>The price you pay for this is learning, understanding and using a more advanced typesystem. That&#x27;s not a small price to pay. Pick your poison.')
