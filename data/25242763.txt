Or Debian packages even.  How else would you do it ???<p>-----<p>Looking at the original suggestion, I don&#x27;t think it really makes sense.<p><i>Without downloading additional packages, a Linux distribution that can also run as a continuous integration server and build server. This means that the desktop can build .ISOs to distribute itself. The desktop can also build any package that is available in package repositories.</i><p>Every operating system can do this, but none of them do it without downloading packages, for good reason.<p>And &quot;downloading packages&quot; is vague.  Windows and OS X do not come with C compilers, but Linux distros do generally.  You can build many packages with a C compiler and Make, but not all.<p>----<p>Aboriginal Linux was supposed to be the smallest  Linux distro that can rebuild itself: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;landley.net&#x2F;aboriginal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;landley.net&#x2F;aboriginal&#x2F;</a><p>However once you add &quot;real&quot; functionality to it, the size of the build and their transitive dependencies explodes.  Like to build a 300 MB .ISO,  you&#x27;d probably need 2 or 4 GiB of tools.')
