What else should they do?<p>Repeating what you conveniently ignored: one bad incident does not override months of completely peaceful protests, acknowledged by residents of the areas where they were protesting. And yet, you bring up just that one thing, which is very much in line with the government propaganda. The Republic link was the icing on the cake. Like I said, you are free to believe what you want but painting yourself as pro freedom of protests while ignoring the fact that they have been peaceful for months and singling out this one thing says a lot about your bias.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ctvnews.ca&#x2F;world&#x2F;farmers-storm-india-s-red-fort-by-the-thousands-1.5282103" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ctvnews.ca&#x2F;world&#x2F;farmers-storm-india-s-red-fort-...</a><p>&gt; The farmers have been staging largely peaceful protests for nearly two months')
