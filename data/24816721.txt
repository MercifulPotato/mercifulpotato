(Wire rope is a machine too.)<p>The tighter your tolerances the more deeply you need to go into the details. For example, a hole drilled by a two-flute drill isn&#x27;t round nor straight and to make it so you need to broach or bore it. You need to check how much out-of round it is and you do that with a three-point ID micrometer, since a two-flute drill makes a roughly triangular hole. Then for straighness you need a set of pin gauges...<p>The softer the material the less tolerances matter. This is why plastic is cheap and machine tools are expensive.')
