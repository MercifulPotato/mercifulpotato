Item(by='bildung', descendants=None, kids=[25300809], score=None, time=1607075378, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300485, text='<i>In Jena there were about one dozend(?) infected people when masks were introduced.</i><p>Already wrong, the very article shows that Jena had about 145 verified cases in April 6. And test availability was absolute shit in March&#x2F;April. It still isn&#x27;t much better now, but from the relation of cases and deaths in the first and current second wave[0], we can infer that current testing is about 3 times that of April.<p>Actual cases therefore were at least about 450 in April 6, if we generously assume everyone who is positive gets tested right now. Jena only has a population of 110k BTW.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;country&#x2F;germany&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;country&#x2F;germany&#x2F;</a>')
