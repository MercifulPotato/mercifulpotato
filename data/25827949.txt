You can&#x27;t see someone infected with COVID-19.</i><p>This particular problem, though, seems like the kind of problem that is amenable to a techno-solution. If there were a quick way to scan someone to see if they were shedding SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, you <i>could</i> see who was infected, or at least who was contagious, which is the thing to be worried about. Attempts to, for example, take people&#x27;s temperature before entering a hospital or nursing facility as a visitor are attempts at this sort of technical solution, though of course they are much less accurate than a hypothetical &quot;who is shedding virus particles&quot; detector would be.<p>So this case would seem to go against the point of the article that started this thread discussion; in a free society, technosolutionism <i>is</i> often the best fix.')
