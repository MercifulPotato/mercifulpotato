If I can’t get the green card, FB isn’t going to fire me and hire an American in my place, they’ll just relocate me to UK or Canada.<p><i>&gt; “why do people have such a hard time with the idea of America&#x2F;Americans trying to protect American interests?”</i><p>Because, respectfully, you appear to have put totally incompetent people in charge of doing that. This lawsuit seems to be political theatre that does nothing to protect American interests. To start actually fixing the problem, you might want to look at how Canada handles immigration and get some ideas.')
