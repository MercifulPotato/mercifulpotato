Maybe it&#x27;s time for review and find ways to replace the most frequent essential js techniques (such as lazy loading and animated reveal menus) with declarative, bounded, secure, privacy-respecting, and energy-efficient mechanisms. Time seems right, too, as the &quot;web stack&quot; reaches maturity (as in, can&#x27;t take any more features). Or actually, it might be too late with only Webkit-derived browsers left standing, in which case we could as well restart from scratch. While we&#x27;re at it, we should maybe also give CSS the boot, replacing it with what we&#x27;ve learned in 13 years of responsive design. IMO, CSS is typically a big let-down, adding tons of untyped crap with massive cognitive issues and laughably overcomplicated, yet still incomplete layout mechanisms to otherwise reasonable markup, just so that we can pretend we&#x27;re continuing to create HTML for casual academic publishing as conceived 30 years ago.')
