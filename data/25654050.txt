Somebody who worked on the Mercury logic language for 10 years ago said the same thing here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ProgrammingLanguages&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9kb9z5&#x2F;logic_programming_languages&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ProgrammingLanguages&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9kb9z...</a><p><i>I have worked on and with Mercury for about 10 years. I had very little logic programming experience before this, while others tend to learn Prolog first.</i><p><i>I like Mercury, but not for the logic programming features, in practice they aren&#x27;t used very often, there&#x27;s not many parts of a program that require backtracking. So on reflection, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d include in a new language, it&#x27;s not worth the implementation and maintenance costs. Not for most programs most of the time anyway.</i><p><i>On learning logic programming: It might sound like I&#x27;m discouraging anyone interested in this, far from it. Logic programming is a great paradigm to learn, another conceptual tool in your toolbox etc.</i><p>via <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18376593" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18376593</a>')
