Which is to my point: people will forgo preventative medicine until their condition deteriorates and they need to be stabilized in an ER. People get their non-emergent conditions treated all the time in American emergency rooms.<p>E.g., if I have diabetes, an ER will not put me on a long-term treatment plan. But if I ignore my disease until I start having hypoglycemic symptoms an ER will treat me until I am stabilized enough to be released. Is this the best system? Absolutely not, but it&#x27;s much different than saying &quot;only the rich have access to healthcare&quot;.<p>FWIW, I used to work in healthcare, including redesigning ER processes')
