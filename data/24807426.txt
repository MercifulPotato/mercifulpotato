The formula uses the average number of words per<p>&gt; sentence and the average number of syllables per word.<p>That sounds like a potentially flawed measure of grade level - and I&#x27;m not really sure it&#x27;s a great measurement of debate quality. A good debating&#x2F;speaking tactic would be to speak in such a way that the entire audience understands what you say and there are no other meanings.<p>The article opens with &quot;at least 93 interruptions in 90 minutes&quot; which they suggest indicates bad quality debate, then asserts that the solution is &quot;don’t talk to us like we’re in middle school&quot;. Using more complex language and longer sentences doesn&#x27;t address interruptions, it doesn&#x27;t address the answering of questions and it doesn&#x27;t address the discussion on policy. Using flamboyant language will simply not help here.')
