I see it as &quot;I&#x27;m going to put my thoughts out, maybe someone will find it interesting.&quot;, with the key difference of not caring about many people see&#x2F;interact.<p>&gt; at worst it might be a source of so much thoughtless&#x2F;marginalizing content on Twitter: because the author did not care what their words will do to the reader.<p>Alternately, this could be caused by echo chambers where people scream endless affirmation at you because you said something that lines up with their political views.<p>Neither method of using Twitter is more wrong or more right, just different.')
