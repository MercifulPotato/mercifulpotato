Some of those big trendy bags have extremely sharp corners, as well as metal clasps and other items that also cut and&#x2F;or bruise.<p>Groups of people expect that others will get out of their way - members of the group directly in your path will look up, and then back to the rest of their group.<p>Couples are particularly bad at this - yes, you&#x27;re together, you&#x27;re clearly deeply in love, but that doesn&#x27;t grant you the right to occupy the centre of the footpath and force everyone else to go around.')
