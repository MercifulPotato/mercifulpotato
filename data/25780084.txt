At first I thought it&#x27;s because OP is only talking about farmland, but in the USA Today article the Simplot family apparently owns more than 400k acres for potato farming in Idaho, but doesn&#x27;t even appear in the OP. I&#x27;m not sure what to make of the discrepancy.<p>Also for the sake of comparison, 240k acres is a good amount, but (as another commenter mentioned), it&#x27;s also not. There are some cattle ranches larger than that. And for an example of non farm&#x2F;ranch use, Bezos apparently owns over 400,000 acres in West Texas to be used for the Blue Origin launch facilities.')
