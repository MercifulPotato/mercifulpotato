However, this would only apply in relatively narrow cases where your workload can be supported by a single\nRSM. There is an absolute limit for the sequencing alone from a single leader, even after you apply the tricks mentioned in the paper. Geo optimizations\n(US users data stored in US, EU users data stored in EU, etc) for latency while maintaining a single database view also become challenging (impossible?) without sharding. Fault tolerance is also\nslightly improved with many shards because you expose a smaller fraction of your database to transient downtime (re-election, catchup) or slowness when the node containing the leader fails or becomes slow.')
