Three? Six? Sixty? Six hundred?<p>I, for one, have strong doubts that the majority of those firms will ever leave China.<p>I will also note that all of your criticisms can be applied even more-so to democracies. Internal turmoil, political infighting, negative world sentiment (for some of them), exploding debt, aging demographics, ossification of political structures and poor ability to self-correct, check, check, check. It&#x27;s true that, say, the United States is not encircled, but it has a separate problem of having to over-reach to maintain an incredibly ambitious, and unsustainable overseas military presence.<p>If those criteria were sufficient for a social collapse, then we&#x27;re all living on borrowed time, and I don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;re singling China out as a likely point of failure.')
