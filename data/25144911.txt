Item(by='fomine3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605747212, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25144860, text='&gt; During the G20 period, we observed increased blocking of domains in the news media and E-commerce category in Japan. DNS blocking was observed in both categories while Echo blocking was seen in the E-commerce category to a smaller extent. The domains being blocked during this time period included popular news domains such as online.wsj.com and washingtonpost.com under the news media category and kickstarter.com and marketwatch.com under the E-commerce umbrella.<p>Lol. Blocking kickstarter.com for G20? It must be false positive or ISP&#x27;s DNS server is just suck.')
