God knows I derive no satisfaction from people being ill. You accuse me of being specious. Good lord, if only that was the nicest thing people accused me of I would be thrilled.<p>It might be interesting to get an antibody test to confirm that it actually was SARS-CoV-2?<p>Which organ system is primarily affected by your CFTR mutation? I quickly checked the lit and I gather Atypical CF can mainly affect respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine and metabolic, or genitourinary systems and is a little different in this way than classic CF, but you probably know more about it than I do.<p>Do you guys have a pretty rough history of respiratory infections, or do you see it manifest primarily elsewhere? Are you guys on prophylactic antibiotics for chronic pulmonary infection?<p>What were the beneficial side effects?<p>Curious to hear your hypothesis as to how CFTR mutations could lend an advantage to patients with COVID? I haven&#x27;t got any ideas.<p>Were you guys much, much more cautious with isolation? Do you work in the community, or were you very cautious about isolation?<p>Super curious to learn more.<p>Edit: I looked at the paper and behavior was cited as a possible key factor. &quot;...typical behavior in patients with CF, who might wear protective masks and avoid contact with sick people...&quot; Another idea they floated was disruption of IL-6 signaling, which they didn&#x27;t figure would totally mask (<i>ba dum tss</i>) the respiratory effects of the virus, but might knock it down a bit. Iono, small sample size too.<p>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much data as to whether or not CF folks have any actual biological protections or if they&#x27;re not just being more cautious, but I found a couple of papers that hypothesize potential mechanisms:<p>Peckham, D., McDermott, M.F., Savic, S. et al.

I&#x27;m perfectly willing to embrace the character archetype of Ed in this hypothetical cartoon situation, although I have yet to be graced with ownership of a dingo farm.')
