It&#x27;s not at all clear to me what it would mean for a corporation to have intent.<p>We could certainly say a &#x27;corporation intended&#x27; to do something if we found an email from the CEO commanding it, that much is trivial.  But what if we think of a corporation as a &#x27;slow AI&#x27; or &#x27;China brain&#x27;?  Might the corporation, viewed that way, have intent that transcends the individual thoughts and desires of the constituent employees?  The system may be structured in a way that rewards low level employees for doing things the individual executives would never consider acceptable (for instance, &#x27;lying to the executives&#x27;), and which the low  level employees don&#x27;t think is a good idea either.  With all the humans personally opposed to some business practice, it might <i>still</i> occur due to the structure of the system.  If we personify that system, we could perhaps say the system itself has a will of its own, with objectives alien to any of the humans involved.<p>A harsh example far worse than Facebook: the Functionalism-Intentionalism debate (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Functionalism–intentionalism_debate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Functionalism–intentionalism...</a>)  At the end of the day, does it really matter?  Whether you subscribe to functionalism or intentionalism in that case, the horrible end result is the same and people need to be held accountable for it.')
