Item(by='esoterica', descendants=None, kids=[25826634], score=None, time=1611001749, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25825961, text='&gt; The most likely explanation for the success<p>Mostly likely based on what grounds? Rentech was very profitable for decades before they ever started their public funds.<p>&gt; Nobody knows how Rentech makes money<p>There&#x27;s nothing extraordinarily special about Rentech&#x27;s returns, they just employ short-term stat arb type strategies that require relatively little capital to execute, so if you express their returns as a percentage of invested capital you get an eye-popping number. But it&#x27;s not comparable to the returns that a traditional buy-and-hold fund makes (in particular because those returns don&#x27;t compound). There are plenty of other quant shops and prop trading firms that would make huge (&gt;Rentech) annual returns if they attempted to phrase their earnings in those terms, but they typically don&#x27;t, because if you don&#x27;t need a lot of capital then you don&#x27;t need to raise money from the clients and outside investors (can just trade the partners&#x27; money) and you don&#x27;t need to brag about your returns in public.')
