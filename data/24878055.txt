The newer Simcom chips are better and quite competitive, pre Sim800 it was riddled with bugs. If then Telit was an option, now it isn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s considerably more expensive and the IoT market is very competitive. 3G chips were the worst pricewise because they had to include royalties to Qualcomm, that&#x27;s why most chipmakers pushed for 4G.<p>The ESP family is absolutely amazing in terms of price and features, not so much efficeincy wise. It would have been great if RTOS support was better. The ESP-IDF is based on FreeRTOS, NuttX has some preliminary support, RiotOS doesn&#x27;t do FPU, BT, crypto acceleration and uses one core only. NodeMCU is maker&#x2F;hobby garde, not an OS and so is Arduino. To be fair, the whole ESP chip family is rather hobby grade but if it works and you&#x27;re not power constrained or you use it as a secondary MCU and put it to sleep, it should be fine.')
