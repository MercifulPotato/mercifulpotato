You&#x27;re gambling that when you invest money in something it will show value, others will acknowledge that value, hopefully at a higher value than you bought in at, and your investment will increase in value.<p>Obviously with gambling, it&#x27;s more stochastic in nature by design but often large complex processes have a lot of stochastic elements to their successes and failures as well.')
