This results in some really fucked-up dynamics, such as:<p>1. Bootleg streaming sites that charge you for fansubs. This has been a particular thorn in the side of the licensed translation business because the old unspoken rule of &quot;don&#x27;t translate licensed works&quot; has long since been forgotten. They rely entirely on unpaid labor throughout the chain, and are absolutely parasites on everyone. (If there was <i>one</i> compelling argument for &quot;stop-having-fun-guys&quot; levels of copyright maximalism, it would be these sites.)<p>2. Crunchyroll&#x27;s absolutely terrible translator wages. This particular site actually used to be one of those old bootleg streaming services, so when they did &quot;go legit&quot;, they kept the underlying mentality of paying people peanuts. They&#x27;re basically parasites dressed up in a fancy suit.<p>3. People in the legit side of the business (save for Crunchy) having <i>extremely</i> negative aspersions on anyone who had a history of working in the fan translation scene. Occasionally this is for proper CYA reasons, but more often it&#x27;s a weird form of elitism.<p>Quite honestly, I think we should start looking at any industry with fan passion surrounding it as a huge exploitation smell. For every person risking millions of dollars in copyright liability by making a cool fan project, there&#x27;s probably 9 or 10 more people who became trained professionals the &quot;proper&quot; way and wound up getting jobs at these big companies where they were chewed up and spat out. Any business that has the potential to live off the backs of fan labor is probably doing so, even by accident.')
