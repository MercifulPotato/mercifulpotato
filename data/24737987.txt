Castle Quest ended up being pretty underwhelming. Exile, on the other hand, is absolutely insane in its level of complexity. This is the full map:<p>www.stairwaytohell.com&#x2F;gamehelp&#x2F;MAP-Exile-BC.png<p>The game is still genius to me. I love the teleport mechanic: in the game, you&#x27;re invincible, but if you sustain too much damage in a short period, your suit teleports you away to safety so you can recover. You can &quot;remember&quot; up to four teleport destinations, with the ultimate fallback being your spaceship. Being forced to teleport is usually bad. You can potentially drop important items in a dangerous area, or find yourself having to redo a tricky navigation back to the area you teleported from.<p>The brilliance is that the big-bad Triax and his three robots have the same teleport mechanic. The only way to destroy them is to hit them with massive amounts of damage before their teleports kick in. This meant using physics puzzles, because damage sources would stack: I could destroy the final robot by luring it to and blasting it in the face with the experimental thruster, shooting it with the remote-controlled cannon, and using the icer simultaneously.')
