Item(by='peterburkimsher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611960714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25963456, text='Usually the equipment is rented, and returned to the owners. \nI spent 4 years in Taiwan working for OSE, a semiconductor packaging company (cutting up silicon wafers, bonding wires onto them, and putting them into little plastic SD cards or RAM chips labelled &quot;Made in Taiwan&quot;).<p>The pick &amp; place machines and ovens weren&#x27;t owned by OSE - they were on a 30-year lease from other companies in Japan, Germany, etc.<p>Software updates would void the warranty&#x2F;lease conditions. One of my tasks was to write a program to measure yields for factory monitoring. This meant figuring out how to use SQL on Windows 2000, with no .NET framework or additional libraries.<p>My guess is that when the equipment is too old, the original owners either take them back for salvaging, or sell off the pieces as scrap. I went to many scrapyards in Kaohsiung though, and found many treasures like $10 bicycles or old consumer gadgets, but no factory-level machines.')
