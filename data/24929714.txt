I keep wanting to use htmx and it&#x27;s like, but there always seem to be very common tasks like having an expandable menu on mobile that don&#x27;t have a great solution in these libraries and I have to write vanilla JS.<p>I&#x27;ve settled on Alpine instead for the time being because it has some data management built in. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m going to have to switch to Vue on my current project because I feel so much less productive with Alpine.')
