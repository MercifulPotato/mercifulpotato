Saying &quot;no one wants that&quot; isn&#x27;t really a substantial counter argument.<p>I suppose the problem with them all being so similar would be if you spent every day visiting a different one, you would tire of them all being them same. But no one does that - you spend many years in a single one, without much awareness of others. In the end it&#x27;s important that it&#x27;s effective to spend long periods in, and its uniqueness is basically irrelevant to the people that actually use it.')
