Yes, the bureaucracy is awful and yes a majority of the people just sit at their desk to pass time. But the work I pick actually solves problems society has. I don&#x27;t care about the politics or whatever and I&#x27;m not judging whatever policies or solutions I&#x27;m engineering but at least it&#x27;s helping society in automating tasks and making the systems for those policies more resilient. Is it avant-garde tech or AppGoFaNet-abbreviation like pay? No. Often just CRUD, some rule engines and making sure information systems are stitched together. But money wise I&#x27;ll retire from this before I&#x27;m 40-45 and can basically do whatever I want at that point.<p>Money is freedom. Don&#x27;t underestimate that. This industry can give you a lot of it in a relatively short time and with the advance of remote working, you don&#x27;t have to live in high-cost centers to earn high-cost income anymore. Just make sure you&#x27;re valuable and don&#x27;t lifestyle-creep your way into being dependent on soul crushing work because the pay is high.')
