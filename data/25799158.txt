It&#x27;s a good programming language. To be honest, I wish it gained more traction and popularity, and I wish C# was abandoned (like VB.net), and more people moved to F#. But that&#x27;s simply not happening. It&#x27;s not happening for the past 15+ years. I used to write programs for .Net,  I&#x27;m not a complete outsider. Unfortunately, F# is still small, even within .Net. You may throw random words at me, if it makes you feel better, I don&#x27;t care. People get emotionally attached to the tools they use and that&#x27;s understandable.<p>You may like F#, OCaml, Haskell more, or you may just hate Clojure (it&#x27;s okay), but that is the truth - among other languages with a strong FP emphasis, Clojure currently is the most widely used in the industry. It doesn&#x27;t make it better or worse.<p>May I remind you though, the use of FP langs as a whole is still so small compared to Python, Javascript, Java, that it almost makes no difference, beyond the fact that FP languages are huge influencers and affect the evolution of other PLs.')
