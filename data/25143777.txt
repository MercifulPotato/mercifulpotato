Item(by='bumby', descendants=None, kids=[25150376], score=None, time=1605740387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142819, text='&gt;<i>There&#x27;s too much of &quot;we know better&quot; attitude.</i><p>I think this is the cynical view that paints it in an arrogant light. The alternate is there is an acknowledgement that the system is less than ideal and could be improved.<p>&gt;<i>People who are awesome get shafted</i><p>I mean, isn&#x27;t this par for the course in any group environment?

If you&#x27;re wealthy and subjected to a progressive tax structure, you get <i>shafted</i> by paying a disproportionate amount of taxes. Sometimes I wonder if getting <i>shafted</i> is part of the cost of living in a stable society. You agree to carry a load so that in the event you need it, somebody can carry the load for you. Game theory shows that this leads to more optimal solutions as long as you can keep free-loading within certain bounds.<p>I used to be a staunch libertarian but came to realize society doesn&#x27;t work so well when it&#x27;s structured to only let the top percentile be successful.

To that utilitarian perspective, I think it&#x27;s a more optimal use of resources if you consider human capital one of the more useful resources.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed libertarians tend to be those high performers who would tend to benefit (or perceive themselves to benefit) from not being held back.
