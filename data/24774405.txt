Dropped them all several times, never had more than dings on the metal edges.<p>Did the same for my 6S, and cracked the screen three times.  The third it cracked time I upgraded to an iPhone XS; but my wife insisted I get a case, and it was hard to argue against.<p>I&#x27;m really glad they&#x27;ve moved back to the (apparently) more robust form factor of having squarish metal edges.  I look forward to not having to use a case the next time I update.')
