If it&#x27;s as rare as I think it is, it might not have that much of an impact on Rust&#x27;s position in the benchmarks game.<p>Most C++ STL algorithms take iterators, that in many cases  are just pointers in benchmarks because these often only deal with arrays. Hell most C standard APIs (e.g. memcpy) take multiple pointers.')
