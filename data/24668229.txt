If you have an arbitrarily precise lat long, you still don&#x27;t know where you are very well.<p>If you don&#x27;t know the datum of a lat long, you only know the location to within about a kilometer.<p>Datum matters. And yes, WGS84 is fairly common, but you will still very routinely come across lat&#x2F;long or projected coordinates in other datums.  NAD27 is the one that you&#x27;ll encounter the most in the US, and it&#x27;s about a 300 meter shift compared to WGS84 or NAD83. Others exist too and are frequently used.<p>Don&#x27;t just record lat&#x2F;long.')
