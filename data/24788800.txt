Making it clear to not engage in emotionally-charged &#x27;debates&#x27; about contentious topics is perfectly inline with good corporate governance. Your coworker next desk over may have wildly different views on abortion, politics, religion, but none of that should matter in getting the job done you&#x27;re paid for. Ideally you shouldn&#x27;t even know, or care what their personal views are on societal issues.')
