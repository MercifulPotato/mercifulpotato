Eventually I ended up with 2 phones - the google store one (with a burner number) and the non google store one. Things like being able to order uber (you used to be able to order on the mobile browser) made life difficult. Eventually I gave up.<p>Current strategy is to only have a burner google account on the phone and rotate gmail accounts every year (on phone refresh). Keep personal google accounts off the phone (using linux desktop) with a vpn and in firefox with privacy settings.<p>Use containers on the browser - never mix google, whatsapp facebook and other activities.<p>Use a phone registered in EU for privacy settings. Use a paid burner gmail account (again I figure it is better for privacy).<p>Annoyingly I also need an iphone for i-message with family members.')
