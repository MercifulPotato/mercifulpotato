Item(by='lhorie', descendants=None, kids=[24792746], score=None, time=1602787260, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24791904, text='This is just my personal interpretation, but the way I approach is I create a trustworthiness score for the set of reviews. For example, too many 5 stars without comments and without low stars might earn a low trustworthiness score because the distribution looks unnatural compared to the distribution in similar competitors. Or a set of 6 reviews, no matter their distribution will also receive a low trustworthiness score simply because there&#x27;s not much to go on. Reviews of a restaurant complaining about a particularly egregious experience earn a low trustworthiness score since it looks like an outlier and there&#x27;s emotions running wild. Review sets with a decent number of 3 star reviews containing several well-articulated paragraphs tend to earn a high trustworthiness score. Etc.<p>So, rather than the score being a dimensionless good-or-bad scale, it&#x27;s a meta analysis of the reviews, judged on multiple dimensions. This means that some companies&#x2F;restaurants&#x2F;products simply don&#x27;t provide enough information for me to form a conclusion despite having a number of reviews that lean towards either &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. And that&#x27;s ok, because the very fact that I&#x27;ve considered so many different dimensions also tells me that there isn&#x27;t necessarily a single absolute best option.<p>This, in my mind, seems like a more accurate depiction of reality than blindly ranking by number of 5 star reviews.')
