However, there are some good sources.<p>If you have the money, Sinocism[0] is a great newsletter that collects the top (mostly political) stories of the day. Some other good (free) Substacks are Chinarrative[1], which publishes translated human interest stories, and Chinese Journal Review[2], which translates abstracts of a selection of academic papers.<p>If you would like a local insight into more young&#x2F;liberal perspectives, Sixth Tone[3] is fairly interesting. Be aware that this is a state-owned media source, so it has an interest in presenting China as progressive in ways that outside of middle class communities in top tier cities it usually isn&#x27;t. Just because it&#x27;s state-owned doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not informative, though! China Media Project[4] is perhaps a useful accompanying source to try understand exactly how the state media is biased.<p>Of the western media, New York Times probably does the best reporting on China (they even have a Chinese language version), but like all western media they struggle to get access. Inside China, Caixin is probably the best newspaper, but unfortunately it is pay-walled.<p>From left wing perspective I can also recommend Made In China Journal[5].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sinocism.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sinocism.com&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chinarrative.substack.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chinarrative.substack.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chinesejournalreview.substack.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chinesejournalreview.substack.com&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sixthtone.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sixthtone.com&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chinamediaproject.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chinamediaproject.org&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;madeinchinajournal.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;madeinchinajournal.com&#x2F;</a>')
