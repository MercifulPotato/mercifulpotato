It was a bit hard to tell from the article. Can this be run outside kubernetes or is it meant to be part of a big set of infra?<p>One thing I’ve always wanted to build is an emulator (snes, etc.) that does real-time replication of data across the lan for both debugging and network play, is this low enough latency for that? The idea would be to help new emulator authors not have to build a debugger or test suite, if you could expose the controller interface and memory, a single debugger could be written that could be shared across new authors. All they would have to do is bind to a simple Api that exposes memory and a few commands to the library.')
