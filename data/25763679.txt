But, were I the professor, I&#x27;d be interested to see how many of my students are understanding the material on a holistic level. This is my bias, though, because I&#x27;m way more interested in knowing why something occurred (and its relationship to other events) vs that it occurred on [insert date] and involved [insert individuals].')
