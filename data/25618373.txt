When an old employer of mine got this, I remember thinking of making flyers that people can distribute and drop in mailboxes for OSM.<p>(Similar to how my school emailed <i>everyone, every year</i> about how generously Microsoft gives us their Office suite for only 40 euros or something, failing to mention that LibreOffice works perfectly fine --if you don&#x27;t mind the design-- and is of course completely free. Why not encourage people to donate 40 euros every 5 years to LibreOffice instead, or alongside?)<p>Didn&#x27;t end up doing it, also because there just isn&#x27;t an easy editor that businesses would use. I would make one, but then how would I make them aware of this? OSM in general and such an editor in particular? It&#x27;s just such an uphill battle when everyone uses Google Search, businesses can get free advertising by putting themselves on Google Maps (that map shows up when you look for a local business or category of businesses), and Google spends a boatload of money on driving cars around and getting more business owners on board as well.')
