I think that almost everyone should be able to achieve a solid 2000 elo rating, with enough dedication over the years. Doing tactics puzzles is one of the most important factors for fast improvements.<p>&gt; Some day, I want to become a titled player. A candidate master needs an ELO of 2200<p>2000 and 2200 are completely different skill levels. I have some friends who play chess for more than 10 years in a chess club, starting as a kid, but haven&#x27;t reached titled skill level yet and probably never will.<p>My personal advice is: focus on the fun part of chess, there will always be a stronger player, but that doesn&#x27;t matter.')
