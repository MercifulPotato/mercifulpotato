Without solid technique, musicality does not matter. Technique is what gives you confidence, it allows you to experiment and fine tune your artistic skills. To work on your expression instead of grappling with what&#x27;s on the sheet.<p>Acquiring (and maintaining) technique requires hard work and time, but it&#x27;s  relatively easy once you combine these two factors. Developing a good ear, a good sense of rhythm, when to play on tempo, slightly before the tempo or slighly after, really understanding the music, that is infinitely more difficult so it make sense for a teacher to stress that part.')
