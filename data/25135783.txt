This entire island did exactly this â€“ they banned all cars and horses and went 100% electric. Before, most people got around via horses(!) I heard it was a smelly mess.<p>It&#x27;s pretty neat actually. They have these little electric buses that go around the island. Everyone has electric little cars and scooter type vehicles. [1]<p>I laughed when I saw the solution to this problem you&#x27;re talking about. Extension cords everywhere. That&#x27;s right, almost every street you saw long extension cords going from the house to the street to charge all the vehicles. Is it perfect? No of course not but it&#x27;s &quot;good enough for now&quot;.<p>Yes, I realize a small island with a few thousand people is not the same a the UK. My point is, people will figure out how to make it work.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hurriyetdailynews.com&#x2F;electric-vehicles-hit-roads-in-princes-islands-157296" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hurriyetdailynews.com&#x2F;electric-vehicles-hit-road...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Princes%27_Islands#B%C3%BCy%C3%BCkada" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Princes%27_Islands#B%C3%BCy%C3...</a>')
