If he were prosecuted, it would be something or someone else. (Soros? Gates? Hillary Clinton? Jeremiah Wright? etc.) Or, alternatively, there&#x27;s no convincing argument that had Epstein never been born, the Qanon movement would have been noticeably smaller or weaker.<p>If your claim is that it would have helped to deliver justice in every single case of injustice, promptly and transparently, then yes, that certainly makes for a better society and certainly everyone agrees with that goal but it&#x27;s also never going to be 100% completed.<p>And if you remember 2004, there were serious allegations of unaudited changes to the voting system as well as coverups and hiding of important information (like what we knew about Iraq&#x27;s weapons program or lack thereof), but the movement of people who objected to both of them <i>did not</i> storm anything. So there&#x27;s something else different here.')
