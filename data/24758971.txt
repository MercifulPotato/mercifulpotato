I don&#x27;t necessarily agree 100%, but I think it&#x27;s a useful perspective in addition to the counter-idea that side projects and meetups will get you jobs.<p>It&#x27;s not every company or set of interviewers, but there are lots of interviewers and recruiters who don&#x27;t care at all about your side projects. I&#x27;ve done plenty of interviews, and don&#x27;t really ask about them much, or really have time to check them out in any detail before the interview.<p>Lots of tech meetups are also jammed with aggressive recruiter-bros and newbies who need a paycheck and aren&#x27;t all that interested in tech. Keep your expectations in check for finding good employers or employees at them.<p>For side projects, I wouldn&#x27;t say not to do them. But don&#x27;t do &quot;hello world&quot; level side projects in a trendy language in the expectation that anybody will care or it will get you a job. Do a side project to accomplish something that you are actually interested in. If you don&#x27;t feel like it or don&#x27;t have any interesting ideas, then by all means do something else instead. Half-hearted projects to fill a perceived recruiting checkbox definitely won&#x27;t get you anything. Doing something interesting, or even doing something kind of boring in an interesting way, might help. Or doing something and taking it into Production enough to feel some of the pain points of maintenance, uptime, marketing, etc.')
