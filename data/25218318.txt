Why does Google develop their own tools?<p>Considering the age of the articles and tools themselves, they probably predate everything you&#x27;re using these days. All the GitHubs and other shiny SV startup things.<p>IIRC they also don&#x27;t ever want to share code with other companies which makes most of the SaaS offerings a no-go for them.<p>Hence why it might not make sense to use the same tools as they do :)')
