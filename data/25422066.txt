Item(by='jonnycomputer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607974278, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419216, text='I think a lot of readers and visitors to Pornhub assumed that Pornhub was reputable (as reputable as a porn site could be), and were shocked by the expose. They could also have legitimate reason to worry that they might be culpable for inadvertently viewing illegal material, and would be angry at Pornhub for exposing them to that risk.<p>And lets&#x27; be frank. Most people are pretty uncomfortable about talking about their porn habits. Talking knowledgeably about what is on the site reveals them as a visitor. This is something that is difficult for people to discuss, and will only do so from the most defensible position possible.<p>I am angry at Pornhub too. Stolen content is one thing. But rape and pedophilia is another.')
