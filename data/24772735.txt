Used TWM for a long time and lately LXDE for when I want something more desktop like. But I&#x27;m also a kind of weird case in that I want to be able to run X11 apps on my laptop, which is a win10 install, so running a local X server (VcXsrv).<p>I find LXDE as a DE fairly lightweight and not too troublesome. The Qt version had some issues with my older X server (Qt for some software defined radio apps that use Qt rather than Gtk or other toolkits).')
