If you take any dish, it&#x27;s always going to be a fusion of different cultural, and trade, and climate, and agricultural... influences. Today&#x27;s perspective on &quot;traditional&quot; could be yesterdays tradition-defying modern innovation. You find (with very few exceptions) that it&#x27;s vary hard to define what a dish actually is. There&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;correct&quot; Laksa recipe for instance, so if you want to understand what it is, you have to investigate how different people make it differently, and how that&#x27;s changed over time. Where you draw the line of &quot;traditional&quot; is mostly rather arbitrary.')
