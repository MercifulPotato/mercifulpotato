Speaking as someone who works at a company with a few Zigbee-certified products, I can say that there are a LOT of &quot;optional&quot; features in the Zigbee specification, and even implementations of mandatory features can have differences that lead to incompatibility.<p>Manufacturer-specific profiles are also a big thing. So just be aware that manufacturer A&#x27;s Zigbee &quot;hub&quot;&#x2F;coordinator may or may not be inherently compatible with manufacturer B&#x27;s sensors. But I would imagine that open-source systems like HomeAssistant deal with that.')
