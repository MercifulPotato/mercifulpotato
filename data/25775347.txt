Judges are are not final arbiters of truth either, yet they can take away certain constitutional protections from people. It is perfectly possible to have  non-final and fallible arbiters of truth - or something more modest like the interpretation of laws - to decide on such matters, as long as there is enough democratic division of power, due process, and appeals mechanisms.')
