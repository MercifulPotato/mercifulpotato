Peoples’ personal biases are too strong.<p>The “fact check” websites used to be great. Now, they wander way over “fact checking.” The worst abuses are when they provide “context” or challenge assumptions. Conservatives and liberals are not working from the same assumptions, and have a different set of contextual facts top of mind on different issues. The fact check organizations are pretty good about checking the actual assertion, but reveal bias through what contextual facts they provide and what assumptions they do or do not challenge. Another way they cross the line is “fact checking” obvious rhetoric: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;trumps-exaggerated-claims-on-biden-and-pharma-in-puerto-rico&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;trumps-exaggerated-claims-...</a><p>&gt; At a rally in Sanford, Florida, President Donald Trump made the exaggerated claim that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, “voted to obliterate” Puerto Rico’s pharmaceutical manufacturing industry.<p>As Biden would say, “c’mon man.” How many times has a politician said stuff like “they sent your jobs to China?” Did anyone fact check Biden’s assertion that Romney would “put [Black people] back in chains?” They explain the vote by saying things like: “at the time, eliminating the provision was seen as striking a blow against “corporate welfare.” Seen by who? They also note that the bill “also raised the minimum wage.” This isn’t “fact checking,” it’s the counter-narrative from the Biden campaign.')
