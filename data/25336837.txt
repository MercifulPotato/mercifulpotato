Nothing says that both sides can&#x27;t learn from the review.<p>As for number nine. I&#x27;m not sure if adding comments is going to completely help; I&#x27;d rather refactor to make the code as explicit as possible, including the tests[1]. But more importantly, I don&#x27;t think that sacrificing possibly more idiomatic code for the sake of beginners is a great trade-off. I think it&#x27;s better to encourage people to get more familiar with the language and technology being used.<p>[1]: Which is usually my first stop for when I might not understand something in the code itself.')
