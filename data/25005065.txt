I&#x27;d argue that SML is both more simple than go (especially with this proposal) and more powerful. SML doesn&#x27;t allow the shenanigans Haskell does (and a go using something similar to the SML type system wouldn&#x27;t either).<p>As to hundreds of millions, that&#x27;s easily true. Most of the people on that team make 500k per year at least with some making way more than that (and we aren&#x27;t including other benefits of costs to the company who employs them). The language is publicly 11 years old and existed before that.<p>1e8 &#x2F; 5e5 &#x2F; 11 gives a mere 18 developers and less than 200 man years. I seriously doubt the compiler, libraries, and extensive tooling took less than 5x that amount at a minimum.')
