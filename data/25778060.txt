She had a remarkable knack for accents (and recreating sounds generally) and did pick up French more quickly than I could. I wonder if this counts as a kind of &quot;uncanny valley&quot;, because my experience was exactly what you reported. I spoke understandable but accented French, tilted more toward written formal French than conversational French (where I was much more limited). My friend, on the other hand, just seemed like a French person but with a faint speech anomaly and an oddly limited vocabulary at times.<p>It&#x27;s not surprising that people initially took my version of French as an effort to learn a language properly, and hers as a sign of cognitive issues or trouble with language. Even once someone&#x27;s aware of it, it won&#x27;t necessary change the fundamental reaction (kind of what taller children go through - even when people learn they&#x27;re much younger, they still apparently have trouble applying the standards they normally would for younger children).<p>Not sure what else to say about this, other than that I&#x27;ve seen it exactly was you describe (though not quite with the &quot;heavy&quot; accent, more of a moderate but immediately noticeable one).')
