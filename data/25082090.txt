But is that good enough, in this case? Should it be legal to front-load your business by promising something, and then going back on that (not because you have to, but because you change your mind)?<p>I feel like it should not, because the competitive advantage you get by offering things for free is incredibly huge. Whenever that gets a business to a place where people will be very unhappy to leave the service, you are in effect <i>forcing</i> people pay a price they have not agreed upon when they started using the service â€“ be it the subscription fee or the price of forced migration.<p>It is very hard to put a price on breaking a promise like this, and since it&#x27;s so hard to grasp, it can easily seem overblown, but millions of people and their decisions on very much related issue (deciding between an Android mobile vs an iPhone) were affected. It&#x27;s not a matter of a startup trying and failing to be profitable, and either going bankrupt or being able to continue to provide a service. It&#x27;s simply a giant optimizing for front-loaded profit. In my mind, Google does not deserve any leeway on this.')
