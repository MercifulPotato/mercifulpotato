But in practice, the stack depth of real sentences is small [1], and sentences that require deep stacks quickly become impossible for humans to understand.<p>For example,<p>Stack depth 1: The rat ate the cheese.<p>Stack depth 2: The rat [that the cat chased] ate the cheese.<p>Stack depth 3: The rat [that the cat [that the teacher liked] chased] ate the cheese<p>Stack depth 4: The rat [that the cat [that the teacher [that the student hated] liked ] chased] ate the cheese.<p>English speakers usually can&#x27;t handle depths 3 or higher.<p>This kind of phenomenon has caused a lot of controversy in linguistics. There does seem to be some sense in which the stack-depth-4 sentence is grammatical English, even though basically no one can understand it. But for the purposes of practical NLP systems, this phenomenon means that if you can model stack depth of, say, 10, then you&#x27;ll be able to model almost all the naturally-occurring sentences.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;40057996" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;40057996</a>')
