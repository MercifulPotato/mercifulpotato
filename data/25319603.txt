Of course, you can assume that others know something about it. But then the logical thing to do is to ask for this knowledge, the knowledge that contradicts yours. Demand a proof, solve your inconsistency. Maybe you&#x27;re hallucinating. Following blindly is not a reasonable choice, if this contradicts your own feelings.<p>There is no reason to investigate something if it doesn&#x27;t contradict your knowledge. It&#x27;s reasonable to investigate the &quot;Dead End&quot; sign only if every other driver goes under it. Because this is inconsistency. And not to drive just like others, but ask for an explanation first.<p>Yes, those &quot;heuristics&quot; may be good enough in a lot of situations. Just like instincts, they can be useful too. But we can&#x27;t let instincts rule over our rational mind. This doesn&#x27;t work. There would be no civilization in such case.')
