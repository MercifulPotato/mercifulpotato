Among Us (or Mafia game on which it was based) is closer probably. But still there are smaller scenarios that can play out in Cheat where the situation is close (you have 2 players providing contradicting information and you try to guess who&#x27;s right).<p>Anyway my intuition about detecting liers is - people who provide too much or too personal details without being asked about them are more suspicious than the default, not less.<p>There&#x27;s a few proverbs in my language about that (&quot;only the guilty explains himself&quot; and &quot;hit the table and the scissors will speak out&quot;) - the first one obviously stupid on the face value but I think it is supposed to mean the same thing - that the guilty will have more explanations ready faster because they thought about them more and focus more on being considered innocent.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s why the &quot;explain to them&quot; part is important.')
