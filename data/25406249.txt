Not the answer, but the question - I&#x27;m a native English speaker, how did I never notice that <i>else</i> makes no sense? Clearly I&#x27;ve been programming for far too long :)<p>EDIT: Thinking about it a bit more, &quot;or else&quot; <i>is</i> valid English, although not ususally following &quot;if&quot;. More like, &quot;Do this, or else I will...&quot;.<p>Perhaps it was supposed to be &quot;or else&quot;, and &quot;or&quot; was already a keyword so we&#x27;re left with &quot;else&quot;? But it still doesn&#x27;t follow well from &quot;if&quot; so the bad translation from German (possibly using a dictionary) is still more likely.')
