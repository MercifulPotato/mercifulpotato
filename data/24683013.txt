I actually have three friends who&#x27;re going though it. One of them is seeing a psychiatrist and is coping well. The second  (who called me) has been self-dosing on these natural medication. And third one has been hit the worst. He is alone and can&#x27;t access proper treatment. He doesn&#x27;t talk to many people due to anxiety issues. And he is outside my lockdown zone, so I can&#x27;t even visit him, unfortunately. I make sure that I at least text them every once in a while to find out how they&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;ll read through the guide and see if I can do more to help.')
