So you never need to &quot;rebalance&quot; anything since you always know exactly where data needs to be filled&#x2F;deleted (sometimes needing a coordinate compression step). This lets you work with a static complete binary tree which is extremely cache friendly and simple to code.<p>Augmented balanced search trees are still useful in competitive programming but are much rarer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cp-algorithms.com&#x2F;data_structures&#x2F;treap.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cp-algorithms.com&#x2F;data_structures&#x2F;treap.html</a>')
