It’s a big country and stuff happens, but it’s useful to know the actual facts: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;cancer-patients-paid-5.6b-out-of-pocket-cancer-costs-in-2018" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthpayerintelligence.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;cancer-patients-pai...</a><p>&gt; In a case study, a patient with lymphoma paid out-of-pocket healthcare costs from $6,446 in a large employer-sponsored health plan to $12,931 in a health plan on the individual health insurance market.<p>These are significant sums, but not at the level of wiping out someone’s life savings unless they’re very poor. (And in that case, they’d be covered by Medicaid, which strictly limits cost sharing.)<p>Note that annually, Americans spend about $5.6 billion on out of pocket costs for cancer care. There are about 1.8 million diagnosed cases of cancer per year, so that’s about $3,100 per case.')
