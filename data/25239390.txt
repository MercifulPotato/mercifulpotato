That said, it does barf hard on some specific files - either taking a <i>really</i> long time to do the work or getting completely stuck in a busy waiting loop for some reason. That said, it&#x27;s still the 2nd best syntax highlighter out there (second only to Sublime itself.)<p>One of my hopes for this side project is that I&#x27;ll be able to contribute more time upstream with e.g. a more extensive test suite for Syntect against a much larger number of syntax definitions from the wild instead of just Sublime&#x27;s built-in ones.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sourcegraph&#x2F;syntect_server" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sourcegraph&#x2F;syntect_server</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;slimsag&#x2F;Packages&#x2F;#license" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;slimsag&#x2F;Packages&#x2F;#license</a>')
