And then after the car in front starts moving, it&#x27;d take them a solid second to start inching forward also.<p>The bigger problem was that this type of behavior was the norm to the point where at slow speed intersections with stoplights (e.g. city streets around college campuses), only a single digit number of cars would be able to go through per green light.')
