The type system in well thought out languages like elm or rust makes coding in them pretty simple. I don&#x27;t think that typescript&#x27;s type system is good enough to actually deliver on this promise.<p>It&#x27;s very easy, in my experience, to spend 5 minutes writing a function that I am 100% sure will work fine in JavaScript, and then spend 15 minutes trying to figure out how to type it. I&#x27;m sure that this is partly due to my own lack of understanding. Typing is basically a huge add-on to the cognitive load when using this superset.<p>Of course, it could just be that I&#x27;m not very good at typescript. But it&#x27;s a new technology, and it&#x27;s very possible to find yourself on a project with people who aren&#x27;t that experienced with it.<p>Additionally, I think the type system really pushes you towards object oriented programming. This is fundamentally at odds with the way most people write ReactJS.<p>Lastly, while deno is becoming a more viable option, most JavaScript development is taking place in node, meaning you have to transpile it. TypeScript adds the overhead of needing a build tool. Using `.mjs` files makes it so easy to spin up a project without any dependencies, something the HN crowd is always kvetching about.')
