Nothing serious. Some jaywalking, maybe, or perhaps you stood on private property without knowing it, or you were smoking a few centimetres too close to an entrance ... there are dozens of possibilities. Hundreds.<p>Now: you are T-boned by a car running a red light. The driver is the son of a police captain. You want to press charges, but suddenly, you are being indicted for dozens of crimes. It took all of minutes for the police to pull out every single time you were in public for the past 7 years and, thanks to the wonders of AI, not much longer to narrow down to the forty or fifty occasions during which they have you on record as committing a crime.<p>Are you still sure you want to press charges against the captain&#x27;s son? Or should bygones be bygones? Because it will be hard to press charges and fight dozens of charges in court, one at a time. In fact you will be in and out of court for years to come. Or not. Who knows?')
