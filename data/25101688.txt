This way you&#x27;ll also have a product that helps most users do 80% of their tasks while the cook-anything algorithm is still burning millions in stealth. If you&#x27;re smart you may even collect enough data and operational knowledge building this product to put you way ahead of other teams, should you wish to go the AI route.')
