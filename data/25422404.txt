They seemed to be doing everything right. Then they sputtered out. I still pay for Evernote because ... they&#x27;re holding a huge amount of my old notes that I don&#x27;t quite know how to get out. But I never add anything new to Evernote.<p>I could tell a similar story about Notion, though it is newer. While Evernote doesn&#x27;t give you enough affordances, instead almost forcing you do use its internal search for everything, Notion gives you far too many affordances, leading to a tendency to create monstrous, unusable systems where information goes to die. Also, it is slow.<p>Google Docs, on the other hand, has been a consistent workhorse for both my personal and professional needs ever since its inception. Google Docs does exactly what it needs to do and nothing more. In Google Drive, you move a Doc file around the way you would move a file around on your computer. Docs&#x2F;Drive have never lost data due to a sync issue, or left me confused about where a file went. I like this. I want it to stay this way.<p>As for the UX on the Google Analytics ... yeah, the Facebook Ads interface is also completely opaque. I feel like this class of products is being optimized for something other than the feeling of transparency, and is instead cultivating particular workflows used by power users.')
