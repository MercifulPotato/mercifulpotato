The stone cold truth is that most people aren&#x27;t interested in using theorem provers directly; instead, they&#x27;re programmatically generating queries. Simpler grammar = easier to generate, and that out-weighs direct usability.<p>In my next system I&#x27;ll be supporting both types of grammars in the parser.')
