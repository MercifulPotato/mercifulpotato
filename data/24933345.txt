Does anyone remember how Rob Rhinehart gave himself heart palpitations? How he hired a bunch of marketers, branders, engineers before any nutritionists and medical advisors?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soylent.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soylent.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;careers</a><p>He is still making the same mistake by not prominently showing nutritional consultants, medical experts and hiding behind the claim that this is a nutritional supplement.<p>Please correct me if Soylent has changed their MO of &quot;move fast and break things&quot; with people&#x27;s nutrition. I would love to be wrong.<p>edit: The idea of a fast, easy, nutritious paste is great. Nutrition, however, does not often fit into a piecemeal ready to eat box for all your meals. I ended up taking personal nutrition seriously when I realized my dietary choices were undermining my health. You only get one run at this life. Please take the gravity of your health and who you abdicate your health decisions with the respect those consequences deserve.')
