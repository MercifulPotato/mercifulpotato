Remember Warren calling for breaking up big tech? Even Biden and Obama frequently deployed (light) anti-corporate rhetoric in their campaigns and presidency.<p>Trump is a billionaire and a defender of the corporate class. His entire administration consists of ex-corporate wall-street types folks and&#x2F;or zealot yes-men. You may be right that the &quot;inroads with the working class&quot; are being made, but only in the form of the working class being convinced that their interests are the same as the corporate classes interests... though even that analysis may be wrong considering that Biden won by convincing voters in the rust and sun belt to vote for him.')
