You don&#x27;t own Reddit. Reddit doesn&#x27;t owe you anything. You never had a contract with Reddit (and I strongly doubt there&#x27;s a clause to protect your in their TOS). You built content for their platform that can be monetized by their ad infrastructure -- they weren&#x27;t hiding that fact.<p>The same thing can happen if you have a Discord community, Facebook community, or even a Telegram group. That&#x27;s the price you pay for free hosting, zero technical setup, and access to a built-in audience.<p>Take this as a learning experience. If you build another community on Reddit, perhaps funnel the users to a self-hosted platform. Alternatively, lower your expectations of &quot;owning&quot; a community.')
