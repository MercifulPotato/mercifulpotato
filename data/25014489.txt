We are talking about consumer products and services such as messaging, smart phones, email, and voice and data applications.<p>Do &quot;large business enterprises&quot; use exclusively &quot;customized encryption&quot;, or do they use the same encryption &quot;consumer products&quot; use? In my experience, it&#x27;s the later. The biggest example is TLS: for instance, <i>every</i> business which uses Microsoft Office 365 relies on the same TLS used by &quot;consumer products&quot;. The same applies to full disk encryption (BitLocker and&#x2F;or LUKS), smart phones (large business do use smart phones, and they are the same smart phones everyone else uses), email, and so on.<p>As a personal example, the software we develop at work is used by &quot;large business enterprises&quot;. When we added encryption to it, we didn&#x27;t use &quot;customized encryption&quot;; we used standard TLS.')
