I don&#x27;t think I have because I was literally homeless for years (and frequently too broke to eat) while trying to figure out how to get money for my writing and being told by people &quot;Writing doesn&#x27;t pay. Get a real job.&quot; while my writing hit the front page of HN sometimes and I was quite open about my medical situation and other factors that prevented me from finding some other way to support myself.<p>I have a really extreme set of circumstances that have not given me some easy way out of continuing to try to get money for my writing in specific. If I had some easy out, I would have taken it ages ago.<p>I did apply for a job -- the only one I tripped across that I felt qualified for. I didn&#x27;t get it. I also do resume work and can&#x27;t figure out how to get adequate traction with that either. etc etc.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to find other answers. What little money I make for blogging has proven to be the least worst answer for me so far.<p>If the entire world literally will let you starve and be homeless rather than give you money for work it values and praises that has no pay wall, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s straining the meaning of the word &#x27;force&#x27; to say that will force some people to give up on their ideals and figure out something that keeps them fed and housed -- if they have any means to do that.')
