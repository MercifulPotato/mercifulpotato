I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s nostalgia, or I&#x27;m just old (31) but I can&#x27;t imagine replacing it ever. Initially for gaming sessions, it became a place to hangout when you&#x27;re on the computer, whatever you are doing.<p>It&#x27;s light weight, usable on my phone, self-hosted, no emoji-fiesta, can send the one-off chat message that I NEVER need history of. It just works and it&#x27;s OURS. Once in a while when it&#x27;s down all of my friends panic.<p>I always thought there was a missing consumer app for my use case. There was&#x2F;is Houseparty but I thought that video is too much. Clubhouse seems like it&#x27;s doing something right but still not on point re. dropping in to a &quot;familiar&quot; place and hanging.<p>Discord on the other hand just feels so alienating to me.')
