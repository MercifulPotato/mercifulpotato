The next morning I received an automatically generated email saying that the deposit had bounced and that my account was now limited. I checked my bank account and saw that the funds had indeed been removed. The email included the ACH error code &quot;R26&quot;, which corresponds to a malformed ACH file. I quickly learned that every single deposit on that date had failed [1].<p>No worries, I thought, I&#x27;ll just email support and let them know. Unfortunately their support was completely useless and did not follow through with what they said.<p>I switched to TD Ameritrade (and the thinkorswim platform) and have not looked back.<p>I think Robinhood needs a sort of Uber-style restructuring. It&#x27;s clear they do not care about their clients.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;sergeiklebnikov&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;17&#x2F;20-year-old-robinhood-customer-dies-by-suicide-after-seeing-a-730000-negative-balance&#x2F;?sh=ac1bbf916384" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;sergeiklebnikov&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;17&#x2F;20-y...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;RobinHood&#x2F;comments&#x2F;d0joa2&#x2F;solution_to_the_r26_reversal_issue&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;RobinHood&#x2F;comments&#x2F;d0joa2&#x2F;solution_...</a>')
