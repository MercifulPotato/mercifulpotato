Spotify reportedly just paid him $100M, and one of his conditions for that deal was that they get no say whatsoever, and he said he wouldn’t agree to any deal where he has to answer to someone else. So when he said that Moxie had nothing to offer, it was intended to mean that there is nothing that <i>anyone</i> could offer (which he has emphasized before), not so much that Moxie personally had nothing of value.')
