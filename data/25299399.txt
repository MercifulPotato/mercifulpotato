The more credible that someone is, the better, and the more sophisticated that act of supportive shielding is, the better.<p>In exchange, the company provides support, financial or otherwise, for that someone&#x27;s personal career ambitions in becoming rich and famous themselves.<p>Anyone else see it this way? Or am I just too jaded these days?')
