There are significant groups of people who buy both illegal and legal just because of previous connections or the inconvenience (driving across state lines to get the legal hookup). So if you buy legally, you are causing competition for the legal supply which can cause just enough shortage to push demand onto the illegal market.<p>Until people refuse to smoke illegal marijuana en mass, the markets are effectively the same.<p>&gt; hope you support drug legalization, otherwise this attitude is massively hypocritical.<p>This is completely orthogonal to legalization. As long as the cartels still get it into the country at a competitive price to local growers (legal or illegal), the cartels are being supported.')
