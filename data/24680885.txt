Their speakers sound really good, and seem to make my sources sound really good in a really easy to use package. I have their AirPlay 2 compatible soundbar, and it works so well when hooked up to my TV as the input, and seamlessly can then receive AirPlay from my devices and fill a room. If there is an open source equivalent, or plans to make one, I would love to see it paired with really amazing sound producing hardware.')
