Though, I would say that this statement is a good description of git, too:<p>&gt; a large, complex piece of software and even if it hypothetically supports some feature, doesn&#x27;t make it intuitive or easy to use in that way. (Or that you won&#x27;t hit a bunch of corner cases when you try to use it.)<p>A takeaway I get from this entire conversation is that the real pain point is not the <i>drafting</i> stage, but the <i>editing</i> stage. The latter is (a) collaborative, with (b) non-technical stakeholders...there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a good way to both use my favorite editor, AND play nicely w my editor&#x27;s stack (or lack thereof).<p>Good thing I don&#x27;t <i>have</i> an editor...that would require me to actually write things :D')
