Audiophile snake oil crap (e.g. ionic crystal cable risers, brass pyramids, $10k USB cables) isn’t really part of the same market.<p>High quality wireless headphones tend to come with a price premium and sound not quite as good, which seems fair since they are generally closed-back and have to drive a DAC and amp off a relatively small battery. At $549 these had better sound <i>really</i> good but I wouldn’t necessarily expect hur-dur-six-hundo level of audio quality.<p>Generally I find the “Apple tax” worth paying for consumer gear if it’s something I can actually make use of. I’ll be very interested to see how these stack up, but unless they’re the second coming of headphone Jesus I already have enough headphones.')
