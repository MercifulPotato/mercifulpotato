You can reduce the instantaneous pressure delivered to the projectile which helps fix the melting problem.  You&#x27;d want to chill the barrel a bit, but some melting might be good there as long as the water doesn&#x27;t refreeze in the barrel and stop successive rounds.  Basically you&#x27;re making a potato cannon that shoots ice.<p>Bonus for freezing the water&#x2F;co2 out of the air itself.  You wouldn&#x27;t even need to carry ammo.')
