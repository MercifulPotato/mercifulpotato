I am currently in Australia, which shut down early and has been serious about fighting this from the beginning, despite repeated outbreaks from international travel, most recently in Victoria, which prompted a hard and long shutdown...that worked.<p>27,000 total cases over the course of the entire pandemic. Less than 1,000 deaths. And all of the worst of that has been lapses in vigilance and mistakes.<p>Those 50,000 worldwide cases were the seeds of the 34 million that have been confirmed. Every one of those hotspots could have been and should have been isolated and quarantined. We&#x27;d be through this if we had responded simultaneously, fast and hard. But no one was really prepared for what that shutdown meant or looked like.<p>But now we are stuck with a persistent infection that just keeps getting worse.<p>&gt; At this point shutting things down causes more harm than good.<p>And people <i>then</i> were saying that a shutdown would do more harm than good. I think a 3-4 week hard simultaneous worldwide lockdown would have stopped this in its tracks, but the logistics and necessity of that were absolutely not clear. Instead we were constantly one step behind, enacting half measures and wishful thinking based on past pandemics. Incredible that people said almost <i>exactly</i> the same thing 6 months ago and look how screwed we are.<p>Now we are three steps behind and there is no putting this thing back in the bottle. We&#x27;re boned. Millions more deaths are coming and the only hope of even remotely normal life now is a vaccine.')
