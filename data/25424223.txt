Item(by='14', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607984824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25422269, text='I would love to read YouTube’s big reveal on how they are targeting children. It does not take an expert to see it. Just search up any kids shows and wait for the ads to come in. Should kids be targeted by any ads? I don’t know but feel probably they shouldn’t. But even if they should be shown ads I highly question the type of ads I have seen while watching shows with my kids. Honestly I can’t think of a single example ad off the top of my head but while watching clearly kids shows have seen enough that I have often thought “what the hell youtube”. A part of me believes they want the ads to be offensive to the parent so they consider the premium account.')
