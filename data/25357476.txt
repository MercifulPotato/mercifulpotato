Almost viable, with just a few mistakes that would have made it both impossible to follow and, if followed as closely as possible, disgusting.<p>A glorious effort :) Reminds me of Douglas Adams&#x27; Nutrimatic machine:<p>The way it functioned was very interesting. When the _Drink_ button was pressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of the subject&#x27;s taste buds, a spectroscopic examination of the subject&#x27;s metabolism and then sent tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centers of the subject&#x27;s brain to see what was likely to go down well. However, no one knew quite why it did this because it invariably delivered a cupful of liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.')
