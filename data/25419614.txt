I can&#x27;t be productive anywhere close to that amount of time, and it&#x27;s been that way forever. Once in a while I&#x27;ll have a spike of 1 - 7 days where I can sit and bang out code 12 hours a day. This is usually the culmination of some long period of rumination that grows into an understanding of some large task that I finally just sit and knock out. After that, I&#x27;m weary and I have to rest (for 3 months).')
