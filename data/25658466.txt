It is, however, referred to as &quot;The Emacs Editor&quot; in its documentation and &quot;an extensible, customizable, free&#x2F;libre text editor â€” and more&quot; on its official website, which could lead to some confusion about its primary purpose if that&#x27;s not editing text. I do begrudgingly use Emacs as my main editor because that&#x27;s what the communities of the languages I like use, but I do find the editing experience to be sub-par compared to other editors I&#x27;ve worked with, and I find that there are better external alternatives to any of the common elisp applications, barring org-mode.')
