The ability to advocate for yourself has been given to someone else, over something as intimately personal and important as the labour you undertake for the majority of your waking hours. They are your only advocate, in the absence of strong regulation and legislation, because in a union arrangement it is inappropriate for the employer to advocate for the employee against the union.<p>I don&#x27;t need to outcompete on donations; I need to collectively pool my cash with other like-minded individuals in order to pay for political activity that will coerce and convince legislators. Those with the most money don&#x27;t necessarily win, but money is the key to gaining access. I&#x27;ve had my representative read to Parliament an exerpt of a  letter that I wrote; there was nary a need for money to get that response, only access.<p>My employers have never been interested in what I do with my money, and I suspect they would be _far_ more interested if I were to begin organizing a union.<p>The solution to employee abuse is legislation and regulation, not yet another layer of political bureaucracy.')
