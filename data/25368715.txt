There is more at stake than FB recovering its investment into IG.<p>Besides... they will get to sell it, probably at a profit. They got to own it for 8 years, enjoyed the benefits of lowered competition. They will be fine. I agree that this should have been prevented in the first place, but we are where we are.<p>Controversially, I don&#x27;t think ordinary rule of law can apply to FAANG-scale monopolies. There&#x27;s no way to generalize rules, laws or industrial policies when the industry is &quot;social media.&quot; Social media is (economically) mostly FB. Any rule, law or policy is basically regulating FB specifically.<p>Anyway, the danger of a hammer coming out is low. Even if prosecutors succeed, a cost-of-business fine is the most likely result. Even if they do spin out whatsapp &amp; IG... that leaves facebook mostly intact.<p>I&#x27;d also note that the worst case scenario for overzealous trustbusting is basically nothing. At worst you kill FB. This isn&#x27;t steel production or auto manufacturing. FB could be swallowed by a demon tomorrow and by next thursday any shortage in social media will be filled. We&#x27;re not exactly short on the stuff.<p>FB bring in $80bn pa, but that&#x27;s totally arbitrary to the cost of doing social networking. It could be done for $40bn or $8bn and I doubt the consumer would notice a difference. Again, this isn&#x27;t auto manufacturing. A car company can&#x27;t make as many cars with half the revenue. If one dies, we actually have less manufacturing capacity and we&#x27;ll make fewer cars for a while. None of this applies to social media.')
