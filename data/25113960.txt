We <i>have</i> data, from the phase III trials. Is the data final? No. But it’s good evidence for general safety. As for long-term problems, we have good theoretical reasons (based, in turn, on experimental <i>data</i>) to suspect that no such risks exist. In fact, we know quite a lot about how foreign RNA behaves in cells and while there are potential mechanisms to cause issues (most importantly strong immune reactions), there are <i>no</i> known plausible mechanisms to cause long-term problems.<p>We can’t <i>fully</i> exclude the possibility of long-term averse effects, but we <i>do</i> have data supporting the vaccines’ safety (both direct and indirect, experimental data), and most experts are confident that there won’t be any such effects — confident enough to put their own health on the line: many are enrolled in the ongoing trials.')
