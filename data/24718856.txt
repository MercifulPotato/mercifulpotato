Item(by='antepodius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602163331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24718234, text='People focus too much on swords, anyway.  Pole weapons were the primary melee weapons for most combatants, including samurai, with swords being akin to sidearms.<p>But there are certainly trade-offs in design.  Katanas are good at chopping unarmoured opponents and being sharp.  The crossguard of a longsword can and was used to bludgeon an armored opponent, who would be basically immune to cuts.  So if I abducted you and forced you to pick a sword from a lineup, then fight someone to the death, you&#x27;d want to know who you were fighting and what they had, and pick based on that.')
