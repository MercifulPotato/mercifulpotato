Communication is the coordination of that reference between speakers in a shared environment.<p>You cannot take GPT3 to new york and ask it what it thinks of the city: it cannot be anywhere (it isnt causally connected to an evnironment); and it cannot coordinate with any listener (it has nothing to say).<p>Text generation is certainly reaching new heights. This isn&#x27;t a form of communication, however, and isnt even relevant to it.')
