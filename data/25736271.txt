With all of the hyperbole over various games being &quot;broken&quot;, most people that are hyped about a specific game are just going to buy it and see for themselves. Unless it&#x27;s literally unplayable (as may actually have been the case here), most people won&#x27;t refund it.<p>This has been going on for years and years, it&#x27;s just getting worse over time. It&#x27;s always some variant of this conversation at $GAMEDEV_STUDIO:<p>Focus group feedback: Our test groups are noticing 10% of players are running into this bug&#x2F;issue. It&#x27;s frustrating them, but there are workarounds.<p>Management: All of our marketing materials target release date XX&#x2F;XX&#x2F;XXXX. If we try to fix this bug we&#x27;ll have to push the release... How many people will _not_ buy the game because of this bug?<p>Focus group feedback: Nobody that would have otherwise bought this game would decide not to buy it over this issue.<p>Management: So we ship as planned, and fix the bugs in a patch.<p>Over time studios realized that you can get away with much bigger bugs affecting much larger portions of players. Ship sooner, start recognizing revenue, and push post-launch patches to fix the &quot;really bad bugs&quot;. It&#x27;s shocking how bad the quality has to get before it starts making headlines.')
