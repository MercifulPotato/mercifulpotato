Think of all the errors made and time lost fixing issues with CSV (comma separated value) or TSV (tab separated files) or pipe-delimited fields in records, etc, etc due to having to handle the case where the delimiter character is not a delimiter character but valid data with a field.<p>ASCII provided characters specifically for this purpose.  But no one seems to have RTFMed.  ASCII 31 is a &quot;unit separator&quot; (or field separator as we&#x27;d call it today) and ASCII 30 is a record separator.  There&#x27;s even ASCII 29, a group separator, so you can have a set of records related as a group (for example, a group of records of different type but related to a single customer).  And there&#x27;s ASCII 28, a file separator, so you can have multiple &quot;logical&quot; files within one physical file.')
