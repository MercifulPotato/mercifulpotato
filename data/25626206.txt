Cigna has a little more variety but is mostly listed at 51%.<p>Only Emblem shows real variety across the board, with prices listed from 21.9% to 174%. It also has the lowest mean&#x2F;median, at 45% and 34% respectively.<p>I know from personal experience that Aetna does have negotiated rates with NYP, and the flat discounts for all providers other than Emblem are also suspicious.')
