Obviously different people relate differently with those side activities but your dedication to learn chess puts it very much outside my personal definition of hobby or unwinding activity.<p>I have a analog story that ended up burning my up with my hobby: playing music. I played guitar (acoustic and electric) since I was a teenager, and sometime after I was an adult, I decided to double down to really learn it (as a hobby, since I already had my main career). I set up several hours a week for deliberate practice, started a classic guitar class, tried some Brazilian MPB class. The endgame for me was that I got completely burned out.<p>After doing that for about 2 years, playing became a big chore for me. One day I just stopped and didn&#x27;t touch a guitar again for almost 5 years.<p>It was still very interesting to see how you approached it.')
