Ok, it&#x27;s good advertisement to our tourism but this is just fake news.<p>I grew up in one of the &quot;drug towns&quot; of the late 80&#x27;s&#x2F;early 90&#x27;s in Portugal. It was bad, really bad. There wasn&#x27;t any extended family without a drug problem. That generation, bornt after the 1974 revolution, now in the mid 40&#x27;s, was almost erased from there. Some died and those remaining, after a life of petty crime and prison, eventually escaped.<p>Completely agree with your comment. I would just add another relevant factor to the roll: decriminalization  gave even more visibility to the addiction problem and newer generations didn&#x27;t like what they saw. It wasn&#x27;t cool to use drugs anymore.')
