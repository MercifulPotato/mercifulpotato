George and Shirley? Second the expression itself. Again what is a bob and jane? What is a partner? Partners in crime? Also seriously:<p>And we get to the key point you are missing. Its clear from the context. The code we had wasn&#x27;t some imaginary code where the variable was far away and had a ton of context. It was that particular code. Different code might be better written in a different way. If you a have different code context in mind with higher complexity, show that one.<p>Additionally, &quot;merge_married_profiles_into_list_of_pairs&quot; is not necessarily better. When debugging the code, we don&#x27;t know what that part really does. An implementation using a more generic standard library function lets us glance over that bit since we already have understanding of it. (And again, it might depend on the audience - are we talking to a language expert, or a domain expert? Do we have a well tested and well defined library of domain functions that everyone has a clear understanding of?)<p>Context and audience matter. Verbosity can be a lazy cop out for bad structure. (That&#x27;s applicable to writing English as well.)')
