Item(by='cxr', descendants=None, kids=[24676137], score=None, time=1601761361, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24674524, text='&gt; If it were just a list of defects, this discussion wouldn&#x27;t have started.<p>This makes for the second time this week I&#x27;ve run into someone stating the obvious and thinking that it makes for a point in their favor and not one against their end of the argument.<p>&gt; Obnoxious is not in the comment I replied to. You&#x27;ve projected that. The maintainer in that scenario may have been replied politely. The only issue under discussion was the submitter&#x27;s reaction to a maintainer thinking the submitter wanted something.  Are you sure you&#x27;re not strawmanning and counterfactualising?<p>Yes, I&#x27;m sure, and I don&#x27;t really have time or the wherewithal to explain in depth to someone who&#x27;s dead set against not understanding.  &quot;The maintainer in that scenario may have been replied politely&quot; is simply not a move that&#x27;s available to you.  There is no &quot;may&quot; when we&#x27;re discussing _actual_, _concrete_ events and not hypotheticals.  (Even in the case of hypotheticals, it&#x27;s a problem—counterfactuals are not an argument unless the argument it opposes employs the universal quantifier; failure to understand this is a failure to understand the difference between what it means to say &quot;∃x&quot; and what it means to say &quot;∀x&quot;.)  There is only what did or did not occur (or what is or is not posed).  To repeat: it is not your job to imagine the most convenient circumstances that would weaken the side that you&#x27;re arguing against.<p>&gt; And these lessons are? If you think it&#x27;s nuts, it would be nice if you were to offer useful solutions.<p>I&#x27;ve offered them.  Go back and read my comments in this thread and you&#x27;ll see them.  Read your own comments—it&#x27;ll suffice to read just what you&#x27;ve written in this one—and the solution follows naturally from the problem you describe.  If it&#x27;s so hard to discriminate between &quot;informational bug reports&quot; and support requests, then stop mixing them.  If you&#x27;re going to run a bugtracker, then <i>run a bugtracker</i>[1].<p>&gt; Netscape&#x27;s corporate strategy doesn&#x27;t seem relevant here.<p>You&#x27;re right.  So I don&#x27;t know why you focused on it at length, as if you can talk your way into it being the thing that I was referring to.  Once again, a move that&#x27;s not available to you.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyp.is&#x2F;de25lAXAEeuhNEN0wan1Ww&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24673650" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyp.is&#x2F;de25lAXAEeuhNEN0wan1Ww&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;i...</a>')
