With no kids, sure you can live however you want. I&#x27;d probably work through covid, given there&#x27;s not a whole lot else to do right now. But certainly don&#x27;t feel bad about taking a year or two off to do whatever (but do it on a budget--you want to err on the side of caution when starting out, and set that as your precedent), then see how you feel.<p>I spent three years variously traveling, working low-wage jobs, taking classes, spending about 10K&#x2F;yr (which was less than what I was making on my investments). I&#x27;m back in software now and maybe a bit behind my peers who stayed in, but happy I did what I did.<p>I anticipate most people who &quot;retire&quot; in their 30&#x27;s end up coming back to work at some point. Not for money necessarily, but because we find ourselves missing the feeling of being productive.')
