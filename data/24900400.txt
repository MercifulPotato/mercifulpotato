There are plenty of U.S. based internet services that work in Iran. There are instances where Iran has banned Gmail, and Iran currently has bans on Facebook and some other social media sites, but that&#x27;s because the government of Iran has imposed such bans to prevent its people from using the Internet to engage in the free flow of information, not because of the U.S.<p>The links you mention don&#x27;t state that Github did any work to comply with U.S. sanctions. The links you state are consistent with the links I posted which is that Github is welcome to provide online services to Iran that are free of charge.<p>Feel free to counter this by pointing out any particular feature or work that Github has to implement unless your suggestion is that denying access to people in Iran paid services like Github Enterprises is somehow a form of &quot;additional feature work put in place&quot; to support Iranian users.')
