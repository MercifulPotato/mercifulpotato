In Western countries, surveys indicate we can&#x27;t convince even half of people to install a contact tracing smartphone app. According to my state&#x27;s department of health, practical experience indicates we can&#x27;t convince even half of people to pick up the phone and respond to a contact tracing interview.<p>&gt; Covid19 would also be over if people with symptoms would just stay home.<p>No it wouldn&#x27;t.
