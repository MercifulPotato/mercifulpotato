Was trying to deploy something with just private &#x2F; internal access recently. It&#x27;d be cool if the steps could be simplified. Seems like currently I&#x27;d need to configure Oauth2proxy. How can I go from a locally running server with no auth protection to deploy in as few steps as possible? Right now I&#x27;d need to add an Oauth2proxy layer. I&#x27;m sure I could do it in a few hours... can it be entirely eliminated?')
