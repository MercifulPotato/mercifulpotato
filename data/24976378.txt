Let&#x27;s not forget those generous free limits can be slashed whenever it suits, and why they might be so generous for launch at all.<p>AWS has, to my knowledge, <i>never</i> increased the cost of <i>any</i> service after launch. They do, however, have a long history of reducing prices.<p>You also completely neglected to mention this part:<p>&gt;Simply authenticating with an AWS account increases free data bandwidth up to 5 TB each month when pulling images from the internet. And finally, workloads running in AWS will get unlimited data bandwidth from any region when pulling publicly shared images hosted on AWS.<p>So yes, AWS gives some incentive to create an AWS account, and an even further incentive to use AWS services. All I can say to that is... duh?')
