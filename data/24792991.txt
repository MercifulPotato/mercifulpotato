There is an Advertising API, and then there&#x27;s a Product Advertising API which is often called the Product API.<p>The Advertising API is for advertisers running ads with Amazon Advertising. Apparently they don&#x27;t allow certain competitors (shopping sites, comparison sites, ad networks) to use it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;advertising.amazon.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;resources&#x2F;ad-policy&#x2F;api" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;advertising.amazon.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;resources&#x2F;ad-policy&#x2F;api</a><p>The Product API is for affiliates to fetch product&#x2F;price information in a reliable way instead of scraping the main site for it. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve ever prohibited price comparison sites. The last time I really looked into it was several years ago, and they weren&#x27;t restricted at that point either.')
