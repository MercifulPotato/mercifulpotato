But then you want to improve &amp; scale, and suddenly all the nuances, bites you. The rules get bigger, nested and complicated. Traditional NLP tried that avenue for a while, with decent success in small usecases, but for larger problems without success. (Compared to stuff like BERT &amp; GPT, which still have a lot of problems)<p>Similar with Knowledge Graphs, you can show some nice properties on inferring knowledge on small problems, but the real world is much more approximate and unclear than some (binary) relationships.<p>Personally i think we Humans lack the mental capacity to build large models with complex interactions.')
