So for example you could very quickly sequence the genome of a virus and figure out how it worked much faster than current methods allow.<p>The reverse folding problem lets you specify a structure and then make a genetic sequence to produce it. For example you could look at this virus to see how it infects its host, then design a custom protein to act as an anti-body stopping it, which is a capability we don&#x27;t currently have.<p>Forward folding is certainly useful, but reverse folding would be revolutionary.')
