Without carbon capture of some sort we will very likely have &gt;2 degree C.<p>Once you come to that understanding, the question is not how do we pay for carbon capture. Rather, it is why wouldn&#x27;t we pay for carbon capture now so that we avoid the massive costs and negative consequences associated with a &gt;2 degree C rise in global temperatures (droughts, more intense storms, massive human migration, sea level rise, etc.).<p>You can&#x27;t just criticize the cost of carbon capture without acknowledging the costs associated with not doing carbon capture.')
