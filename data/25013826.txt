Unfortunately it also destroyed my executive function too; I can barely even string together coherent thoughts and perform programming work without being overly medicated on ADHD drugs.<p>I know there&#x27;s valbenazine and other Parkinson&#x27;s drugs (selegiline works decently enough on a daily dose, but MAOIs can become dangerous in certain circumstances), but they don&#x27;t solve the root problem.<p>Now I can barely even control my hands, legs or face and it&#x27;s mildly disfiguring, but it&#x27;s not like I care anymore...')
