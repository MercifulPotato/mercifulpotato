Just one hour ago, a high school kid who grew up here in Silicon Valley was telling me about how ridiculously uninformed his local friends are about Southerners. This kid has visited the south a few times recently and has come back amazed at how friendly, smart, and mannered southerners are. (I agree with his assessment, but I&#x27;ve seen it myself often enough in my own travels that I lump it in with the many no-longer-surprising differences between reality and intellectual fashion. He was confiding in me, because he guessed that I would be one of the few who might understand.)<p>He has apparently tried to correct his friends&#x27; misconceptions a few times, and has been equally amazed at 1) how wrong their ideas of southerners are and 2) how nothing he can tell them has any impact their thinking as they crow about how superior we are to those contemptible southerners, who aren&#x27;t &quot;tolerant&quot; like we are. (One more LOL for the road....)')
