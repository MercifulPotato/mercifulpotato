For example, by criticizing Trump on his COVID-19 plan<p>Huh?  &quot;We&quot; have made a very big mistake by turning this issue into a political one.  However, the mistake was in failing to criticize Trump from the very beginning.  Twitter should have canceled his account when he put out that tweet calling COVID a hoax (in March?).  Corporate America should have stood up in a united fashion and put out a pro-mask&#x2F;anti-Trump message.  Every health care administer should have put out PR immediately debunking Trump&#x27;s nonsense.  The idea that we should have avoided criticizing the guy who stupidly made this thing political in the first place is just crazy to me.')
