You are %s. You are a %s ...`<p>Minor correction: % formatting allows specifying names for dictionary keys too:<p><pre><code>    In [1]: &quot;%(a)s and %(b)s&quot; % {&quot;a&quot;:&quot;A&quot;, &quot;b&quot;:&quot;B&quot;}\n    Out[1]: &#x27;A and B&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nIn fact I had never switched to using str.format as it just never added enough benefit for me over the old %-based formatting.<p>But I do like f-strings and am using them quite a bit. Calling functions or methods inside f-strings is something I had no idea was possible. That is pretty neat:<p><pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; name = &quot;Eric Idle&quot;\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; f&quot;{to_lowercase(name)} is funny.&quot;\n    &#x27;eric idle is funny.&#x27;</code></pre>')
