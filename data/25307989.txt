I&#x27;m not sure that this is a realistic expectation with our current methods of company governance (which should probably be changed).  I&#x27;m assuming the research isn&#x27;t overly safety oriented and is more like &quot;overuse of google leads to decreased overall well-being&quot; rather that &quot;use of the cigarettes that we sell leads to significantly reduced life expectancy&quot;.  Of course that statement begs the question of where the line between the two lies.')
