Item(by='ralmidani', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611079252, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25833781, text='As mentioned in another discussion, I used to be a Copyleft Zealot, but I&#x27;ve come to realize an absolutist insistence on &quot;Free as in Freedom&quot; and the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot;, without allowing businesses a viable path to profitability, is an obsolete attitude. It has become incredibly easy and cheap to distribute copies of large programs, even as a service over the internet.<p>Sure, hobbyist projects and foundations for FOSS software still exist, but important infrastructure projects like Mongo, Redis, and now Elastic have all recently changed their licenses from &quot;true&quot; FOSS to &quot;some rights reserved&quot;.<p>One might argue that the point of FOSS is not to make money. But GNU&#x2F;FSF have said repeatedly that it&#x27;s OK to &quot;sell&quot; your software. How do you do that when a FAANGMO can easily out-scale you and put you out of business?<p>If I were to start an actual software company, I would give very serious consideration to licenses like Polyform[0] over &quot;true&quot; FOSS, at least for the important, money-making parts where it would be impossible to compete with a FAANGMO.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polyformproject.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polyformproject.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;</a>')
