I&#x27;ve noticed manufacturers seem to like making them in 27&quot; (too small) and 43&quot; (too big!) sizes.<p>I have questions.  How far away do you sit?  How is a 43&quot; screen for coding?  Do you use a tiling window manager to allocate all that space?  Do you use it for gaming at all?  If so, how hard is it to keep track of everything on the display?  Do you find yourself having to turn your head to keep track of everything?')
