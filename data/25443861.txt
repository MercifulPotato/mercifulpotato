I&#x27;ve spent a long time trying to figure out the best way to make generic containers in C and this is what I&#x27;ve come up with.<p>Most container libraries in C are either weakly typed (with void pointers and function pointers) or they are heavy on macros (expanding to huge blocks of code wrapped in &quot;do {} while(0)&quot;.) Pottery is different: it uses include files and renaming macros to create strongly typed composable templates. The templated code in Pottery looks sort of like normal C, and it preprocesses into ordinary C functions similar to what you would write by hand.<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of stuff in the examples to demonstrate Pottery: a toy chess engine, yet another string library, etc. I&#x27;d love some feedback on it so please have a look or try it out and let me know what you think.')
