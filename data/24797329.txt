They exist to make profit.  And anything that doesn&#x27;t align with that is unimportant to them.<p>I&#x27;d also point out that on Twitter or Facebook, you aren&#x27;t the customer, you&#x27;re the <i>product</i>.  And they keep you in your little section of the feedlot (filter bubble) to keep you pacified and feeling good, as they profit off your PII and eyeballs.')
