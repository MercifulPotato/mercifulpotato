Yes, if you follow the dosing instructions (and are aware of all sources of the drug you&#x27;re taking and also aren&#x27;t drinking alcohol or something simultaneously) you&#x27;ll be fine, but if you discovered this drug today the odds that it would be approved for over-the-counter use are basically zero.')
