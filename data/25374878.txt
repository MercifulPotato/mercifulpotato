The Quest is currently a one of a kind device when it comes to ease of use and setup.\n(Which makes it doubly annoying to me the Facebbok tie in. I adored the Quest one but I sent it back for a refund due to Facebook&#x27;s ridiculous decision not to allow multiple user accounts. A device which I&#x27;m not using 95% of my time cannot easily be shared with other family members?! Utter madness. &#x2F;rant)')
