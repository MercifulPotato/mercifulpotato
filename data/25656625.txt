They have come full circle, having a very powerful language model they can attach it to other inputs(video, audio,...) creating an ensemble system that gives the illusion that it has &quot;knowledge&quot; about domains and can reason in context, as they ofter state in all their works. But we should know better that what they are doing is very different, eg. trowing a truckload of data into billion-parameter neural networks, spending millions, if not billions, of dollars, just to minimize a loss function in an adversarial environment (a GAN), in this case.')
