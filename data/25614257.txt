Even though I know that my time is valuable, I wonder if we shouldn&#x27;t question our actions a bit more as we wander through this minefield of software we&#x27;ve created over the last 10 years.<p>The last TWO times I had Docker on my Desktop, some update caused it to fry itself and bring my computer to its knees trying to restart something that it had &quot;uninstalled&quot;.
