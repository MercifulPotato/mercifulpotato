If you don&#x27;t have operator overloading, then you have to call a function.  And an overloaded operator <i>is</i> a function call.  So what&#x27;s the difference?<p>You can overload + to add matrices, say.  That could allocate.  It could also be buggy and subtract them instead.  Or, you could call AddMatrices, which could also allocate, and could also be buggy and subtract the matrices.<p>The <i>only</i> difference is that, if you came from C, you might expect + to be the built-in arithmetic operator, and only that.  That is, if you don&#x27;t know the language, then the language features may surprise you.  That&#x27;s... not news, and not very interesting.<p>I agree with the article.  The complainers have a C hammer, and they can&#x27;t see beyond it.')
