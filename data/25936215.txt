Being good at software is something that is (or isn&#x27;t) deep in the DNA of every company and is very very hard to change.  I think long-term this is why Tesla&#x27;s domination of the market is just beginning and isn&#x27;t dependent on longer battery life <i>or</i> charging network. <i>No</i> car company except Tesla has demonstrated even basic competence in good UX or software development, so they are all doomed to lose. (I&#x27;d personally give Tesla a B- but they are competing against an industry of straight Fs across the board)')
