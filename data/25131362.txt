I haven&#x27;t tried a remarkable, though I do have a kindle as a reference for e-ink displays. As a whole, the iPad is hard to beat:<p>- Matte screen protector + pencil means reading&#x2F;writing experience feels just as good as an eink.<p>- It can comfortably handle large, color PDFs. Other solutions either don&#x27;t have color, or don&#x27;t have processors powerful enough to handle rendering large PDFs anyways.<p>- Both iPad and Remarkable have almost identical pixels per inch - 224 and 226 ppi.<p>- iPad has polished reader apps. My favorite is Kybook3, which supports auto trimming PDF margins &amp; horizontal scroll locking which makes it super convenient to read PDFs. It can also read epubs and other formats with plenty of knobs to tweak background colors, fonts etc. I don&#x27;t think the Remarkable is quite there yet.<p>- Reading, researching frequently means looking something up on the web as you go too. Again difficult to do on a remarkable.<p>The iPad can potentially be more distracting, but that can be solved by setting it up right IMO. I don&#x27;t install any TV&#x2F;Media&#x2F;News&#x2F;Games apps on it, turn off notifications for most apps and have a shortcut to limit the colors to black and white.')
