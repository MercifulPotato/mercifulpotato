I wanted to make something that I could play with my friends remotely, and I came up with this. Frontend is made with React, and the back end is a python server that forwards state updates from clients to other clients and also to a Redis server. The Redis server acts as the source of truth for all game states. Server-client communication is done through web sockets using socketIO. Hope you enjoy it! I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions technical or otherwise')
