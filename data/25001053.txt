I&#x27;m more worried about total government surveillance.<p>It&#x27;s strange to me that many of the same people who are concerned with room 641a are people asking to cut out the private entity, not the government. It&#x27;s entirely possible that I simply don&#x27;t know some aspect that would make other government entities less susceptible to this kind of strong-arming, but the DMV here sells change-of-address data, so I remain skeptical.')
