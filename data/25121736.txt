Item(by='rednum', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605605601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121547, text='&gt; Git is one of those technologies where it&#x27;s super important to get a good grasp of how to internals work.<p>In my opinion relying too much on user understanding implementation is a mark of bad design. I don&#x27;t care about more advanced functionalities of git, on daily basis I have very simple workflow that I want to &quot;just work&quot;. Sure I can spend few days studying git internals, but it feels unnecessary. Especially given that in the past I&#x27;ve worked with simpler proprietary tools that &quot;just work&quot; (though did not have equivalent of &quot;power&quot; features).<p>On the other hand I think git is like bash - has some serious warts but it&#x27;s good enough to be used widely; and unlikely to be replaced by anything else at this point.')
