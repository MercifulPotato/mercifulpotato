If the tenant moves out and stops paying rent, the landlord has a claim for breach of contract. The landlord, however, must try to mitigate his damages by renting the property to someone else. The breaching tenant will be liable for vacancy costs as well as costs of finding a new tenant. If fair market value has gone down and the landlord can’t find a new tenant at the old rate, then the breaching tenant will be liable for the difference in the remainder of the lease term.<p>There may be statutory exceptions that allow a tenant to break a lease without liability in some circumstances. They’re things like military service, domestic violence, unsafe property, or landlord harassment.
