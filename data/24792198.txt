Item(by='jabl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602787310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24779814, text='I had a VW (2007 model, bought 2013, sold 2019), and man, owning that thing was frustrating and expensive. Off the top of my head:<p>- ABS sensor on one wheel broken.<p>- Long running problem with the fault indicator light suggesting some problem with the intake. Opened and cleaned the intake valve. Didn&#x27;t help. Then found out a plastic cogwheel worth maybe 10c for controlling a valve in the intake manifold was broken. But you can&#x27;t buy that, have to buy the entire intake manifold for EUR 700. Thanks VW. Then the shop doing the work managed to forget a bolt in the combustion chamber when changing the intake manifold. So new engine block needed, since in order to save cost the fricking engine doesn&#x27;t have separate cylinder liners. Luckily the new engine block was on the shop&#x27;s insurance. On a positive note, the new engine was a slightly newer model which had the fixed camshaft chain that had been a common failure with that engine model.<p>- Alternator failed.<p>- Turbo charge air pipe fell off.<p>- Rear brake pads jammed and had to be prematurely replaced. Again, a common problem with VW disc brakes if you drive carefully and not that much.<p>Currently I have a Toyota, which I also had before the VW. So far so good.')
