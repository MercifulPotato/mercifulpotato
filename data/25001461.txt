Well, if all you paid attention to was Netflix&#x27;s lame excuse you could certainly get that impression since they did everything they could to imply that was the case.<p>Except that&#x27;s not what happened.  They profiled a scene - one scene!  If anything there are far more crazy&#x2F;disgusting scenes in the movie than just that one.<p>The poster is a red herring.  The problem is the movie and it&#x27;s content.  Always has been, still is.')
