Otherwise the audio will stutter.<p>The first approach ensures responsiveness: you click stop and it immediately stops; you press volume up and the volume immediately goes up. The second approach is “easier” but results in a bit of lag between your control input and the output.<p>With HiFiBerryOS, they may go with the first approach. The fewer things you have in a system, the fewer task scheduling surprises you have, and so you can make the buffer smaller and have better responsiveness.<p>Now, modern hardware, even something as cheap as the Rpi, has plenty enough processing power to ensure smooth playback like 99.9% of the time (I just pulled that number out of thin air), and most non-audiophile people won’t really notice any lag in the usual media players such as VLC in day-to-day listening, but some audiophiles will swear they can notice it.')
