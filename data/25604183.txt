Don&#x27;t eat out if you can avoid it and if you do go in person, never order in.<p>In secret someone who cares less about your health than anyone you know prepares hundreds of meals a day and if they don&#x27;t come in because they are sick they lose money.  If they don&#x27;t try to hide mistakes it will cost them.  If they don&#x27;t save the company money by picking up food off the ground or using yesterdays soup as a base for today&#x27;s soup they are doing a poor job.  There are very few ways a customer can prove these mistakes unless they are visible upon receipt.  Poor reviews hidden from the public is the only recourse.')
