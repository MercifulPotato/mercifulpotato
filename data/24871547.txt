Is there anything about it that makes it a natural fit for Lisp but not for other languages?<p>Macros, for example, are a natural fit for Lisp because of the parentheses. It would be difficult to add Lisp-style macros to a language like Python because Python doesn&#x27;t have Lisp parentheses. In contrast, there&#x27;s nothing about multiple namespaces that is particularly tied to Lisp. Common Lisp and Emacs Lisp have multiple namespaces, but Scheme doesn&#x27;t. Python doesn&#x27;t have them, but it just as easily could.<p>So is the condition system more like macros or more like multiple namespaces?')
