The rate of development is insane I find, you can just bang out straight forward easy to read code and everything you&#x27;d ever need to write a web API is there in the standard library.<p>Where I work we&#x27;ve shipped Go APIs using just the standard library running on like 1&#x2F;10 of the hardware we were using in the .NET (not core) world and handling 10,000s requests per second. Perhaps that was just because we had really old shitty .NET code though.')
