Due to its architecture, there are difficult to change internal limits on how PostgreSQL samples the data.<p>Under some conditions, it is not possible for the sampling mechanics to build a representative model -- the actual statistics used for query planning will be quasi-random. One of the ways this manifests is that every time you rebuild the statistics you get a completely different statistical model even if the data has barely changed.')
