The classic &quot;memorize how to bubblesort&quot; interview questions which so many people complain about because they don&#x27;t show anything except that someone has prepared? Isn&#x27;t it better to just look over the code of applicants and check if they are aware of general structures etc?<p>Obviously some familiarity with algorithms etc is required and it should be checked if that&#x27;s there, but with tests you can&#x27;t really test if someone understands the bigger picture and did not just memorize the answer. I know more than enough people who can solve problems just fine but their code is absolutely atrocious and I&#x27;d never hire them. Interviews where one can ask them why they write code the way they do are probably far more effective.')
