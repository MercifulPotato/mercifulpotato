Making an expert level understanding of CS a requirement to verify your voting system means that Joe Q. Average who doesn&#x27;t hold a PhD (or maybe even a college degree) has to rely on spooky experts telling him what to believe.  If I were in his shoes then I would have no confidence that I participated in a fair and valid election.<p>We kind of live in a bubble here on HN where most people are sort of in the tech space and could take a weekend or two to understand blockchain.  I think its easy to forget that most people don&#x27;t have the required background to learn it easily (or would want to use up their time to understand it).  I almost have a PhD in the hard sciences and I don&#x27;t fully understand the finer details of block chain.
