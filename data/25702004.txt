The unmodified virus spike protein is stable only when attached to the protein shell of the virus. These people worked on methods, on how to modify the spike protein so that when it&#x27;s released alone, without the rest of the virus, it still keeps the same shape and form as when attached to the virus. If you just used to original protein sequence without the rest of the virus, the spike protein would fold into different 3D-shape, and would not work as an antigen. Without this work, the vaccine would not work.<p>Katalin Karik√≥ invented how to &quot;mask&quot; this foreign mRNA, so human cells accept and use it for protein synthesis. Whereas usually human body attacks foreign RNA vigorously.<p>The there is the part, where mRNA is packed inside tiny fat bubbles, so it can be transported into human tissue and cells. I think we still haven&#x27;t seen a submission about this technology here?')
