My house is TOWN 632-3 but not 丁目 番 号 anything. There is a 6丁目32番3号 in our city which is _not_ my house. This lead one night to me driving across town to pick up a lost friend.<p>Our house was in a development soon post war which for ages was surrounded by nothing but rice paddies. We&#x27;ve had a couple online shops which assume we&#x27;re missing portions of our address. Overall though I like havinng only two numbers. Makes me feel like I own a whole town block.')
