Item(by='adventured', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605687707, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25133942, text='&gt; PRC can either fire and also lose a few cities, or not fire and be ignored.<p>That&#x27;s unlikely to be the scenario. The big problem for China is that they&#x27;re responsible for the current North Korea regime existing. China has been directly, intentionally propping up and protecting North Korea from day one. The American people will not find it acceptable to exchange Pyongyang for Los Angeles or New York, much less trade several of North Korea&#x27;s cities for several major US cities.<p>The American public would demand a nuclear strike against China in retaliation, a more equitable outcome - Shanghai for Los Angeles, Beijing for New York - for those ultimately responsible for what North Korea is today.<p>That&#x27;s where hundreds of millions of people could die from a North Korean strike. It&#x27;s why China should have never enabled and tolerated the Kim regime in the first place, and now it&#x27;s too late to fix that historic blunder. Any nuclear strike from North Korea will likely result in a nuclear strike against China.<p>This is equivalent to the Israeli Samson option (which is why you don&#x27;t want Iran getting nukes).<p>If the US goes down - eg loses its top 30 cities - why shouldn&#x27;t it take every Chinese and Russian city with it? Try convincing the American public to not want revenge against anyone that has ever assisted North Korea.')
