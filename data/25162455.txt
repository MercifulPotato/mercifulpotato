I&#x27;ve thought that it may be a reasonable business to offer a service to owners of popular GitHub repos to somehow get started with this business model. Anyone who quits maintaining popular OSS in rage (as has happened a few times) stands to gain more by simply changing the license and then charging non-OSS users in the future.<p>Edit: Thanks for the comments explaining. I was unaware of the barriers to this path.')
