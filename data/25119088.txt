I was concerned about the heat in Pasadena and the piles of snow in Boston (silly me. why don&#x27;t Ivy&#x27;s relocate someplace nice like Hawaii?). I aced the math SAT-I section without studying and was in GATE and NMS. Instead, I went to a top 50 public state research uni (that became a party school just as I got there) because it was a sure thing. I think I learned more and developed more initiative because it was so sink-or-swim, and the standards were high and the assistance was low. I even hustled an undergrad paid research gig in a top security lab to fix grad students&#x27; and postdocs&#x27; network code that looked like spaghetti after being pur√©ed in a blender.')
