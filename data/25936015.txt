Imagine suddenly thousands of people are doing this and now Discord is being flooded with reports.<p>-<p>Something some people might not know as well, there was another WSB Discord started by Jartek that used to be linked on the subreddit<p>That Discord was much more tame even with minimal moderation. No racial or homophobic slurs, but still allowing most if not all content people wanted to bring up short of porn...<p>Post scandal the subreddit changed back to this Discord, which was a mistake. It really was a vile server.<p>-<p>Edit because now I&#x27;m rate limited over vindicating downvotes from people mourning that dumpster :)<p>Crazy how every direct reply to me has needed <i>someone else</i> to correct them. I guess my comment was coherent enough for people not foaming at the mouth to cry over some racist dumpster fire of a server...<p>-<p>Again, there were two servers<p>One was linked in the subreddit, had minimal moderation, policed really <i>hard</i> slurs like ni*er, allowed shitposting all you wanted otherwise.<p>That one gained traction while WSBGod&#x27;s saga was going on.<p>-<p>The one I referenced <i>which is the one deleted today</i>, where mods were throwing n bombs for fun, was mostly regarded as an embarrassing weird place people might stumble upon from Google.<p>You couldn&#x27;t even find it easily, someone had to invite you directly and some of them weirdly saw those invites as a favor (that&#x27;s how I was invited there, someone liked one of my DDs in the main server and thought they were inviting me to sit with the cool kids... right.)<p>It wasn&#x27;t tied to the subreddit and referred to itself as the &quot;OG Discord&quot; because it existed before the subreddit officially tied itself to a discord server.<p>-<p>Jartek&#x27;s &quot;saga&quot; took place, and because he had created the well regarded Discord server the link was replaced with one to the outright vile server.<p>Today the outright vile one was banned.<p>Good riddance.')
