Money launderers don&#x27;t want to lose dirty money any more than anyone else wants to lose clean money. They depend on there being a buyer at a price near what they paid. I suppose you could have a market that was <i>so</i> full of money launderers that they simply depend on flipping it to the next money launderer, but ordinarily, they depend on there being at least some proportion of locals who will pay the new, higher price, or they aren&#x27;t guaranteed a buyer.')
