There&#x27;s a bunch of different Bayesian models for protein structure - as an example, I implemented a model for structural changes in evolution for my master&#x27;s thesis<p>The big challenge for these kind of models is the curse of dimensionality. Since every atom in the structure can potentially interact with every other atom, it&#x27;s tricky to make a joint distribution for the entire sequence and it&#x27;s rare to have a model that&#x27;s both accurate and parallelizable, so the field hasn&#x27;t benefitted much from the advances in for instance GPU computing')
