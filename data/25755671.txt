Perhaps St Benedict had missed the note of &quot;Rules Making 101&quot;, never make up any rules that cannot and impossible to be followed.<p>As I mentioned in my other comments where God in the Quran has exposed and cautioned the monks (in Chapter &quot;Hadid&quot; or &quot;Iron&quot;) who were not observing their own made up rules during their monastic period seeking God&#x27;s good pleasure, for the exercise of monasticsm that were not originally prescribed or enjoined in their own God&#x27;s scriptures, oh the irony! Pardon the pun :-)')
