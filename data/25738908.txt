Most Middle East countries don&#x27;t even pretend to be democracies - Israel actually is. And yet it is singled out for hate again and again.<p>&gt;  Israeli law explicitly says that only Jews have the right to national self determination<p>That&#x27;s a lie, the law doesn&#x27;t say that. The law says Jews have the right to national self-determination in their national state - Israel. It doesn&#x27;t say it is the only case possible of national self-determination, neither could it - how would Israel possibly make law for all other nations in existence?! Just as Japanese have it in Japan, Koreans - in Korea, Swiss - in Switzerland, and Mongolians - in Mongolia, Jews have their national state in Israel. That doesn&#x27;t mean a Jew in Mongolia or Korean in Switzerland do not have human rights - but it does mean Korea would have Korean and not Mongolian as state language, and that people of Japanese descent may have easier time to get Japanese citizenship than people of French descent. Presenting this completely common occurrence as something exceptional and a proof of &quot;racism&quot; - all the while many other countries around it literally run violent ethnic and religious cleansing, murder their own citizens for &quot;blasphemy&quot; or being gay or wearing wrong dress - with absolutely no complaint from the likes of you, and singling out Israel for exclusion for completely routine and accepted practices among many nations... I can&#x27;t really decide if it&#x27;s Antisemitism or plain idiocy, neither do I care. It just another proof that censorious hate for free speech, and willful ignorance often walk hand in hand. You are literally ok to destroy everybody who you think - scratch that, who your feed on twitter, prepared for you by your betters, told you - are &quot;bad&quot;, without even trying to understand. And then you pretend you&#x27;re some kind of enlightened being...')
