If I sent a change like this at work, no matter how trivial, that said it fixed this bug but I didn&#x27;t send any tests, the reviewer would reject it out of hand or, probably, just silently ignore my change. But that&#x27;s the real problem here. This program is a monograph. There are no reviewers and there are, consequently, no standards.')
