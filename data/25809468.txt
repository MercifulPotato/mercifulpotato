These jobs would be a lot different without IP law. They might be payed less and be done less, or maybe not. If they are payed less, it&#x27;s true probably they wouldn&#x27;t be as prolific. But they would still exist, it&#x27;s disingenuous to claim IP law is a requirement for creative endeavors.<p>As a matter of fact, programming already works as if IP law didn&#x27;t exist from the point of view of many programmers.I&#x27;m hired by a company to produce a product, in exchange for a salary. I don&#x27;t know any IP that I might produce as a result of my work. I&#x27;m simply paid for my time. Could (as an example) novel writers be payed for the time spent writing a book rather than as a function of the sales of their books? I see not logistical reason why not. Maybe the market won&#x27;t bear many writers under those conditions... But they would still exist, right?<p>Note: I think Trademark law is really good. And patents have issues but they are mostly good. I&#x27;m only talking about copyright here. I&#x27;m not entirely against the concept of IP, but I do think copyright law is not nearly as critical as it&#x27;s made out to be. Maybe the optimal solution is weak copyright rather than no copyright, but I think it&#x27;s important to understand that no copyright is not as crazy as it sounds.')
