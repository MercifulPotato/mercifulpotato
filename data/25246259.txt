The premise that everyone is benefiting is false. A tremendous amount of people are in industries that are shuttered, communities that are withering, locations that are in decline, or otherwise not &#x27;getting better&#x27;.<p>2. The proper basis for comparison for the iterative generation of wealth and productivity isn&#x27;t the past, it&#x27;s the reasonable alternatives at the same time in development.<p>Imagine you and I start with 100 coins each.<p>In Scenario A, I take 30 of your coins. Then we fight each other and fritter away 10 coins each. Then our respective coin volume doubles. I end up with 240 coins. You end up with 120. We&#x27;re both better off than in the past. In total, we have 360 coins.<p>In Scenario B, I steal all your coins. Without any coins, you can&#x27;t fight me, so neither of us loses any further coins. Our coin volume doubles. I end up with 400 coins.<p>In Scenario C, I don&#x27;t steal your coins and because we&#x27;re not busy fighting each other, no losses occur. We both end up with 200 coins. In total we have 400 coins.<p>I think the lesson here is self evident, and that&#x27;s without raising the fact that growth slows and societies collapse due to wealth disparities. If the simple thought experiment isn&#x27;t enough and you&#x27;d like something a bit more involved, read up on the history and philosophy surrounding our transition away from the feudal system. Our distaste of titled hereditary privilege was very well deserved.')
