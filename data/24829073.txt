Here&#x27;s what we have learned over the last 10+ years:<p>1) Learn to advocate for yourself. One wise doctor told us &quot;we&#x27;re all just guessing&quot;.  I don&#x27;t know exactly what you are dealing with, but do your own research and seek out health practitioners that are on the leading edge of that community.\n2) Learn your &quot;dose&quot;. Every body is unique and has its own limits. There is no &quot;normal&quot; with chronic illness\n3) Trust your gut. Remember that the struggle is real.  There are a lot of doubters, questioners, and &quot;helpful&quot; people.  You know what is best for your body.\n4) Seek out a community of faith&#x2F;meditation&#x2F;prayer&#x2F;therapy&#x2F;etc. Dealing with Chronic illness is often more mental than physical.')
