Item(by='sharker8', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611767963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25930171, text='They should be sent to pasture at month seven, destined to live out the natural lifespan of a cow and die a rather unremarkable and dignified death of old age, having grazed upon the fields and enriched its soil with their manure.  They can also be used for humane harvesting of methane.  They should, of course, be spayed and neutered as well, and children can pay to pet their cute noses and dress them up in funny costumes during holiday season.  This suggestion is not the advice of some militant vegan (on the contrary, I am but a lowly flexitarian, who believes that most animal products are destined for the wastebin of history), nay I am but a hopeful wandering utilitarian, who happened to alight upon this most recurrent and delectable of controversies.')
