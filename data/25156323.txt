It started adding bitmaps after a while, I wanna say in the Flash 5 era? It&#x27;s been a long time and I&#x27;ve deliberately put a lot of my time with Flash in the mental vault, as it was also mostly time working under John K.<p>Anyway. I spent a lot of time hand-optimizing autotraces of scans of ink drawings, and even more time moving them around in sync to dialogue. Flash was very much about sending compact vector representations over your 28.8kbaud modem connection and moving them around instead of sending anything like what we would call a video stream, until they added the FLV format and YouTube happened.')
