Item(by='sjwright', descendants=None, kids=[25984094], score=None, time=1612136996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25979043, text='&gt; I’m not necessarily disagreeing with your overall point, but when you say “weak” are you still speaking in the physical sense?<p>Obviously I was not—otherwise I would have been entertaining a direct logical contradiction.<p>I am speaking in the terms offered by the user <i>klipt</i> earlier in this conversation tree. This is how dangerous rhetoric is formed. To call someone &quot;weak&quot;, no matter how much you qualify its meaning, inevitably leads to many other subjective connotations that I do not agree with.<p>&gt; To not seems to be the type of wordsmithing used to avoid precise use of language.<p>On the contrary, it&#x27;s the type of wordsmithing used to avoid <i>intentional misapplication</i> of language.<p>&gt; I think the BJJ argument can actually be dangerous. Yes, it’s good for anyone to know self defense. But the vast majority of women won’t become skillful enough to overcome the (statistical) innate size&#x2F;strength disadvantage, particularly any man with training. They can if dedicated enough, but if they don’t it can lead to false confidence.<p>I think it&#x27;s borderline offensive to assume that the &quot;vast majority of women&quot; won&#x27;t become &quot;skillful enough&quot;.<p>I think it&#x27;s borderline offensive to suggest that building up confidence is a dangerous idea. Even &quot;false confidence&quot; can increase one&#x27;s actual physical power. And to say that a policy is dangerous because it won&#x27;t be effective in all encounters is ridiculous.<p>It seems you misunderstand the purpose of having broad BJJ training. It&#x27;s not just about increasing skill. It&#x27;s not just about increasing confidence (which for many women might be itself sufficient to stop an attack). Rather it&#x27;s about the culture that would arise among MEN in response to a society where women have more confidence—whether objectively justified or not.<p>&gt; you instead advocated for a double standard...<p>I did no such thing and I consider it highly offensive for you to imply that I did.')
