And while this is absolutely one of those Totally Subjective YMMV Works For Me May Suck For You deals, for me it&#x27;s been far more hit than miss.<p>(I have some experience with Tidal, which also has apparently human-curated lists but they haven&#x27;t at all at Apple&#x27;s level. My experience with Spotify wasn&#x27;t good, but it was also <i>really</i> limited, because it just didn&#x27;t offer anything obvious over Apple Music to me -- the reverse is almost certainly true for someone who&#x27;s already deeply invested in Spotify, though!)')
