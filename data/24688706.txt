If you added a feature and then ten commits to fix typos on top of it, just squash it into the original one and pretend like it was right all along. It keeps the repository sane and not full of “typo fix” commits, and, like, I don’t really mind looking for a change in a diff that is 20 lines instead of a dozen that are one.')
