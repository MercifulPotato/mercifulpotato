If your company is just starting out then buy everything if possible - your competitive edge is the fact you&#x27;re small and nimble. You can respond to market changes faster than the established companies can. Over time you&#x27;ll recognize what are to become your <i>Systems of Differentiation</i> and then and only then should you consider building that yourself. When you&#x27;re starting out you typically don&#x27;t have the time or capital to wait and build the software you may need. For such companies doing business and generating revenue <i>now</i> is more important than having a perfect application portfolio. And yes, this is why systems are never as perfect and pristine as developers would hope.')
