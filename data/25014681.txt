I want to write code without knowing anything about your API before I start.   That said, I absolutely understand the appeal if you&#x27;re writing the client and the server, and don&#x27;t care about your API users.<p>Edit: Since I got a bunch of questions that seemed to be the same.  The few times I&#x27;ve used a graphQL API i was expected to know which attributes I was requesting per object, instead of just getting them all and figuring it out later.  That was my main concern. I want to find an endpoint, get a list of objects without knowing what will be in them and start throwing stuff at it. I usually do this in python using jupyter, so when I&#x27;m finished exploring I have working code that just needs to be refactored a bit to fit into wherever it&#x27;s going to go. \n For me, this workflow is usually faster than even finding the documentation on most systems.<p>But yeah i apologize for my early morning crankiness, I was really complaining about a few specific implementations of GraphQL that I found frustrating.  And to be fair these specific companies I&#x27;m thinking about also had annoying REST&#x2F;SOAP APIs  in the past and are now touting GraphQL as a sort of silver bullet.')
