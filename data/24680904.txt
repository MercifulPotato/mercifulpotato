Item(by='cblconfederate', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601834355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670746, text='I got a distribution from a computer  magazine that was hastily packaged. It was a CDrom of a version of linux that runs under DOS with LOADLIN, had a filesystem called umsdos that s basically FAT (fat32?) with extra files for metadata. Unfortunately it seems the distribution didn&#x27;t fit in the magazines&#x27; CDROM so they left out some directories, crucially &#x2F;usr&#x2F;man so most of the man pages were missing. It wasnt a linux magazine so there were absolutely no instructions.I didnt have internet access so it was impossible to figure out what to do. All the commands i could figure out were &quot;cd&quot; and &quot;more&quot;  and &quot;dir&quot; (it was aliased to ls as i found out later). I somehow ended up finding some README files and similar and over time learned the basics. The rest is far less exciting to remember.')
