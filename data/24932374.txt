Ethereum introduces a concept called an “EVM” (like JVM) which is used on several more platforms that arent called Ethereum, so you should be familiar with that.<p>Oh! You also dont need to be distracted by:<p>“Consensus model ideology”<p>“I could use a database for this”<p>or any other self limiting thing.<p>because “you could also make money”<p>Lets be honest you were probably going to work for some ad tech startup anyway, all crypto projects have just as little utility for the world while possibly having the argument for much more utility, and you dont have to pretend like you are an investor that wont get zeroed out by VC liquidity preferences')
