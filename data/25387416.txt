In comparison to Protractor it&#x27;s an absolute god send and so much easier. The documentation for Cypress is pretty good IMO. I love that when you use should(&#x27;be.visible&#x27;) etc it&#x27;ll continuously retry until the timeout as it makes your tests so much less flakey.<p>There&#x27;s a couple of annoyances still:\n - I hate that some things are wrapped in JQueryLike and then other times they&#x27;re not. \n - I still hate that there&#x27;s async&#x2F;await magic and wish we could stop it for e2e testing and just be explicit so I know what is or isn&#x27;t going to be magic.')
