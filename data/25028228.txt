I set up one project with autotools a few years back and the experience was horrible: lots of weird incantations, obfuscated syntax, piles of m4 macros to do what feel like straightforward things, and just a general feeling that I was being forced to learn obtuse technologies  for basically no purpose.<p>Cmake isn’t always the easiest thing either but it’s a vast improvement over autotools.')
