If that was true, Amazon would have the data to back it up and would only benefit them to say so.<p>If we want to know the actual number of items that go to landfill, we don&#x27;t need to send GPS trackers everywhere, we can just mandate Amazon (and all other companies) to report on that. It&#x27;s not like they don&#x27;t have the data.')
