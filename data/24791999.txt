But it&#x27;s hard, really hard. Like all distributed systems.<p>CRDTs are far from a panacea:<p>* No implementation is compatible with another<p>* There is very few implementation in languages that are not JS.<p>* The biggest problem is when 2 documents are diverging for too much time (think a blockchain fork) like if you go offline for 4 days while your coworker work on the same document as you do. You have to come back to differential sync, like Git.<p>And it&#x27;s just for sync, then to move to P2P you have to handle NAT traversals, distributed identities, rendez-vous places and much more.')
