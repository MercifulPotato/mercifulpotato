There are lots of American city neighborhoods where EVs will be inaccessible without street-side charging.<p>In response to GP, I definitely expect the US government to take a lead on building charging infrastructure (especially with a federal administration that doesn&#x27;t actively dismiss climate change). A failure to demonstrate competence building green infrastructure in the next few years will quite possibly lead me to seek greener pastures elsewhere (EU). Thankfully San Francisco included charging infrastructure and street-side charging in its 2019 EV roadmap [1].<p>That said, public transit is by far the better green tech. But since private vehicles won&#x27;t be going away overnight, might as well transition them to something cleaner.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jan&#x2F;22&#x2F;electric-vehicles-close-to-tipping-point-of-mass-adoption" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jan&#x2F;22&#x2F;electric...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfmta.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;reports-and-documents&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;evroadmap_final_june2019.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfmta.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;reports-and-docume...</a>')
