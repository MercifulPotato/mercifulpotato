Tech companies have demonstrated a very clear liberal bias (which in itself isn&#x27;t a bad thing necessarily).  However by removing&#x2F;censoring content they are actually legitimizing it because people don&#x27;t see these companies as a neutral third party but rather a biased dictator of information.<p>I have distant family that has bought into the conspiracy theories.
