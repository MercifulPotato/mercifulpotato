Consider the polynomial $x^2 + C$ for $C \\approx 0$. Are all of its roots real or complex? The problem is that even a very small change in C, maybe caused by rounding errors, can easily change a root from real to not real.<p>C \\approx 0?<p>The imaginary parts in the first bug are nowhere close to zero.')
