This is only possible because of math that was developed three years ago.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;technocrypto&#x2F;status&#x2F;1330150362427387910" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;technocrypto&#x2F;status&#x2F;1330150362427387910</a><p>In proof of stake, mining equipment and electricity consumption is replaced by the cryptocurrency itself.
