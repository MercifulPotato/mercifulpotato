I do use it for things like taking a screenshot and marking it up, and sketching out design ideas whiteboard-style. It works great for that, although most of the time I just use it as a conventional ThinkPad laptop.<p>In fact when I use the pen it is usually with the display hinge in &quot;laptop&quot; mode, not flipped all the way around to tablet mode.<p>Either way, as long as you have the software support you need, the hardware works great. It is both a touchscreen and a Wacom tablet with pressure sensitivity. At least the pressure sensing works in native Windows apps - web app support has been more spotty.<p>For annotating PDF files, I guess you would need Acrobat Pro? Or would you use some other software?')
