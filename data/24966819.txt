I speak as a person who has repeatedly lost money in real estate. Real estate is hardly a slam-dunk guaranteed money making machine, as plenty of people in 2008 will attest to. It&#x27;s a tough business. Just looking at the winners is called confirmation bias.<p>That doesn&#x27;t really prove your point.
