Item(by='ci5er', descendants=None, kids=[24900457], score=None, time=1603738444, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899575, text='1) I have for a long time. Now with Kindles, I don&#x27;t have to load 10 paperbacks into my computer bag every time I go on a global jaunt. A lot of time in airplanes and hotels gives you a lot of time for this (on average - which is why I said &quot;per week&quot;, not &quot;per day&quot;). But, most under 250 page non-fiction books can be polished off in less than two hours. A lot of people spend two-hours&#x2F;day watching some Netflix movie - this is the same thing.<p>2) I guess the ones that are based on subjective interpretation instead of objective fact (whatever that is today). There is a book called &quot;How we know what isn&#x27;t so&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;How-Know-What-Isnt-Fallibility-dp-0029117062&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0029117062&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;How-Know-What-Isnt-Fallibility-dp-002...</a>), and it talks a fair amount about humans can clash by developing different interpretations of reality that they think are really real. I guess this isn&#x27;t &quot;touchy-feely&quot;; I guess it is just that the reason I got into engineering is that machines are a lot more predictable and understandable than humans (to me). I did not mean to denigrate anyone&#x27;s choice of book; I just didn&#x27;t have a better term at hand (I still don&#x27;t!)')
