It is a good thing that women can leave relationships where they&#x27;re being mistreated and be better off on their own, but it means we need to rethink designs elsewhere in society that were based on the assumption that they wouldn&#x27;t.<p>I agree with you about the village mindset, and it&#x27;s kind of the most robust option. Even ignoring divorce, a parent can be emotionally incompetent at caring for children, and certainly can be called to work (or fight) elsewhere, can get sick and&#x2F;or die, etc. We should be ensuring children have multiple backup options if their own parents are unavailable for whatever reason.')
