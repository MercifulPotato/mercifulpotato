I&#x27;ve switched from Ubuntu to Manjaro a few months ago and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever look back. Latest kernel and Gnome version make a huge difference in performance and stability (that was the main reason I switched, Ubuntu desktop kept breaking for some reason) and Pacman is a dream. I used to just apt update everything, which was nice, but now with snaps you don&#x27;t know what you get and you sometimes need to download some deb or add a repo. Pacman has everything (when enabling AUT) and I haven&#x27;t even touched the terminal for it, because the UI is so good.<p>You should give it a shot :)')
