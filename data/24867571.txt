Undervolting is simply finding the lowest voltage your unit can stably work at.<p>The only result of undervolting on modern CPUs is lower temperature; performance actually goes up as the processor still aims to hit its set TDP&#x2F;TPL limits.<p>Lower voltage = higher clocks for longer on all Intel CPUs that can be undervolted. I believe it&#x27;s the same for new AMDs, but I haven&#x27;t had the chance to test one.<p>You&#x27;re basically fine tuning your pet rock - some silicon is higher quality and can do better than the stock voltages that were set for thousands&#x2F;millions of units out of the factory.')
