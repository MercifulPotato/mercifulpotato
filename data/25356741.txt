For example, will having near real-time updates of other people&#x27;s location be worth $X&#x2F;mo? Heck, yes. Should you charge for one-off manual checks? Probably not.<p>So, have a manual and automatic modes. With manual, if I want to know what my friend is, I have to tap a button and it will ask the relay to ask the friend&#x27;s phone for its location. Cap this to, say, 1 request a minute and give this away for free. Then add an automatic mode whereby the relay will automatically poll my peers for their location. Charge for this. Also allow <i>very easily</i> enabling this mode for a fixed period of time, say, just 24 hours or 1 month or allow subscribing to it. This will take care of people who need to track someone&#x27;s location only occasionally. Charge more for this (or, alternatively, give massive discounts to those who subscribe).<p>Next, have tiers on how often updates are collected. 1 minute, near real-time, etc. Price accordingly.<p>Next, cap the length of the peer list that people can have for free.<p>Next, on the server side retain only the last update by default, but allow retaining full (or extended) history. Charge for this, charge to the _consumer_ of this information.<p>Next, allow people organizing themselves into groups, with every one sharing their location with everyone else. Charge for that, charge it to the group owner.<p>Next, allow groups to have a &quot;star&quot; topology - all members reporting to a single &quot;admin&quot; user. This is now getting into the enterprise-ish use, so you&#x27;d probably want to have a &quot;managed&quot; version of the software that will have all UI locked down. This will also jive nicely with the history retention.<p>Next, add a separate management&#x2F;admin software for herding group installs. Alternatively, offer an option of using a web interface in exchange for relinquishing the privacy.<p>...<p>I mean it&#x27;s not that hard :) Start small, solving one specific need of a specific user group at a time and then extend logically.')
