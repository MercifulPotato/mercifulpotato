It&#x27;s a cool idea and I can see useful functions, but not pushed up against a place where you&#x27;re typing. I am constantly bringing up Siri or changing volume when hitting numbers, -= or delete from a finger swiping across the touch bar accidentally. There used to be a tactile force needed to activate F key functions, but now there&#x27;s just a capacitive touch bar.')
