Iterating on a architecture is harder than starting one from scratch. If the software market moves  to ARM and there&#x27;s bigger opportunities on the laptop&#x2F;desktop side, it will attract other players in the high performance market.\nUntil now there was very little incentive due to the lack of software on mainstream operating systems (microsoft learnt this the hard way). Linux market on laptop an desktop has been way too small to attract big investments in the area.\nAfter x86 is not dead, AMD is competing pretty well with their Zen architecture. It will be interesting to see what the next iteration will bring in term of power consumption and performance.<p>I also wonder if being an SOC with integrated memory helps the M1 in term of performance (I guess it must improve data access latency). It might push competitors to build high performance SOC.')
