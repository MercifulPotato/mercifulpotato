I have a bunch of Matlab code I&#x27;m needing to refresh and honestly I could go either to Python or Julia. Python is more mature, but Julia doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s going to die or anything.<p>I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time to look into it but my hunch is it would be magnificent to code numerical routines in Julia and access them from Python. There was some work for adding that sort of an interface with octave but it never seemed to work well.')
