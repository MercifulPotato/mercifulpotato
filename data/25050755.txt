It was a running gag towards the end.<p>Considering that I come from a third world nation where the cops often pull members of my community aside for searches and special checks, the British police force for all their faults are a breath of fresh air. I&#x27;ve been exactly in that spot, with police using surveillance data and national ID data to arrest protestors and put them under false charges. I&#x27;ve personally almost been arrested for no reason except for 1.) walking in the night alone and 2.) walking at night in suspicious clothing (i.e. T-shirt and shorts).')
