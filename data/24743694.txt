I had no idea), a couple calling me a &quot;beta&quot; and questioning my testosterone levels (why is that a thing?) and one that declared I was obviously a lizard person. All of them had positive karma but we&#x27;re removed by mods, days later, so I can&#x27;t quote them directly.<p>The internet is just mean, to everyone. I feel like with the negative karma on all this ladies unpleasant comments she really didn&#x27;t get it that bad.')
