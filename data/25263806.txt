A lot of the tech that has been going into the ITER design didn&#x27;t exist 30 years ago! They didn&#x27;t anticipate developments in super conductors but this is by no means a 90s machine built 30 years too late.<p>Part of the role of ITER was to fund the research to develop the reactor&#x27;s components while giving everyone a concrete goal to work towards. The challenge with ITER is much more than construction.')
