Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604683693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25007697, text='&gt; I live in a &quot;Top 10 most dangerous cities in the U.S.&quot;<p>Become batman. That might help.<p>&gt; However, this causes a brain drain and leave the city in a worse place.<p>The narcissistic ego. It&#x27;s not &quot;brain drain&quot;, it&#x27;s jobs. You can have wonderful cities full of factory&#x2F;maintenance&#x2F;etc workers. I&#x27;m going to bet that a city&#x27;s quality is tied to the citizens&#x27; financial security and physical security.<p>As for what you can do? Nothing. Cities improve with capital investment&#x2F;systematic top-down focus, not via individuals who watch too many marvel movies. You are not going to bring crime down, you are not going to bring jobs in, you are not going to rebuild the city.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t want to do that, I want to uplift if I can.<p>Oh my god. People need jobs&#x2F;financial security. Not some virtue signaling techie from HN trying to &quot;uplift&quot; them.<p>Just live your life, who do you think you are? If naive attention-seeking idealist saved cities, all the cities in the country would be thriving. But they are not. Figure it out.')
