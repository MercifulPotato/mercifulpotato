You might need to select a different model which is &quot;close&quot; to get optimal output and&#x2F;or experiment a bit.<p>Scanning is more difficult to tell but it may well work using SANE&#x27;s AirScan driver, called eSCL as it looks like this model supports AirScan&#x2F;AirPrint scanning. This shouldn&#x27;t need the proprietary drivers as I understand it. The next models up (MFC-273x and higher) look like they support scanning and saving directly to an FTP server or CIFS&#x2F;SMB share on your network which wouldn&#x27;t need a driver so that might be a more surefire option.')
