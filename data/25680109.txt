So maybe arrests will happen on Friday.<p>That arrests didn&#x27;t happen _on the spot_ in a case like this is utterly bizarre. Arrests happen on the spot for stupider things like people partying on a parking lot and someone trying to hide or run away when the police show up to stop the noise or responding to a breaking and entering.<p>I know of cases were actual hostages were taken or shots fired or things lit on fire, and it took the DA and the police three days to actually show up at a guys house to arrest him. His identity was all over the newspapers.')
