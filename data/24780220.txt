If you missed an episode or missed the entire week, you could always buy the latest issue of Soap Opera Digest which would have a summary of the week (or month&#x27;s) story arc. Once a year or so, there would be magazines which would summarize the entire story arc of the show so new viewers could catch up. On a side note, if anyone is bored at work today, look up the Wikipedia entry for a long-running soap, like Days of Our Lives, which will have a synopsis of the entire story. It&#x27;s quite epic, silly, and tawdry with a decades-long, no-breaks, no-jumps storyline.<p>I think for prime time viewing, Hill Street Blues was the first semi-serialized drama intended for viewers outside of the soap market. It had an interesting structure with A, B, and C plots. A plot gets resolved in a single episode. B plot is a 3-4 episode arc. And C plot lasts for the season. And then there was continuity from season to season. The show was decently successful, and paved the way for what we have now. One thing I find interesting is how many older viewers at the time thought it was too fast paced, too complex, and didn&#x27;t enjoy it. They were too conditioned to the episodic norms. I&#x27;m sure the show would seem slow now to modern binge watchers.')
