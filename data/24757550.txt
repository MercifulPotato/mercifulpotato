It really shows that COVID-19 has been politicised so much that people can&#x27;t debate on the topic anymore in good faith, because nobody wants to admit that they might have been wrong. Especially people like Donald Trump make a scientific debate extremely difficult, because he has been undermining the virus from the beginning and even if science was to find that the virus was less dangerous than initially thought many scientists, especially those who had public exposure, wouldn&#x27;t want to support&#x2F;admit an idea which could play into Trump&#x27;s favour. The whole thing is just a bloody mess.<p>&gt; Nobody seems to seriously doubt that at some point almost all humans will be exposed to the virus.<p>Unfortunately there are many people who really believe we can eliminate the virus through strict measures. Just read many responses here on Hacker News and you&#x27;ll find plenty of those people.')
