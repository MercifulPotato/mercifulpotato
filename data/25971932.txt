ICANN very much introduces a single point of failure that could wipe out the internet if it were disrupted.<p>It could be replaced, but it would take years.  In many ways, cert authorities are more decentralized than ICANN.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say we shouldn&#x27;t worry about these single points of failure, rather, I think it&#x27;s just an exaggeration of QUIC&#x27;s impacts on decentralization.')
