You’re not required to disclose on your resume that the MSc was earned virtually. Also with most learning being virtual this year anyway, you’d be in the same boat as anyone else. All of this is to say someone reviewing your resume doesn’t necessarily have to know it was an online program unless they explicitly ask you.<p>I’d love to learn more about what you’re trying to get out of a masters and whether you could get the same thing by working professionally for 2 years.')
