Item(by='gopalv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611857639, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25945750, text='&gt; The round steering wheel looks good and works nicely.<p>This is of course an anecdote, but I&#x27;m too tall to sit in a Model 3 and drive it without having my knuckles bump into my knees.<p>Of course, I should probably buy a Model Y, but a rectangular one (or even a flat bottom one) would great for me for most of the freeway driving.<p>Though, that might be a unique requirement because I learned to drive stick shifts in India with one hand on the wheel on a Brodie knob, but I think something like that is much safer on a steer by wire rather than the old jeeps.')
