Because they <i>can’t</i> be, or because <i>you think</i> they aren’t used in that way?<p>I’ve been using an iPad for nearly 100% of my work over the past two years (until this summer, just a regular 9.7” iPad), and I know of developers who have been doing the same for at least nine years [1]. And these days it’s even more “general purpose”, being able to develop locally on the iPad with things like Play.js and Pythonista running locally. Blink on iPad even has a local shell built in, and of course pretty much all Android devices can drop to their local root shell too.<p>I guess you’re going to have to define what you mean by “general purpose computer” because pretty much every definition I find online includes smartphones and tablets [2][3][4]:<p>&gt; A general purpose computer is built to perform a variety of tasks, including the most frequent computing tasks, in a reasonably efficiently manner. It can store and execute multiple programs in its internal storage. Personal computers such as tablets, smartphones, notebooks and desktops are examples of general purpose computers.<p>The difference it <i>seems</i> like you’re making is that laptops are general purpose computers because <i>you want to define them that way</i>, and phones&#x2F;tablets are not, again, because that’s how you <i>want</i> to define it. So please, define what “general purpose” means and why your definition doesn’t match anyone else’s definition?<p>What do people get out of gatekeeping the most ridiculous things? Any iPad or Android tablet can install generic applications, browse the web, play games and music and video, do word processing, check email, store and retrieve arbitrary data, edit photos, connect to SSH... you know, <i>general purpose computing</i>. So again... what is the point of differentiating?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yieldthought.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;12239282034&#x2F;swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yieldthought.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;12239282034&#x2F;swapped-my-macbook...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reference.com&#x2F;world-view&#x2F;general-purpose-computer-52c09ca46a9e389" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reference.com&#x2F;world-view&#x2F;general-purpose-compute...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcmag.com&#x2F;encyclopedia&#x2F;term&#x2F;general-purpose-computer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcmag.com&#x2F;encyclopedia&#x2F;term&#x2F;general-purpose-comp...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;bitesize&#x2F;guides&#x2F;zkrr97h&#x2F;revision&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;bitesize&#x2F;guides&#x2F;zkrr97h&#x2F;revision&#x2F;1</a>')
