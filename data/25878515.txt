I made a little toy project for the EVM over a year ago with this exact concept, never really did anything with it sadly, life seems to find ways to get busy. Due to the nature of needing to send &#x27;gas&#x27; to make function calls, it was a natural fit to add a call to send a small portion of the value to an address before returning the computations result.<p>I really loved the idea of being able to create libraries of code that could just be called for a small fee or copied for free if one didn&#x27;t have the funds. I hope this idea continues to catch on, it seemed to me to be a perfect incentive fit for the open source world.')
