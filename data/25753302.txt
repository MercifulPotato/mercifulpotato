[1] This means even if you block 40% that remaining 60% that slipped by will overwhelm your medical infrastructure like what&#x27;s happening in Japan now who didn&#x27;t follow South Korea&#x27;s standards (out of pride? so many countries chose to ignore Taiwan and South Korea&#x27;s advices in the early days).<p>This is why you have extreme disparity between countries like Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam vs America, Europe, Japan.<p>40% doesn&#x27;t mean you are catching 40% of the viruses here. It means your detection is only at 40% capacity, like your vision.<p>I&#x27;m arguing for multiple PCR tests spread out over a few weeks to make up for this low accuracy. I doubt many people will put up with it like they did in South Korea or Taiwan. Especially North America where the individual rights come before the well being of society.<p>I actually thought that North American and Europe were anti-fragile, this virus quickly proved otherwise. How do you force individuals to comply with rules that is designed for the greater good when they&#x27;ve been told all their life their individual needs come first and the rest of society has to accommodate them?<p>Even getting people to wear masks is still an issue. I&#x27;m utterly disillusioned after 2020, the racist attacks from both sides of the political spectrum, the misinformation built upon centuries of stereotypes and exceptionalism, and a politically divided environment to boot.<p>As soon as we get more data on the vaccine&#x27;s effectiveness on dealing with mutation variants over 1 or 2 years, I am getting the fuck out of North America and taking all the jobs with me.<p>Because this isn&#x27;t the first pandemic and it sure as hell won&#x27;t be the last, and I highly doubt people will have learned their lesson. Conspiracy, memes, and other incompetent thinking that arises from laziness. People in North America and Europe have lived comfortably for a long time post-WW2, relying on economic hegemonies, military intervention, immigration to do the dirty work, and I believe they are in decline now. Sure America will remain #1 military superpower but front lines have simply shifted away from trenches to our minds where you can conquer and control how people think in foreign countries. This is what unrestricted warfare looks like and we are seeing the fruit of this labor to the delight of its enemies.<p>[1] I recall reading Dr. Feigl-Ding&#x27;s twitter last year which pointed to an American journal that cited this figure back in 2020 but I can&#x27;t find it right now.')
