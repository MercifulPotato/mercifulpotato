Poor battery life, 4lb+ laptops. There is no universe where that is &quot;fairly underpowered&quot; unless we&#x27;ve moved the goal posts to pretend that everyone is rolling with a GTX 3080 and anything less is unbearable. In the real world you have to go to the seriously compromised &quot;gaming&quot; tier to get better graphics performance.<p>&quot;but in terms of raw power it&#x27;s just not there&quot;<p>That depends upon what we define as the destination. It in no way competes with dedicated gaming rigs, as I made clear. Not by a huge margin. It isn&#x27;t going to be something a guy reviewing 300W, $1000 GPUs will care about. That isn&#x27;t the target market.<p>But the vast majority of people don&#x27;t having those gaming rigs. Laptops that have better GPUs are a _tiny_, minuscule component of the market. And if you actually use those dedicated GPUs, you&#x27;d better be plugged in.<p>So when we talk about &quot;gaming&quot; we get into a No True Scotsman thing (to repeat myself) where it isn&#x27;t gaming unless it&#x27;s someone playing Warzone at 120Hz at 4K. But a pretty heady number of users are doing things like Civilization, The Sims, Roblox, Minecraft, and similar gaming. The M1 can host that style of gaming with ease.<p>&quot;thanks mostly to TSMC&#x27;s 5nm process&quot;<p>It&#x27;s kind of interesting that we&#x27;re at this point. Apple has made a pretty capable GPU, stellar CPU cores, stellar inference cores, among other remarkable hardware. It was pretty stellar at 7nm too. It&#x27;s all being dismissed as the 5nm advantage. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s remotely so simple.')
