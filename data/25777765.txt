What&#x27;s being criticized is so-called &quot;rich linking&quot;, ie. previewing content such as Wikipedia articles from search engines or news articles from aggregators without taking viewers to the primary source&#x2F;site. People having a radical anti-copyright agenda have conveniently named this &quot;rich linking&quot; to dilute the discussion, as have news aggregators to downplay the issue.<p>As an aside, the way the EU copyright reform is being formulated into national law in Germany has been criticized as outright contrary to the whole purpose of the reform, and coming straight from pro-Google  lobbyists [1].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faz.net&#x2F;aktuell&#x2F;wirtschaft&#x2F;eu-urheberrechtsreform-deutschland-mach-google-ein-geschenk-17144734.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faz.net&#x2F;aktuell&#x2F;wirtschaft&#x2F;eu-urheberrechtsrefor...</a> (in German)')
