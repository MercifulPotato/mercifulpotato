At best it represents &quot;at least one network (~building) of 1-n visitors&quot;.  You could argue 0-n visitors (some sort of automation&#x2F;crawler).  It could also represent more than one network (a temporary IP obtained for less than a day, a IP obtained for a day that changes during your definition of a day).<p>User-agent reduces the scope, but doesn&#x27;t eliminate (between recommended evergreen updates and identically imaged&#x2F;uncustomized use of devices).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23668212" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23668212</a>')
