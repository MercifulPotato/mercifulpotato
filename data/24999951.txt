It&#x27;s obviously not working for a majority of businesses, or they would have adopted it. We just need to create an IPv7, which is just IPv4 with 64 bits of address space. I don&#x27;t get why this is such a hard concept for people to swallow. IPv4 works <i>fine</i>, we&#x27;re comfortable with it, we like it, let&#x27;s just make it bigger. We can even make the new system backwards compatible. 0.0.0.0.127.0.0.1 is still localhost, for example.<p>&quot;But that&#x27;s so hacky&quot;, you say. &quot;We need to fix the old standard.&quot; This is what Intel said with its Intel 64 Itanium processor. Break with the old instruction set and make it better. AMD came out with Opteron[1], a hacky extension of the x86 ISA but for 64 bit. Backwards compatible. Swept the market. It&#x27;s why your binaries are compiled to &quot;amd64&quot; now.<p>Yes, IPv4 has quirks, and those quirks are well understood and lots of code exists now to deal with them. Let&#x27;s not find out all the quirks of a new system the hard way for seemingly little benefit.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eweek.com&#x2F;pc-hardware&#x2F;64-bit-intel-vs.-amd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eweek.com&#x2F;pc-hardware&#x2F;64-bit-intel-vs.-amd</a>')
