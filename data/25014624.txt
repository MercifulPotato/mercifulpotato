And the GPL family of licenses is trying to get us there.<p>MIT and the like, while being good open source licences, allow anyone to break the chain and not release their code to the public. So it is good in terms of being open source and free&#x2F;libre now, but does do anything for the future, and does not do enough to bring about the vision of a fully free world.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d prefer the GPL licenses unless there&#x27;s an good reason not to.')
