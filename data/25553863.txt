I’m personally partial to FP, but I tend to work in languages where it’s not the dominant paradigm, and where throwing exceptions is more idiomatic than say Either types. For those cases, checked exceptions are much nicer than having no error handling semantics in the type system. At least if you generally know what kinds of error cases are likely you can guard against them.')
