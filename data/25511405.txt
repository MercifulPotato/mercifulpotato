There&#x27;s a very wide range of hard-to-predict outcomes, from total failure to massive wealth, with a lot of just-bumping-along-for-years scenarios. The value of money varies drastically over time. The people involved are generally novices. Labor and skill contributions are impossible to predict in advance. Social conventions and ties add more layers of difficulty. What everybody is doing is essentially buying lottery tickets. And any serious dispute resolution can be more expensive than makes sense early on.<p>So what the industry has mostly converged on is a pretty basic, simple-to-understand solution that has a small enough number of dials that people can work it. It covers the main outcomes reasonably well if people are not too terrible. And if people are terrible, well, no mechanism is really enough.')
