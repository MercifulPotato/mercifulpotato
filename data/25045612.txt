Item(by='01100011', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605014458, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25044192, text='You can obtain a Q-Switched laser off ebay for around $600 by purchasing one of the cheap &quot;tattoo removal&quot; machines.  Not a bad price I think.  Q-Switching is cool, but isn&#x27;t fast enough to produce the higher powers available from a mode-locked laser.  I&#x27;m looking forward to when a DIYer can put together a mode-locked fiber laser at home.  That opens up some crazy applications(i.e. particle accelerator).')
