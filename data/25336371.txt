Probably some other poorly conceived Outlook calendar plug-in like Salesforce that wants to “capture” activity on the calendar but would be blind to modifications made in Teams UI, so they turn it off.<p>Or maybe you are still on-premise for Exchange? The Teams-Exchange integration is server-side, and won’t work with on-prem Exchange unless your admins have set up hybrid mode correctly.')
