Item(by='dvt', descendants=None, kids=[24963721], score=None, time=1604275186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24963287, text='&gt; That&#x27;s a very fascinating point, you bring up. But I&#x27;m not sure how one can separate initial conditions from PMF. PMF takes initial market conditions into account by definition. At least, if we&#x27;re going by Don Valentine or Andy Rachleff&#x27;s definition.<p>I don&#x27;t agree. Initial conditions are minutiae that, on the surface, don&#x27;t seem to matter -- hence the canonical example of a butterfly flapping its wings cascading into a hurricane a few weeks later. Product market fit is <i>not</i> that. If &quot;Facebook&quot; would&#x27;ve been called &quot;Smilebook&quot; (which is an initial condition), do you really think it would&#x27;ve failed?<p>In fact, worrying about your domain name, and what your LLC is going to be called, and what you logo should look like are all rookie mistakes when founding a business.')
