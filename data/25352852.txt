The reality is that people tell lots of stories about why things happen, but they only have the power to say that something happened.<p>The search for &quot;why&quot; is both very human and a big problem in terms of explanatory power.  That is to say, someone has a finding and publishes it.  That may (or may not!) be relevant to the specific tight scope around the survey&#x2F;research.  However, be very, very, very cautious in generalizing - that&#x27;s where most people in ads&#x2F;conversion optimization go wrong.')
