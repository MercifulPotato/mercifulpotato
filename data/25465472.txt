Then I sat down and actually read about the box model rules, how things like margin and padding affect elements, and how amazingly useful flexbox was.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with web developers that still don&#x27;t understand the usefulness of collapsing margins. Developers that think padding is an alternative to a margin and not understanding they are different things altogether. If your solution to spacing something is to wrap it in a new element and add padding then you&#x27;re thinking backwards. You just add margin to the element you want to space.<p>I firmly believe the idea that CSS (today at least) is complicated is just people not trying to learn what modern CSS is like. Learn your basics like the box model, block elements, inline elements, etc. Then learn about flex and grid. That right there is like 90% of the knowledge you need to make anything in CSS today.<p>The way I learned was being given Sketch or Photoshop documents with all the sizes and margins&#x2F;paddings and told &quot;now make that a website&quot;. I really wish there was a learning tool that just had website&#x2F;website element mockups with sizes and your job is to replicate it as close as possible in HTML&#x2F;CSS.')
