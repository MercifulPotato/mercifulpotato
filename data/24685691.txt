I don&#x27;t think the entertainment value of driving loud and exciting cars will massively change but it&#x27;s rapidly becoming a nostalgic thing.<p>What is changing is that ICE based car racing is becoming merely an expensive hobby rather than a business relevant thing for engine manufacturers to be spending money on. The money is solidly in the EV market. That&#x27;s where essentially all of the money and profits are.<p>Now that even super cars are electric and generally outperforming their ICE predecessors on things like horse power, torque, 0-60 acceleration, etc. the glamour kind of is evaporating rapidly for F1 racing. Yes the range of these things sucks. But then their petrol equivalents were never known for their range either. The point is raw performance for however long the engines, tires, and fuel last. Electric at this point is superior on pretty much all fronts.')
