My main browser is Qutebrowser where I don&#x27;t login to Google stuff, for which I use a Firefox profile.  So when I&#x27;m watching something long like a lecture from any of my playlists, I download it first, quit Firefox, and watch with mpv.  If I watch on FF on a large screen the computer starts swapping and I have to go kill some apps.')
