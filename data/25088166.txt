And by stop I mostly mean, set on a handful of tools and stop mindlessly passing from language to language, framework to framework, cloud provider to cloud provider, trying to find the _perfect_ one. I think it would be better to just pick something, anything really, and become very good at it.<p>In the past decade I&#x27;ve built production apps in C#, Java, Go, Ruby, Javascript, Python, using AWS, Azure, GCP, backed by DynamoDB, Postgres, Snowflake, MySQL. I&#x27;ve used dotnet, Unity, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Spring, DropWizard, Gin, Gorilla Mux, Node, React, Express Flask, Django. Probably more. I didn&#x27;t use any of them long enough to become what I would call an &quot;expert&quot;, but I used each of them long enough to dislike various components in favor of other pieces from other languages&#x2F;frameworks. I kinda just learned that nothing&#x27;s ever going to be &quot;My&quot; language, like I see for other people all the time. They&#x27;ll always just be &quot;meh&quot; at best, but I should probably just pick a devil to know, rather than hoping to find magic somewhere.')
