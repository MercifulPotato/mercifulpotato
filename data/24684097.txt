Proximity to edge locations of the CDNs likely has something to do with latency delays. Also proximity of your hosting server location to Cloudflare&#x27;s CDN.<p>I ran a similar benchmark for time to first bite with a Heroku site behind CloudFlare and since the Heroku edges location varied wildly, latency varied wildly as well. CloudFront in front of an S3 bucket in the same location would likely really fast. That said when you get hit by a bot attack using your registration form to spam QQ emails, you would be putting CloudFlare in front and that might be worth a  benchmark as well.<p>One thing I would improve: benchmark of hosting provider speed and then benchmark the CDNs in front of specific hosting providers. If your hosting gives you a static IP to connect to your CDN, the speed will be less varied.')
