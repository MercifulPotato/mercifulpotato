In your example, the topmost system would also include you as a subsystem, and the loss you&#x27;re trying to prevent is injury to yourself. Getting stranded is a hazard that could result in that loss. A mitigation could be to allow you to damage the vehicle subsystem to protect the person subsystem. A formal safety program would try to avoid process escapes such as overlooking a scenario like that. You might still decide not to design for it, but at least you consciously made that decision.')
