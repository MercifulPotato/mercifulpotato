But today I learned that &quot;meat&quot; is indeed specifically the parts you eat, while &quot;flesh&quot; is just soft tissue, so &quot;flesh&quot; would maybe be more appropriate here.<p>&gt; they have trouble with the concept that biological creatures can have some degree of intelligence? That&#x27;s just nonsense<p>I&#x27;m not sure we (humans) were any better than that just very recent ago. Animals were believed to not feel pain at all before, and some people still feel fine with boiling lobsters alive. It&#x27;s not super far off to imagine that other species sees humans the same way we&#x27;ve seen them before.')
