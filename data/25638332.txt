In reality a clinical-grade WGS still costs a multiple of $1000 (see, e.g., <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.1186&#x2F;s12913-020-05318-y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.1186&#x2F;...</a>). The Moore&#x27;s Law-like cost reductions of genome sequencing are a bit of a myth at the present time; in practice Illumina has a monopoly on the technology used for clinical WGS, and therefore they have a great deal of influence over the effective cost of sequencing.')
