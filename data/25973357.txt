Usually it saves me a few hour of struggling and the solution comes to me first thing in the morning. I&#x27;m also the top 5% committer in my company even though I almost never touch 35h&#x2F;week (caveat: I don&#x27;t advertise this behavior at work and I work from home).  Companies would really do themselves a favor cutting the day short, 40h of coding&#x2F;meetings&#x2F;etc a week is way too much for a lot of people.')
