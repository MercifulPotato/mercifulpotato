Recently, we&#x27;ve been working on a regression model to predict train sectional running times based on historical data.<p>As our tool is used during real time operation, we can&#x27;t risk the model outputting an infeasible value. So we&#x27;re thinking about defining possible speed intervals, e.g. (0km&#x2F;h, 80km&#x2F;h] for ore trains, and falling back to a default value if the predicted running time causes the speed to fall out of this range.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;railmp.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;our-solution&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;railmp.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;our-solution&#x2F;</a>')
