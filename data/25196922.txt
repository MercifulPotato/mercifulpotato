I think what made him stand out in his day actually <i>was</i> that fact.<p>He casually reflects on absurdities, contradiction, and their prerequisites rather than burying them. What Wilde is doing in this essay is giving credence to counterarguments, either between socialism and individualism or between socialism and his own, famously hedonistic character.<p>The tendency in his period was to argue for hermetically sealed worldviews. Marx&#x27;s famously, and later Ayn Rand&#x27;s are like type examples. These worldviews internally saw themselves as a complete and absolute understanding of history, sociology, economics... the Truth about people and society. They conceded nothing and admitted no external influences.<p>Wilde&#x27;s essay is still read because it&#x27;s one of the few which actually captures the real political&#x2F;philosophical debate of his era. The <i>ideals</i> behind the ideology, the dangers of these going wrong.<p>He was a mighty intellectual, and if you want to understand why 19th socialism was what it was I think he&#x27;s indispensable.')
