I totally feel like a fake cancer survivor but it&#x27;s definitely turned me into a hypochondriac. I had to get a colonoscopy recently due to my GI issues and some of the symptoms were similar to the ones for colon cancer. I&#x27;ve tried to move on after 2 surgeries, RAI, medication adjustment but mentally it&#x27;s been tough. I have to get tested regularly to make sure there&#x27;s no recurrence. The stress and anxiety have been extremely tough to deal with for someone who has been mentally tough all their life.')
