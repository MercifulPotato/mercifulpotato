If a doctor&#x27;s visit has the potential to cost you hundreds or even thousands of dollars, unless something is really serious, chances are you&#x27;re going to avoid going.<p>In a system where costs are paid through taxes, the disincentive to see a doctor is eliminated. That maybe has some negative effects (going to urgent care for relatively minor problems), but I think it has real benefits in terms of preventative care.<p>In terms of a countries overall finances, it balances out (not entirely - see my previous point), but in terms of affect on behaviour it has a huge effect (in addition to balancing out the burden that I mentioned before).')
