Pyenv is meant to manage multiple versions of Python. Rustup is meant to update Rust. It&#x27;s possible to have multiple versions of Rust installed (not just stable + nightly, but multiple versions of Stable, for example) but that isn&#x27;t the main point of the tool.<p>The &quot;env&quot; tools are about managing the environment the (interpreted) application runs in. The &quot;up&quot; tools are about managing the compiler &amp; toolchain of a language, and make no difference to the applications.<p>Of course someone will go and make pyup to manage Python versions without changing the environment just to increase confusion.')
