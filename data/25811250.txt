(and including the Windows Boot Manager configuration data)<p>If all the measurements match, the TPM releases the volume encryption key and the system can boot.<p>If you boot from an external volume and then modify the boot configuration or the OS loader, or reflash the UEFI firmware, the measurements won&#x27;t match and the TPM won&#x27;t give the key.<p>Of course, if the login prompt, which runs way afterwards is buggy, drive encryption in Windows won&#x27;t save you there.<p>An advantage of this system is that when you reboot, all your services can run before you input your password, and you can login remotely. That&#x27;s an absolute must for a lot of business use cases.')
