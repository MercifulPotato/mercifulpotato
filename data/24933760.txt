Couple tweaks, you may want to use more than 1 letter for the workspace name icon in the left menu when a user has a few workspaces since naming is unpredictable.<p>There is also a lot of whitespace between welcome username, and the getting started copy on the page.<p>The home icon and the logo in the left nav do the same thing not sure if you need both.<p>Create task in the backlog should stand out more, I&#x27;m a PM and that is probably one of the most used options. Is there an option to add time to a task or urgency?<p>Hope this helps, looks like a great start.')
