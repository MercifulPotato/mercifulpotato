Item(by='jarvist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602680954, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24775856, text='From the brochure, it&#x27;s 2300 tons of steel in the substructure vs. 670 ton weight of the towers. It&#x27;s not stated what fraction of the ballast is fixed, and what fraction is water. Normally the fixed ballast would be rock. I don&#x27;t know how these numbers compare to a shallow water fixed installation, or even an onshore turbine (they must have some foundations!).')
