I want people to be able to work on things that matter and things they care about, while living in a place they care about and for without having to constantly sweat about money.<p>If European SWEs wanted to raise their wages, we would have to unionize and demand a greater share of revenue. Also, we would have to vote for politicians that want to force large companies to pay their fair share in taxes. Google, Amazon, apple and others have a leg up because they can make billions without paying our countries their due taxes.')
