If someone had a problem all the code was right there in a single file and the error could be found patched and deployed in minutes.<p>Over the years there were a couple of attempts at replacing this legacy system with a &quot;well-architected&quot; .net one but all the architecture made things harder to maintain and it only ever got to a fraction of the functionality. When there was a bug in those ones we had to not only find it but we had to go through every other bit of calling code to ensure there were no unwanted side effects because everything was tied together. Often the bug was in some complicated dependency because spitting out html or connecting to a database wasn&#x27;t enterprisy enough. Deployment was complicated enough it had to be done overnight because the .net world has a fetish for physically separating tiers even though it makes many things less scalable.<p>90% of the corporate&#x2F;enterprise code I&#x27;ve seen would be much better off being more like that cgi app.')
