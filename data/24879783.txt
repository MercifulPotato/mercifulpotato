Item(by='vslira', descendants=None, kids=[24880003], score=None, time=1603553494, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24879467, text='&gt; Staring at fact flashcards for hours on end just felt like a waste of time.<p>I think I found your problem.<p>Try this cycle:\n- Add however many cards you like\n- Study\n- Got bored and didn&#x27;t finish all your cards? Stop and don&#x27;t add any new card until you can finish quick enough to not get bored\n- Finishing quickly? Add more cards<p>The exponentially increasing interval is your friend. Before you notice you won&#x27;t be studying more than 10 cards a day :)<p>It doesn&#x27;t feel like it in the first ~10 days of a block of cards, but there&#x27;s a jitter in the spacing function, so you will see the same block at the same time 2 or 3 times but then they&#x27;ll start dispersing and be a lot less overwhelming.<p>And most important of all: don&#x27;t be afraid of slow progress: progress is progress!')
