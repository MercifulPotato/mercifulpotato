Otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t have copenhagen and other interpretations. The fact that abstractions are accurate doesn&#x27;t make them more real. Example: navier stokes equations are accurate, but they aren&#x27;t water; moreover, by adding complexity to the diff equations, they won&#x27;t become more like water.<p>This is what I really don&#x27;t like about the modern physics: it&#x27;s become an elaborate fortress of math models shielding us from the reality, and whenever we discover a missing wall in the fortress (dark matter), we just patch it with another clever math abstraction.')
