But there are definitely those who communicate poorly in any medium -- and I find that often they&#x27;re the ones who like media where they don&#x27;t leave a trail that can be pinned on them.<p>There are are advantages to the &quot;quick call&quot;, and some people definitely work better that way. But I much prefer written communication: not only do I get to refer back to it, but it&#x27;s more asynchronous, freeing me up considerably.<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s talk&quot; often seems like a barbarous imposition on my time, that I have to hear it <i>right now</i> and make any decisions while you&#x27;re staring at me. I try to keep in mind that they just have a different communications style, but that&#x27;s not always easy.')
