Very useful for embedded and similar, but for general-purpose stuff like the web you never need anything unsafe.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s pretty common in both of these languages for there to be C libraries involved somewhere in the stack.<p>Negative. The complete stack is open source. You can browse the source code of the standard library at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.dot.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.dot.net&#x2F;</a> You only gonna find unsafe&#x2F;dllimport for IO parts of that library where they integrate with file systems and such. All their core components are 100% managed code.')
