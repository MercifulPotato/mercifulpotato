Conversely, I expect that when Bitcoin goes wrong and the 21 million unit limit is replaced (call it “Bitcoin Future Fork” or whatever), this will be done by people not too familiar with hyperinflation.<p>I’m also hedging against inflation with property, although I could also hedge against it with shares or precious metals.')
