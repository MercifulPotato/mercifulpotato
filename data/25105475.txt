Some seeds, like pine code seeds, grasses, and so on,  will only generate after a fire. Then there is succession of plants that grow out. Nature has this figured out. And the forest benefits from fires. Fire kills off parasites, and diseased trees. The new forest will be healthier.<p>I understand preventing fires around human habitation. But it will probably be used to preserve the forest for logging too. Logging is not at all a natural process.')
