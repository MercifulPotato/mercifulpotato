Putting people to prison because they are addicts is a dumb idea, however I read here:<p>&quot;Medical prescriptions – for registered users of drugs such as injectable heroin&quot;<p>&quot;Specialist Pharmacists. - Sales to registered adult users – for drugs such as amphetamine, powder cocaine and MDMA&quot;<p>It sounds like we say &quot;ok, you take drugs so we will sell them to you&quot;.<p>Many drugs ruin people health (physical or mental), so I would assume we should somehow help people to give up addiction, here we are just helping them to buy drugs legally.<p>What if someone is not able to work and cannot purchase drugs any longer? Shall those drugs be provided free of charge then? Is that really something society should provide as something free?<p>I understand that war on drugs kind of went too far, but I think that remedy to it cannot go too far in the opposite direction.')
