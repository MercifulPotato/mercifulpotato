The WebAIM user survey is only available in english, and usually filled by tech-savvy blind users who are part of the blind community and are told about it.<p>At this point, JAWS is mostly used in corporate environments in the United States, mostly due to the number of scripts already written for it, a business-friendly (non GPL) license, and easy enforcement of restrictions given by IT, which are features that NVDA doesn&#x27;t provide. Some countries give out JAWS for free to their blind residents, so the number of JAWS users there is probably going to be pretty significant too. However, in most parts of the world, NVDA is the screen reader most people use. As a person living in eastern Europe, with many friends from around the world (including the U.S.), I know exactly two people using JAWS as a daily driver.')
