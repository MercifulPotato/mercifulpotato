You cannot seriously be suggesting that at this point, in the middle of a global pandemic, a vaccination is not valuable unless it covers 100% of the population. Right now even a vaccine that would only work for 1% would a a useful improvement over status quo where no-one is immune except previously infected. That said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will work for a much much larger part of the population and potentially allow us to reach herd immunity even if a small part of at risk individuals will not be able to take it. That will be a huge benefit to those people even if they donâ€™t get vaccinated themselves.')
