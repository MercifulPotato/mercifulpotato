A closely related problem google&#x27;s created is that there&#x27;s been a big loss of self-determination - google likely has the engineers capable of tackling something like that, but they&#x27;ve sunk into more of a standard corporate leadership model where these engineers really aren&#x27;t allowed to work on something like this - instead of having a free-floating surplus pool of them, freely able to attach themselves to different projects, they&#x27;re mostly hired on a need-based rationale.<p>If you&#x27;re doing a standard corporate model (in the interest of cost control), where you&#x27;ve got exactly the number of engineers you need to maintain&#x2F;develop certain products, then you&#x27;ve got no flex&#x2F;slack in the system - everyone you&#x27;ve got is <i>necessary</i> for the projects they&#x27;re on, and can&#x27;t be pulled off without hurting those projects.<p>I remember reading about one of Google&#x27;s last big bets - which was the major, AI-driven upgrade to google translate, and what was terrifying to me about reading the article was the artificial darwinian survival model applied to it.  Firstly - the folks who wanted to work on it had to beg management for buy-in to get anyone the clearance to work on it, and then second of all, they were given a deadline where they had to produce meaningful results within 1-2 year&#x27;s time, or the whole thing would have the plug pulled.<p>If we weren&#x27;t right at the cusp of that technology wave cresting, and ML-driven translation being viable, it&#x27;d have gotten axed and set us back by quite a few years.  What we need is a company willing to genuinely &quot;no strings attached&quot; commit resources to things like this - because maybe something simply can&#x27;t be ready for another 5 years.  But if it is on a 5 year timeline, we really want them to just put in the 5 years of work so we can have it - instead of cutting all funding and turning it into a 15 year delay.<p>Because again - if someone like google isn&#x27;t doing it - <i>nobody else will</i>.  The whole cost-cutting rationale on R&amp;D stuff is really a bet that someone else can do the hard work in the meantime, and then once it&#x27;s close to being ready, you, the company, can hop onboard and cash in.   But if you&#x27;re the only one with the means (be it cash, or in google&#x27;s case: data sets) to do that hard work, and you&#x27;re not doing it, then we&#x27;re all screwed - it means <i>nobody&#x27;s</i> doing it.')
