Most customers want a computer that &quot;just works&quot; and is secure, and they <i>want</i> Apple to do security for them. Having the OS&#x2F;machine vendor do security for you is a gigantic value-add for most users. Most people either don&#x27;t know enough to handle it themselves or don&#x27;t have time.<p>There is a minority base of users who explicitly don&#x27;t want this, and that includes many of the users on HN. Product development tends to be a quasi-democracy in that what most of the market wants, most of the market gets.<p>That being said the implementation here is badly designed. What Apple <i>should</i> do is have an advanced dialog in the security&#x2F;privacy preference panel that allows these things to be configured, but with a warning that doing so will disable certain Apple-provided security features. Also: Macs have plenty of space. Why not download the entire f&#x27;ing CRL list? It&#x27;s just a bunch of hashes and timestamps. Download the whole thing and then update it with patches at a configurable rate: every 15 minutes, every hour, every day, or &quot;on request.&quot; That would fix many problems.')
