The way to optimize  for it changes in years but you get a slightly less optimized version. Im sure software written in 2007 in assemble for linux pc works now, and fast. I think assembly is not cheap because the language is tiny, offers no abstraction and youre on your own for everything, not because of arch turnover.')
