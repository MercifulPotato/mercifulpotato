But, taken all together, I’m convinced that they are working,” says Grabowski.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>&quot;It&#x27;s not a slam dunk&quot;<p>Anecdotal beliefs from a random person named Grabonski in an opinion piece article is not science. And this is your &#x27;good faith&#x27; argument?<p>I didn&#x27;t even read the rest of the links you posted because they&#x27;re going to say the same thing: that mask effectiveness is inconclusive.<p>From the world health organization:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; At the present \ntime, the widespread use of masks by healthy people in the \ncommunity setting is not yet supported by high quality or \ndirect scientific evidence and there are potential benefits and \nharms to consider.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence....<p>It&#x27;s the world health organization saying that...<p>It&#x27;s clear masks stop droplets but maybe at a community level continually putting a plague vector directly on your respiratory system for a virus that stays on surfaces for days is not a good idea...<p>Additionally Sweden has had no mask mandate and Norway has had no mask mandate and they both have the infection under control they both have less deaths per capita than the United States.<p>Yet you ignore all of this data that counters your narrative.<p>Because the Corona cult...  was wrong about lockdowns and are wrong about masks...and are trying desperately to justify their mistakes so they don&#x27;t feel bad for putting 40 million people out of work and crushing people&#x27;s lives for a year.<p>Your thinking is as bad faith as it gets and I really hope the Corona cult gets the karma that&#x27;s coming to it at some point.<p>Your arrogant ignorance is hurting a lot of people unnecessarily.')
