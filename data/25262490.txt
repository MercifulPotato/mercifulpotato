Nothing will ever compare to that monstrosity that will never work: $7.2 Billion and growing [0].<p>Also, not an Engineer, but went to interview at both Tesla and SpaceX and SpaceX&#x27;s internal facilities are jaw-dropping. People love to go on about Tesla&#x27;s Fremont factory, which is awesome, but I&#x27;ve been to Fremont and Boca Chica. And Boca is by far more impressive; I lived and worked in Emilia Romanga in Italy, and also lived in the town nearest to Stuttgart in Germany so I&#x27;ve have seen my share of amazing engineer and logistical&#x2F;distribution feats.<p>I saw them starting to stack what was to become SN3 (RIP) in real time in the hangar as I saw SN2 vertical on the launchpad which that still remains one of the coolest things I&#x27;ve ever seen in my Life. I was basically leaning up against one of the Raptor Engine prototypes they have pretty much just <i>around.</i><p>I&#x27;ve also got a few glimpses of the Hawthorne factory from (the outside) when I was charging the Model 3, lots of cool stuff comes out there (namely Falcon 9 and Merlin and Raptor engines) they have so much cool stuff just lying on the side of the building which I took pictures of but was asked to delete by security, which I complied.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oig.nasa.gov&#x2F;docs&#x2F;IG-20-012.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oig.nasa.gov&#x2F;docs&#x2F;IG-20-012.pdf</a>')
