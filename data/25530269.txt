The email is from an internal address. Do they mean to say that their internal email system canâ€™t detect fake emails purporting to be from an internal address? This is cruel in multiple ways. Promising a non existent bonus and then blaming employees for failing a phishing test (which is not even a real phishing email or exposes deep seated IT inadequacies). Presumably this goes on their performance report too.')
