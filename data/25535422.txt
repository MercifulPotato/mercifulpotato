Lots of songs have vamps (sets of four or eight bars you repeat over and over until something happens and it&#x27;s time to go to the next bit), or holds, or other various other things where the conductor is paying attention to what&#x27;s happening on stage to cue the musicians. You could probably rig something up in QLab or whatnot to maybe emulate that effect digitally, but it&#x27;s never going to be &quot;just hit play on the canned track.&quot;')
