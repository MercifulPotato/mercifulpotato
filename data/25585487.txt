I make too much to qualify for &quot;assistance&quot;, but my insurance is ridiculously high and every year (I do shop around) they ask for more and offer less and less. &quot;If&quot; is the biggest word in the dictionary. The issue is divorcing medicine and profit. Healthcare is and always will be a basic human right. I would be OK with starting incrementally, say, I buy health insurance and I pay NOTHING ELSE EVER, no matter if I stub my toe or I need a quadruple bypass. The issue is also one of the insurance companies coming between me and my doctor. We know what&#x27;s best for me, not the insurance company. I&#x27;ve been fighting this battle for 20 years and I&#x27;m more disgusted with each passing year. I now know how to fight it on an individual level as far as getting debt forgiven, etc., but no one should have to live like this.')
