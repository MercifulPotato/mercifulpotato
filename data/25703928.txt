Google banned Parler&#x27;s <i>app</i>, from their own app store. At the very least, Android devices allow different app stores.<p>But the whole thing is irrelevant anyway, because neither Google nor Apple filter web pages you can view in their respective web browsers, and Parlor, or anyone, can just make a normal website.<p>Apple&#x27;s (and Google&#x27;s, as far as I know) complaint is not &quot;right wing politics is immoral&quot; - although if it was, I&#x27;d be OK with that. Their complaint is simply &quot;you&#x27;re not moderating your users as required by our app store rules&quot;, and as a user, I&#x27;m fully on Apple&#x27;s side here.')
