Item(by='dalbasal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607469924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25352088, text='&quot;New media&quot; economics have been enlightening. It&#x27;s been kind of a dump on ideas of openness, and its economic consequences.<p>Here we are in a world where artists don&#x27;t really need a &quot;label&quot; or whatnot, for any of the legible reasons of the past. Recording is cheap. Artists reach audiences themselves (or via algorithm). No one needs to front a million dollars to press records or print books. The digital version of cable channels, or broadcast licenses are basically free and unlimited.<p>In theory, it&#x27;s totally open. Musicians can record music. Get it to audiences. DIY talk radio. DIY TV shows. It&#x27;s popular.<p>Obviously, monopolies control all the distribution channels... but I don&#x27;t think the money problems stem from this.<p>The problem is that a sufficiently open (economically) system does not generate much cash. Producers are commodified, their power totally diluted.<p>The only way to make money is cutting exclusive deals with strategic advantage for a monopoly, aspiring monopoly. That serial show which will covert netflix users to amazon. The half dozen podcasts who cut a deal with spotify to help them &quot;own&quot; podcasting. The Beatles or Metallica, holding out for something similar.<p>It&#x27;s not a (simple) Competition Problem either. Yes, being open means more competition, but some still find large audiences.<p>Youtube&#x27;s ad sharing, spotify&#x27;s streaming royalties, etc. These all pay pennies (or less) on the dollar like-4-like to old media. X number of viewers on TV can support a professional TV show. The same viewers and the same show  on youtube cannot. The actual economic mechanics are different, but openness results predictably regardless.')
