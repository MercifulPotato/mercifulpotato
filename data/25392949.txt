No, I don&#x27;t think Office should exist. If Microsoft had been forced to sell Word separately from Excel, we might all still have a choice to run Lotus123, or QuattroPro. There&#x27;s nothing enshrined in the Constitution that says that companies have to be allowed to bundle whatever they want into their other products. I think it&#x27;s the job of our government, in fact, to prevent it this sort of thing. Microsoft bought lots of companies during the 90&#x27;s (good for them!), but ran a least a dozen more -- and prominent ones, at that -- out of the market by duplicating their software, and absorbing their business. Yes! Absolutely! Microsoft can make their own disk defragmentation product. Or antivirus. Or whatever. But put a price tag on it, even if it&#x27;s $0, and let it compete with everything else that&#x27;s already in the market. Don&#x27;t bundle it. I mean, did the browser wars teach us nothing?')
