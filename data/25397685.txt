We now know that both subjects are unrelated, but I followed this virus from early January and it took the general population 2 WHOLE MONTHS to pick up on it. Those 2 months were filled with conspiracy theorists, and actually a huge number of them turned out to be right, like the very existence and seriousness of the virus itself.<p>Similarly, at the time masks widely agreed upon to be ineffective. Anyone seen with a mask outside was looked at weirdly, anyone buying masks or telling people to buy masks was called a conspiracy theorist. Reasonable people at the time were lied to by their own government into believing that masks weren&#x27;t important, because the government didn&#x27;t want to compete with their own population since they were running short on supply. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Surgeon_General&#x2F;status&#x2F;1233725785283932160" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Surgeon_General&#x2F;status&#x2F;12337257852839321...</a><p>The point is, out of your reasonable examples of things that are obviously false, I can already take issue with one of them because it depends on when you would apply the censorship. If it&#x27;s February and you&#x27;re applying censorship to &quot;5G causes Coronavirus&quot;, you&#x27;re also probably applying it to &quot;buy N95 masks&quot;, and you&#x27;re also probably applying it to &quot;don&#x27;t let Chinese people into our airports, avoid Chinese people altogether&quot; because it&#x27;s racist, even though that&#x27;s the correct thing that should have been done, instead of this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mNMdg4morQs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mNMdg4morQs</a>.<p>My point is, facts and truth are fluid, especially in new situations that we don&#x27;t know anything about. And especially when politics are involved. By June everyone understood that lockdowns and social distancing were good and necessary, except that the entirety of media, academia, and elite society in general decided to give up on this for the George Floyd protests. If truth can bend this easily once it&#x27;s convenient, why should I take it seriously at all?<p>So I reaffirm my point that I will absolutely not change my mind on this, and without giving it any pause. Truth doesn&#x27;t exist when we&#x27;re talking about politics, and trying to pretend that it does is naive. You&#x27;re naive for believing that it exists. It&#x27;s all about power and what&#x27;s convenient for people in power (the media, academia and elite society), it&#x27;s absolutely not about truth, and this year of all years should have woken you up to this fact.')
