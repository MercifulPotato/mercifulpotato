Or did it predate all of that? Maybe it might have had a chance if you could have collaborated within an organization rather than only as individuals.<p>Edit to answer my own question, looks like the original G Suite was in August 2006, but at the time it was just GMail, Calendar, and Sites. Docs was added in early 2007. Wave was a thing under Google from 2009-2012, but was never part of G Suite.')
