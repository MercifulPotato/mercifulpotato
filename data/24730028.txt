They don&#x27;t understand how the block works, but they need to to be more profitable, so they paint the IBM logo on everything, cut costs and headcount until it is green for a short while.  Then it turns black, they rinse and repeat.  They make it green a few more times and then finally instead of green, it turns red!<p>Then they combine some red blocks, bundle them together, make it look black or green and sell them off.<p>This looks like the biggest bundle jettison ever, but after acquiring Red Hat, that makes sense.')
