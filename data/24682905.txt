The Laplace transform only works for <i>constant coefficient</i> linear equations as far as I&#x27;m aware. And it is inappropriate for many boundary value problems, because it solves a problem over a domain from 0 to infinity when that might not be what you want.<p>With this being said, I&#x27;m a big fan of integral transforms in general (Fourier and Laplace particularly) and have used them many times to solve both ODEs and PDEs.')
