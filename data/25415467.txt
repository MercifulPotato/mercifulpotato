The only thing that stops me from using system like this is the fact that I don&#x27;t care that much if I can find stuff. Or I didn&#x27;t until recently but I still don&#x27;t want to acknowledge that this has changed, dunno.<p>I see a lot of comments claiming that either tags are superior or this is bad because you need an inventory for your system. Both ignore a very real problem: with tags you&#x27;ll end up with near-identical tags which doesn&#x27;t really improve your ability to find stuff. You can have a hierarchy of tags, sure, but then once again you need some sort of inventory of tags.<p>Which brings me to my observation: if you think that tree hierarchy is limiting you and you need free form tags, your hierarchy is probably bad and you&#x27;re simply tagging things to feel like you&#x27;re organized.')
