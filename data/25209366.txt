This is not because our bubbles are particularly US centric, more that it has become envogue to simply discuss whatever gets &quot;the other side&quot; going.<p>In particularly, it is very interesting that &quot;the other side&quot; is aligning ever more so with the US political spectrum, where in the past such a thing was unheard of, atleast here in Germany. I&#x27;ve heard similar stories from Friends in other Non-US Nations, be it in Asia, Africa, aswell as other european nations. \nDoes anyone else have similar stories?')
