If you make a website where some dude is going to post anti-Semitic shit everywhere and someone else is going to have to politely explain that Jewish lizard people are not conspiring to elect a Black woman as President then sure, you can have it.<p>But that&#x27;s not a sacrifice I want to make. I&#x27;ll go to the website where I don&#x27;t have to do that. And the website will come to me.<p>Like, I don&#x27;t see you moving to the ghetto and putting your kids in shitty schools so that you can even things out. This ain&#x27;t different. I don&#x27;t like those people at the party, so I&#x27;m not gonna go if you invite them. So you pick: them or me?<p>Either choice is fine. Reddit picked me. Voat picked them. And we are where we are.')
