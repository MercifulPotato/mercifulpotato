We run our entire AI and AR at under 33 ms per frame, and we can get to about 60 FPS of optimized throughput. The 300ms of delay mostly comes from the hardware display process: it takes time for the camera to receives an image, and passes that image through many different pieces before getting to the processor that we can use, and then it takes again some time to be rendered. With that said 300ms is the upper-bound and typically the delay is less than that. Further, you may not have noticed but there&#x27;s similar delays for iPhone AR games, as well as to all other AR headsets, and that delay is there just for the videos to display (no AR, no AI).<p>We also recognize that distraction is a risk, and therefore UI&#x2F;UX design is highly important here. Ultimately, we believe that overlaying on a live view in a clean and effective way is better than people reading directions off of a synthetic 2D map on a different screen that takes your eyes completely away from the frontal view.<p>Definitely appreciate all the feedback and discussions though, we will continue to improve and do our best to deliver a product that people want!<p>- BTW we are totally hiring: software engineers, PMs, sales, AI&#x2F;AR scientists, and more!')
