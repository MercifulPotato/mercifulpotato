And when they think of &quot;you&quot; they think of antifa druggies living in a park and burning down stores. We can&#x27;t really demonize someone if they aren&#x27;t a bit radical so we have to focus on the radicals.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that the idiots you see probably are dumb enough to think they&#x27;re geniuses, but there&#x27;s a huge invisible support base (on all sides) of non-radicals who are fairly rational. And I think experience is the biggest difference between the groups. If you&#x27;ve seen a neighboring store burned you feel one way, if you&#x27;ve seen a neighbor threatened you feel another. The problem then is sharing experiences honestly so we can construct a mutual view of reality and then discuss the same issues.')
