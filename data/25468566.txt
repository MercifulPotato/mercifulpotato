If we take the view of companies want to maximize profit, it would make sense that they’d try to fulfill demand. Another big problem is scalpers and websites not doing enough to stop it. They create an artificial scarcity so they can make a quick buck. Sure, a PS5 isn’t “essential” like toilet paper is, but it’s still a dick thing to do.')
