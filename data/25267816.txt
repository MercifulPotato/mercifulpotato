It&#x27;s just not very fast  vs user expectations today.  More generally you can&#x27;t just recompile desktop Linux apps on mobile and expect much in terms of responsiveness&#x2F;battery life.  While I&#x27;m with you re: not wanting to be stuck in a proprietary ecosystem, it does have one advantage: you <i>must</i> specifically target the platform in order to do much useful on it which typically includes platform-specific optimizations so it performs well.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting conundrum: right now I can probably get 90% of Linux GUI software running on my Pinephone.  The problem is, it&#x27;s so slow and painful to use that I don&#x27;t want to.  I&#x27;d much rather see the critical 5% of the software (browsers etc) optimized for mobile.  I think we&#x27;ll get there in time, but it&#x27;s still early days.')
