Yes they are getting paid and they support their families back home, and yet I am not surprised that they die in such numbers (according to article). You would understand if you came and just witnessed their living and working conditions.\nI&#x27;ve worked in Dubai for 4 years and despite I was paid well (and no income tax), it really felt like slavery.  And seeing those poor souls in construction sites didnt add to my happiness either.\nBtw, i personally knew people who were paid 300$ per month (hotel room cleaning staff). That $28k average per year seems more like officially reported number, not the real one.')
