Windows has dragged its feet and has practically trailed OSX in design&#x2F;usability&#x2F;appearance (despite a VAST difference in available budgets) practically since OSX was released.<p>So it&#x27;s Linux, or.... what? the Beos&#x2F;Haiku? ReactOS? Open Solaris?<p>They need their own OS at a minimum to push Windows. A huge investment in ReactOS&#x2F;WINE would also help bridge the gap.')
