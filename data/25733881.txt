I had been taught about what was then known as targeted advertising, and I thought that meant that all those inane ads were being specifically targeted at insomniacs. Like they had decided I was some sort of moron who would fall for this stuff. Didn&#x27;t take me too long to realize the low quality ads were simply targeting the low-quality time slots. Nothing more sinister than cheap people being cheap.<p>But with real-time auctions, though, there are whole swaths of people whom the quality ads have decided are a waste of time, and now the hyenas can circle in to prey on everything that is left.<p>There are some ad networks out there that try to avoid the real time auction and cross-site tracking aspects of these conventional ad networks. I don&#x27;t know how successful they&#x27;re being, but maybe they&#x27;re on to something. Something that should be encourage by public policy.')
