It&#x27;s common for people to reference Rich Sutton&#x27;s The Bitter Lesson Of Machine Learning [1], which essentially says that brute force has always beaten &quot;clever algorithms&quot;. I&#x27;d outline an alternative view to this. The development of &quot;clever algorithms&quot; in the GFAI days or pre-neural-nets computer visions days often didn&#x27;t follow an approach where the different parts could be combined together in a fashion that was performant. It seems like the higher you go in CS theory, the more speed gets abstracted away. And the problems with that might be the real lesson here.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.incompleteideas.net&#x2F;IncIdeas&#x2F;BitterLesson.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.incompleteideas.net&#x2F;IncIdeas&#x2F;BitterLesson.html</a>')
