Developers-RHEL might be bit-identical to real-RHEL at some dates, but as a product it&#x27;s of course very very different due to lack of interim updates. And that&#x27;s aside of the smaller speedbumps of registration and having to involve Legal if you want to run in a company.<p>Again, stop moving goalposts. Your comment was &quot;why can&#x27;t they just put it on FTP&#x2F;WWW without support&quot;. That&#x27;s exactly what they do. You aren&#x27;t required to register it in any way, including downloading. You want a free &quot;product&quot;. That isn&#x27;t their business model. At least they make the sources for everything available, which took Canonical years for Landscape.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know how true that is, the CentOS wiki makes it sound like like the debranding part is non-trivial&#x2F;manual labour intensive. So according to you the main bottleneck is hardware &#x2F; buildservers? If that&#x27;s true, one wonders why even the minor CentOS 8.x releases lag RHEL 8.x by 4 to 6 weeks.<p>This is literally the build system. I have real-life experience branding a number of Red Hat products, including rebranding Anaconda and the base system. See for example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oVirt&#x2F;ovirt-release&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;ovirt-release-master.spec.in#L254" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oVirt&#x2F;ovirt-release&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;ovirt-rel...</a><p>The lag is because Koji (which is also used internally) uses a hierarchical build&#x2F;tag system. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.pagure.org&#x2F;koji&#x2F;using_the_koji_build_system&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.pagure.org&#x2F;koji&#x2F;using_the_koji_build_system&#x2F;</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.pagure.org&#x2F;koji&#x2F;tag_inheritance&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.pagure.org&#x2F;koji&#x2F;tag_inheritance&#x2F;</a><p>For a base release, a mock root needs to be bootstrapped. This is more or less by hand, and does definitely require incremental builds of and the rest of the base system. I guarantee the CentOS releng team has scripts that do this, but I don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;d keep them (I never worked directly with that team). Once they&#x27;re in a koji buildroot, that buildroot can be used to bootstrap its way to a &#x27;release&#x27; buildroot, with successive tags. Again, this is something that any build engineer should be familiar with.<p>The real wrench with 8 is modularity, which is also present in Fedora. If you really want to help CentOS go help them fix it:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;805180&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;805180&#x2F;</a><p>Issues like &quot;special version of RPM in the buildroot&quot; are weird non-issues specifically related to how Koji works, but Modularity does have real problems.<p>&gt; Sure, I largely believe the long-running narrative that a lot of core Linux development is paid&#x2F;done by Red Hat, and that most other distros, including Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu are free-riding to some extend. That&#x27;s why I not really behind the cheering for Rocky, and think it&#x27;s fairer in the end to either pay up, or roll up the sleeves and do a real _community_ enterprise OS based on Debian instead of cloning RHEL.<p>This is a no true Scotsman argument. I don&#x27;t know what isn&#x27;t &quot;real&quot; or &quot;community&quot; about CentOS other than the fact that there was&#x2F;is overlap between CentOS maintainers and RH employees. Just because they have day jobs doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t be part of the community, too. Hand wringing about what&#x27;s fair defeats the purpose of using a distro like a tool to accomplish goals.<p>&gt; The first part might be true of RHEL customers, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true for CentOS customers. The customer base is of course diverse, but my guess is that for a very large part of the (CentOS, not RHEL) users, objections to moving to Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu are practical (legacy&#x2F;switching costs, maybe followed by maybe proprietary software support), much more than principled&#x2F;legal.<p>You inverted this argument and you&#x27;re asking the wrong questions. The question isn&#x27;t &quot;why aren&#x27;t people moving off CentOS?&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;why did they use CentOS in the first place?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s because they were already familiar with RHEL from previous jobs, and wanted familiar tooling (apt may be nicer than yum was, but dpkg is a dumpster fire for package maintainers compared to RPM, and RPM&#x27;s tooling is much more cohesive than digging around in 10 different manpages for apt-cache || apt-file || dpkg -L || whatever to get information). Kickstart is nicer in many ways than preseed. Sure, the costs of swapping all of that are non-trivial both in the time investment for administrators to rewrite tooling and for the marginal loss in productivity until they re-learn tooling.<p>Going forward, container-first distros are getting the brunt of new deployments, which is exactly why RHEL isn&#x27;t a growing revenue stream for Red Hat anymore, and why it doesn&#x27;t make sense to keep pouring money into CentOS.<p>Red Hat is focused on OpenShift&#x2F;OKD as the new &quot;platform&quot;. Containers have their place, and it isn&#x27;t everywhere for lowly end-users, but RH didn&#x27;t drop CentOS to fuck over the community. They reduced support for the community because RHEL (and CentOS) are increasingly irrelevant to a company which has put their eggs in the CoreOS+Openshift basket as their future. That isn&#x27;t specific to them.<p>All of the major vendors see the writing on the wall. What&#x27;s better than making your systems easy to manage? Making it so they don&#x27;t need management at all. Do everything in k8s and update a single system image quarterly (or whatever), and leave traditional workflows as an afterthought. Red Hat is lucky enough to already have RHEL, but if I were starting a new for-profit Linux company in 2020, I&#x27;d do exactly what CoreOS did or Rancher does.')
