As long as visitors are annonymised and it is self hosted I don&#x27;t see how this would invade a person&#x27;s privacy.<p>The problem with Google Analytics is not that they track a user on a single domain, the problem is that users are tracked on a *.google.com domain and Google knows who you are based on your other google sessions and knows everything you do on the internet because every website uses GA. With a self hosted product that wouldn&#x27;t be the case, so the privacy is given by nature even if you&#x27;d track a user across a space of a month or longer.')
