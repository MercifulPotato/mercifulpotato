Let me just add that Paul Gilbert has a very broad musical range - there surely is a lot of high gain shredding (at least in earlier days), but he‘s also doing amazing work with clean settings and acoustic guitars. His hearing is not the best though, so maybe subtle differences in dynamics escape him :)<p>Personally I think that most problems people report about Kemper‘s sound stem from their speaker setup. If you use it for audio recordings or for loud stage setups, you most likely won’t be able to tell any difference.
