Like with everything, extremes are bad and all managed or all unmanaged are both bad. My personal guideline is use off-the-shelf services if they are cheaper than DIY, including labor, or if DIY provides no competitive advantage and off-the-shelf is cheap enough. But if DIY is much cheaper or gives a competitive advantage, do it yourself.')
