I&#x27;ve done two years of regular work since and I expect to have the HELOC paid in the next few months.<p>It was stressful on me and my family but we kept it together.<p>Since those events I worked a year for a &quot;startup&quot; company in the data analytics and AI field slinging Python and now I do Java and Javascript for a non-profit&#x2F;academic organization, entirely focused on getting data out of a database and in front of customers.<p>I am focused on doing application programming well on my day job but I do side projects involving printing, arduino, embedding Java inside itself as a Lisp-like DSL, etc.  Practically those things line up:  in the process of understanding handicapped accessibility for work i learned to think in terms of &quot;value&quot;,  Ansel Adams,  and how to generate random color schemes that are always legible.  jooq which I was using for work got me thinking in a mathematical way about what is possible to express as a java internal dsl,  etc.<p>Do it again?<p>That&#x27;s out of the time horizon I am thinking in today but I wouldn&#x27;t rule it out.')
