These towns are almost entirely populated by Native Alaskans and typically consist of a small gravel landing trip, a post office, a church, a general store, and a small grid of barracks-esque housing. No roads in or out.<p>These towns typically have populations between 150 and 600 from the ones I&#x27;ve opened up the corresponding wiki article, with median incomes between 10K and 30K.<p>I&#x27;ve wondered if the coming of Starlink and its competitors could be a boon for these rural communities. If a few precocious youth in these communities could get involved in some remote coding bootcamps and learn web or app dev, they could provide a compelling alternative to outsourcing to India.<p>The time zone is only 1 hour off of mainland west coast, so syncing up with HQ is easier. The legal system is just the US system, so HR is easier. No language barrier.')
