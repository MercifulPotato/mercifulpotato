They can even predict cost based on heating system and location.<p>Also: In Boston, AC is a must for a home office. A building like this can use a mini split for both heating and cooling, which is much cheaper than resistive heating. (I heat and cool my home office near Boston with a mini split.) There&#x27;s no point in a separate heating system anymore.')
