I thought it was just that B borrows a share from A, sells it to C, and then D borrows the same share from C to sell it to E. That way a single share has been shorted twice, and both B and D need to buy that share to pay back the loaned share.<p>So R quickly buys that share from E and refuses to sell it. Now B and D are screwed, because they both desperately need that share to pay back the loan that&#x27;s about to run out tomorrow.')
