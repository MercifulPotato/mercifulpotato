I recommend reading the FRR Routing thread [0], where an author presents a very solid case for manual updates (keeping routers stable), and Snap maintainers refuse.<p>Even in the very latest snapd version, your only choices are;<p>- Pause all updates, but only for 60 days max<p>- Revert a single snap, but only until author releases a new version. This can be only done once (twice on some systems), so if you want even older versions, you are out of luck.<p>This policy seems very inappropriate for Linux systems where people traditionally value having a control over the code they run. It is much closer to Android&#x2F;iPhone &quot;app store&quot; model -- but even those at allow disabling automated updates!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.snapcraft.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;disabling-automatic-refresh-for-snap-from-store&#x2F;707&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.snapcraft.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;disabling-automatic-refresh-for...</a>')
