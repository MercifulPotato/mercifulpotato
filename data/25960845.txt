Everyone already knows the value of Gamestop is a tiny fraction of its price, so even if some shorts have to close, others will open short positions. To the people who believe they won&#x27;t be the bag holders because of high short interest, this basically means the stock will always go up, and when enough people realize that&#x27;s not true, the party is over and the ones opening short positions or closing long positions recently will be the only ones walking away with actual money.')
