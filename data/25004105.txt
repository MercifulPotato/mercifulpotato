I am not at all representative of the general homeless population in SF. I doubt anyone is. The homeless is probably one of the most diverse of any classifiable group in San Francisco. People are homeless for numerous reasons, and I bet any similarity you find is only superficial.<p>Note that I never considered my self homeless. My 1981 VW vanagon—which we named Sunny—was a plenty good home for me. It was the first home I bought with my partner and we had a really good life in it. We would have stayed in it longer if it wasn’t so difficult to immigrate into the USA. But I know—and understand why—many people consider that homelessness.')
