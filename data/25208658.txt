That includes everything: CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, and assembly instructions for vendor-specific things like NSObject. This puts everything physically close together (efficient), eliminates all the protocol compatibility overhead (efficient), removes all the standards the company can&#x27;t control (efficient).\nThe downside, of course, that this will be the ultimate vendor lock-in, which is hard to compete with, and can&#x27;t be serviced by anyone else.\nThe upside is that the alternatives will always remain relevant.')
