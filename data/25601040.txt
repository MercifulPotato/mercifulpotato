It&#x27;s funny, but of course he lets &quot;moderates&quot; off the hook as if they aren&#x27;t just as subject to this dynamic as everyone else, when the truth is that they not only are, they have the ace of trump cards—social proof—to mask it with.<p>To me the interesting thing about that video is that it shows how much self-reflection (or personal work, whatever you want to call it) Cleese had been doing by then. His classic character was the rigid, angry type who was comically un-self-aware, which had roots both in his own character and also in his effort to be conscious of it—it takes consciousness to make oneself hilarious in that way. In this video, the way he describes how to feel good about yourself by projecting badness onto others shows how much deeper he had gone with that.<p>At the same time, with the blatant loophole for &quot;moderates&quot; in that bit, one can sort of see his limit.')
