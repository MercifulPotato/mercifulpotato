Designed obsolescence is the main business model of smartphones. If anything disrupts the profits in this business model, there has to be an incentive (either reward or punishment) that is enforceable and actually enforced. If a law is made and corporations end up circumventing it, that doesn&#x27;t count. I kind of expect corporations to continue successfully circumventing&#x2F;overcoming the efforts against designed obsolescence. Convincing consumers it&#x27;s OK not to get a new phone every year is another issue.')
