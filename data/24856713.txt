Human intelligence evolved in the real world with all its vast information content. Deep learning systems are only trained on a few terrabytes of data of a single type (images, text, sound etc). Even if they can be trained faster than the rate at which animals evolved, their training data is so poor, compared to the &quot;data&quot; that &quot;trained&quot; animal intelligence that we&#x27;ll be lucky if we can arrive at anything comparable to animal intelligence by deep learning in a billion years.<p>Or unlucky, as the case may be.')
