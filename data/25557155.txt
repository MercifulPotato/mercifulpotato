There&#x27;s actually a theory running around that we&#x27;re living in a digital dark age.<p>Here&#x27;s how the theory goes. Dark ages (a now antiquated term) aren&#x27;t defined by a lack of records being created, it&#x27;s defined by the lack of records making it to the modern era. That can happen one of two ways; either records aren&#x27;t being created due to the fragmentation of existing states, or records are created but they either degrade or are not readable in the future.<p>While we are creating records at an unbelievable pace, there&#x27;s an open question how long they&#x27;ll be readable. Most of our data is stored on sensitive equipment that requires fairly sophisticated maintenance. So long as our society continues mostly uninterrupted, we can keep adding new data and have it for the future. And while there is some risk of future file formats being hard to read, basic images and what not should be readable forever. But it doesn&#x27;t take a very long interruption to our social structure for these systems to begin to fail, and left alone for centuries most of the data storage mechanisms we use would lose all their data. Even DVDs break down in a few decades, if we went through a serious civil war or something on-par with the breakup of the roman empire, it&#x27;s possible that most of the records that would survive into the next millenia might be paper records.')
