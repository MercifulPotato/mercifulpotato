Is it just a throw-away disparaging term?<p>Hacker has at least three distinct meanings: deeply knowledgeable software developers, shallowly knowledgeable programmers, and people who break into computer security systems.<p>I assume you are not using the first of these, else you would likely say the Julia developers are hackers too. And you are definitely not using the third.<p>van Rossum&#x27;s training, for example, came through the language design and implementation process for ABC.<p>Tim Peters, another early designer, worked on compilers for Kendall Square Research and Cray Research supercomputers. (Eg, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.python.org&#x2F;msg303574" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.python.org&#x2F;msg303574</a> describes developing libm for KSR, and <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackless.com&#x2F;coroutines.tim.peters.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackless.com&#x2F;coroutines.tim.peters.html</a> shows his knowledge of features of Icon and Simula 67.)<p>So already there it was a multi-disciplinary effort.<p>What don&#x27;t you say Python was designed for an era of single-core computing and for tasks where raw performance took second place to usability instead of going hand-in-hand? Seems rather more correct and less needlessly antagonistic.<p>But you seem rather fond of needless antagonisms, as people certainly do write &quot;real&quot; programs all in Python.')
