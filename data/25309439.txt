I then use comments on that issue to track every step I use to fix it - adding screenshots, pasting in blocks of command-line output, linking to debugging tools I use etc.<p>I usually end up with an issue thread with a dozen or so comments, all by me. I often refer back to old issue threads to remind myself how I debugged something.<p>Here&#x27;s an example from yesterday: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;simonw&#x2F;datasette&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1124" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;simonw&#x2F;datasette&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1124</a>')
