The basic answer is simple, although it has many side-effects: your work computer is isolated from the Internet.<p>In both cases, you can end up going to jail for a long time if you leak the code, so there&#x27;s a fairly strong disincentive.  Of course, that&#x27;s only effective if you believe you&#x27;ll get caught.  And so your computer and the network is fairly heavily monitored, and very restricted in what you can do.<p>In the military case, there is no Internet access at all.  Anything secure is on an entirely separate network.  So, no Googling for hints, no Stack Overflow, no GitHub.  In the place I worked, phones were not allowed either.  If you needed to look something up, you could leave the secure area, use an insecure computer to look something up, and then go back into the secure area.  You could bring stuff in (paper), but not take anything out.  And remember the &quot;go to jail&quot; penalty if you tried and got caught.<p>In trading firms, I&#x27;ve worked for firms that pretty carefully control their Internet access.  Internet traffic is white-listed, and any site with an ability to upload is either totally blocked, or if it&#x27;s really, really useful (eg. GitHub), it gets a customized filter in the firewall&#x2F;proxy that white-lists only the read-only URLs.<p>Any remote access is done entirely via RDP, locked down to prevent everything except screen + keyboard + mouse.<p>If the company is issuing laptops that leave the office, or allowing access to GitHub&#x2F;Lab (and especially using personal GitHub&#x2F;Lab accounts), then they&#x27;re not really serious about protecting their code.')
