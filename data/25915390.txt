I wish that there would be some system where each product that is put on the market would have to provide a sustainability analysis, and pay more&#x2F;less taxes depending on this rating. This analysis could be something like &quot;what happens to the materials after it becomes obsolete?&quot;, &quot;how long is it going to last under normal usage?&quot;, &quot;How biodegradable is the packaging?&quot;, etc.. This would force companies to actively look for ways to improve this rating, and hopefully lead to better practices overall.<p>Some products are just too difficult to repair, or just pointless to repair past a certain age as they become obsolete (like a phone). But they can be safely and cost effectively be recycled in bulk.')
