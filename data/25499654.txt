It is notable that many monopolies sprung up in the US in the late 1800&#x27;s&#x2F;early 1900&#x27;s before there was significant regulation, which is what in fact lead to the first significant laws related to monopolies and &quot;trust busting&quot;.<p>There is certainly the danger of regulatory capture that increases the costs for competitor to enter a market, but that is different than regulations on how large corporations are allowed to wield their power as market leaders. You need to distinguish between regulations that increase the costs for new competitors vs. those that prevent bullying&#x2F;price fixing etc. For example, it was anti-trust regulation that gave rise to <i>popularity</i> (not initial creation) of Unix, and interoperability regulations that further expanded competition in the telecom industry.')
