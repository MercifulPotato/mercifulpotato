Fair question. Well, the guy grew up on the border: he was talking to us in Chinese ... this was not a major touristy area, it was between the Japanese railway that comes down from Tonghua to Ji&#x27;an (Chinese side) and Manpo&#x2F;만포시 (NK side) at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;#map=13&#x2F;41.1369&#x2F;126.1751" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;#map=13&#x2F;41.1369&#x2F;126.1751</a> and the town of Changbaishan at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;#map=13&#x2F;41.4239&#x2F;128.1771" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;#map=13&#x2F;41.4239&#x2F;128.1771</a>.  In this area you can literally look across in to North Korean villages and pillboxes, and in Changbaishan you can look across in to what I have read is allegedly the biggest NK town on the border. Along the way there is a failed attempt at building a train and the hills are denuded. Poverty is immediately evident. People are fishing with crap equipment because there is nothing else to do and they are hungry. Nobody has adequate clothing. I did not see glass. All the roads are dirt on the NK side. And so on.')
