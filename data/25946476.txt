I literally attributed an almost 50% drop to their actions.<p>But it covers their asses, and it reduces the number of people who can lose their life savings with them. Note the &quot;with them&quot; part<p>&gt; Are you new? That&#x27;s the entire reason wallstreetbets exists in the first place. It was always about losing money on purpose.<p>Are <i>you</i> new? WSB has always had clueless people trying to ride it&#x27;s coattails, there&#x27;s the &quot;As and the Rs&quot; for a reason. That&#x27;s why it used to go private even more often than this.<p>My comment explains like 3 different ways that the people who did this made a YOLO with &quot;fuck melvin&quot; in mind don&#x27;t care.<p>But there&#x27;s suddenly an entire clueless public trying to clutch onto it, and they don&#x27;t really know or care what Melvin and yolo and WSB are, they just see a ticker keeps going up because of those reddit guys<p>-<p>You should read comments before you reply.
