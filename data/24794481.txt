That it&#x27;s just incomparable, right?  Even though the cost of being dead would be borne by the user and their family and not part of google&#x27;s bottom line-- murder for spam reduction would be right out.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that big a leap to say that it is unlikely that there is any plausible reduction in spam from an automated facility that justifies the kind of extreme harm and disruption created by locking an honest user out of their  decades long email-- which might be more damaging to them then a home fire--, with zero effectual recourse.  Yet it happens because the cost of the spam is on google&#x27;s &#x27;balance sheet&#x27; while the damage to the user is not.<p>So that is the sort of argument that I&#x27;m making.  I think google is creating damages wildly out of proportion to any plausible benefit,  but it works out for them currently because the damages are externalities.<p>Were Google a more conventional company the threat of litigation (even litigation they&#x27;d ultimately win) would help internalize some of these costs, but Google has grown to such a size and scope that even the federal government finds prosecuting them to be extremely daunting.')
