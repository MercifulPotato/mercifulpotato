If I had to invert a n-ary tree, I would google how to do that, which I can&#x27;t do during the interview.<p>&gt; Once you go through and understand a few hundred coding challenges, things start to repeat themselves and then it just takes practice and consistency.<p>Assuming you spend about an hour to solve and understand a given coding challenge, that&#x27;s a couple of hundred hours. Assuming an hour a day, that&#x27;s about 3 months for 100 questions. That&#x27;s not a trivial amount of prep.<p>&gt;Personally, I find coding challenges fun and even quite enjoyable at times, so I don’t see why it’s a waste of time to get good at them.<p>Personally, I would prefer to spend that time enjoying my life. Whatever floats your boat.')
