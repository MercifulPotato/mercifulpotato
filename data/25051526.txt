Everyone seems to say &quot;well this does not work for my XXX because of RAM, etc.&quot; I would say yes, no surprises there! With this line up Apple is fine with that, because the Air and 13&quot; are not targeted at you. This is the laptop for my wife or kids that use it for school, web, some music and video, nothing at a professional level. That battery life will make both of them very happy.<p>The reality of this is that it is very likely they focused on yield for the chip vs market segment for what they can ship today. For the professional user I would very much to expect to see follow on products with more RAM and cores in 1Q21 (MacBook Pro 16&quot; and iMacs).')
