What a fucking power-hog. Dell&#x27;s done well at giving me OK battery life, but I pay for the power with pretty appalling thermals. I LOVE the idea of a fanless laptop that also lasts well into double digit hours. So much so that this is a non-negotiable requirement for me. Just like the Surface lineup instantly disqualified all 16:9 laptops from my life for eternity, the M1 has instantly disqualified shitty thermals for me.')
