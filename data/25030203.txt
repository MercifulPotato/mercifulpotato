Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604879722, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25029721, text='&gt; What did Resolve support say when you contacted them about this reproducible issue?<p>I was never able to get an answer from support.<p>The only way to get support is to make a public forum post but they protect the forum by not allowing anyone to post without first getting whitelisted by a moderator.<p>I spent over an hour writing a post, adding video links to DropBox, a full list of steps, settings, everything.<p>Except I found out I wasn&#x27;t able to add URLs in the post because my account was brand new so I had to remove the only important part of my post (the video proof of the artifacts and calling them out with exact time stamp references).<p>Also it took multiple days for my original post to get whitelisted and their forum sorts posts by date, but it doesn&#x27;t treat &quot;moderated_at&quot; as a separate date so by the time my post was public on the forums it was already on like page 8 and got no replies.<p>So I asked them if I could bump my post and they said ok, but it took days for the moderator to whitelist the bumped post and the same problem happened again where I was nearly on page 10 before it was visible.<p>They also have no way to trial the paid version to see if the studio version&#x27;s codec is better.<p>I spent honestly about 10-15 hours over a week trying to solve the issue by Googling everything and trying many different version combos with no luck.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a company work so hard on treating potential paying customers so poorly. I&#x27;d still use the software if I could, but yeah, I have no way to even get in contact with support and after spending ~2 full working days on unsuccessfully solving the problem with no resolution in sight I gave up and stick with using Camtasia.')
