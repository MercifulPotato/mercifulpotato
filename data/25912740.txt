Bash has a perfectly good way of dealing with spaces in array elements.  Fixing the example in the article is as simple as adding double quotes around the array:<p><pre><code>    for name in &quot;${names[@]}&quot;; do\n      echo &quot;$name&quot;\n    done\n</code></pre>\nThe will not result in a single element, but will destructure each element of names, as if each were double-quoted, and will print the same output that the &quot;strict mode IFS setting&quot; does.<p>What&#x27;s more, the double-quoted array solution will work <i>even if</i> the elements contain newlines or tabs.')
