Item(by='nicoffeine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605835104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25155323, text='&gt; Technology can&#x27;t simultaneously progress while still remaining backwards-compatible for years or decades<p>I agree to some extent, but at some point we (as in society) need to come up with some sort of standard for file formats and for user interfaces that will last for decades. Part of what makes technology useful is that when a tool is invented, it&#x27;s function and our interface to it don&#x27;t significantly change for sometimes thousands of years.<p>Take a hammer as an example. Even though there have been advancements in design and durability, any human who has ever used one can use another. That&#x27;s why so much of the actually important stuff still runs inside the Windows ecosystem. Until the ribbon redesign, you could take anyone who knew excel, sit them in front of any newer or older version, and they could get to work.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is why the technology industry can&#x27;t deliver one UI paradigm per decade, loosely couple the UI to the services that manipulate the state, and then allow the user to stick with one interface to get their work done for as long as their career. Then every 30 years you could break the oldest UI -- not sure why you would need to, but whatever -- and then the whole world could save trillions of hours of lost productivity instead of dragging themselves through redesigns that only exist because they give VPs a line in their resume.<p>(In this fever dream we all work four days a week. Programmers have time to produce immaculate, well documented, and bug free code. The hacker gods are now roboticists putting the finishing touches on fully automated luxury space communism.)')
