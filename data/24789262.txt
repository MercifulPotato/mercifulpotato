They use emails as usernames and when you log in, there&#x27;s an option to change the email or password. The problem is if you change the email, it only updates where notifications go. The username is still the old email and that&#x27;s where things like password reset emails are sent.<p>(And they don&#x27;t support 2FA. Better keep the old email around indefinitely...)')
