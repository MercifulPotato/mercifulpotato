Fundamentally they play different parts in the theory (one being a matter particle the other a force carrier) and mathematically they are represented differently and behaves very differently (one being a fermion and the other a boson). In particular the boson&#x2F;fermion distinction is usually glossed over in popular treatments of QED (because it&#x27;s so unintuitive and messy).')
