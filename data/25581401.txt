I find this attitude curious the thought that all the academics would suddenly start just taking the money and twiddle thumbs.<p>Depends on how you define “academic”. There are suddenly going to be a lot of “academics” showing up for their free handouts once there is no bar.<p>&gt;I can tell you that the vast majority of academics are not motivated by money. If that was the case they would move into industry where they could earn significantly more.<p>Selection bias. The academics you are thinking of are the ones willing to put all of the work into getting grants, teaching, etc. There are an order of magnitude more PhD holders that nope out of academia after graduation because of the grim prospects.')
