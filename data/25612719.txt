For clarification:<p>To ship a product from Germany (DE) to Switzerland (CH):<p>The package forwarding service XYZ is a company registered in both DE (as XYZ DE GmbH) and CH (as XYZ Switzerland AG).<p>You (the customer) order a package to be shipped to XYZ DE GmbH. That company pays the toll on the goods, then ships them from XYZ CH AG to your private address in Switzerland.<p>This is basically not a different process than normal shipping, except it doesn&#x27;t require the seller (in Germany) to do toll declarations and pay the exorbitant DE-&gt;CH shipping.<p>Since CH isn&#x27;t in the EU, those are really big obstacles. A <i>lot</i> of shops in DE just won&#x27;t ship to CH, or demand upwards of 25€ for shipping (but not tolls - you&#x27;ll be out another 20€ or more for that).')
