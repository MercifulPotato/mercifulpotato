I want to read this without questioning who the author is.  It has the look and feel of something I might align with, instinctively.<p>Alas, this is a dangerous thing in the world of bogus news.<p>The author and his editors then refer to <i>Founder Fathers</i> (not <i>Founding</i>) and “tying” police powers (instead of “tying the hands of the police” or “curtailing the powers of the police”.)  People learning English as a second language are, of course, allowed to make mistakes, but written journalism about US public policy isn’t.

How did the internet make me so skeptical?')
