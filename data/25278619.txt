All of the world&#x27;s systems and technologies haven&#x27;t been able to be understood by one human for (most likely) a very long time now.<p>The world is incredibly complex, but at this point in history I can go and learn about pretty much all of it whenever I want. By definition that means it is very comprehensible. It just isn&#x27;t practical for me to do so.<p>Modern scale as you&#x27;ve pointed out, and speed at which things are expected to happen to keep that modern scale going, are the bigger factors I think.')
