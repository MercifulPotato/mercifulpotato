Used old IKEA furniture was made from wood and had some level of quality. These things could last decades. Current new things there are made from paper!!! I manage to damage these new things while assembling. New IKEA things can’t be moved, because assembling and disassembling them does not work anymore. It’s a great decision to destroy old used things, so they disappear from secondary market and IKEA can sell more of the paper trash.<p>Edit: paper furniture isn’t new and secret.
