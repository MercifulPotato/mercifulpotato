This energy is wasted. In many forms of energy generation the result is pollution. Crypto mining is unique because it is the first thing that requires no infrastructure. These are heavy computational services that don&#x27;t need heavy internet infrastructure as mining is not bandwidth intensive and even satellite latency is good enough to submit the hashes. Its better than other use cases because those other use cases were more expensive than throwing pollution into the atmosphere simple as that.<p>The entire story that crypto is “taking away” is wrong when it is giving in more cases than not because its the only economical way to mine.<p>This goes hand in hand with the e-waste fallacy. The hardware doesn&#x27;t go obsolete if the power costs are low enough, and at the remote power source it is low enough. There is a robust trade of “obsolete” hardware from people that have higher power costs to people that have lower power costs.<p>Is new single purpose hardware being created for a purpose you don&#x27;t respect even when confronted with new information? Yes. Is the impact overblown and oversimplified? Yes. Should you make sure the reality doesn&#x27;t turn into the imagined nightmare? Yes. Remain vigilant, just have more accurate arguments so you know what to watch out for.')
