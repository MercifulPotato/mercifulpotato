A number of new movies have come out at that price point for a very short window this year before becoming available for purchase or rental. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s accurate to compare these movies to rentals in the $2-5 range. This scheme is clearly designed to replace some of the revenue from a theater run before it goes straight to rental. If you&#x27;re looking at it that way, it&#x27;s not such a bad deal for the consumer. We did the Mulan thing and it was half what it would have cost to take the family to the theater. It was a fun evening at our house and we would do it again as an alternative to going to theaters during covid. The only ones getting screwed by this setup are the theaters.')
