All your notes are locally saved as plain text-files and are [[linkable]] (+ backlinks).<p>Markdown makes the content of your notes future-proof and highly portable. Apple&#x27;s CloudKit service is used to sync everything across your devices (you don&#x27;t need to rely on private sync solutions).<p>NotePlan is a 100% native app written in Swift. This means: a beautiful, clean design, super-fast, and highly integrated into Apple&#x27;s ecosystem (iOS included). It also syncs with iCloud calendar and reminders.<p>If you are looking for a native alternative to Obsidian and Roam, which has iOS apps, NotePlan also supports bi-directional linking and is compatible with Obsidian (change the file-extension to .md in NotePlan&#x27;s preferences) and Roam (when you export your data as Markdown files).<p>With NotePlan, you can build your favorite productivity workflow:<p>- Zettelkasten ([back-]linking, folder support, notes)<p>- GTD (tasks are first-class citizens, create project notes and schedule)<p>- Bullet Journal (daily notes, re-schedule tasks, undated notes as lists).<p>Read a quick walkthrough here (with videos): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noteplan.co&#x2F;walkthrough" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noteplan.co&#x2F;walkthrough</a><p>Read more about NotePlan&#x27;s features here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noteplan.co&#x2F;features" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noteplan.co&#x2F;features</a><p>If you have questions, just ask :)<p>Best,<p>Eduard')
