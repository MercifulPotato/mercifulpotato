I grew up listening to songs from the 60&#x27;s, 70&#x27;s, and 80&#x27;s. I still like them, and you can always find them playing on the radio today. These songs are also very Lindy - they&#x27;ve stood the test of time.<p>But I find Modern Pop songs get played to death for a few months and then you rarely hear them again. Remember when &quot;Closer&quot; from the Chainsmokers was playing constantly in 2016? I never hear it on the radio today.')
