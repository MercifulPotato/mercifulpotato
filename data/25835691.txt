In this vessel carved from a single tree, seventeen Indians at one \n    time travelled with us. With all their baggage added to ours and everyone \n    aboard, the vast canoe still looked rather empty. Portaging it, this time \n    with only four or five Indians to help, over half a mile of boulders beside \n    a large waterfall was depressing to contemplate. It meant placing logs \n    across the path of the canoe and hauling it, inch by inch, in the merciless \n    sun, slipping inevitably into the crevices between the boulders whenever \n    the canoe pivoted out of control and scraping one&#x27;s shins, ankles and \n    whatever else one landed on against the granite. We had done the portage \n    before with the small canoe, and the two Italians and I, knowing what lay \n    ahead, spent several days dreading the hard work and pain. On the day lye \n    arrived at Arepuchi Falls we were primed to suffer and started off \n    grimfaced and hating every moment, to drag the thing over the rocks.\n    \n    When it swung sideways, so heavy was the rogue pirogue, it several times \n    pinned one of us to the burning rock until the others could move it off. A \n    quarter of the way across all ankles were bleeding. Partly by way of \n    begging off for a minute, I jumped up on a high rock to photograph the \n    scene. From my vantage point and momentary dis-involvement, I noticed a \n    most interesting fact. Here before me were several men engaged in a single \n    task. Two, the Italians, were tense, frowning, losing their tempers at \n    everything and swearing non-stop in the distinctive manner of the Tuscan. \n    The rest, Indians, were having a fine time. They were laughing at the \n    unwieldiness of the canoe, making a game of the battle: they relaxed \n    between pushes, laughing at their own scrapes and were especially amused \n    when the canoe, as it wobbled forward, pinned one, then another, underneath \n    it. The fellow held barebacked against the scorching granite, when he could \n    breathe again, invariably laughed the loudest, enjoying his relief.\n    \n    All were doing the same work; all were experiencing strain and pain. There \n    was no difference in our situations except that we had been conditioned by \n    our culture to believe that such a combination of circumstances constituted \n    an unquestionable low on the scale of well-being and were quite unaware \n    that we had any option in the matter.\n    \n    The Indians, on the other hand, equally unconscious of making a choice, \n    were in a particularly merry state of mind, revelling in the camaraderie; \n    and, of course, they had had no long build-up of dread to mar the preceding \n    days. Each forward move was for them a little victory. As I finished \n    photographing and rejoined the team, I opted out of the civilized choice \n    and enjoyed, quite genuinely, the rest of the portage. Even the barks and \n    bruises I sustained were reduced with remarkable ease to nothing more \n    significant than what they indeed were: small hurts which would soon heal \n    and which required neither an unpleasant emotional reaction, such as anger, \n    self pity or resentment, nor anxiety at how many more there might be before \n    the end of the haul. On the contrary, I found myself appreciative of my \n    excellently designed body, which would patch itself up with no instructions \n    or decisions from me.</code></pre>')
