There is already a clear distinction in law between commercial and non-commercial activity.<p>Obviously my single sentence isn&#x27;t yet enough to be standalone law. But you rightly pointed non-commercial activity could be exempt from this restriction.<p>I can imagine somebody picking up burgers and delivering them to homeless people. I believe this could be exempt as non-commercial activity.<p>There are again questions, what if Uber decides to pick up burgers and deliver them to homeless? One could say that even if deliver it for free it is still commercial activity (because they obviously stand to gain PR which has a value). Also they can just ask a burger place for permission to buy burgers from them for homeless people, I see no problem with that.<p>Also all attempts at distinction of small and large scale seem to have issues with them. First is the arbitrary definition of what small and large scale is.<p>Then what if you are wealthy man and decide to feed all homeless in LA for Christmas? I guess you could try to get permission from the owner of the establishment but I don&#x27;t see why you shouldn&#x27;t just be able to decide, in a spur of the moment, to send a dozen of your minions to various establishments and just buy the stuff.<p>What then if Uber decides that their minions who deliver goods are actually small businesses providing the service on its own and use Uber&#x27;s platform as a service to coordinate them with buyers? How would large&#x2F;small scale operation be defined?<p>To summarize, I think:<p>- commercial &#x2F; non-commercial distinction is better than large&#x2F;small &quot;scale&quot; (however defined),<p>- non-commercial organizations and private individuals should not be subject of this law<p>- commercial activity most likely is calculated to gain something from this whether the delivery is or isn&#x27;t paid for by the consumer and so I think it should not be exempt,<p>- &quot;small scale&quot; commercial activity can probably be perverted by corporate lawyers.<p>- if the law is restricted to online platforms, there is possibility corporations are going to work around it so that it does not meet the criteria of online platform.')
