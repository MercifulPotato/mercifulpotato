I do this all the time.</i><p>I agree one can sometimes do this, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s always possible. I strongly suspect you do not have the ability to, for example, turn all of the trolls and hijackers in a toxic reddit thread into reasonable conversationalists.<p><i>&gt; You cannot have community when all opposing viewpoints are banned.</i><p>Banning trolls and hijackers is not the same as banning opposing viewpoints. I am not saying people who reasonably argue for opposing viewpoints should be banned. I am saying that trolls and hijackers--people who don&#x27;t reasonably argue for anything but simply shout down everyone else--should be banned. Doing that is necessary to make it possible for reasonable people arguing opposite sides of an issue to have an actual conversation.<p><i>&gt; So now that we have all these echo chambers and no communities. How healthy is society? It is far worse off than 10 years ago.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree. The sickness might be more visible now, but I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s actually any worse, just more visible.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure the sickness is quite as bad as you say. Are there really <i>no</i> communities at all? For example, is HN not a community? Is it just an echo chamber? I see opposing viewpoints argued reasonably here all the time; after all, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing in this very conversation.')
