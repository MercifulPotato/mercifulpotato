The only way to really solve it is to host my own tile server (expensive) and add some sort of 3rd party proxy service between the app and the Zood tile server (so Zood could not surveil your tile loads).<p>I&#x27;d like to host my own tile server in the future, but it depends on revenue, which is just not there right now.<p>Also, and this is just my opinion, I don&#x27;t think Google is trying to surveil people via tile loading patterns. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible, but there are far easier ways to surveil users than examining tile loading patterns. So for the time being, I&#x27;m ok using the Google Maps SDK.<p>Privacy, like trust, is not binary, but a spectrum. My hope is that Zood Location can start increasing the amount of privacy people enjoy in their digital lives, and over time, the app can be improved to increase that level of privacy.')
