Cast iron even better.<p>They&#x27;re called nonstick for a reason; stainless steel does not compare. You&#x27;ll have more sticking problems cooking eggs on a steel pan drowning in butter than on a (new) nonstick pan with minimal grease.<p>I do own an 18th-century cast iron pan and it has pretty good seasoning. I use it for many things, almost daily, but I&#x27;m still glad I own nonstick pans too.')
