It does not provide any way forward in itself. Most moral error theorists actually subscribe to the idea that we should pretend that morality is real in most instances. This is known as moral fictionalism. There are several other ways forward. Some, for instance, say that we now have more freedom to experiment with &quot;morality&quot; given that we are no longer governed by it.<p>Only Stirner and &quot;moral abolitionists&quot; believe we should stop talking in moral terms. Once the moral error theory is accepted, it&#x27;s only a matter of practicality as to what one should do with moral statements and sentiments.<p>As such, there&#x27;s plenty of room for other statements not based in morality - ones from practicality, and normative statements which are not facts, but personal opinions.<p>I can still think murder is wrong; I can still argue for there to be laws against murder, and I can still be horrified by it. What I can&#x27;t say is that murder is wrong (in the moral sense) for everyone everywhere, and that by murdering you are contrevening a universal law. There is no commandment (says the moral error theorist), moral, religious, or otherwise, that we must obey.')
