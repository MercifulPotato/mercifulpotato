Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602367406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24727735, text='&gt; It is possible for a subject to be both political and controversial<p>I didn’t claim otherwise. I believe that people are told not to talk about their abortion because it’s <i>controversial</i>, but not because it’s <i>political</i> barring perhaps a few people who aren’t educated enough to understand the distinction.<p>&gt; Abortions are political because the Republican party has a publicly-stated policy of wanting to legislate against abortion.<p>The Republican party’s political advocacy is obviously political, but it doesn’t follow that any given account of an abortion is political. Both are controversial, however.<p>&gt; So everything controversial is becoming political.<p>Controversial things frequently are political, but that doesn’t mean any particular speech about a controversial topic is political speech. You seem to be confusing a prohibition about politics with a prohibition against any topic that has a political aspect. So at coinbase, a gay man could talk about his marriage despite that gay marriage is also a political subject (and also a controversial topic in some spheres, albeit probably not the SV spheres), but he (and any employee for that matter) couldn’t advocate for or against gay marriage <i>policy</i> or <i>norms</i>.')
