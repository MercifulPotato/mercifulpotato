Item(by='xibalba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607018046, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25291531, text='&gt; You don&#x27;t get to declare someone else&#x27;s &quot;resignation&quot; for them<p>I think you are arguing that this is more straightforward than it really is. If we suppose (in absence of her actual email) that she declared &quot;...make x, y, and z happen or I resign&quot;, that certainly reads as a (conditional) offer of resignation that <i>can</i> be accepted by the other party.<p>All of this is likely to end up in court and we&#x27;ll get a decision on whether it was a resignation or firing.')
