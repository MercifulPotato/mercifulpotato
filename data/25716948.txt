Maybe you should do your research before you happen to accuse me of saying things I never said. These images were provided by Amazon to Parler as a justification to remove Parler from AWS. These images were not taken by me or provided by me.<p>The article which covers these images:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buzzfeednews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;johnpaczkowski&#x2F;amazon-parler-aws" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buzzfeednews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;johnpaczkowski&#x2F;amazon-p...</a><p>&gt; Haha, no. It was because of the ratio of that kind of content to all the content.<p>No evidence to back up your claim here. Again, this is the sort of stupid left wing bubble that makes up most left wingers. Unless you can say exactly how much of the content was violent on Parler your guess is as good as mine. I just showed the GP evidence on how Twitter doesn&#x27;t remove hate speech on its platform much the same as Parler. That is about it. I can dig thousands of tweets for you which show hate speech. I am not going to waste my time doing it. If Amazon can use the above images as justification to remove Parler then Twitter being online is hypocritical.')
