The former expands constant surveillance to constant surveillance + identification.<p>&gt; I should clarify, I&#x27;m not arguing in favor of real time facial recognition, I&#x27;m just skeptical of this move&#x27;s efficacy in preventing the same outcome.<p>You don&#x27;t appear to be, don&#x27;t worry. And these days there&#x27;s nothing wrong with being skeptical. After all, it did turn out that the government was spying on its citizens. This wouldn&#x27;t stop that, but it does blunt it a bit. Dunno, maybe I&#x27;m an optimist.')
