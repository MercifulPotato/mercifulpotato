In this study, which was a multicenter, randomized, double blind placebo controlled study in Brazil, the researchers found no benefit in treating hospitalized patients with severe COVID with vitamin D3.<p>This study is helpful because it gives us evidence that if vitamin D deficiency is associated with severe disease, treating it at the time of hospitalization is not helpful and we can focus on other treatment options.<p>Note that this is a preprint which means it has been made available before final peer review.')
