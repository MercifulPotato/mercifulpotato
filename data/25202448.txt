Here’s a pretty amazing result from the paper. To estimate the median (loosely) on a stream, first set the median estimate m to 0 prior to seeing any data. Then as you observe the stream, increase the median estimate m by 1 if the current element s is bigger than m. Do nothing if the current element is the same as m. Decrease the estimate by 1 if the element is less than m. Then (given the right conditions) this process converges to the median. You can even extend this to quantiles by flipping a biased coin and then updating based on the result of the flip as well as the element comparison.<p>The unfortunately now deceased neustar research blog had an interactive widget as well an outstanding write up[2]<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1407.1121" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1407.1121</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;content.research.neustar.biz&#x2F;blog&#x2F;frugal.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;content.research.neustar.biz&#x2F;blog&#x2F;frugal.html</a>')
