The is no question of dishonesty or impersonation, just of offering this service.<p>This is quite an extreme restriction, IMHO, and seems to be a kneejerk and simplistic response to a perceived problem.<p>On the other hand, the problem of online reviews is separate and should be addressed specifically, IMHO. At the moment it&#x27;s the wild West and a breeding ground for defamation. Maybe regulating this should get more attention from lawmakers (though I realise that in the US the 1st Amendment may make this difficult).')
