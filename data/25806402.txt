I find that if I receive positive feedback, it doesn&#x27;t motivate me it only encourages me to take it easier.  If I receive negative feedback, I will double down to fix the issue, but my morale will suffer.<p>What&#x27;s most important is that the feedback is IMMEDIATE.  Tell me after a presentation what I flubbed.  Don&#x27;t tell me after a quarter that my presentation skills are lacking.')
