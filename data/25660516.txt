Just money. How depressing.<p>Of course it is. FAANG is just the 1980s Wall Street of our day. I can only pray that eventually people will realize how predatory and dangerous these companies are and decline to work for them. But Ivy League&#x2F;Elite Uni grads only care about prestige and so as long as working there is seen as prestigious they will continue to sell their souls.')
