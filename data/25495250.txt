It is in most linux distros and is available for mac in brew and in cygwin for windows.  It has a mirror subsystem that works nearly like rsync and can support SFTP + chroot.  Combine that with rsnapshot for diffs and you can fall back to earlier versions without using a lot of disk space.  You can put that rsnapshot location outside of the SFTP chroot so that malicious access can&#x27;t wreck your data, or just make the directory above your rsnapshots root-only access so regular users in a non chroot environment can&#x27;t get there.')
