Works are forgotten, left behind, ignored etc. A work can be valuable in one context at one stage in the discourse, while worthless at another time. It&#x27;s not like a neutral map of some terrain that we can just file and store forever.<p>He&#x27;s in the social sciences, where this may be more obvious, but it&#x27;s also true of sufficiently developed technical sciences too. When the low hanging fruit has been picked, the game becomes closer to zero sum. I mean new value can still be created, but not mainly through bringing in &quot;new characters into the story&quot; but by letting the story unfold using the same characters (main ideas). Only a true paradigm shift may break this equilibrium.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;vtIzMaLkCaM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;vtIzMaLkCaM</a>')
