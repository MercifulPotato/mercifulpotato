I&#x27;m searching for a 1&#x2F;8 inch outer diameter seal, 180 Â°C temp resistance with a specific interior diameter and 2.5mm thickness - but even going on the product category for seals, it&#x27;s <i>impossible</i> to filter.<p>To make it worse: unlike in ye olde times, employees in the physical store <i>also</i> only have access to the website - they can&#x27;t help you either.<p>And forget about Amazon, their listings are full of crap.')
