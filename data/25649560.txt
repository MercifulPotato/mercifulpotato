So that&#x27;s $66, or about $7 a month for both of us.<p>Whenever we&#x27;re properly past the pandemic I can see the Starbucks problem coming back a bit, because part of that was having a place to go to in the morning to be around people and get some writing done before work.<p>I&#x27;m mainly a coffee + a little half and half, so my drinks don&#x27;t usually have a ton of calories.')
