Specially when it comes to privacy-friendly tools, not only analytics, I&#x27;d argue that there&#x27;s not enough options yet.<p>I initially built it for myself, as I was not fully satisfied with the existing solutions. And I do intend to offer more features than what you currently see, but unfortunately my time is limited and it&#x27;s going to take a while to bring Panelbear to the feature-level I&#x27;d like it to be :)')
