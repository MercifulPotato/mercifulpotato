Akin to remotely fixing somebodies PC over standing behind them.<p>With that premise I&#x27;d speculate in this instance that whilst not the root cause, may of been a small ripple that led to that root cause and&#x2F;or lead to a slower resolution than what would normally get.<p>Those speculations aside, it will only highlight what that some tooling needs to adjust for remote workers as does design and set-ups more.  Water cooler talk is not just for gossip and a counter would be more regular on-line group socialising at a work level so that not only the companies but the workers can fully adapt and embrace the work medium; But so the kinks and areas that need polishing can be polished and made better for all.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;d speculate that I&#x27;m totally wrong and yet what I said may well anecdote with some out there and resonate with others.')
