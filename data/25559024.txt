And this isn&#x27;t a simple black&#x2F;white, good or bad story. This is a clear sign of de-industrialization.<p>This is good look upon UK energy utilisation over the decades and clearly shows industry usage declined decades ago:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;system&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;attachment_data&#x2F;file&#x2F;928350&#x2F;2020_Energy_Consumption_in_the_UK__ECUK_.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;...</a><p>I would also factor in efficiency usage of appliances and house insulation etc playing into that 20% factor more than most.  Dare say lighting has seen a big reduction in electricity usage in that period due to LED&#x27;s.<p>&gt; It would be great if UK wind power would be so abundant and cheap, it flooded the entire EU with cheap clean electricity.<p>Looking at:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wind_power_in_the_European_Union" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wind_power_in_the_European_Uni...</a>\nThe UK seems to be above average in wind electrical production.<p>As for this flood of cheap and abundant electricity it produces, given <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Electricity_price_statistics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php...</a>\nand what I know of how such large wind farms are financed.  It does seem to be a common theme that wind production installation costs are subsidised by a level upon consumer energy costs.  So with most wind energy production being cheap, at a level well removed from the consumer - yes, though at the consumer level - not so much as they are subsidising this transition drive.<p>Not saying it is a bad thing, but the whole cheap and abundant aspect at a consumer level, does seem somewhat removed unless you have a large property with a wind turbine yourself getting a nice feed in tariff that is subsidised by everybody else to incentive green energy production.<p>But the shift from coal is a good thing, though one area that I feel gets overlooked would be ships that use brown coal and the emissions they produce.')
