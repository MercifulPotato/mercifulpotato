I don&#x27;t understand what leg they have to stand on here.<p>This feels like DeCSS all over again.<p>P.S.: They also took down youtube-dlc, even though it&#x27;s not listed.<p>[1]: It turns out I am wrong. It wasn&#x27;t in the readme, but in the <i>test cases</i>. See extractor&#x2F;youtube.py. To me this seems even more tenuous, but IANAL.')
