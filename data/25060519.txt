These were relatively minor storms compared to what could happen in a worst case scenario.<p>The focus of my preparations are around providing for my family if we had a severe hurricane hit. This involves making sure we have enough food, water, and fuel to be self sufficient for a few weeks. It involves being able to charge devices and have light without power. Sadly, it also involves having at least some ability to defend ourselves as that is the world we live in.<p>It is a fun hobby to have. While some people go overboard, I think we&#x27;d be better off if more people prepared for real scenarios like this as it takes some of the burden off the system and leaves capacity for those who couldn&#x27;t or didn&#x27;t prepare enough.')
