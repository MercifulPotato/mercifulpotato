I’ve been running Ubuntu on my MBP for a year now and have had zero issues, even with the retina display. No special drivers needed, at least for my model.\n I keep it dual boot so I can work on mobile apps in OS x, but I suspect apple will screw me out of that option to try and force me to upgrade at some point, and at that point, iPhone apps will become something I don’t work on, or I’ll use a remote build service for them.')
