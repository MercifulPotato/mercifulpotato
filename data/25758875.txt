So I would not be surprised if Exynos comes to US in 2021 or 2022.<p>But right now nothing has been shown by Samsung to be competitive with Qualcomm&#x27;s mmWave offering. And interestingly enough US is the <i>only</i> market which has implemented mmWave with one carrier and other two are &quot;looking at it&quot; closely. As far as I know <i>NO</i> other market currently has plans for mmWave. Which means if mmWave is mandatory for US market, you would likely continue to see Qualcomm in Samsung Smartphone.')
