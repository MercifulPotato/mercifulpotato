There are just too many cooks, too many different perspectives, most toolchains allow you to solve problems in too many different ways.<p>IMO and contrary to what people say, making good software is not a team sport.<p>You could try to offset that by some combination of keeping head count low, optimizing for technical homogeneity when hiring and&#x2F;or using intentionally <i>spartan</i> toolchains (Golang for example) but the odds are still against you.<p>Also, US business culture is maximalist and land-grabby in nature so no one is going to let you actually apply any of those constraints. The people who write checks don&#x27;t actually care if the software is &quot;good&quot; because in almost all cases it doesn&#x27;t have to be.')
