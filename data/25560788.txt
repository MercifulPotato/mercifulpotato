Item(by='epistasis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609174744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25560441, text='SF, like all of California, has the worst possible property tax scheme. They passed &quot;homestead&quot; protections but did it for <i>all</i> property tax, not just homesteads.<p>Any property tax, from vacant lot to strip mall to vacation home to industrial plant, can not rise above 2% per year. Meanwhile property values rise 5%-10% per year. The only way for property to get reassessed at market value is to build on it or sell it.<p>This subsidizes speculation. If you own a vacant lot since 1970, and pay an effective tax rate of 0.05%, and building on it raises your taxes to 1%, you&#x27;re taking a huge risk by deciding to enter the market now. Similarly, that super old 6-unit apartment building from 1930 has a ridiculously low tax basis; upgrading to 20 units hugely increases taxes.')
