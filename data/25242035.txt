The buildings will then look impressive while they are impeccably fresh, and just rotten afterwards. Because the eye is then still focused on the same surfaces, now showcasing imperfections. &quot;Minimalistic design&quot; architecture rarely ages well unless aging was deliberately made part of the plan. Highly ornamental architecture however often works quite nicely after aging (or even partial decay), it&#x27;s as if the visible aging gives the ornaments a form of authority they lack while new.<p>I don&#x27;t know wether it would be a simulation approach (&quot;where does how much rain water run down from window sills&quot;) or if some clever deep learning tricks similar to style transfer could be used or a combination. The &quot;how&quot; doesn&#x27;t matter for the effect it could have on how architects and their customers think during the design phase.<p>Marketing a tool like that would not be easy, but with a sustainability angle it should not be impossible either.')
