I agree with you in that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever played a large open world game that didn&#x27;t have a lot of bugs and I&#x27;m not an overly observant gamer. Skyrim was the same way. It&#x27;s just none of them ruin the experience in a way that Cyberpunk for consoles has. I&#x27;ve been playing it on PC and love it but can understand why people are upset regarding the experience on consoles.')
