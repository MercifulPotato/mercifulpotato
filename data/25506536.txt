I completely agree with your take on ORMs and learning SQL.<p>One thing that people get confused with about CoreData is treating it like an ORM; it is not. CoreData is an object persistence framework more in line with object databases than relational databases. The ability to use SQLite is just an implementation detail. It&#x27;s like how Datomic can use a SQL db as a datastore however does not present data relationally.<p>When porting apps back and forth between Android and iOS, the biggest thing I miss on Android is CoreData. CoreData is exceptional at what it does and its a shame that more iOS education doesn&#x27;t focus more on CoreData.')
