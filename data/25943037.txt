If you hype stock to PROFIT from it by selling before it crashes, that is market manipulation. If you hype stock because you believe it is an amazing opportunity, and you happen to diversify before it crashes - that is talking about things in public.<p>A bunch of people hyping each other up? Also talking in public about what they like. If that moves markets?
