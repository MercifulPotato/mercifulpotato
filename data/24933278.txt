The female bedbug has no vagina analogue or other opening in which to leave sperm, so the male bedbug just kind of fucks away at her until he pierces or wears a hole in her exoskeleton and injects his sperm into that, where it floats around in her hemolymph until it finds her eggs. Female bedbugs are thus highly susceptible to coital infection, but those fuckers are nevertheless adapted for survival even despite our efforts to get rid of them.')
