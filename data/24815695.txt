Knowing what lead into WW1 and WW2 spanned for decades before, and were much more important than learning the actual facts of the war.  History isn&#x27;t really the study of what happened, rather it&#x27;s the study of the consequences of what happened.  Going in chronological order gives you a sense of what to expect based off what is happening.')
