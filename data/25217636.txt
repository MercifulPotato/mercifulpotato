A single function might create a couple hash tables, do some data juggling and sorting, and solve a problem in like 20 lines of readable, performant code. In my experience, C coders almost invariably employ less performant algorithms and data structures due to the incidental complexity involved in memory allocation, pointer indirection, etc.')
