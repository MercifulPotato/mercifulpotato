But I left and switched to adblocking after it kept getting worse (YouTube is one of the few sites that I use an adblocker on).<p>- YouTube Music is awful, not a halfway decent product to replace the good Play Music.<p>- Stopped sending emails for video uploads (I know, I&#x27;m weird)<p>- &quot;Premier&quot; videos started to be shown in the RSS feeds. So now I am notified of stuff I can&#x27;t even watch yet.<p>- Half the time videos just play at 360p even though I have never had a second of buffering on my 500Mpbs connection.<p>I think there were a couple of other things that were bugging me. But when they dropped the email notifications and the RSS feeds were terrible it was the last straw for me.<p>I would gladly pay if I felt that they were providing a good service and it was getting better.')
