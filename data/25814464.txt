Item(by='asddubs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610914382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25814332, text='&gt;and then execute them (because it may asychronously loads further scripts whith are required to load the content). And then wait for it all to execute.<p>not to mention potentially rewrite the executable code to still work on the archive copy, or potentially end up with a copy where all clickable links are broken depending on the specifics (and sometimes also content further down the page if scrolling triggers dynamic loading). And if the site doesn&#x27;t update the URLs to be unique for each &quot;page&quot;, well good luck finding that dynamically loaded content in the archive at all to begin with.')
