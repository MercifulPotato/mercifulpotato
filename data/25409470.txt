I see your point tho, but I&#x27;d also say that some of things you describe here are direct result of real world problem domain being complex, and changing over time.<p>For example, wrong abstractions. As long as engineers writing the software are competent (if they aren&#x27;t - that&#x27;s a totally different story) they&#x27;ll try to chose right level of abstractions for current understanding of the problem. Years down the road, a lot of their choices maybe end up to be a mistake, very often because understanding of the problem changed, or problems itself changed, and something that was nice and clean solution isn&#x27;t one anymore. If problem isn&#x27;t fully fixed and 100% understood, you&#x27;ll never be able to make all the right, future-proof decisions about right abstractions.')
