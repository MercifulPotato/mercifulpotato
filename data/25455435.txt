Prior to picking up the additional LG 5K, I used one LG 5K and two 27” Apple Thunderbolt displays.<p>15” MBP, with 4 TB3 ports: LG 5K and two 27” Apple TB displays all working without higher heat than w&#x2F;o them connected<p>13” MBP, with 4 TB3 ports: same triple monitor setup, same no heat &#x2F; fan speed issues.<p>15” rMBP (2015): used two 27” Apple Thunderbolt displays + two 34” ultrawide LG displays, no heat issues or fan issues<p>The only time I’ve ever seen my laptop stressed by connected monitors is when I did an experiment and connected NINE external displays (ten total screens, as laptop screen was still on) as a test to a 16” MBP to see if it could do it. If I’d had more TB monitors to test with, I think I could’ve done higher count.<p>Setup in that test:<p>TB3 port back left: LG 5K display<p>TB3 port front left: two 27” Apple Thunderbolt monitors daisy chained and using TB3-&gt;TB2 adapter<p>TB3 port back right: eGPU w&#x2F; AMD Radeon 580 card connected to two 34” LG ultrawides and two 27” Apple Cinema Display monitors (the older non-TB models)<p>TB3 port front right: same setup as left, two 27” Apple TB displays<p>Even then, it definitely wasn’t “overheating”, but processors did idle much higher and fans stayed on  during idle (but not at high speed).')
