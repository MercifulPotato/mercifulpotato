One challenge is that developers don&#x27;t always know the user facing impact of their improvements.<p>For example if I notice a logic error in a system and fix it, I may not know what if any software configuration could trigger the error. If it were obvious, QA would&#x27;ve found it. And given the choice between further investigation or leaving the bug unfixed, my employer would prefer the latter.<p>Or one time I was working on a new feature that required speeding up the system&#x27;s implementation of malloc(). That improves the performance of the entire system to varying degrees. Pinpointing exactly where the user&#x27;s experience improves would require extensive benchmarking outside the scope of the work.')
