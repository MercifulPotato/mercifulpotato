It&#x27;s quite nice--my images are always better than everyone short of pro streamers.  You can flip the image, color balance, etc. <i>all in the webcam</i> with a remote control (this is why I got it--&quot;flip the image&quot; was causing my laptop fans to screech at max RPM for a different webcam)<p>I&#x27;ve never used it, but if you really need microphone arrays, then probably the Avaya CU360 is probably for you.  Bonus: it&#x27;s standalone Android so you can install all the streaming apps on the device instead of on your computer.<p>And, why not microphone arrays?  Because echo cancelling is a nightmare technology that requires real R&amp;D.  Somebody <i>always</i> gets the setup wrong on conference calls.  The new macs haven&#x27;t been out long enough for me to trust that Apple <i>actually</i> solved the problem any better.')
