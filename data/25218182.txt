This is why the EU is so important: EU can (still) stand up to China, in ways France simply cannot. It would of course be even stronger if UK was still part of it... But in any case the EU cannot sell weapons.<p>I read quite a few French defense forum where netizens are wondering how France could sell weapons to Taiwan, without being singled out. One idea is to sell expertise, parts and maybe even blueprints rather than weapons. &quot;Made in Taiwan&quot; enough not to brush China the wrong way. As long as it looks local enough, China might agree to look the other way. This is of course a rather pessimistic line of thought, as the idea here is that China simply doesn&#x27;t care of a handful of frigates, destroyers and fighters in the hand of the Taiwanese army. They simply don&#x27;t want a slap in the face from a foreign country.<p>To put things in perspective, by 2030 the Chinese vessel fleet is expected to be at least 425 ships strong, versus a target of 355 for the US. [1] With production capabilities vastly superior to that of the Western world. In that regard selling 5 destroyers to Taiwan is probably not a big deal. But maybe it&#x27;s not all that useful.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meta-defense.fr&#x2F;en&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;17&#x2F;the-355-ships-targeted-by-lus-navy-will-be-insufficient-against-china-according-to-mark-esper&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.meta-defense.fr&#x2F;en&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;17&#x2F;the-355-ships-targ...</a>')
