I&#x27;ve never heard &quot;nonlinear&quot; as the opposite of that due to to a constant offset. &quot;Linear map&quot; and &quot;linear operator&quot; are used in contexts where homogeneity is a given.<p>A scaling plus displacement is linear in the sense of &quot;linear equation&quot; because, for instance, if you scale a signal and add DC offset, there is no distortion; no new harmonics are present in the output signal.<p>ax + by + c is called linear because the plot of points which satisfy the equation form a straight line; there is nothing confusing about it whatsoever.<p>Temperature <i>delta</i> conversions between C and F are certainly a linear map&#x2F;operator.  If it gets 5°C hotter, and then 3°C hotter, making 8°C hotter, that&#x27;s exactly like 9°F hotter plus 5.4°F hotter making 14.4°F hotter.<p>Here is a test for linearity for a real-valued one-argument function which is not confused by an offset:<p><pre><code>     x + y      f(x) + f(y)\n  f( ------ ) = -----------\n       2             2\n</code></pre>\nWorks just fine for °C&#x2F;°F.<p>There is another criterion for a linear map that hasn&#x27;t been mentioned, though: f(ax) = af(x).')
