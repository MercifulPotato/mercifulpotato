It was by far my most expensive investment so far (due to exchange rates and import taxes) but it was a complete game changer for me.<p>As much as I was sold on it, a part of me still thought I was being duped into buying something that wouldn&#x27;t really help me in any way but I&#x27;m so glad I was wrong. Typing on the Ergo Dox feels like a completely different experience from regular keyboards, because it fundamentally is. It&#x27;s a keyboard that adapts to my body and arms, as opposed to the other way around which is the (unfortunate) norm.')
