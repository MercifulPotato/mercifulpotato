I also don&#x27;t know of any of my former friends who developed back pain. I actually always put this done to having very good core strength from rowing.<p>In contrast or my cycling friends (which I took up after) have back problems, in particular the ones who started when young.<p>Mind you this was more than 20 years ago so maybe the training regime has changed.')
