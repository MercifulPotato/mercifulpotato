Vanilla OO&#x2F;functional Scala, focused on immutability and functional idioms, but without effect systems and type classes, can be a really beautiful, simple, expressive, highly productive way to develop software.  I&#x27;m neck deep in FP Scala now (the cats ecosystem with cats-effect) and hoping I eventually come to feel the same way about it.<p>I&#x27;m very sad about the Java OO extremists and the Scala functional extremists finding common cause in denying the possibility of moderate, limited use of Scala&#x27;s power.  Programming that way is head and shoulders above Java, and I&#x27;ve yet to see FP Scala match it for productivity (again, hoping and working, so fingers crossed.)')
