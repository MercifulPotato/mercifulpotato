Item(by='davorak', descendants=None, kids=[25706151], score=None, time=1610221850, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25702005, text='&gt;&gt; I could not model&#x2F;implement an Object with an internal state changing method in a fp language via a functor.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think anyone claimed that.<p>I was not trying to refute the opposite claim. I was giving info on the differences of functors and the referenced oop feature. My points run somewhat counter to the authors claim &quot;Functors are basically an Object with a internal state changing method in typical OOP terms.&quot; or at least what I think some reads walk away with. Hard to say what is in the author&#x27;s head with the provided text.<p>&gt; Now we are getting somewhere. You said partially, what features are being left out?<p>I did not mean to imply features would be left out but rather I would use more than the one oop feature, &quot;an Object with an internal state changing method&quot;, to implement functors.')
