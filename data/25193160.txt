They&#x27;re in Zorro. They&#x27;re in Red Dead Redemption. They&#x27;re in Bioshock. They&#x27;re in Boardwalk Empire. They&#x27;re always violent goons, sneaky goons, or violent, sneaky goons.<p>I think maybe the answer is that their name recognition is mud with employees, but that&#x27;s a selling point to management.
