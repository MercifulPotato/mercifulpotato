It will have to be replaced w&#x2F;an HLK test setup, the release engineer and I will have to learn a new process, and possibly get a new signing cert. It&#x27;s not a trivial process, but one we can work through.<p>&gt; the main &quot;victims&quot; of this will be shitty vendors with buggy drivers that lagged in supporting newer Windows variants<p>Some of us have to support customers who are running old versions of Windows, and sometimes we just need to add new features.<p>Think about what you&#x27;re saying. There&#x27;s no reason to denigrate vendors. Also, it&#x27;s not always about bug fixes. A lot of us really care about the quality of our drivers and our customer&#x27;s experience.
