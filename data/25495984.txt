Then issue shares to current staff founders.<p>That is de-facto like handing over equity from previous staff to new investors - you could almost do the math for how much &#x27;old employees&#x27; stock was sold to new investors wherein said old employees didn&#x27;t get a dime.<p>It&#x27;s generally going to happen in negative situations, but that happens a lot.<p>Edit: and it&#x27;s not something your ever going to hear about, it&#x27;s obviously not something leadership wants anyone to know about. Even &#x27;former employees&#x27; who were washed out may not find out - how would they? They&#x27;re not entitled to be notified upon new issuance of shares.')
