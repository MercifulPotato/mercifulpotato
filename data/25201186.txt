Much of the fastest and most important Java tools are written in pure Java (or other JVM language) and as such can&#x27;t be called from Rust in a reasonable way.<p>Writing Big Data code in Rust is certainly possible from a performance perspective but is an uphill battle of lack of libraries, integration, etc. Some of this might change in time but I don&#x27;t see Rust ever displacing Java from Big Data.\nOne of the big reasons for this is the main downside of Java is it&#x27;s GC, which is mainly problematic for latency sensitive applications. In the Big Data field this is substantially reduced as a problem as the code is usually throughput bound and executed outside of interactive contexts, hiding the cost of the GC where it might be more apparent in other applications.<p>I love Rust and I think it has a lot of potential to replace some of the databases and networked services used in data infrastructure, just don&#x27;t see it displacing Java as the top dog.')
