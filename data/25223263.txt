If, for example, anybody could copy your movie, then spending $200M to make it would be a very bad business decision, so people would prioritize other business models and endeavors. Hollywood would be weaker, and Broadway would be stronger. There&#x27;d be a much larger emphasis on live, interactive, and&#x2F;or customizable entertainment experiences.<p>I fail to see a problem here. &quot;But that&#x27;s not how it works today,&quot; isn&#x27;t a problem imo.<p>Let&#x27;s say we made recipes broadly patentable. I&#x27;m sure that would change the restaurant industry into something unrecognizable over time. 100 years from now we&#x27;d see all sorts of massive businesses profiting in ways that are unimaginable today. Those businesses&#x27; existence wouldn&#x27;t imply the laws were good.
