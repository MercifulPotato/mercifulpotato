Rework is the last thing you want when your time is valuable.<p>A former partner of mine was a documentary film-maker and I observed on many occasions times where she spent way to much time trying to make up for bad or out of sync audio. I encouraged her to make changes in her equipment, but not because of the minor improvements in video or quality over her current equipment, but just because the likelihood of rework would be much lower. The video and audio quality at the end was very comparable, but the cost to get from A to B ended up being much better time-wise.')
