They have a search monopoly and supposedly are heavily biased on speed as a ranking factor. Well golly gee, if you want the Web to be a lot faster, smash sites with brutal speed ranking penalties until they get the message. It wouldn&#x27;t be difficult nor would it take much time to get the point across (in fact it would be trivially easy). There is no other logical explanation other than Google&#x27;s intentions are gatekeeper (and plausibly much worse in time: hostage taker), not primarily to make the Web a better place (that&#x27;s merely the lie they&#x27;re pitching as a cover story).')
