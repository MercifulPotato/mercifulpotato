There was a ~3 year period of my life where all it would have taken is one bad month. Just one. And it wasn&#x27;t for lack of trying, or because of laziness or mental illness. Just real bad luck and starting out in a not-great place within a not-great system.<p>Homelessness is a hole that is easy to fall into and damn hard to fall out of, and not to be insensitive but the assumptions you&#x27;re making are part of the problem.<p>When you assume that homelessness is fundamentally caused by a fault in the person, that person is basically dammed to stay homeless. The things you say here are the same reasons people give to not hire a homeless person. &quot;They must either be crazy or lazy, neither of which is an employee I want&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s not to mention the fact that there are a surprising number of homeless people that <i>do</i> have jobs, but just don&#x27;t make enough money to save up to get anything better (which, yes, is a failing of the system). Most people don&#x27;t realize this if they haven&#x27;t lived it, but being poor is <i>very expensive</i>.<p>&gt; He basically gave up on the system and finds it easier to just let family support him.<p>Some people don&#x27;t have a family that could support another person.')
