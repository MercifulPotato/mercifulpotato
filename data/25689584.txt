Some small number of people have been convicted of VOTER FRAUD.  Please do not conflate the two, as the scope of their impact is completely different.<p>&gt; You can&#x27;t shut people up.<p>I literally ASKED why people are still raising one specific objection.<p>No one has attempted an actual defense of that specific objection.  They have moved the goalposts to other objections.<p>It is unreasonable to bring up objections to Dominion voting machines in Georgia in the 2020 election.
