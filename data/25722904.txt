Anything beyond that is subjective, and you get your hands dirty really quick (ie try arguing that the Scalise shooting - by a Bernie volunteer against Republican congressmen - is completely divorced from Bernie, but the Capitol events are completely tied to Trump).<p>Ergo this amounts to banning people - almost all on one side of politics, even if a fringe thereof - for saying things that appear to be untrue. Not even a hint of violence or a call thereto, just an opinion that is believed to be wrong.<p>Are we quite sure we&#x27;re happy with people losing their income and livelihood and brand and platform, just because the tech companies don&#x27;t agree with their claims?<p>Do you know how many smaller, left-of-centre groups will quickly get caught up in that once they join this discussion around unionising the workforce of the tech giants?<p>You may despise Bannon, and I find it hard to believe he&#x27;s an earnest actor, but think through the steps for how this happened. He&#x27;s being banned for an opinion, entirely separate from any risk to anyone, and to argue otherwise (ie an implicit call to violence against the blamed party) would open you up to the claim that blaming anything in the last week on Trump is a call to violence against the president and&#x2F;or his supporters, and is thus equally bannable.<p>Is that reasonable? Should all opinions on this topic result in permanent banning and deplatforming?')
