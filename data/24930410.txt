I think we both over-simplified as these are logarithmic ratios, not linear.<p>On to speculation: the interaction between the waves and the ocean floor may be hitting one, of many, of these magic numbers in this scenario. It&#x27;s possible two periods of waves interact to cause this 26s interval, since waves are always grouped. Also, consider how the waves may have combinatorial feedback loops due to stokes drift (doppler effect) in deeper water.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating the latest research on microeism seems to be from the 50&#x27;s. There&#x27;s very few resources describing what happens to waves as they move from shallow to deeper water.')
