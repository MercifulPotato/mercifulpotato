Those property owners can be targeted with tax exemptions without the &quot;unintended&quot; consequences of Proposition 13. The vast majority of the beneficiaries of Proposition 13 are not seniors who would be put on the street, and the fact that the tax benefit is inheritable makes the idea that this was the purpose of the initiative even more of a farce.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sccassessor.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;department-organization&#x2F;property-tax-exemptions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sccassessor.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;department-or...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sccgov.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;dtac&#x2F;tax&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;parcel-tax-exemptions.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sccgov.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;dtac&#x2F;tax&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;parcel-tax-exemp...</a>')
