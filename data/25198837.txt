Living standards are much higher than they used to be. Should they be restored as actual usable apartments? If so you&#x27;re going to think about the heating, cooling, the insulation etc. etc. etc.<p>Should they be restored as historical exhibit? OK, sure. But then the space isn&#x27;t really being <i>used</i>. IMO these are interesting but they&#x27;re not such an important part of history that they must be preserved exactly the way they are today.')
