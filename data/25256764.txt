TSLA has gone from $191 to $576 since June, GOOG from $1394-&gt;$1761, AMZN $2478-&gt;$3143, ZM $262-&gt;$466.  Where I&#x27;m at restaurant meals have gone from about $13&#x2F;plate to $20&#x2F;plate, and houses have gone from ~$1.6M -&gt; $2.1M.<p>BTC&#x27;s rise isn&#x27;t all that out of line with any of those.  I think you&#x27;re seeing investors rush out of dollars and into anything that&#x27;ll have hard value in the digital economy going forward.  Inflation doesn&#x27;t hit all markets evenly, so you may not see it in your paycheck yet (if you still have a paycheck) and areas without a lot of people seeing money come in won&#x27;t have prices rise as much.  But I think you should read this as a currency crisis for the dollar, not a bubble for Bitcoin.')
