I was rewatching video from people storming the capitol.  They were not armed and they were all milling about without a plan. Even the lady that was shot was unarmed<p>Edit2: I think we are being hoodwinked.  We saw lots of angry people storming the capitol out of frustration, provoked by false information fed to them.  I don’t think the disinformation campaign stopped at the rally, I think it is continuing now.  Everyone is being led to believe that the folks who walked in were acting the same as the Michigan capitol protest earlier last year.  It was not like that.  It was a bunch of people thinking they were going to make a difference and ended up not having a clue of what they were going to do.  The orderly exit of most leaving the capitol building is proof of this.<p>I just ask before you rage downvote to pause and think is this the division they (those making the narrative of DC burning vs Capitol Siege) are trying to sow? Both actions are heinous and doesn’t look good for America regardless of how you try to spin it.')
