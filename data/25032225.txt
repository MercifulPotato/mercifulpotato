What&#x27;s the point of open source if companies just steal it, build billion dollar industries on top, and then lock everything down?<p>Apple is telling us we can&#x27;t run our own software on their goddamned devices, yet they built their empire on open source.<p>Look at Facebook, Google, Amazon. They&#x27;ve extracted all the blood they can and given us back scraps. AWS is repackaged software you pay <i>more</i> for. Yes, it&#x27;s managed, but you&#x27;re forever a renter.<p>They&#x27;ve destroyed our open web, replaced RSS with DRM, left us with streaming and music options worse than cable and personal audio libraries.<p>The web is bloated with ads and tracking, AMP is given preference, Facebook and Twitter are testing the limits of democracy and radicalizing everyone to cancel one another.<p>Remember when the Internet was actually pleasant? When it was nice to build stuff for others to use?<p>Stop giving your work away for free when the companies only take.')
