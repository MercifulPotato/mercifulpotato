Does anyone? I find the article frustrating because it doesn&#x27;t have data to prove it&#x27;s core assertion.<p>Full disclosure, I&#x27;ve been using Robinhood, for a several years, to buy small amounts of stocks or ETFs I want, with limit orders, when volatility drives the price down. Everything I buy I intend to hold for a *long time.<p>And I really appreciate that they offer low fees, in % terms, on small orders. So it allows me to gain experience as an investor, not trader.')
