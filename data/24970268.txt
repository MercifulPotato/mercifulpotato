However, I didn&#x27;t see anything like that in the video. I assumed this meant they didn&#x27;t want to show that run because the potential danger of being blown off the road wouldn&#x27;t look good. Perhaps they mixed the speed data with a safer run from earlier in the day. This would explain the discrepancies.<p>If this is true, perhaps they are simply using the calibration talk as a red herring to distract from the misleading video. This scenario would allow them to not take responsibility and comeback with a genuine record.')
