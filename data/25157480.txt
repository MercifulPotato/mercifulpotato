A strongly-typed language would fail loudly and predictably if a blob of JSON didn’t match the expected format. In some situations, that’s preferable to having invalid data work it’s way through the system, or having to manually implement type checking<p>I’m a fan of the Runtypes library for this use case. If you design your typescript interfaces using the library (admittedly a bit magical to me) you can get runtime errors if API data doesn’t match the expected type')
