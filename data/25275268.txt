As is consistently true of government run organisations it was run so badly that most of the NHS didn&#x27;t even try to use its services. At the time of the privatisation the NHS sourced around half a million products but only acquired 50,000 of them via NHS Logistics. The entire purpose of privatising it was to try and make it work better and thus to encourage the NHS to buy more centrally to get bulk discounts, something that wasn&#x27;t going to happen for as long as doing so required them to work with a small, sclerotic socialised bureaucracy.<p>Why would anyone think that an organisation which had no economies of scale, nor any demonstrated expertise in logistics in a competitive environment, be better at delivering things than DHL, a world famous delivery and logistics company that the NHS frequently chose to use anyway in preference to its own operation? That&#x27;s ideology.<p>How much did NHS Logistics workers care about the health of the citizens who paid their salaries? Not at all: even though many of them were going to keep their jobs anyway they reacted to privatisation by going on strike and <i>picketing trucks to stop them delivering supplies to hospitals</i>. That&#x27;s ideology. Fortunately it didn&#x27;t kill anyone, but only because hospitals were already mostly bypassing the striking workers already due to aforementioned poor performance.<p>The NHS had its limits thrown into sharp focus this year. Mass testing is a bad idea, but putting that to one side for a moment, Germany and indeed most other places were able to ramp up test volumes far faster than the UK did, because Germany used private labs from the start when the NHS insisted on only using NHS labs, despite being given direct commands to scale up testing as fast as possible. That&#x27;s ideology.<p>Finally, the supply chain hasn&#x27;t been effectively renationalised. The contract changed from DHL to Unipart:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spendmatters.com&#x2F;uk&#x2F;dhl-challenges-loss-of-nhs-logistics-contract-is-unipart-capable&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spendmatters.com&#x2F;uk&#x2F;dhl-challenges-loss-of-nhs-logis...</a><p>Supply Chain Coordination Ltd is what the name suggests: a relatively small coordinating body that manages contracts for various services, including contracts for logistics provisioning.<p>The brutal reality about the NHS is that not a single country in the world has copied this model. If it was good we&#x27;d see other countries adopt it but they don&#x27;t. They don&#x27;t adopt it because it&#x27;s not good: this model is a relic of a time when the British public had just won a world war and as such had been exposed to years of war propaganda that made the government look artificially competent. In countries where that didn&#x27;t happen the idea you&#x27;d want a single, centralised government agency to run every aspect of something as vital as healthcare was seen as insane: after all, if you go down that route why not have the government supply all food too? All entertainment? Why not run a fully USSR-style economy? Well because we know it doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s why. There&#x27;s nothing magical about the NHS that renders all those experiences irrelevant.')
