Item(by='ksec', descendants=None, kids=[25253240], score=None, time=1606735812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25251860, text='&gt;I mean Ive got to think you <i>must know</i> both those points are true.<p>Hardware relating Comments on HN has always been fairly low quality to say the least, comparatively speaking to many other subjects. But Apple M1 sort of brings the worst out of it. My current counting right now over 10K comment suggest most have very limited understanding of Hardware tech, little on Hardware business, and quite literally zero on supply chain.<p>So I would not be suspired If many <i>doesn&#x27;t know</i>.<p>I could count people with one hand who have to constantly comment and correcting all the wrong assumption, TSMC capacity limitation, NAND and DRAM price fixing etc etc. And now we have Apple&#x27;s supply chain monopoly.<p>The world currently ships approx ~1.2B Smartphone every year, and Apple represent less than 20% of it. And if you include Tablet, PC and Laptop ( Which shares the same supply chain ) Apple is much closer to 10%. The premium Apple pays is not leading edge ( apart from 5nm TSMC ) but <i>very</i> strict quality control and capacity guarantee.<p>My observation into this issue, is that most software developers and tech workers are so far removed from old model ( non-tech ) of business they have very little understanding of Logistics, Supply Chain, Lead Time, Sales Channel, Distribution and Discovery ( Marketing ). And ironically enough the world <i>best</i> company at doing all of the above is also a tech Company called Apple.')
