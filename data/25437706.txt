It&#x27;s still not really feasible today but thousands of people are working on it and progress is being made.<p>I think email is a great example as it&#x27;s a highly successful protocol that unifies most applications together. When you go to a website you sign up with your email. It&#x27;s universal. You can guarantee that someone can interface with you via email in a way you can&#x27;t with centralized services like Facebook. There have been some businesses that primarily work on Facebook but it&#x27;s uncommon and they always have email as a backup. If you want to notify someone of something or provide an official service it will be over email. Email wins because it&#x27;s decentralized, warts and all.')
