Since we were comparing it to something that has only one year of support to come, I thought it was fair to count any more than that as &quot;years&quot;<p>Amazon has a historically good record and reputation for supporting things longer rather than axing them early. Look at what they&#x27;ve done with Amazon Linux 1, which was supposed to be EOL this summer: (they made a judgement call that people still needed the support, and extended security updates for at least another year.)<p>Regardless of the dates that are on paper, I think you&#x27;re the one that&#x27;s being pedantic now. What&#x27;s the last time that Amazon ended support for anything that was in GA? It&#x27;s absolutely fair to say years to come, when making this comparison.')
