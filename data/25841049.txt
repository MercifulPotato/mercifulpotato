My general assumption has been that &quot;child labor&quot; in the international industrial context was grade school children (5-12 years old or so) working, often in a compulsory manner.<p>As someone who worked since the age of 14 (part-time) here in the US to help put food on the table, I don&#x27;t see an issue with 14+ yr olds working. That was in the late 90&#x27;s, but I can&#x27;t imagine there aren&#x27;t 14yr olds working in the US in all manner of jobs today after school and on weekends. The existence of of such jobs here in the US was the difference between food or going hungry for my family. I have to imagine that in less developed parts of the world this version of &quot;child labor&quot; may actually do more to lift those families out of poverty than eliminating them. Unfortunately, as you said, it&#x27;s hard to discern what the nature and context of this labor truly is.')
