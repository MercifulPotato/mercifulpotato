The one time where deep learning maybe shouldn&#x27;t be attempted at all is when the number of samples is very limited. While it excels with high dimensional hierarchical data it can do well on other problems as well. It differentiates from problem to problem and usually multiple solutions are tried and compared, starting with EDA and linear regression.')
