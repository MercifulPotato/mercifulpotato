I certainly don&#x27;t want it as commercialized and as centralized as it is today.<p>I also take issue with this whole dumbing down of technology that&#x27;s been happening over at least the last 10 years and shows no signs of stopping. It&#x27;s understandable that there are certain business entities that would prefer to be in possession of as much money as technically possible, and to achieve that, they need to give their products into as many hands as possible, which means said products have to be &quot;easy to use&quot;, aka don&#x27;t require reading manuals and understanding what the damn thing is actually doing.<p>Computers and other computer-like devices like smartphones are, ultimately, tools. As are the programs they run. And tools are meant to serve and empower their end user. 99% of the IT industry, unfortunately, would rather like them not, because that clashes with their own interests they for some reason are allowed by the society to have. That&#x27;s all I have to say.')
