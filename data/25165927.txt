It&#x27;s basically semi-skilled (at best) professional services- why don&#x27;t companies just pay external recruiters per hour to find candidates, the same way you pay your accountant, attorney, etc.? (Though at a much lower rate, of course- $50 to an absolute max of $100 an hour).<p>It would likely be cheaper for the hiring companies, and ultimately aid both the company&#x27;s brand (no push recruiters on commission) and improve the industry overall (same). I understand that&#x27;s not a VC-backed model type of business, but does seem like a logical transition for the recruiting industry overall')
