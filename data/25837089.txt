Personal observation.  \nWhen I first got the radio I tested it at our groups ham shack.  I was 150&#x27; away from our repeater (open field, no obstructions) and could not get the repeater to acknowledge my signal.   I could hear everybody fine, but could not TX.\nOne of my buddies handed me a spare antenna, and presto I was able to use the repeater.  I was also able to hear repeaters that were 20+km away that I couldn&#x27;t tune-in on the rubber duck.\nTransmit and receive improved with a different antenna.\nI thought I had a bad radio, bad transmit button, or bad microphone before I swapped out antennas.<p>My statement is 100% accurate based on my observations.  Grumbles from the other members in my group agreed with the sentiment.  They ship with bad antennas.')
