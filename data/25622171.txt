For an article about writing UI, it spends a lot of time laying out all the short-coming of using C to build a UI toolkit.<p>Amusingly, Qt is mentioned as initially not having a FOSS license but &quot;now available in version 6 with much less restricted licenses&quot;... that&#x27;s quite a weak praise given that it is available as LGPL, GPL or commercial non FOSS licensing. He then goes on criticizing Qt for being bloated. Most people would rather say that is very feature-rich. Qt is also modular. You don&#x27;t need to include libraries you don&#x27;t use.<p>English does not seems to be the author native language; there are many bad choices of word, like saying that C in &quot;restricted&quot;; I think he meant it is &quot;limited&quot;.')
