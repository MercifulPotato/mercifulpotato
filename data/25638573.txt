There is virtually zero user-facing documentation. Need to know how to backup keys, verify another user, or what E2EE means? Ask your server operator. Basically the onus is on operators to document this stuff for their users. Except the stuff we&#x27;re documenting is hard even for server operators, and especially challenging to document in a way that both nontechnical and technical users can understand.<p>2. Because this stuff is challenging even for more technically minded users to understand, it leads to a kind of burnout for interested non-technical users where they learn all they can about some feature and how it works at a high level from out of date random blogs, try to use the (complex, multi-step) feature, but then something won&#x27;t work, and it isn&#x27;t be clear whether it was because the user did something wrong or because the clients or server implementations are broken<p>3. Issues where core functionality is broken (e.g. two mutually verified users on my homeserver haven&#x27;t been able to talk to each other in months -- see [1], [2], [3]) languish for months with zero response from maintainers.<p>4. While core functionality is both broken and undocumented, the maintainers announce rabbit hole features that no one asked for and seem very much like distractions, like their recently-announced microblogging view&#x2F;client[4]<p>In short the Element maintainers have shown little interest in making the platform accessible to the people who need its differentiating features the most, and have prioritized the &quot;mad science&quot;&#x2F;technical aspect of their platform at the expense of the human element (end-users and operators).<p>It&#x27;d be cool if Element used their resources to hire some UX folks and community advocates whose sole focus is addressing the horrid accessibility of their platform. I think most users would rather see that than further &quot;mad science&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-ios&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3762" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-ios&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3762</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-ios&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3572" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-ios&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3572</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-ios&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3393" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-ios&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3393</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;introducing-cerulean" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;introducing-cerulean</a>')
