The SEC identified $34mm in poor execution. If you did 65c each way per option contract &amp; free stock trades that would only be 52.3m option trades. That&#x27;s miniscule. That&#x27;s over 5 years. It would take a whole lot of unidentified trades for that to be substantial.<p>The spread on most trades is probably in the range of 50c on low liquidity shares and $1 on low liquidity options.<p>Perhaps the reason RH collects more in revenue from order flow is because they:<p>1) get paid more for their order flow on a per trade basis<p>2) they don&#x27;t collect any fees from options driving down revenue<p>3) they charge less for margin fees with less users using margin<p>There are any number of reasons, but to say that you&#x27;re getting royally screwed is a massive stretch in my mind. Prior to RH fees were outrageous. The fees are still outrageous on my self-directed 401k. I&#x27;m not getting $10 in losses from bad execution.')
