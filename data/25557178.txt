It is a fundamental part of the scientific method that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on a priori reasoning, intuition, or revelation. &quot;<p>The key word here is &quot;solely&quot; meaning that empiricism involves the addition of observational evidence on top of other forms of analysis.<p>Additionally take this sentence: &quot;Empiricism, often used by natural scientists, says that &quot;knowledge is based on experience&quot; and that &quot;knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and falsification&quot;<p>Note that falsification used here cannot exist without assuming logic is true.')
