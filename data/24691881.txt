They&#x27;d orient themselves to regulate their exposure to the sun&#x27;s rays, arranging themselves in a horizontal plane on top of the rock when the sun was overhead, and vertically along the side of the rock when the sun was at an angle.<p>The first &quot;desire&quot; was the want of energy.  The first behaviour was to move towards the sun.<p>The first communication was the signal that was passed through the colony of cells to coordinate the movement of the whole community into a mutually beneficial configuration.<p>The first conflict was when the colony became large enough and so diversely distributed that a part of the community &quot;decided&quot; it would rather not obey the signal to move and instead would move to its own preferred surface of the rock.')
