Item(by='elihu', descendants=None, kids=[24762826], score=None, time=1602568758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24762420, text='I haven&#x27;t read the book and maybe the argument is solid, but I&#x27;m inclined to disagree.  For mining, maybe Mars isn&#x27;t the best place (hoisting stuff out of the gravity well might not be worth it except for high-value metals), but on the other hand it has decent gravity and an atmosphere, which means it&#x27;s more suitable for human habitation and fuel processing than the asteroids.  And living on a planet has a certain appeal that living on a ship doesn&#x27;t.<p>In the far future we might have better habitats in the asteroid belt than on Mars, but that&#x27;s pretty far out.  In the medium term, I expect Mars will be an important fuel stop at the least.<p>I guess there&#x27;d be a kind of a self-perpetuating economic force at work: mining would be most lucrative when the products can be consumed near where they&#x27;re made, and if there&#x27;s a heavy demand for construction in the asteroid belts then the asteroid belts are where most of the materials will come from.  If it&#x27;s on Mars, then the materials will be gotten on Mars.  (That&#x27;s assuming that material shipment is expensive.  On the other hand, if you can mine iron in the belts and then just lob it at Mars with a rail gun and have the Martians drive out in rovers to collect the splatters of molten metal off the surface, then maybe the economics of non-local mining can work out.)')
