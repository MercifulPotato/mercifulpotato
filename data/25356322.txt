But you can already do this with HTML?<p>The only advantage I see is that you can actually support markdown like you do in your page, since it&#x27;s less verbose than HTML-tags and doesn&#x27;t make the text unreadable if you read it as plain text.<p>But with HTML5 you can introduce arbitrary tag names to pretty much get the same with an XML-like structure instead of json. Just use &lt;subtitle&gt; &lt;what&gt; &lt;description&gt; and supply CSS for it. If you want to consume it with something else, swap out the JSON parser for an XML one, navigate to the body tag and from there on it&#x27;s the same thing.<p>I mean it&#x27;s a cool trick you came up with, but it doesn&#x27;t seem worth the effort, and relying on quirks mode seems brittle.')
