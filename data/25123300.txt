The only real problem with that is when it is done accidentally. If they want to continue to code and advance their technical career, this isn&#x27;t the right move. If they want to move out of coding and into leadership, this is a good move.<p>Either way, deliberately acknowledging that they are now a PO will help focus their efforts, as there is a wealth of information online about doing that role well.')
