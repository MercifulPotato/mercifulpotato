If you are not happy with your current path then make a change.  This is challenging if you have dependents, but if you are single then just go do something else.  Nothing is stopping you from a life change more than yourself.<p>Here are some common expectations to dispell:<p>* Unless it is in writing and legally binding nobody owns you anything.  This is deeper than it sounds and many people struggle with this in a very infantile way.<p>* Don&#x27;t be a freeloader.  Don&#x27;t expect people to give you assistance.  Assistance is wonderful when you need it, but if you are dependent upon assistance people will come to think of you as a disease.<p>* Don&#x27;t wait for somebody to tell when you when to start.  Waiting is a waste.  Just go.  If you are wrong about something you can correct for it later.<p>* Don&#x27;t expect all of life&#x27;s problems to be solved by social structures.  I have spoken with teenagers who expect to get into a good school or expect to have the most wonderful job once they graduate.  Imposing false promises upon yourself results in more disappointment than action.  If you want a wonderful job then start by working your ass off to be wonderful at your job.<p>* Don&#x27;t expect somebody else to do your job for you, which includes tools and frameworks.  Sometimes you have to get your hands dirty to solve a problem.  Reliance on helpers to do your job for you is great until they can&#x27;t solve a given problem then your fucked.  Even worse is when that tool is no longer available, which is worse because the result is defensive behavior that nobody wants to associate with.<p>* Be goal oriented.  If you know what you are striving for you can backwards plan the steps necessary to accomplish it.  If you manage a team write those goals down and expose them to your team so that the team moves towards the goal as a collected unit.<p>* Understand the nature of vanity.  Vanity is necessary to set positive impressions and satisfy customer experience.  Beyond that vanity carries a diminishing return over time with an inversely proportional cost.')
