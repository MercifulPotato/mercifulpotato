Because of policies that favor landowners housing in California has become primarily an investment instead of a place to live.<p>However it&#x27;s not simple supply and demand. We have a ton of &quot;speculative demand&quot; which increases when prices rise and we can&#x27;t reasonably stop that by building more. Yes California needs to build but even if we started Shanghai levels of growth today it&#x27;s unlikely we&#x27;d get affordable cities before climate change renders the state unlivable.<p>We need to kill land speculation and taxes are the right way to do that.')
