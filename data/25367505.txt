We&#x27;re talking about photo-filtered cell phone camera shots here. Facebook doesn&#x27;t need a user acquisition ploy. I guess maybe it&#x27;s a move to keep users in Facebook, but I&#x27;d be willing to bet a million bucks that almost everyone is discovering Instagram content via Facebook or Twitter. Seems like mostly a huge waste of cash.')
