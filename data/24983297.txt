She gave me their name and number, but I was stumped. How the hell did:\n1. They know that was my mother\n2. How did they know her number\n3. How did they know she would be able to reach me?<p>I&#x27;ve subsequently determined that my ICE information was leaked somehow. This is the <i>only</i> piece of information, other than life insurance, where my mother and I would be positioned as related. I do not have a Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit. I have this profile, which is my average online profile, and I have a professional one. Neither has ties back to my family, much less phone numbers. We also live in totally different states and they were calling her about a job for me in my current state and city.<p>I would say it is already unethical to dox someone, just if you do it in the name of sales or &quot;connecting people&quot; Americans somehow sweep it under the rug.<p>This is just a matter of correcting societal expectations.')
