Even within the 3d space, quantum chemistry effects produce an even higher order of &quot;effective&quot; dimensionality. Finding stable paths that don&#x27;t interact in 2d is hard, but easier in 3d. Its even easier in hyper dimensional spaces where other chemical properties can be used to provide pathways for only specific reactions.')
