You&#x27;re going to a professional event with your boss. Each of you is driving their own car and your boss is following you. Now your boss knows you have an expired warranty, which, whether you like it or not, will reflect badly on your professional image. You may think this scenario is far-fetched, but it <i>will</i> happen regularly because people who know each other sometimes drive with each other. The same kind of stuff happens with highly personalized advertising on your laptop. All these things seem inoffensive but seriously violate user privacy and <i>will</i> (for sure) get people in trouble in the end.')
