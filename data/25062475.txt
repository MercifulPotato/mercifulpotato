And meanwhile they&#x27;ll working on some other tech that&#x27;s ready for that engineering stage yet. Theoretical physics isn&#x27;t applied physics isn&#x27;t prototype engineering isn&#x27;t process optimization engineering.<p>You need people and organizations working on every TRL step, and they aren&#x27;t interchangeable, you need the preceding step well-funded to make your work possible and you need to move the results to the following steps since those will harvest the actual end-user value in the end.')
