And really, it is just smaller transistors. Yes, that glibly does a disservice to the process engineers making this miracle happen, but I can get excited about &quot;look, smaller transistors!&quot; only so many times in my lifetime. :)<p>&gt;  optics on silicon,<p>Yep! That and quantum and post VNeumann architectures. There&#x27;s some weird shit on the horizon that I probably won&#x27;t live to see in household products, but I don&#x27;t think it will be be optical deposition by layer. It might, who knows, I&quot;m officially talking out my arse now. :)')
