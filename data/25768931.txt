If you&#x27;ve got the tooling set up it&#x27;s a lot of setting of envars. It&#x27;s not trivial but it&#x27;s also not super difficult. A compiler running native on an architecture doesn&#x27;t produce any different output than the same compiler doing a cross compilation.<p>Even if you wanted to run a native RISC-V build process, running it in QEMU on a much more powerful AMD64 system will get you the same results in a fraction of the time. This gets much faster feedback in the CI system.')
