That seems overly restrictive - where does that leave services in which sharing data is the whole point of the service?<p>The article goes on to say: &quot;Grindr made use of the app conditional on consenting to data sharing or to paying a subscription fee.&quot;<p>Is this the unacceptable part?  I.e. Grindr is creating a financial penalty for users who exercise their data privacy rights?<p>Would it be acceptable under GDPR to run an app where the choice is &quot;consent to sharing data or do not use this app at all&quot;?')
