Just set a rate&#x2F;minute and track each user&#x27;s usage and bill them monthly.<p>Then pay the same rate&#x2F;minute (minus a super small commission %) to the artists of whom the music was streamed.<p>This would mean that artists get a fair share for what they contribute. If Madonna releases a new album which is a flop then why should she still get the same payout as her last album which was a hit? Equally, if a new artist releases a real banger why should they get less for their talent only because their name is less established as someone else?<p>This model would also allow a platform like Spotify to push the rate&#x2F;minute slowly up until they reach a point where demand and supply meet happily. We would be able to find the real value of good music which consumers are willing to pay.')
