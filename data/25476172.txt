Item(by='Geminidog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608368139, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25476030, text='&gt;In mathematics we write a² + b² = c² to describe the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.<p>Therein lies the problem. Can you explain to me the meaning of  a² + b² = c² without English? Can you just write down an equation and expect me to know what you&#x27;re talking about?<p>Can you explain to me the concept of entropy by just showing me all the equations?<p>Can you explain to me the meaning of your program with only one letter variable names as shown in your Pythagorean equation above?<p>You can&#x27;t. That&#x27;s why math texts consist of equations AND English, and there&#x27;s no reason programming shouldn&#x27;t either.<p>Anyway a side note, have you ever heard of literate programming?')
