I like to let the code &quot;tell me what to do&quot;; I&#x27;m building something, and I repeat the pattern a few times, so I keep an eye on it. Eventually, I&#x27;ll have a few repeated patterns I can look at. A lot of times, they&#x27;re similar, but not the same. Waiting gives me the opportunity to review several similar patterns and find a more elegant solution that can accommodate all of the use cases, rather than forcing a sub-optimal abstraction for the sake of being DRY alone.')
