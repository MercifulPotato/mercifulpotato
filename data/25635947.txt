Over wifi in-home is more, closer to 20-30ms with a mediocre laptop wifi card. Playing online with my brother who lives 35 miles away using an Ethernet connection I typically see 15-25ms latency, not much worse than a &#x27;meh&#x27; bluetooth controller. It&#x27;s likely worth noting that my brother and I both have the same cable internet provider, but we also sometimes play with my brother-in-law who lives another 40 miles from me (~60 miles from my brother) and we can all play games like Streets of Rogue together from my brother&#x27;s PC without issue.')
