So, that&#x27;s why he needs to offer convincing evidence. It sounds like he offers none (I haven&#x27;t read it, just relying on the summary above).<p>My point was more that a physicist may be an authority on the technology itself, but would not necessarily be an authority on the affects it has on a biological system. That&#x27;s why it has to be a multi-discipliniary approach rather than people being immediately dismissed for not being physicists.\nWhy would you think that a physicist would be more of an authority on causes of human disease than an epidemiologist?<p>&gt; The claim that these are new innovations that &quot;biological scientists can&#x27;t keep up&quot; is just obviously false on its face so what is he talking about?<p>Ok his wording is pretty over the top here, but he literally points to a study which suggests as much.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not surprised at all to discover one of them thinks 5G causes cancer<p>It was actually the IARC working group for evaluating carcinogenic risks to humans. He was merely referencing their study and findings.\nAnd actually, once again, they&#x27;re not saying that 5G causes cancer. They&#x27;re saying that the evidence from their specific study suggests it might, but it&#x27;s not conclusive, and that further studies are required to get better evidence either way.<p>Look I&#x27;m not saying that the evidence suggests 5G is harmful, I&#x27;m just taking issue with some of the specific dismissals presented above as I think they selectively cut out parts of the quotes that actually change their meaning somewhat.')
