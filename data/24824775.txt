Liability.<p>Because of this they are not willing to do anything even slightly outside of code, and any decision that needs making is a phone call to the engineer rather than making the call on the job.<p>This slows everyone down as nobody is keen to actually be the one with responsibility. The engineeer who feels the same way also make sure that everything is overspecced to all hell to make extra cirtain that they wonâ€™t be liable for anything failing.')
