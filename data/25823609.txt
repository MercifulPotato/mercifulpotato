About 50% of US government spending is health and social services. So even cutting <i>everything else to zero</i> is only a doubling of health and social services. A doubling isn&#x27;t nothing, but a game changer? And not all (or even most) of that other 50% will be spending you feel is frivolous, so it would be much less than doubling.')
