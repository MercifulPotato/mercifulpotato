I want to be efficient.  It&#x27;s incredible just how bad UIs have gotten in the last 10 years.<p>I use Nextcloud and there are parts of the UI that defy logic.  For example, when I select a file it brings up an &quot;Actions&quot; menu that&#x27;s hidden via a hamburger button.  It has 4 options and I have about 3000px of horizontal whitespace on the same row.<p>TLDR; It&#x27;s all hamburgers and whitespace and I don&#x27;t understand why.')
