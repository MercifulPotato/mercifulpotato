I think the &quot;credit card ritual&quot; is usually just a way to show they are not rushing you out the door.<p>something to understand about america: in general the protections for ordinary folks are pretty bad, but the act of paying for a good&#x2F;service is sacred. if you (or one of your employees) fuck over a customer, they have ample remedies against you.')
