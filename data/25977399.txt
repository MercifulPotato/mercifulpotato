Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=[25977826], score=None, time=1612085002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25977280, text='I guess I&#x27;m so far to the left that I have a hard time believing in &quot;cancel culture&quot; as anything meaningful.<p>Take the example of Steven Pinker, given in article.<p>Those students explicitly said that they were not trying to cancel Pinker, and the goal was not to expel him from the association, but only to have the association withdraw special privileges that Picker was granted.<p>How is that &quot;cancel&quot;?<p>Now compare it to the calls to get Cheney out of office in WY. How is that <i>not</i> cancel culture? Or when Milo Yiannopoulos was de-platformed from the Republican convention - again, why isn&#x27;t that called &quot;cancel culture&quot;?<p>My conclusion is that &quot;cancel culture&quot; is a made-up term used to minimize the negative influence of criticism from the left, even when valid.<p>As for &quot;in denial&quot;, I am reminded of Phil Ochs&#x27; commentary in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Love_Me,_I%27m_a_Liberal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Love_Me,_I%27m_a_Liberal</a> :<p>&gt;    In every American community there are varying shades of political opinion. One of the shadiest of these is the liberals. An outspoken group on many subjects, ten degrees to the left of center in good times, ten degrees to the right of center if it affects them personally. Here, then, is a lesson in safe logic.<p>and of MLK&#x27;s grave disappointment with white moderates.')
