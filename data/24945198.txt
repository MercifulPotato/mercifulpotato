These days it&#x27;s increasingly possible to create models with enough free parameters and complicated math that you can sift through noise with the right filters and get what you were looking for.  This is even more troublesome for unimodal phenomena.  There has only been a singular multimodal observation that correlates with a GW observation; and that&#x27;s troubling especially since the number of unimodal observations is increasing, and so the statistics of how often we would expect random signals to correlate (with the three prongs of the detector, and then with a multimodal observation) is getting murkier and harder for third parties to review.<p>The truly disciplined experiment is to do a double-blinded study: over a timespan record events in secret.  Then augment the GW data with 3x fictional events (say, fix the times and magnitudes but randomize azimuth&#x2F;altitude).  Challenge EM observers to correlate with these events, break the seal, and see if multimodal observations pass a simple chi-squared test.')
