I didn&#x27;t claim it in a research paper for publication!<p>If we discourage others from more casually sharing our observations as you&#x27;re doing we&#x27;ll miss opportunities to find things to form hypotheses from in the first place! Casual discussion in the community is part of science, something to be encouraged, and you&#x27;re sadly missing something by dismissing it like this.')
