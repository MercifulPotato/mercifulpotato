To use the two examples in your comment, if someone claims that opposition to gay marriage is hatred does that mean it was an act of tolerance for Mozilla to fire Brendan Eich for donating in favor of Proposition 8? What about people who claim that opposing affirmative action is an act of intolerance towards underprivileged minorities? What about people who claim that supporting such programs is intolerant towards successful minorities?<p>I&#x27;ve witnessed all 3 of these claims asserted in real life. And note that the latter two are directly contradictory. Just saying, &quot;tolerate all except the intolerant&quot; is an answer devoid of actual meaning. Genuine tolerance is refusing to ostracize or expel people <i>even when you feel that their views are intolerant</i>. Because I guarantee you: there are plenty of people out there who would find at least some of your views intolerant. And it also allows people to use allegations of intolerance as a tool to shut down debate.<p>Effective codes of conduct focus on specific behaviors or actions, not abstract ideas like tolerance.')
