But in theory the cost can be captured in an insurance premium.  The government could have a role in requiring adequate insurance.<p>But this is all separate from government actions that destroy legitimate profits, the risk of which may make private financing impossible.  (One might think that the risk of government action is just like other possible risks, which investors can account for, but the point is that it&#x27;s not a risk for the government itself, leading to government financing being preferred.)')
