They should have separated the cardboard box and properly disposed the painting as refuse.<p>Edit: extremely embarrassing typo corrected (see responses if you really have to know). I was going for self-deprecation, which has traditionally worked out to be less painful than this for post-war Germany. Clearly, I&#x27;m <i>mediocre</i> at best myself.')
