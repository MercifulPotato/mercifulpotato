The idea of more censorship was also popular among the citizens. However, it was mostly a European thing, although Facebook did comply to an extent. Then Donald fucking Trump happened. Now Americans were the ones who started pushing for censorship, even more strongly.<p>This is way beyond Facebook banning someone in bad faith, if Facebook has to censor a wide range of things, this can only be through automated systems due to the massive scale, and these systems will <i>inevitably</i> fuck up more and more as we add more things which they are supposed to censor. It is literally an unavoidable outcome even without bad faith. The kind of censorship people expect today just cannot work on a Facebook scale unless we accept that people will get banned unfairly all the time.')
