What will you do then?<p>This is NOT a hypothetical. Projects have dropped ALSA support and adopted a policy of PulseAudio or GTFO -- and ALSA has more commitment to its long-term maintenance than Xorg now does. And I suspect the next phase will be Wayland maintainers putting pressure on toolkits to drop X support, much like Lennart pressured the GNOME community to hard-depend on systemd.')
