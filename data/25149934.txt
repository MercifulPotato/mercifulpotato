Floats are not exact real numbers because they cannot represent most reals exactly.<p>There&#x27;s no need to use a float operation to see this inexact behaviour - floats cannot even represent most reals that humans can write in a computer program. If you write `0.1` in your programming language of choice such that it gets treated as a float, the result is not, in any way, exactly 0.1.')
