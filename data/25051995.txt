Finding a return value in Python docs usually means reading through a paragraph of text or using dir() from a command line. Figuring out how to use a Javascript Object can often mean jumping around MDN looking for a reference, unless the feature is super new, then all you might get is a signature. Android documentation will give you everything but examples.<p>Objects and functions are like parts of an engine. You need to know what each piece is used for, where it goes, how to install it and the way it all fits together.')
