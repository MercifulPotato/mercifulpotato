Even dual link DVI is rather bandwidth limited when you’re talking 4K resolution so having the physical port would be largely pointless.<p>But, again the cheapest dual 4K&#x2F;60fps video card costs more than buying 2 of the cheapest HDMI 2.0+ cards.  Which is why graph is card companies don’t really cater to that market.  Unless your case and motherboard only has slots for a single card it’s effectively a non issue.')
