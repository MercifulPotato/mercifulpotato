It has become more complex when each &quot;cell&quot; exceeded the node capacity. The file naming system was not flexible enough to split these cells into smaller nodes and I abandoned writing a router for Nginx to direct requests to right server based on the filenames. I just decided to throw a couple of big machines at the problem instead and that removed all complexity. It wouldn&#x27;t be possible just a couple of years ago though.\nFor a couple of years the rsync solution worked very well.')
