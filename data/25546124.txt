It solves so many issues - first of all it&#x27;s dumb as fuck (zero &quot;smart&quot; features), two I can only use it once it&#x27;s dark out and three I always unplug all the cables so if I want to relax I have to go through the effort of plugging it in and focusing it on my wall.  On top of all of these benefits, I don&#x27;t have to look at a stupid piece of plastic and glass mounted to my wall.')
