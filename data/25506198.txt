This gives me an affordable(and hackable, to boot) webcam of a surprisingly decent quality with 60fps at 720p, which most consumer webcams can&#x27;t do at all, since apparently no one cares about framerates(I have niche reasons for caring).<p>¹ It&#x27;s also over a network with uv4l because the v2 720p 60fps mode isn&#x27;t supported by the uvc gadget stuff. It&#x27;s a bit of a shame, but I haven&#x27;t had problems with the network transfer. The biggest issue with all this is that my Zero will occasionally overheat and the video will start freezing up, and I don&#x27;t have much of a solution besides &quot;don&#x27;t put it in any kind of case&quot;.')
