Item(by='hogFeast', descendants=None, kids=[24719789], score=None, time=1602167885, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24718808, text='Your assumption is that I care about some random person on the internet thinking &quot;the worst&quot;. The point is to highlight that people on here actually have this attitude, and it isn&#x27;t sarcasm. How many politicians are saying Facebook should be censoring other people (unsurprisingly: always their opponents)? How many people say social media is the problem? How many people say the &quot;other side&#x27;s&quot; news is fake news and ignore the fake news they believe in? It isn&#x27;t possible to have an actual opinion (I have offered them on here, and that gets downvoted too).')
