Where I live in the puget sound region, there&#x27;s no regular inspections on vehicles, because my county doesn&#x27;t require emission checks, and WA doesn&#x27;t have a periodic safety inspection, so a tire check program would be a totally new thing.<p>It seems to me that trying to figure out if that chemical can be replaced with something else, and if that something else is safe would be priority one. Priority two would be trying to filter the urban runoff somehow (which is probably a positive for many other pollutants). Getting people to switch their tires a little sooner seems like too much effort for too little gain; tires are going to wear out or get too old and be replaced anyway, and there&#x27;s a lot of cars from out of the area.<p>Maybe, you could do a rebate program to encourage people in the area to update a little sooner.')
