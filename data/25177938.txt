I’ve heard this recently from republican leaning sources but it doesn’t appear to be true.<p>I can&#x27;t find sources to determine the exact contribution of the US to this, but free market capitalism in general is definitely responsible [0].<p>&gt;&gt; it seems like a majority of climate change talk always revolves around how the US can be doing more<p>&gt; An American citizen emits 16 tonnes of co2 per year. Who else even comes close?<p>Canada is higher, Australia is close behind. I mentioned this before, but US co2 emissions have been in decline, while many other countries are increasing. It will not take India long before it eclipses the US.<p>America represents 15% of total co2 emissions [1]. If we wanted to reduce globally everyone needs to participate.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;catalyst.independent.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;14&#x2F;capitalism-remains-the-best-way-to-combat-extreme-poverty&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;catalyst.independent.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;14&#x2F;capitalism-remai...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;ghgemissions&#x2F;global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;ghgemissions&#x2F;global-greenhouse-gas-emiss...</a>')
