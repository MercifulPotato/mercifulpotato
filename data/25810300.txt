Even if it is legitimate and well intentioned, spuriously using the term &#x27;university&#x27; and having a disclaimer like &#x27;<i>Singularity University is not a degree granting institution</i>&#x27; in fine print definitely doesn&#x27;t send the right message. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an issue of whether they deserve to use that term but it gives the illusion that they&#x27;re in company with other dubious non-accredited &#x27;universities&#x27;. It&#x27;s just bad optics.')
