Just gave the\nApple Watch another spin but returned it. If you want an\niPad on your wrist that&#x27;s the way to go. If you just want\nhealth features I&#x27;d recommend the FitBits.<p>Will probably upgrade to the Versa 3 or Sense, but the 2 is\njust awesome. I&#x27;ve also had the Charge 2, Charge, Ionic, Microsoft Band 2, and Microsoft Band 1. Versa 2 was a major leap.<p>Finally, I still consider these things early adopter territory, but in 10 years I think everyone and their dog will be wearing one.')
