Item(by='Qub3d', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611282022, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25858810, text='Good info, thanks for sharing. I can only be as accurate as the info I was provided. I did read JWZ&#x27;s post -- I have his blog in my RSS feed and actually saw the post there before I saw it being linked here.<p>Mr. Lefebvre <i>said</i> &quot;cinnamon-screensaver is written from scratch&quot; in his GitHub post. I assumed good faith[0], and thought that maybe after nearly 30 years, JWZ was just a bit jaded and assumed the worst. I see that JWZ is probably the right one here, and clefebvre mistaken.<p>But Jamie has a certain &quot;tone&quot; that I would argue is a tad combative. To be fair, its his style, just like Linus Torvalds. But that lead me to see his comments in the context that he responds like this to <i>every</i> bad thing (TM) he feels lead to comment on, and I combined that with the GitHub response to conclude that JWZ was acting as a peanut gallery member here.<p>And please don&#x27;t mistake my reasoning for support. In both my earlier comments, I was advocating for <i>exposure</i> of the response, not endorsement. I feel that is quite clear, and this is shooting the messenger.<p>&gt;  I don&#x27;t wish to be rude to you; but I finally stopped lurking on HN after years and created an account for the purpose of telling you these things. And by years, I mean that my Slashdot ID is in the 500,000s, rather than say the 60-millions.<p>Welcome to HN, officially! But maybe chill with the cred dropping. Appeal to authority is no basis for an argument.<p>[0]: &quot;Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that&#x27;s easier to criticize. Assume good faith.&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html#comments" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html#comments</a>')
