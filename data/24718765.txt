I never though the &quot;News&quot; part meant much at all. A substantial portion of the links that get highly upvoted here, and attract active discussion, are actually quite old.<p>To my mind, the main &quot;thing&quot; is that submissions be <i>interesting</i> (for some definition of &quot;interesting&quot;), not that they be &quot;news&quot;.<p>I guess it just goes to show how different people can look at the exact same thing and interpret it differently.')
