You want a leader who is loyal to you and materially and socially supportive of you above almost all else.  It&#x27;s such a mind fuck to work for someone who is empathetic but doesn&#x27;t stand up for you, or even undermines what you are doing (whether or not deliberately).  You can wind up sinking years of your life by being stuck in that situation without even seeing it')
