This improves privacy a lot!<p>About second article which is not even published anymore.\n- Since when collecting money by crowdfunding makes a company bad?\n- It is a lie that &#x2F;e&#x2F; doesn&#x27;t do anything new. Check here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.e.foundation&#x2F;faq#is-e-lineageos--microg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.e.foundation&#x2F;faq#is-e-lineageos--microg</a>\n- the ROM still falls back to google’s DNS : This have been fixed many months ago.\n- th&#x2F;e&#x2F;y don’t accept negative feedback : I have been in &#x2F;e&#x2F; chat and there is so much negative feedback there and no one gets kicked out, I wonder what he did to get kicked out.<p>Seriously, this all looks like someone who doesn&#x27;t like privacy trying to scare people away. Admit it no one is going to use a hard to install or hard to use OS. &#x2F;e&#x2F; is the best option if you want your grandmother to have some privacy while still being able to use android apps.')
