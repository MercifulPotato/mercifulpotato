Item(by='fao_', descendants=None, kids=[25852634, 25846956], score=None, time=1611119311, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25842268, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve brought over a bagged lunch to a homeless person specifically asking for food, only to be roundly rejected without comment or inquiry. Guy begged for food daily.<p>I imagine that this isn&#x27;t the norm, though.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve given money to a homeless person asking for money for a cab to the hospital. They had a visibly and badly injured hand. After I gave them the money they stopped me from calling a cab from my phone, and (upon perceiving me as having left), pocketed the cash and laughed. They never went anywhere and just hung out.<p>How much do hospitals cost where you live? I&#x27;m not saying that this person wasn&#x27;t an asshole, but for many people, they see no point going to the hospital if it&#x27;s going to leave them in the red.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve had a friend offer a stack of jeans to a homeless person asking for pants, only to have them tossed all over the ground right in front of my friend. They only took their favorite pair.<p>What were they going to do with the others? Where do you think they could store them in a place they wouldn&#x27;t get mouldy, wet, damaged, etc.?<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve taken someone desperate for food into a convenience store to pick out a meal, only to be run out by the store owner.<p>Why is this the fault of the homeless person?')
