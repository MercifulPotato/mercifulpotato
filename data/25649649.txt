This entire venture consisted of 57 people. Even for the smallest of the three companies (JPM) this Haven was just a drop in the bucket. I&#x27;ve personally worked at much smaller companies that pissed away far more resources and no one gave a shit.<p>The idea is still valid, each company is still sees value in the space, there was no major falling out between the companies, and the number of employees affected in a negative way is negligible. This is basically an organizational restructuring. Total non-story, IMO.')
