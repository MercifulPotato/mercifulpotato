For example x86 traditionally has `rep movsb`. However that doesn’t mean it will remain the fastest way to do things in the long term; AVX&#x2F;SSE lets you copy more at once with the caveat that it is more complicated to use (due to alignment requirements and register usage.)<p>(I think certain ‘obvious’ patterns are optimized in microcode, but it’s probably hard to beat moving 32 bytes or 64 bytes at once with moving bytes&#x2F;words at a time, no matter what the processor does.)')
