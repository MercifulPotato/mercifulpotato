The Classic environment framework was always installed but a copy of Mac OS 9 was also required to be installed on the system volume as well—and this wasn&#x27;t included when installing a fresh copy of Mac OS X from a CD.<p>There was a limited period of time when Apple shipped and installed both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X on Macs—so for those people, the Classic environment was &quot;effectively&quot; installed by default.
