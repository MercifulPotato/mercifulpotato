Factorio&#x27;s greatest gameplay achievement is taking away mundane things once you&#x27;ve mastered them to the point of mind-numbing repetition. It&#x27;s a sliding window, whereas Satisfactory just keeps piling on more layers of complexity without really abstracting anything away, save only for the running around with a chainsaw to keep your generators running.')
