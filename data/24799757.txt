When I was looking for my missing cat I discovered so many hidden trails in my borough that was just amazing. For example a gap between two residential homes I thought it leads to someone&#x27;s garden but actually it was a quite long public footpath with signs of homeless people camping on it. I also found two abandoned properties that I wouldn&#x27;t see in Google Maps. One of which was totally overgrown with bushes, weeds and someone even left a half of the car there. Then I found an article that the owner of the site was ordered to clear it, but that it seems has never happened. Cat returned a few days later.')
