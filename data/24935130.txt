Item(by='DyslexicAtheist', descendants=None, kids=[24938478], score=None, time=1604002206, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934315, text='&gt; Economist, FT and the WSJ<p>I have print subscriptions to the first 2 but I disagree because what I recall from working in blue collar jobs is that people who would benefit from that world view will not bother. they spend their days thinking about basic survival and when they pick up a paper (on the bog) just want to be entertained. Sadly the typical reader of the Economist never had to deal with anyone from the &quot;lower&quot; classes. They consider them as something they need protection from. A minimum wage, social safety net and working health care system usually goes a long way in preventing this divide from growing into a normal (like in the US  - or very poor countries that share that class divide as a common property with the US).')
