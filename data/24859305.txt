Feynman famously made this a big part of how he approached quantum mechanics, saying that it was his toolkit that allowed him to solve problems others saw as impossible.<p>While the initial understanding can&#x27;t be done with spaced repetition, remembering what&#x27;s in your math toolkit and how to use it can very much be aided by spaced repetition. I&#x27;ve personally used this to great effect teaching people math through my spaced repetition app.')
