If we go back before 1950, the same argument you are making was used justify businesses refusing to provide service to women, minorities, LGBT people, etc.  It&#x27;s funny to see people supposedly on the left recycling discredited arguments from the bigoted right to justify their behavior today.<p>Society had to create protected classes, making something illegal that was already intrinsically immoral, to make clear that the argument you are trying to make is bogus.  Perhaps it&#x27;s time for liberals (and I mean actual liberals, not the left) to campaign to make political affiliation a protected class too.')
