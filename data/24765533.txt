(Like the unrequested redesign that people web designers post for famous websites.) Something like a fake towns, with a fake population number and a fake map and a fake history. And what are your proposal to improve it.<p>Also, include how much it would cost in your commission [Patio11 advice to not post the exact number], and for how long you expect to be there as a consultant (or whatever that position is call). And how much they must pay in construction costs.<p>Patio11 usually includes some freebie in his post, some actionable advice that is easy to implement and provides some immediate return. The idea is that if it work, it is easier to convince people that you have more good advice.<p>Can you add some recommendation for a small typical town? Something like:<p>fake advice&gt;  <i>If your historical church and the main square are more than 5 blocks away, you should build a big fountain in between because that will increase the chance that your town is included in the Michelin guide and you will increase the turism.</i><p>My fake advice can be totally wrong, or not applicable to a typical town there, or have other million of problems, but I hope the idea is clear.')
