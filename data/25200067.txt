In other words: the coefficients are only good for that specific track(s).<p>More generally, I think this approach is only suited to &quot;static&quot; courses, which only matter in contrived demos. Any real use of a steering algorithm requires reacting to conditions that can&#x27;t be predicted a priori; e.g. if you have to avoid collisions with other cars, and one car is controlled by a human player, every run is effectively a different track and overfitting like this would not be an option.')
