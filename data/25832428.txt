Here in Germany, sending money from one bank to another still takes at least one up to three _work_ days. So in the worst case, you&#x27;re wiring money to sb on Friday and he will receive it by Wednesday. Compare that to 10 minutes required by Bitcoin anywhere on the planet.<p>Of course, there are special purpose banking products to accelerate transactions but they are also more expensive than Bitcoin&#x27;s miner fee.')
