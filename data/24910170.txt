They always engage in question-begging and other fallacies and misdirection, as you are now.  You state that Trump&#x27;s behavior is reprehensible, but do not allow that position to be challenged and provide no argument at all in support of your statement.<p>If you don&#x27;t know how to apply discipline and empirical methods to have a discussion in a detached and productive manner, then yes you are going to have a very hard time with conversations with people who don&#x27;t share your biases.  And if you can just downvote, censor, and otherwise dismiss&#x2F;marginalize&#x2F;deplatform the person challenging your bias, you will never learn the truth.')
