But I&#x27;m confused. You posit Yglesias as a member of &quot;the professional class&quot;, which you contrast with &quot;ordinary people&quot;, and in particular, people like yourself.<p>But in your profile here on HN, you describe yourself as:<p>&gt; I&#x27;m an appellate lawyer. In a past life, I was an engineer at a cognitive radio startup.<p>I&#x27;m puzzled at why you see the distinction as having anything to do with &quot;the professional class&quot;.<p>I think the word you could have used to good effect here is &quot;cosmopolitan&quot;. Its meaning is a subtle and probably used a little differently by different people, but I take it to describe a person somewhat like myself who (unlike you) doesn&#x27;t have much of an attachment to &quot;soil, language, religion, and shared food, history, art, customs&quot;, but instead sees all of the culture of humanity as their birthright, and who feels free to pick and choose (subject to certain political and economic constraints). I find it personally important to me to be able to combine things I love from different cultures from all over the world, and I confess that I regard those with a strong attachment to whatever they perceive as &quot;their culture&quot; as somehow a little (or a lot!) backwards. I also confess to a genuine irritation with anyone who expresses ideas that suggest that certain culture is &quot;owned&quot; by specific groups of people.<p>Clearly, we have quite different views of the world and our place in it. But I&#x27;m still confused why you put Yglesias and his cosmopolitan views in &quot;the professional class&quot; when it seems (from your being here on HN as well as your profile) that you are also a member of this class. Surely Yglesias is just a cosmopolitan sort of person, and you are not?<p>If so, it&#x27;s really about &quot;the professional class&quot; vs &quot;ordinary people&quot;, it&#x27;s about people (like me) who view cosmopolitanism as central to the great hope for a peaceful and prosperous future for humanity, and people (perhaps such as yourself) who feel that belonging to a particular culture (and place?) is central their identity and presumably their conceptions of the future.')
