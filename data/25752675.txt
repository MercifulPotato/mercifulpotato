A map[t]struct{} has 2 states for every key; absent, and present.<p>People new to Go tend to pick map[T]bool or map[T]int because they&#x27;re used to using bools and ints throughout their code, but struct{} is the correct value type for sets.  (That is not to say that a counting set, map[T]int is useless, however.  If you need that, use that!)')
