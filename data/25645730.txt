The entire premise of central banks controlling inflation via the money supply becomes precarious when people are able to issue and access credit outside of the controlled money supply.<p>You&#x27;re entirely right that they want their cut, but they also don&#x27;t want to end up like a country such as Indonesia or Vietnam where all the financing has to be organised in the USA.
