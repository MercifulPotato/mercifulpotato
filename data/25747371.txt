I regularly get interested in e-readers but one key point in your question is <i>affordable</i>. Kobo readers [1] look promising. Especially the biggest one <i>Kobo Forma</i> (8&quot;) but it&#x27;s far from cheap (280€).<p>In general, what deters me from e-readers is the lack of a nice way to annotate (with handwriting). I get the problem with EPUBs but it should be fine with PDFs.<p>Generally, EPUBs are a problem for technical books where I want the figures to properly match the corresponding text. Plus some figures are bigger than the screen (have to be so). And reading PDFs is a problem for the same screen size reason...<p>The best I can think of is Sony&#x27;s gigantic DPT-RP1 [1] and it seems to have perfect handwriting support. But at almost 800€, I really don&#x27;t call this affordable.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.kobobooks.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;eReaders" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.kobobooks.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;eReaders</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sony.net&#x2F;SonyInfo&#x2F;design&#x2F;stories&#x2F;DPT-RP1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sony.net&#x2F;SonyInfo&#x2F;design&#x2F;stories&#x2F;DPT-RP1&#x2F;</a>')
