The first time I got rushed through the fillings and had them the same appointment as a cleaning because they were minor (they were). I still felt abused by it. A few years later, the same dentist found something else. I got a second opinion this time. It was basically that an aggressive dentist might reasonably want to fill it, but the second opinion was &quot;don&#x27;t bother.&quot; Five years and on a new dentist and it hasn&#x27;t been so much as mentioned by the new dentist.<p>Unless something is obviously wrong or you have a known history of cavities, I&#x27;d always get a second opinion.')
