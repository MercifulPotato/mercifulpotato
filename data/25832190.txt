But there is a dimension hinted at in the article that makes this not a good asset either.  That is, the fact that a dozen or two large syndicates have deployed specific specialized hardware located in Iceland, Iran, Venezuela, and China etc., is not a reasonable guaranty of the future security of compute and network power in the system.  Simply having computer power now linked in a global Internet does not bestow real world power.  The U.S., E.U., have strong currencies backed by real world strength.  Bitcoin on the other hand is a commercial ledger for drug, fraud, gambling, extortion, and money laundering transactions.  It&#x27;s the modern day Barbary Pirates, or take your pick of any other geographically-centralized pirate community.  As pirates learn, when they achieve a sufficient notariety, entity-decentralization ceases to be a true protection.<p>It&#x27;s been 10 years, Bitcoin still is as useless as it was in 2010, but it steadily is gaining notoriety.')
