In theory docker layers&#x2F;caching should fix this but the reality is that you don&#x27;t add individual files to an image, you had the compiled artifact&#x2F;bundle&#x2F;whatevs and if any file changes its going to upload it again, made worse by a change that effects many components&#x2F;images&#x2F;k8s pods. If you can solve the upload bandwidth problem (local servers? giant pipe?) then becomes more possible.')
