It has proven very difficult to add &quot;security&quot; to the scp model. All attempts to &quot;detect&quot; and &quot;prevent&quot; anomalous argument transfers stand a great chance of breaking existing workflows. Yes, we recognize it the situation sucks. But we don&#x27;t want to break the easy patterns people use scp for, until there is a commonplace replacement.<p>The problem is that in many cases those bugs are in fact the intended behavior and changing it would break backward compatibility. I think it is better to leave it as it is and move to a different tool.')
