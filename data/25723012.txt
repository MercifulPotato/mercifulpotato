I&#x27;m very pro-free speech. I&#x27;m not a Conservative or a trumper. I&#x27;m a limey brit.<p>But I don&#x27;t quite think I&#x27;d go as far as you have in the above quote. I think Trumps continued lies and the support of multiple other republicans encouraged and legitimised these actions.<p>Does that excuse the actions? No.<p>Does it make them criminally liable? Imho, maybe. Incitement is a thing.<p>But they certainly can&#x27;t say &quot;it&#x27;s not my fault people listened to me&quot;. There is a very real need right now for republicans to look at the company they&#x27;ve kept for the last 4 years and do some soul searching.<p>That would be best for them and for the country even if I don&#x27;t think failing to do some merits arrest or deplatforming.<p>This isn&#x27;t a right&#x2F;left spat. It&#x27;s a moral fiber, truth vs lies question. What sort of person does a party member want to be and to be associated with?')
