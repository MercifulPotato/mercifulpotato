It&#x27;s not because twitter is special, it&#x27;s because it was one of the first to achieve a sufficiently large userbase.<p>Defending arbitrary censorship on these platforms as &#x27;oh well it&#x27;s a private entity so they can do what they like&#x27; misses the forest for the trees. Technology has shifted the power balance for free expression, and applying pre-technology laws and mindsets to it just empowers that small handful of individuals to manipulate public discourse even more. Twitter doesn&#x27;t quite have a monopoly on speech, but it&#x27;s damn close in terms of practical outcomes. The fact that the legal definition of `monopoly` hasn&#x27;t caught up with that, doesn&#x27;t change the matter.')
