Where&#x27;s the data? Etc.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad argument, but since the hypothesis space is vast (what kind of future conflicts the US&#x2F;NATO will engage in, what intensity, what kind of economics, what kind of arms race will those bring, etc), and data is sparse, it seems like HN&#x2F;pundits are not great at really reducing the uncertainty.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s still a fuckload of money, and probably it could be better spent on providing new skill training to unemployed&#x2F;at-risk-workers in those states where the F35 money goes right now, but that&#x27;s a hard sell, and doesn&#x27;t really move the needle with regards to air-force capacity.')
