Communication is WhatsApp here.<p>My physiotherapist, my doctor&#x27;s nurse (who handles my appointment) they all function on WhatsApp, and no, they are even going to try Signal. Grocers, delivery people — it goes on. My bank and credit card relationship managers communicate with me on WhatsApp. They are never &quot;migrating to&quot; Signal.<p>I am the only one among my contacts who will be moving away from WhatsApp — everyone else (among my people who are using Signal sparsely or actively as of now) have WhatsApp installed and will keep it.<p>Most of my recent Signal convert contacts have already started replying on Signal after hours or days, some have uninstalled. Most of those people will soon uninstall it is what I expect. Unless Signal brings social features that makes these people experience FOMO of broadcasting their lives on one more network :)<p>Penetration of Signal in real world is way too different from what it &quot;feels&quot; here on HN.')
