The fun part is deciding do you show the front or the back? Maybe cut the shirt down the length of one side and display it in a butterfly cut? Get a frame that is glass encased on both sides, and then flip it over every week? I have seen actual framed butterflies with this kind of case so you can see both sides of the butterfly&#x27;s markings.')
