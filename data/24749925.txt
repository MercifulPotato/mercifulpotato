It became five because a bunch of people were smart enough to figure out their bosses weren&#x27;t their friends, and fought for a shorter workweek (also reducing unemployment and increasing the value of each worker). We&#x27;ve gotten lazy, collectively speaking, and the bosses have crept it back up to five-plus-some-extras.<p>Five is still ridiculous, though. There&#x27;s so much waste in the system these days; the world would run fine on a three-day week.<p>It&#x27;s time for working people to get fighting again.')
