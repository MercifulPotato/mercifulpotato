How does a Senator represent &quot;the state as its own entity - not [ ... ] the people in the state&quot; ? Presumably the Senator responds to legislative proposals based on how their perceive them to affect the state, but what can it mean to say &quot;how it affects the state&quot; if that doesn&#x27;t actually mean &quot;how it affects the people of the state&quot; ?<p>Well, I&#x27;ll suggest how: it makes sense only if you reinterpret &quot;the state as its own entity - not [ ... ] the people in the state&quot; as meaning &quot;the existing distribution of power and resources within the state&quot;. That is, the role of the Senator from state XX is to ensure that the existing power structure of the state remains in place.<p>I cannot imagine any other intepretation of &quot;the state as its own entity&quot; that can be offered. Do you have one?<p>Also, this notion of &quot;the states as the fundamental unit&quot; is  a concept that was certainly in place at the time of the DoI. It simply isn&#x27;t how most Americans experience their citizenship or lives, and arguably it suffered a fatal blow post-civil war. You can argue, if you wish to, that the Constitution still reflects the old arrangement (there are some smart folk who will disagree with you). The de facto situation on the ground, however, is that Americans conceive of themselves living in a single nation with differences in laws and regulations from state to state.<p>[ EDIT: clarify para 3 and drop word bombs ]')
