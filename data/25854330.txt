That it _seems_ to change the way code is approached is an artifact of an early community excited to try FP concepts in it. Nothing wrong with that; however, the ReScript team (me included) don&#x27;t really approach things this way. Our goal, outlined at (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rescript-lang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;manual&#x2F;latest&#x2F;introduction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rescript-lang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;manual&#x2F;latest&#x2F;introduction</a>), is to provide:<p>- a more solid type system\n- and a much faster compilation speed (a growing pain in TS projects)\n- to write mainstream code\n- for products (as opposed to a focus on intermediate FP libraries)<p>The fact that it leverages some FP concepts here and there is just a mean, not the end.<p>The marketing of this is really hard, because FP usually attracts the crowd you&#x27;d expect, at the expense of several of the above emphasis. But we&#x27;re still working toward it.<p>Having seen some ReScript codebases in the wild, I definitely know where your team comes from. We do try to approach it with the &quot;different TypeScript&quot; angle, but understandably userland doesn&#x27;t always write code the way we&#x27;d like to recommend.<p>In the spirit of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25846479" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25846479</a>, weâ€™re trying to become a boring technology. Unfortunately boring technology had to have gone through a hype period.')
