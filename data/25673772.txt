If you don’t get covid, you don’t die of covid. If you lockdown, you don’t get covid. It’s a simplification but it’s a start.<p>What you have said is that people will suffer under lockdown - but you haven’t really tried to quantify that. You’ve decided that’s a lost cause and have moved onto “lockdown <i>causes</i> death” ! Amazing.')
