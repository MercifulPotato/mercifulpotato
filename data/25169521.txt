E.g. in case of an asymmetry after breast cancer patients have to decide whether they prefer to live with an asymmetry or an alignment, which, however, leads to scars.\nAs simple as this decision may sound for you - for most patients it is not.\nUnfortunately, the is no realiable data and research on a larger scale so far, that allows surgeons to better understand what patients (and society in general) accepts as an &quot;aesthetically pleasing&quot; outcome.<p>Therefore I built a web based software, that is able to create relatively realistic models of various breast conditions - e.g. different breast sizes, asymmetries, scares and so on.\nI then built this software into a survey, that mixes different conditions in a pseudo-random way, that allows us to gather a vast amount of realiable data on a scale that has never been seen in this field of medicine before - which ultimately would significantly improve advice and also surgery for patients.<p>It would be awesome if you would sacrifice 5 minutes of your time to support this project.<p>I am looking forward to answering any questions.\nThank you for your time and support.')
