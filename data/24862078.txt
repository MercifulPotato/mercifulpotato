Historically, the lower the tax rate, the more investment you get in real estate speculation and other passive income streams because it&#x27;s now more efficient to simply not invest in productive activities when you can just get effectively free money without doing any work.<p>The higher the tax rate, the more businesses invest in actual business activities, because they get more <i>expenses</i> they can use to offset income they may earn, and because passive activities generally don&#x27;t generate enough of a return to be worth the investment compared to (re)investing in an actual business.')
