Chase is required by law to make the funds available after a couple days, just like all other banks. The OP&#x27;s sister fell for a common scam that&#x27;s been going on since forever, and Zelle warns you fairly explicitly to never send money to a stranger or else things like this could happen.<p>Of course Chase isn&#x27;t going to eat a $3,000 loss because a customer fell for a common scam and ignored Zelle&#x27;s warnings and didn&#x27;t even do a cursory look through the bank agreement which clearly explains how checks clear.<p>The difference between the other services &quot;taking responsibility&quot; and &quot;not shaking down their customers&quot; and Chase Bank is that unlike a checking account, credit card transactions can be easily reversed. Once you send the money through Zelle, it&#x27;s gone.<p>That your sister was victimized is clearly terrible, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that her negligence caused her bank to lose 3 grand, and your father is liable as a cosigner as well. She is reasonably expected to recognize that Craigslist arrangement as too good to be true, and she ignored Zelle&#x27;s admonitions not to send money to strangers.')
