(I make no assertion on which way causation flows. And within a city, the relationship breaks down.)<p>This is classism and itself is abhorrent. As someone who lives in NYC, living in NYC and discussing abhorrent views in red states as correlated to income sounds utterly ridiculous on its face when we have our own corrupt NYPD (Stop and frisk, the kettling and brutality on peaceful protestors), ineffective mayor, and increased gentrification leading to homelessness.<p>I&#x27;m absolutely baffled by &quot;I treat living in NYC as a way to get away from lower income people and their abhorrent views&quot; when NYC has lower income people that are actively being disenfranchised and the wealthy simply look the other way (which arguably is abhorrent!).')
