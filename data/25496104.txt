It might not be the same level of excitement as it was 30+ years ago but I don&#x27;t remember.<p>For me it depends on what it is.  Machine learning and AI is probably the most exciting thing.  Honestly the small learning assignments and exercises are not as exciting as visualizing the final result of an advanced robot (which I may actually never get to).<p>But as far as motivation, having an exciting goal helps.<p>Also I think the novelty matters a bit.  Something totally new that I haven&#x27;t used before.<p>But I think mental and physical health and other circumstances affect levels of anticipation and such.  At least for me.  So make sure you are not depressed.<p>Also I would say age might effect it to some degree.<p>But I remember when I was a kid the experiments were very direct and pragmatic.  There was very little reading or video lectures involved with typing in a &quot;draw lines&quot; program on my Coco 2 from the book and then changing the line color or whatever.  And the amount of material I generally covered in a day was pretty small in content but high in novelty.  So those things probably affect the level of fun.')
