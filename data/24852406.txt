I&#x27;ve just started a YouTube Premium subscription and expect I&#x27;ll continue paying for that once the free trial ends, whereas even at half the price, Quibi just didn&#x27;t have the content or familiarity to get my money at the end of the trial.<p>One thing I do have to commend Quibi for, however, is how well they reversioned their video content. I think they will be seen as a little ahead of the competition there (possibly before their time). Against other content houses that will have significantly more footage to get through (and&#x2F;or less resources for this task).<p>I think the different versions (e.g. portrait&#x2F;landscape for Quibi) will be a little way off being that common. I expect computer vision tooling will enable it more broadly when it can at least expedite the process considerably (which probably isn&#x27;t a huge distance off although then the blocker is organisational processes around publishing video).')
