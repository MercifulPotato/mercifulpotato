It is impossible for a single person to have expert domain knowledge in every single product category. I&#x27;ve been a software developer for 20 years, so  (relative to the general population, not HN) I am an &quot;expert&quot; of sorts in this field, but I am assuredly not also an expert in automobiles, food safety, home appliance safety, airline maintenance, medicine, or any of the other things upon which I might spend money.')
