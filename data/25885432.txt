I have definitely spent thousands of dollars on supplements, tried probably hundreds of them.  I want to get the TrioSmart breathe test to figure out specifically what my intestines are infected with, I want to get as comprehensive a food sensitivity testing panel done as possible.  There are also lots of supplements that I know would help me that are not available where I am, for example bismuth (pepto bismol).<p>In your case, I would recommend getting some L Glutamine power and taking a bunch of that in the morning and at night.  That would likely fix your brain fog or at least go a long way.  Best resource I&#x27;ve found is brainhealthbook.com .  What is your email?  I&#x27;ll reach out and we can discuss ideas, theories and strategies further.')
