I don&#x27;t really expect anyone else to contribute, but it would be neat.<p>I just opted it in to Hacktoberfest. Best case scenario, I actually get a great PR because someone was looking for Hacktoberfest-eligible repos and thought my app looked cool. Worst-case scenario, I get a bunch of spam PRs that I rejectâ€”but since I basically never get any PRs, this doesn&#x27;t seem like such a huge problem.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Wowfunhappy&#x2F;Pebble-RSS-Reader" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Wowfunhappy&#x2F;Pebble-RSS-Reader</a>')
