That&#x27;s all part of the golden handcuffs routine, along with stock holdings etc. Give your life to the company or bugger off, no middle ground.<p>That&#x27;s why I wanted to point out that it&#x27;s entirely reasonable. It&#x27;s just a different work&#x2F;life weighting, people should be able to still work in tech and not have an 80&#x2F;hr week.')
