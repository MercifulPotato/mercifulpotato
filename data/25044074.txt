Item(by='Jugurtha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604999992, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25043251, text='&gt;<i>When learning a new topic in math, I personally prefer to start with a more formal, terse text. For me, the texts that focus too much on examples and motivation tend to be chattier</i><p>Soviet books (MIR Publishers) are notoriously terse and to the point. This is what we used in college, and it has made it difficult for me to read a different style, because the content tries my patience.<p>For example, I couldn&#x27;t consume Andrew Ng&#x27;s Coursera ML course, but I appreciated the CS229 recorded at Stanford because he dove directly into the maths part. I didn&#x27;t want to see slides, I needed to see problem statement, pause the video, work through gradient descent, play the video, and check I got it right. Side note: doing this [pause, working on it, play] has its advantages, it helped avoid a confusion the instructor had in the course with notation, for example, which you had to be sorted out in the later part of the course.<p>As you said, it is a spectrum of content with different styles for different needs and people, but even for the same person, one might need a style at a certain point and the other at another point. I remember in my third year I used some MIT OCW resources because I felt my brain was shot and I needed to be spoon fed on a topic I was so far behind on.')
