Let&#x27;s imagine that advertising were banned. How could a car manufacturer still advertise their cars? Put bigger logos on them and sell lots of cheaper models for a while. That way the city will be full of your vehicles and any time someone sees a car they&#x27;ll think of your cars. Same goes for Coca-Cola and other brands. In that case they just need to take up more shelf-space.')
