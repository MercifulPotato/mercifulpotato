The outdoors are the reason we invented the indoors.<p>“The potential energy savings are huge; the costs are almost nil.”<p>This is a complete fantasy. What’s actually happening here is, faced with a hard problem (heating indoor spaces in a sustainable way), they have decided to solve a much harder one (changing the behaviour and physiology of everyone on Earth) in the guise of a simple one (if only we all wore more clothing). What sounds like a simple solution is therefore actually nearly impossible, and of little use to us unless we’re facing extreme circumstances.<p>The whole point of civilisation is that life does not have to be a survival exercise. If we can’t come up with anything better than this line of reasoning, then we are done for.')
