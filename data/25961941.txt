It&#x27;s mostly myth.<p>The issue with unnecessarily interacting with police is that you never know what is actually happening. It&#x27;s like dealing with a salesmen, they are trained do control situations and question people every day.<p>In many circumstances you have nothing to add, nothing to gain, and you incur risk that something you say or do makes an unfortunate connection. Nobody is going to beat or arrest you for saying &quot;no thanks&quot;.')
