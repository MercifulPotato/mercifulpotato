We let mentally incompetent people grocery shop and drive cars and vote, knowing full well they&#x27;re a danger (or at least not a net benefit). Every town in every country contains well-known incompetent citizens.<p>What&#x27;s the default for intelligent non-humans?<p>Does each one have to prove mental competence? At what level: that of an average human, or that of the lowest competent human?<p>Is the default to assume they are competent, and have all the rights and privileges of a human, or is the default to assume they aren&#x27;t competent and don&#x27;t have those rights?<p>Personally, it makes sense to me to err on the side of &quot;any being who tells me plainly that they want a vote gets to vote&quot;.')
