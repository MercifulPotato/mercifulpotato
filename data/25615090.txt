Item(by='core-questions', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609612432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614755, text='&gt; Would you be willing to share more specifics,<p>You&#x27;ve got to be kidding me. Have you used your own product? Going from my carefully tuned Server install to cloud Jira or Confluence is a night-and-day difference. The Cloud product is virtually unusable in comparison for any heavy Jira user.<p>You don&#x27;t need &quot;specifics&quot;, you need your performance engineering team to literally take over the entire company for 6 months to a year. No new features - nobody fucking needs them, the features 99% of your users use have been in the product for 5+ years already. Whatever you&#x27;re PM&#x27;ing, cancel it, it&#x27;s a waste of time in comparison to making the product not suck. The biggest source of losing users to some other product is going to be the sheer pain of continuing to use Atlassian....<p>Just make it usable. Halve the number of requests. Cache more things client-side. Do more server-side pre-processing so that a round-trip is not needed when I click on a menu.<p>I&#x27;m not looking forward to when I am forced to migrate my users to a more expensive and less performant experience. I and hundreds of thousands of other administrators will be experiencing months of user complaints because of the forced migration as it is; this is Atlassian&#x27;s real chance to make it suck less in time.')
