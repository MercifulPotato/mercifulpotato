Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25260119], score=None, time=1606771828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25258569, text='&gt;I think a lot of people have problems with strictly enforced rules in finance<p>They have problems with it because the rules cost them money, not because it&#x27;s hard to understand or rigidly enforced. If the rules just resulted in a &quot;transaction declined&quot; they wouldn&#x27;t really care either way. For instance, I don&#x27;t think anyone thinks that it&#x27;s unreasonable for your debit card to get declined if you don&#x27;t have enough money.')
