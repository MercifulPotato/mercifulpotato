They call foul and make a big fuss when the system <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> work in their favor, but then they don&#x27;t have the power to fix it.  They&#x27;ve realized it&#x27;s easier to just undermine the legitimacy of the winner and just patiently wait for the next opportunity.<p>I wish I knew what it would take to get the support necessary to fix it without endorsement from a political party.')
