I&#x27;ve accepted to continue playing the game after the January&#x2F;February patch.<p>I am a little confused by the wording here,<p>&gt; therefore we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via PlayStation Store.<p>Does this mean that anyone who purchased a digital copy gets a refund?   Will we retain a license to play the digital game?<p>Or maybe CDPR&#x2F;Sony have given up on ever releasing a PS4 (amateur) build of the game that works?')
