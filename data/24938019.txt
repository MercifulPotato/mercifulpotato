Our whole thesis was to create a system that recommended candidates based on their github repos. Pretty sure someone will solve this problem, but in our experience, it felt like a losing battle since recruiters wanted access to certain types of candidates and were continuing to reject candidates that were surfaced, with non-traditional backgrounds.<p>This was 2015, I think someone will solve this problem with time. The experience did teach us a thing or two about git commits, PRs and the overall experience of productivity through git based systems.')
