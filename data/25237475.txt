In particular this plugin also is pointed at a local checkout of the repositories you&#x27;re working with.<p>So for instance in my case I have all the code I work with in ~&#x2F;Development.  Since I also use ripgrep for local development I typically include .ignore&#x2F;.rgignore files to control what I&#x27;m searching around in my repos.<p>Doing &quot;excludes&quot;&#x2F;&quot;includes&quot; across a variety of repositories is hard at query time because they layouts of those repositories can be very different.  For instance in some JS repos you do want to search in &quot;dist&quot; whereas in others you don&#x27;t because &quot;dist&quot; gets generated out of &quot;src&quot; for instance and just ends up being a duplicate etc.')
