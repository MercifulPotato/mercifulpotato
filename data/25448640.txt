Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25450346], score=None, time=1608152724, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25447330, text='&gt; I agree we need more cash payments to humans. But we have to be careful not to confuse money with stuff (the goods and services produced by the economy). Giving money does not produce any more stuff, it only increases the competition for and price of the stuff that is being produced.<p>&gt; We are producing less stuff because of the pandemic, which means there is less to go around (however it gets allocated), and no amount of money will change that.<p>A large fraction of that stuff is not strictly necessary for anyone&#x27;s survival, especially in the short term.  It&#x27;s various degrees of &quot;nice to have.&quot;  Too see this, look at the kinds of rationing they did in WWII.<p>A successful COVID containment strategy would have identified the truly essential vs nice-to-have parts of the economy, and temporarily shut the latter parts down while supporting <i>all</i> affected workers in those sectors with payments sufficient to provide all needed access to essential goods and services for the duration (including housing).  That wouldn&#x27;t work as a permanent economic policy, but it would work as a temporary coordinated response to time-limited crisis.')
