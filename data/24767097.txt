Say 10% to be extremely generous. NYC five-borough average back in 2015 was around $15K per year [1]. A fully-burdened employee expense is around 2X base salary, so a $100K salary position clocks in around $200K fully-burdened, or around 7.5% of that 2015 NYC average figure. I don&#x27;t currently see companies wholesale changing employment strategies for 10% differentials.<p>I&#x27;m not sure companies can measure productivity down to that expense detail level for knowledge workers.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;heres-how-much-your-company-pays-to-rent-office-space-2015-05-27" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;heres-how-much-your-compan...</a>')
