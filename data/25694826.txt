Now we&#x27;re surprised when the same medicine gets used by others. For either side, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s proper minimize their complaints. If the BLM crowd says they have a serious problem with police violence, the best reaction is, &quot;what can we do to restore confidence?&quot; Similarly, when 40% of the country says they have serious concerns about the integrity of voting in this country the proper response isn&#x27;t &quot;everything is okay&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;what can we do to restore confidence?&quot;.<p>The lesson here is to condemn all rioting, set expectations that are equally applied to all segments of society. Listen to those feeling alienated and see what can be reasonably done to promote inclusiveness. It&#x27;s hard to take advocates of inclusiveness seriously when they eagerly cancel, disenfranchise, and deplatform people that disagree with them even remotely (and yes, there are plenty of examples of rational criticism being deplatformed).')
