The attacker needs to roll more than the number of direct supports a piece is having to take it, otherwise they lose the attacking piece.<p>It will be a bit like XCOM, before a move one will know the percentage of success of various captures, and will have to make a decision in that light.<p>So even a higly probable capture has a small chance of failure, sometimes resulting in the player in a weaker position being able to stage a spectacular comeback victory. In normal chess it perhaps impossible to win from a disadvantaged position.<p>Is there any such chess varient which uses dice, to add a chance element?')
