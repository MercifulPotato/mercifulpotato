Regardless of whether you use public services and benefit from its administration, you are expected to obey to it. If you don’t use a private service, you don’t have obey to their term of service, and law might even grants you ability to forbid private companies to exploit data related to you in their services.<p>The real problem here is not some private services chose what is or what is not available in their services. The core issue is their monopolistic position on information infrastructure. To some degree, people are responsible for not using decentralizing services, and for that, shame on people. On the other hand, when people are not educated to actively defend themselves against mass manipulation, it’s no wonder they end up trapped in that kind of &quot;free&quot; services. Of course, any form of political power that is not based on maximizing <i>people</i> auto-determination will precisely want easily manipulable people.<p>Neither these private companies nor political parties that now fake to be outraged by censure of opinion want auto-determined people able to share anything that might look like a menace to the centralized institutions they have in their hands.')
