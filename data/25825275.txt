I&#x27;ve never been accused of disregarding human life, and I&#x27;ve had a bunch of conversations here and elsewhere about COVID-19 response.<p>It feels like you&#x27;re in what I call a &quot;contrarian headspace&quot; where you believe you&#x27;ve discovered something that&#x27;s under-reported or under-represented, and you&#x27;ve grabbed firmly onto that belief, riding it into every conversation you can.  Here be dragons, especially on HN.<p>I think, to retain my own sanity, I&#x27;m going to bow out of this conversation, but I do suggest you take a good hard look at how your beliefs landed you on the same side as the system crushing Rebekah Jones.  What they&#x27;re doing to her is, regardless of legal technicality, problematic, and if you&#x27;re not able to see that because of your feelings about COVID coverage, you&#x27;re in some trouble.')
