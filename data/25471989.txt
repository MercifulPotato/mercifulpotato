However, now, according to wikipedia, the price for a reused falcon 9 launch is $50 million. In reusable configuration this will launch 34,400 lbs to LEO. At this pricing it is around $1450&#x2F;lb to LEO.<p>This is speculation to a degree, but I think Elon has tweeted that the internal SpaceX cost for such a mission is around $15m. So yes, even at $1450&#x2F;lb to LEO, SpaceX is making a significant margin. See this article for more info: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elonx.net&#x2F;how-much-does-it-cost-to-launch-a-reused-falcon-9-elon-musk-explains-why-reusability-is-worth-it&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elonx.net&#x2F;how-much-does-it-cost-to-launch-a-reus...</a><p>Remeber that SpaceX still has to recoup the investment in developing the Falcon9 as well as reusability. In the linked article above, they mention that Elon said developing reusability cost about $1 billion. So lots of this margin goes to paying that invest back.')
