Twitter&#x2F;Fb could also require ID verification, for example. They basically already do (require a cell number after account creation), but it&#x27;s not enforced in all countries.<p>Anyway, no magic bullet, but if they are held accountable, they will find solutions pretty quickly, as Pornhub did.')
