I&#x27;ve only been to London once, but I can certainly speak to identical behavior from panhandlers at many intersections in central NC, USA. They&#x27;ll hold signs pleading all sorts of sad stories, typically asking for finances for food. Sometimes faking limps or missing appendices (one time I could clearly notice the guys leg tucked up inside his jeans...)<p>If you offer to buy them a big meal at the restaurant down the street, they&#x27;ll cuss you out and harass you. Then promptly heckle the car behind you for cash.<p>They want cold cash for <i>drugs</i>, nothing more or less. Many of these folks run it like a job, panhandling for 4-8 hours a day, then hopping in their car and returning to their shared living situation to shoot&#x2F;snort&#x2F;smoke up. It&#x27;s a racket than can easily generate more income than an honest hourly job around here.<p>It&#x27;s really quite sad, because amongst them are <i>some</i> folks who seriously need help, and would be nothing less than extremely thankful for any food or clothing provided to them. Sadly, the druggie gremlins are in the majority, so I don&#x27;t give anything to anyone. Lock the doors and look straight ahead. I keep my hand near my firearm too, because I&#x27;ve had them vigorously pull my car doors before.')
