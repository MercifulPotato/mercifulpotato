Bernie Bros pushed the narrative, Biden would just blow up and not answer the question like he should do reasonably. The democrat base said it&#x27;s not enough to go Bernie and they elected Biden. What was the story? The possible bias of a company who likes democrats and other left-leaning figures gave his son a job in perhaps hopes of some influence? Not exactly a huge story. Biden had denied any involvement during the primaries.<p>NYPost investigated and found further information and sat on it until just the right time before the election. Smart play by them to be sure.<p>Even with what the NYPost reported on. Hunter Biden is a scumbag to be sure and it does confirm Biden met his employer but it doesnt prove any influence was sold. Hunter Biden was probably taking advantage of his rich&#x2F;famous father. Not unlike Donald Jr.<p>To assert that this is misinformation is quite unlikely.<p>Facebook and Twitter didnt block it because it was misinformation, they blocked it because of personal identifying information or &#x27;hacking sources&#x27;.')
