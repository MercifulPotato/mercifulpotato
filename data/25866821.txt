I mean in natural language it is clear to me, why they’d name it groupby, but in programming terms I think partition is more appropriate, as groupby is already “blocked” by the database operation.<p>But…this is exactly what a database GROUP BY does. (You’ll always have aggregations in the SELECT clause which work on the data in the groupings, but the GROUP BY itself just specifies splitting the dataset up into this kind of groupings.)<p>&gt; Otherwise I guess one can easily write partition oneself and then use that function over and over again, without resorting to a library.<p>Yeah, literally all a library is avoiding having to rewrite code that someone has already written once.')
