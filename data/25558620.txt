The first affected generation doesn&#x27;t have time to realize that they will be worse off than their parents, and so has 2-3 children without realizing that they will be unable to afford to educate or provide healthcare.<p>Those children then grow up seeing the hardships and stress of their parents, who complain about how expensive they were and now they won&#x27;t be able to retire and decide to either wait for things to get better before having children or not to have any at all.<p>Then the elder statesmen complain about low birth rates.<p>Until the United States creates policies so that someone who works 40 hours a week, regardless of the job, will be able to retire and afford healthcare, only the top 10% of earners ($150k+) and the extreme poor (medicaid, food stamps, subsidized housing) will have more than 1 child.')
