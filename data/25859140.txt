Things people should know:<p>* It&#x27;s funny.\n* Benjy is just one of the characters. He has mental issues, which make his chapters more difficult, but the other characters&#x27; chapters are straight forward, give you context, and push the story forward.\n* Benjy&#x27;s chapters aren&#x27;t really that difficult.\n* It&#x27;s been 20 years since I read this so everything I&#x27;ve written here may be wrong :)')
