Item(by='jethro_tell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602390256, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24743010, text='I use a 10 year old logitech c910 - 1080p with stereo mics and a room with indirect natural light and 1Gbps fiber internet connection.  I have people ask me all the time if I&#x27;m a podcaster or streamer and mention that my setup looks really clean and sounds great.  Most of my calls take less than 1Mbps upload during the call so it&#x27;s probably not the internet&#x27;s fault for the most part.<p>Never had anyone say that with my laptop integrated cam on wifi.  My guess is that now that every laptop has a camera and a mic just above the keyboard, we are just used to seeing shitty images and hearing garbled sound but apparently, it does make a difference.')
