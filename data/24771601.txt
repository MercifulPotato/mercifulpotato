That other organization will not run the same operation on two sets of data to verify if they match - they&#x27;ll just import it in their workflow, and what happens there will have consequences immediately as soon as some item e.g. a person is switched to a new system. And it&#x27;s plausible that you won&#x27;t have any direct visibility in any flaws in that migration until that person complains to that organization and <i>perhaps</i> maybe eventually they will identify that your data migration is involved instead of simply screwing that person for months.')
