Union dues are low. Given what organizing actually looks like, multiple unions are more likely to undermine the existence of a unionized workforce at all than to drive dues down.\n2. Ideally, union corruption would be dealt with the entire shop moving to a different local, not the shop splitting into sectors.\n3. Workers elect their stewards and negotiators, who set the\nnegotiating agenda. It&#x27;s not perfect, but this would be better dealt with by new representation than by adding another union with a competing agenda.<p>Like I said, I believe this reflects a misunderstanding about the function of unions and what workers are trying to get out of them.')
