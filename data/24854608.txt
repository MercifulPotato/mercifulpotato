Fidgeting with my hands or something is similar, but not as conducive.<p>It actually is a boon in lectures or physical presentations (people find the motions engaging), but it&#x27;s usually distracting enough in problem-solving meetings with peers, that I&#x27;ll avoid it in those situations.<p>My favorite part about working remote during COVID has been that I can finally do this during normal meetings, and nobody has to be distracted by it! :)')
