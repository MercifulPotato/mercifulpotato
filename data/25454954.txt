In the context of a Facebook news feed it seems reasonable to me that Facebook should have data on which news sources or groups I&#x27;m following, and so it&#x27;s entirely reasonable for them to use that data for ad targeting.<p>I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s reasonable to expect that Facebook should have access to the history of all the websites I&#x27;ve visited, and data on the content of those websites, so it doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable that they should be using that data to target ads at me.<p>Similarly for Google, targeting ads based on things I&#x27;ve searched for on Google is entirely reasonable. Targeting them based on the fact Google Maps has picked up a BLE beacon saying I was in a particular shop seems a lot less reasonable - Google frankly have no business knowing that I was in that shop, especially given there&#x27;s unlikely to be any signs up notifying me that my visit to that store is being tracked.<p>I guess my underlying issue isn&#x27;t in companies doing personalised ad targeting, its in the massive pools of seemingly unrelated data they&#x27;re collecting to do that targeting. I&#x27;ve been immersed in the world of technology and aware of privacy issues around it for decades, and even I&#x27;m surprised by some of the things that are being correlated for the sake of a 0.25% increase in conversion rate. The average person doesn&#x27;t have a hope of keeping track of what&#x27;s being done, and changes like bringing that data collection front and centre when installed apps is a really positive move.')
