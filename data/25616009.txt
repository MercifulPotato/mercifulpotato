Item(by='Shank', descendants=None, kids=[25616047], score=None, time=1609618144, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25615394, text='My biggest critique with OSM and OSM-based maps is that contributing an OSM change has an unknown time delay between &quot;OSM change&quot; and &quot;actual map software updates to have it.&quot; I was infuriated to find multiple geography issues in Apple Maps in my area. I went to OSM, and the underlying source has already been corrected. The satellite imagery is correct, but the map layers for navigation and travel are wrong. How long will it take for OSM changes to make it into Apple Maps? No clue.<p>You can submit corrections for some info (like place details) to Apple and Google and they&#x27;ll change within 24-48 hours. If you update OSM, however, it&#x27;ll take you an unknown amount of time. Some iOS apps proudly champion being able to update OSM data monthly -- but that&#x27;s still huge compared to basically over a weekend.')
