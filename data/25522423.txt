Just awful on my MacBook that this a couple years old (read, nothing extreme at all). It&#x27;s of course better on my shiny new desktop but fundamentally, it&#x27;s been slow there too.<p>- Tables. If performance was tolerable elsewhere, tables are not. Everything is 2x slower. Wouldn&#x27;t even think of attempting to use them on my phone (which also isn&#x27;t old)<p>- Where are my billing setting on the app? Nowhere to be seen. And not on the website either, unless I go into desktop mode. I was thinking it was free for a couple months because I couldn&#x27;t find the settings.<p>- Launch time. Don&#x27;t get me started. When I used it i tried to never close it to avoid the launch times.<p>In the end I switched over the list-stuff to Todoist which had served me good, but it&#x27;s of course missing the whole smart doc thing. I really don&#x27;t understand if the devs all have beast machines or if they just don&#x27;t care about performance at all. I&#x27;m not trying the product again in a while.')
