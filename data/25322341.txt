It says what it is and what it does on top of browser styles right there in the linked gh page, doesn&#x27;t it? The question is more, like, why do we need to discuss those CSS &quot;tricks&quot; at all on a forum for &quot;hackers&quot;? I mean setting contrast and handling overflow of preformatted code text are as basic as it gets when it comes to text formatting. And come on, &quot;prefer-color-scheme&quot; as media query, really (when we have &quot;the cascade&quot; and user stylesheets, adding lots of overhead to CSS)? It appears CSS is made about as unhelpful and undiscoverable as possible.')
