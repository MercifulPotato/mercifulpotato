I think lots of people eventually reach a point in their job&#x2F;career where they stop trying to find meaning in work and try to find meaning elsewhere.<p>I&#x27;ve got a PhD and have worked in some different types of jobs inside and outside Academia.  Instead of meaning, I try to understand if I can feel useful in my job.  And by &quot;useful&quot; I don&#x27;t mean curing cancer, feeding starving children, etc.  If a person works in a huge company and builds a simple dashboard that saves people hundreds of hours of manual work, they can feel really useful.   Maybe some parts of the job are actually interesting as well as useful.<p>I feel places like HN massively over-represents people who find or claim to find &quot;meaning&quot; in their work.  It&#x27;s hard to really evaluate what people are saying without knowing their age, career progression, the opportunities they did and did not have, etc.')
