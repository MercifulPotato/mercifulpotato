The handicap system makes it fun to play at any skill level. The only trouble is sometimes servers don&#x27;t always have players of all levels at some times of day.<p>Edit: progress is weird though. Often hit a plateau and seemingly stuck there a long time, then for some seemingly inexplicable reason you advance. The strangest is when this happens while you&#x27;re not playing and you return different&#x2F;better than when you took a break.<p>The other thing I appreciate is that you can be good at whole board strategy or detailed tactical fights. The latter requires more thinking and the former you can get away (to a certain level) by developing intuition over time.')
