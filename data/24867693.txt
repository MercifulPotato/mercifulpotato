I don&#x27;t expect to die tomorrow, but I probably don&#x27;t have more than 30 years left either (based on average life-expectancy at the time of my birth). The actual expiry date is most likely somewhere in-between, but the fact is that very few people get to know until it&#x27;s too late. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t want to know either.')
