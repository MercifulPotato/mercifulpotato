Cable companies like Charter and other wireline providers generally use the money to expand their networks into new areas that don&#x27;t already have broadband. But with Starlink, SpaceX could theoretically provide service to all of rural America once it has launched enough satellites, even without FCC funding.</i><p>&gt;<i>One possibility is that SpaceX could use the FCC money to lower prices in the 642,925 funded locations, but the FCC announcement didn&#x27;t say whether that&#x27;s what SpaceX will do.</i><p>SpaceX is still in the painful bootstrapping phase of things, and their cost structure right now is still higher then what they ultimately hope for. But from the sound of it they&#x27;ve got a lot of flexibility in how they deploy this money so long as they ultimately meet service targets, and they&#x27;re only one player amongst many even for this subsidy money. If they&#x27;re satisfied with service people don&#x27;t tend to casually switch providers, so there is real value in being first. I think therefore SpaceX may consider using some of the money at least to lower the bar of someone signing up and try to get currently underserved households onboard as customers faster.<p>Additionally, don&#x27;t forget this is only the first round, there is even more money available next time. Given the nature of bidding, I assume strategic calculations about how to win more next time will also play a role.')
