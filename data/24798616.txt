However I did not. \nI would have no reason to prep for such a question due to the amount of time Ive spent in the commercial sector developing solutions rather than rehearsing interviews like a fresh graduate who has never programmed before would do. \nCan I solve the problem? Ofcourse, but not as quickly as someone who has revised for it, even if I take a couple of minutes longer, it would be taken badly - regardless of whether it was rote or freshly devised.<p>You arent selecting for a good developer - you are selecting for someone who has had the time to prepare for interview questions ( a massive red flag in my book )<p>The answer? Atleast for me.<p>Is he experienced? Does the conversation flow naturally?  Do you feel he is a loyal, dependable person who can clearly communicate?  Well I would say that covers 90% of the issue.  Hire the guy, see how he performs.')
