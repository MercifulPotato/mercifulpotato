Item(by='justinclift', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608561864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475956, text='&gt; looking at the online reaction you&#x27;d get the idea that this game is a non-stop bugfest.<p>It kind of is though.  Super common to have dropped objects (eg guns from dead thugs) be stuck in the ground and unable to be picked up.  :&#x2F;<p>Personally, I installed it yesterday about midday, then played for around 8 hours.  Today, played around 6 more hours, finally getting up to the Keanu Reeves piece (after doing many side quests).<p>Got stuck in a location between objects, 1&#x2F;2 way between floors.  Had to revert to my last checkpoint save... only to discover the game hadn&#x27;t been saving for the last 4 hours of play time.  WTF! :( :( :(<p>No autosaves when it should, no quick saves either.  Even though it clearly showed the saving icon each time I triggered a quick save, prior to getting close to a mission start location.<p>Uninstalled it instead.<p>Losing 1&#x2F;4 of my play time like that, when it explicitly showed the icon to indicate saving was happening.. and not actually doing it, is so far beyond taking the piss. :(<p>Not sure if I&#x27;ll try again in a few months.  Plenty of other, better things to put time into instead.')
