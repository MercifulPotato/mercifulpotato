And only if you&#x27;re OK with taking cluster down for a minute as you add it.<p>If you true freedom you&#x27;d need to go Ceph(FS) based, but there&#x27;s no GUI to manage a Ceph cluster that I&#x27;m aware of, and they&#x27;re so focused on cloud usage that you&#x27;ll find little guidance on single-node clusters.<p>edit: Forgot to read Louwrentius&#x27; comment, of course MDADM with raid 6 allows you to add disks in pairs of two, so that&#x27;s definitely also an option. Don&#x27;t forget to use LVM, it can get real awkward without it.')
