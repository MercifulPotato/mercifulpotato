This is what he said:<p>&gt; So as the Polish people were struggling with the Soviet empire, they came up with a slogan: &quot;Two plus two equals four.&quot; They printed it up. They put it on signs. They put it in the front door. And the Soviets knew it was somehow treasonous, but they couldn&#x27;t -- how do you walk in a store and say, &quot;You can&#x27;t have &#x27;Two plus two equals four&#x27; in the window&quot;?<p>It came from two places. One was Camus&#x27; novel, &quot;The Plague,&quot; in which Camus says there are times when a man can be killed for saying two plus two equals four, because the authorities can&#x27;t stand the truth. I think you&#x27;ll find more than enough occasion in Washington, in Sacramento, in Albany, in city hall, in county commissions, that they can&#x27;t stand the truth.<p>(source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.c-span.org&#x2F;video&#x2F;?292185-11&#x2F;newt-gingrich-remarks-conservative-political-action-conference" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.c-span.org&#x2F;video&#x2F;?292185-11&#x2F;newt-gingrich-remark...</a>)')
