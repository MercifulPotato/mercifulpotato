The &quot;lightness&quot; approach in your examples would be sticking to arrays instead of using containers, or using Java serialization back when it was introduced (language feature, no extra weight!) instead writing to CSV, which requires a parser.<p>I feel like you are taking about a different problem here, and the problem TFA addresses is indeed academic.<p>(Edit: the author of the article shies away from giving example. The only example -- in-house gettext alternatives -- was definitely not a lightness concern where I&#x27;ve seen it; consider that i18n framework in Android isn&#x27;t simply gettext for reasons that have nothing to do with TFA)')
