Let&#x27;s assume\n  &gt; I&#x27;m not an idiot please, just misguided. This isn&#x27;t reddit.\n</code></pre>\nThis cargocult ritual is for those who manage farms of identical servers. If you have a single production server with no load balancing, it&#x27;s fine.<p>But be careful, Git does not handle file permissions well by default. If you have a directory or file that needs special permissions (like a cron job script) then you should set `core.fileMode` to `false` in your git config.')
