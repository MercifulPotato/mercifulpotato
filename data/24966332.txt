For example, saving application configuration as Option&lt;int&gt; is easier for the application to read correctly (int value, bool present). However when a user is editing an Option&lt;T&gt; through a GUI (checkbox, number) pair, then unchecking the checkbox will set the value to None and discard the last entered value, which is a poor user experience in my view.')
