I guess the interesting way to compare them would be what&#x27;s the disposable income you have to spend normalised against purchasing power. So gross salary, less taxes (payroll and any others if applicable), pension contributions, student loan repayments, medical insurance contributions (and other out-of-pocket expenses relating to that you may have to pay in a typical year), and then baseline cost-of-living (rent&#x2F;mortgage payments), but there are so many variables there it seems very hard to be directly comparable.<p>All I know is if I earned what I did now (which is an excellent UK salary) in Silicon Valley, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford to live by myself in a two-bedroom flat in a desirable area, which is what I do now. I&#x27;ve no idea how much I would have to earn in SV to have the same quality of life as I do in Manchester, UK. (I figured it out for London and it&#x27;s approximately a Â£20k premium due to the rental premium in London)')
