Tech had other issues before that are kind of resolved and at the same time new problems have evolved that might not be apparent to all frogs in the water.<p>The biggest overall problem I see for a life in tech is that constant information has created constant competition to integrate popular ideas into the work place. There are therefore a lot of places that have exactly the same things, and popular things rarely live up to the label, which can be fine, but some can be major irritants.<p>Of course, there are some places that make a point of being stubborn about keeping a difference, but I&#x27;m less likely to estimate in years or decades when an organization claims it is sticking to an unpopular direction than I was in say 2000.<p>So increasingly, I think there is less choice about many of the factors that go into an office job in a place that prides itself on tech. For all the talk of diversity, there&#x27;s a lot more one size fits all.')
