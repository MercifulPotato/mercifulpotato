The hard thing about x86 is the fact that instructions can by anywhere from 8 bits-&gt;256 bits in length (in 8 bit increments).  So there&#x27;s really no way to know if you are loading up an x86 instruction or you are splitting an instruction.<p>The fact that risc-v only supports 32,64, or 128bit instructions means that you don&#x27;t have to go through a lot of extra effort to determine where instructions start or end.')
