You need to stop doing that. The original quote:<p>&gt; What they can&#x27;t survive is groups of thugs that don&#x27;t like the result of an election, <i>and go off to physically prevent its results from being honored.</i> That is unprecedented.<p>The last part of that sentence you cropped (emphasized by me) didn&#x27;t come to pass because it was interrupted by Capitol contingency plans and Shelter In Place protocols, among other things. It very well could&#x27;ve been successful; we&#x27;re lucky to not know that outcome.')
