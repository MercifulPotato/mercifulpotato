In the same manner no one blocks the exit markers and people stand in the queue behind the train door ready to disembark quickly.<p>Only this makes the 90 second Shinkansen stops possible as well as the 3 minute cadence between trains we saw in Hiroshima station possible. Not only is the platform used very efficiently, there is even a small Soba restaurant in the middle of the platform! :)<p>In comparison here in Europe (CZ) the trains are usually late and you migh only lern the platform couple minutes before the train arrives - and it might even change at the last minute! There are no door markers and trains stop preatty much at random somewhere at the platform. Most traincars still have stairs and people are not used to proper queueing, so they form a fan around every door that blocks people from quickly getting eiter in or out.<p>The trains are also slow (160 km&#x2F;h max on parts of track and on a good day) and mostly not EMUs, so you have platform space used up by the locomotive. Oh well.')
