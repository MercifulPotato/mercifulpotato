It&#x27;s the most comprehensive guide of how to organize a large FastAPI project I&#x27;ve seen. Which is important, because FastAPI is unopinonated, so there&#x27;s onboarding cost to getting a team on the same page-- strong opinions help alleviate that!<p>It&#x27;s more Rails-like then Django&#x2F;Flask-like. Meaning, top-level organization by &quot;M&quot;&#x2F;&quot;V&quot;&#x2F;&quot;C&quot; as opposed to by &quot;Blueprint.&quot; I mean, &quot;models&#x2F;blog.py&quot; as opposed to &quot;blog&#x2F;models.py&quot;.<p>Netflix Dispatch is an example project that organizes in the more Flask-Blueprint-like way (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Netflix&#x2F;dispatch&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;dispatch" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Netflix&#x2F;dispatch&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;dispatch</a>).<p>I&#x27;m going to pour over this a bit longer, but that will take some time!
