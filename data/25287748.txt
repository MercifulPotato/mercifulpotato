It&#x27;s good that research like this is carried out. However, it&#x27;s totally an 80-20 kind of a game. If we have any chance of stabilizing the climate, its only through focusing aggressively on the 80% part of the above.<p>For example, reading &#x27;ditch new tech to fight climate change&#x27;, I was hoping to get an article on massive reforestation schemes, agroforestry, or something old-new along those lines. Sure, it would be a massive effort, but that&#x27;s low cost highly available and accessible carbon sequestration tech right there. You just need to incentivize people and organizations appropriately.<p>Actually, we could just start by doing something about the aggressive deforestation going on in Brazil right now.')
