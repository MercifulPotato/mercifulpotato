I will try nevertheless.<p>Mail dumping, interception and modification of ballots, just plain errors in ballots or failure to mail them (these last two are not in the &#x27;game the ballot&#x27; category, but they do happen with mail-in balloting) all occur in almost every election. Even if they do not materially change election results, they affect the perception of the legitimacy of results. The perception is as important as the reality of the process. Any law that helps improve the perception should be welcomed.')
