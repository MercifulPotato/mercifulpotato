Not only is it resolving imports into file paths and loading them into memory, but it’s also executing module-level code which tends to be quite common in Python, so it’s not at all uncommon for imports to take 5s or more.<p>Meanwhile in Go, dependencies are baked into the executable so there is no resolving of dependencies, and the analog to “module level code” (i.e., package init() functions) are discouraged and thus much less common and where they occur they don’t do as much work compared to the average Python package.')
