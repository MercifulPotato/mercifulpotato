In high school I didn&#x27;t have many problems but at University I found I would often choke during exams despite knowing the material and being well prepared.<p>I would get extremely nervous in the lead up to my university exams, I&#x27;d have difficulty falling asleep the night before, I&#x27;d be tossing and turning all night going over everything in my head and I&#x27;d feel anxious and sick (my stomach would be incredibly queasy) to the point I&#x27;d have trouble eating anything in the morning. So I&#x27;d go into my exams tired and irritable (because I hadn&#x27;t eaten much) and I&#x27;d make stupid mistakes.<p>Eventually I got over this but it took me a year or two and it definitely had an effect on my grades.')
