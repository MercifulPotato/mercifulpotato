Item(by='lopmotr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602290791, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735714, text='Wikipedia requires sources for its information, especially anything contentious. If Twitter somehow obtained the manpower and speed to do that, then it might be OK but there&#x27;s no hope of that ever being possible. The rate of content generation is too high, the demand for immediate publication is too high, and the effect of removing something a few days after it&#x27;s posted is too little too late because it will have already had its effect. Nobody would use such a slow and boring service where almost every post gets automatically put on hold until someone can find a source. Users obviously won&#x27;t do their own research - that&#x27;s like schoolwork!<p>Wish somebody a happy birthday. Wait till tomorrow for Twitter&#x27;s employees or crowdsourcing to verify it. And it only gets verified if that information is actually available to them.')
