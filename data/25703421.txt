They are EVADING. Their home isnt a safe space from warrants.<p>You just effectively nullified the entire reason to have a warrant out for someone&#x27;s arrest, let alone reason for bail so someone shows up to court.<p>And no, it&#x27;s not safer in the sense they aren&#x27;t shot. Body armor has gotten better and the likelihood of surviving a few rounds to the chest has gone up. The shootings haven&#x27;t changed, just the body armor. Get out of your sick fantasy world. Better yet, go be a cop to help reform. See for yourself before you think you have an opinion.')
