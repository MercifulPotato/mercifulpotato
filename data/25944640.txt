Non-copyleft licenses seem to just be code for corporations to build upon, providing them free labor while getting little in return.  At least with the GPL, you are getting a promise that they will make available their sources.  Consider carefully your expectations when you license your software.<p>An example where a project&#x2F;product hybrid somewhat works is web browsers.  Generally speaking, there are several competitors trying to achieve something similar, and there are some attempts (however nebulous) to create standards bodies.  The Elastic Search community could have done something similar and formed a standards body around some sort of specification.')
