There were plenty of unsavory characters in the book.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean. I agree that there are tons of unsavory characters in the book. Atticus is not one of them. He&#x27;s portrayed as nearly flawless. This plays into the White Savior[0] trope.<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re trying to teach white people and people who haven&#x27;t experienced racism about racism, then this is a pretty good way to do it IMO.<p>That sounds appealing, but consider that the book&#x27;s &quot;central&quot; Black character&#x27;s defining characteristic is that he&#x27;s <i>not a violent criminal</i>. That&#x27;s the depiction of black people in the book. This, like I said, makes racism this abstract thing. And especially now when you generally don&#x27;t have lynch mobs, it&#x27;s easy to write off the book&#x27;s entire story as &quot;well we don&#x27;t do that today, racism is solved!&quot;, which is yet another reason the book draws criticism as a teaching tool.<p>The book was perhaps good at a time when Black people were often presented as less-than-human, but now that they&#x27;re usually just presented as less-human, less fully formed, different tools are better.<p>&gt; If there are other, better books to read, then recommend other books. Don&#x27;t ban this one because you don&#x27;t think it goes far enough.<p>I actually already did that in this thread, and then explained why that doesn&#x27;t fix the issue. There are likely already teachers using The Hate U Give or The Invisible man in their classrooms, but there are clearly some that aren&#x27;t. Giving teachers a bunch of choices doesn&#x27;t protect students from teachers who make bad choices. Ultimately, requiring that teachers use better teaching tools in their curriculums isn&#x27;t the boogeyman it seems to be made out to be. Like, it&#x27;s still staying in school libraries.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;White_savior" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;White_savior</a>')
