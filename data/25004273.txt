Evil does not support settings such as `:set nu` or a thousand other settings that I use once in a blue moon but expect to just work. Even `:wq` attempts to close all buffers, `:e` doesn&#x27;t open files as expected, I could go on.<p>IdeaVIM get 90% of VIM right, and some things wrong (such as `u` for undo also undoing movements). Evil gets 95% of VIM right. But I have high hopes for NeoVIM allowing an actual first-class VIM implementation to be embedded, not copied, into an IDE or even Emacs.')
