I can&#x27;t see how this could help GME or other stocks picked for this ride.<p>I totally get the emotional value of these stocks and the hit they took due to the pandemic. This just feels that they are used as pawns and somehow this recent emotional tension is being harvested for some other than the proclaimed purpose (to support the stocks).')
