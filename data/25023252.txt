Technology companies with technology management often disrupt the companies managed by the old way of thinking (e.g. finance, insurance, etc).<p>Some of the things you mention are red flags though at least to me having worked in them before - for me they normally make me question the companies management. The biggest one seen in a previous place I worked IMO - is buy vs build as much as possible off the shelf. How many successful tech first companies who have disrupted actually use that model for their core platform? The companies I&#x27;ve seen get away with it until they face competitive pressure OR technology isn&#x27;t their primary advantage. In fact as you get to a certain size it can make sense to build your own and reduce your vendor count + ongoing costs and take advantage of your economies of scale. How many big tech firms rewrite db&#x27;s, parts, dev-ops tools or are at least open to when the advantage is there? The successful tech first companies often do, even if they were once things like book stores where it &quot;wasn&#x27;t their core business&quot;. They even open source their components often to support their business and give their tech people more cred; allowing them to attract even more tech talent. The most successful&#x2F;nice to work tech places usually err to building when it concerns their platform, with some pragmatism thrown in to use modern tooling from elsewhere if required normally open source but can be bought if it offers nothing of differentiation (e.g. cloud products, databases, etc).<p>Cloud is just a potential enabler IMO; you still need the culture to execute. A big corporation has a lot of interacting requirements, and needs the long term flexibility to change it without being on the hook in a vendor&#x27;s backlog competing with other firms. It also potentially leaks your roadmap to other competitors. Common business software (e.g. document writing, email, chat, etc) are the exception; if your a big corp your usually in a monopoly&#x2F;oligopoly position - there aren&#x27;t too many people doing what you do at the scale you are and most vendor solutions are really just &quot;outsourced builds&quot;; where the long term flexibility as the vendor pivots&#x2F;changes deteriorates.')
