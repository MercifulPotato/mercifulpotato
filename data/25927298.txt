Is that really so surprising?<p>When somebody else foots the bill, it&#x27;s feast time!<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m with you. Also a PhD-turned-industry, for much the same reasons. But I realize what you describe is a completely rational strategy. The options always come down to:<p>1) Try not to be a <i>host</i> – if you have the wherewithal<p>2) Try to be a <i>parasite</i> – if you have the stomach<p>3) Suck it up &amp; stay <i>salty</i> – otherwise. You can call it a balance, equilibrium, natural order of things – whatever helps you sleep at night.<p>Take your pick and then choose appropriate means. Romantic resolutions and wishful thinking – kinda like Atlas Shrugged solution for option 1) – rarely work.')
