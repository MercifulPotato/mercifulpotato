As a manager, you are hired to be an extension of your boss. Your boss may have 5 managers reporting to him, reach of which has 5 reports of their own. Your boss is tremendously busy and no longer has the time to understand all the details of all the work under their purview. If your report goes to your boss and starts presenting a problem, the report may have very little idea of how their problem fits into the other 25 problems that ICs may bring up, and yet is making a decision that this should be their boss&#x27; boss&#x27; (director) priority. If this happens continually, the direct manager is not doing their job, and the director will make sure they hear about it.<p>More shortly, sometimes what you think is bad news as an IC is something your manager can solve without getting their boss involved. Especially with more junior reports, they may have trouble distinguishing the difference.')
