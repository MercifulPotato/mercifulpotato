Europeans get more per tax dollar than we do. In the USA, we just waste the money. Europeans pay a bit more than we do, but they get a <i>lot</i> more back in terms of transit, health care, social safety net, etc. If our government can&#x27;t use the money more efficiently, it shouldn&#x27;t get even more.<p>Last time I rode on Amtrak it was absolutely depressing.
