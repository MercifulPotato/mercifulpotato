So actually the lawsuit will still be fought and the company will stay alive doing so. The problem is that they can’t raise another round to fund operations because they can’t find investors while the lawsuit is ongoing.<p>As others have noted loser-pays doesn’t provide any protection. The problem is that lawyers write the rules for the system they operate in (either directly as legislators or indirectly through fundraising, influence, and lobbyists). Regardless of the outcome of a case the lawyers arguing it are fine. I wonder what would happen if you suddenly made the lawyers somehow financially vested in civil suits too and strengthen scenarios where lawyers become financially liable (ie bad faith arguments, shenanigans by lawyers that might be de facto legal but are judged to be bad faith, etc).')
