I know SQL fairly well, but have no experience in web dev. I would think website builders would have basic functionality for this, but maybe it&#x27;s a much harder problem than I&#x27;m thinking.<p>I would also think this could be done on the server side, so the user should never interact directly with the database. Is web development usually difficult to find answers for? I work in networking so rarely interactive with web dev.<p>Thank you.')
