Item(by='craftinator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607810362, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25401807, text='&gt; Is there any real concrete — or at least scientifically backed — reasons why we’re continuing to see numbers rise, in spite of more lockdowns in place<p>Anthony Fauci summed this up pretty well a few days ago in a press release. He basically said that the USA is really bad at following rules, which we are, and that with the recent holidays (Halloween, Thanksgiving) and because of the cold weather (people stay indoors more, share the same air, air being recycled and heated in HVAC systems to reduce energy consumption), that numbers would rise.  And so they are. I think these human explanations are the main source of the rise in numbers.<p>Another interesting one was in a WHO release a few weeks ago, that people seem to be experiencing &quot;mask fatigue&quot;, or what is more generally known as &quot;caution fatigue&quot;, where people, after having to be cautious for a long time, and not experiencing the source of that caution personally, just lose their ability to pay attention to the problem. It&#x27;s the same reason the TSA inserts fake firearm pictures into the x-rays of luggage, and the same reason the military regularly inspects guard posts in key locations.')
