Look: we here on hacker news are used to thinking about the world in a logical way.  We test our ideas against reality and reject what doesn’t fit.  We have rational enlightenment ideals about democracy and reason.  Well some people don’t!  They really don’t.  They have a prescientific, premodern understanding of the world. I know this is hard to accept but it’s clearly true.  And every time they turn on the tv and see gay people and atheists, they get furious and they want all those people to shut up and be silent, so the world can go back to being the comfortable, familiar place that they think it is without all the complexity and uncertainty that the real world contains.  So if you don’t understand the world, and it’s scary, you’re going to latch on to some belief system that says that some cabal of devil worshippers is responsible for everything you don’t like.  Logic has nothing to do with it.')
