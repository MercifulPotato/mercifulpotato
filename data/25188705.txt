One of the big selling points for me is the dead simple billing. Another huge selling point is trivial unification of calling and messaging across devices.<p>The latter feature has been enabled by Hangouts up until now. Now, it seems to be equally fulfilled by Messages. I&#x27;m not losing other Messages features, as I&#x27;ve never used them. I&#x27;ll get to keep my unified calling and messaging across devices. I am relatively happy. I&#x27;d prefer no change, but it&#x27;s been clear that Hangouts would go away for some time now.')
