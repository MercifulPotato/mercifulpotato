The last Windows compatible version of Safari was back in 2012 or so, and as far as I know, it was never available on Linux.<p>Therefore, for me to test on Safari, I either have to spend thousands to buy a laptop, or pay out of my pocket for some sort of cross-browser testing tool (even if it&#x27;s free, I am spending extra time) while Chrome&#x2F;Firefox are used by most of the world and ensuring that I deal with Safari&#x27;s idiosyncrasies does nothing much for me.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s Chrome that has an weirdass non-standard UI (the practice of showing app preferences&#x2F;dialogs in a webpage needs to burn in the flames of Hades) and other niggles, not to mention being a privacy black hole.<p>I would argue its more standard since it is the same UI in every OS I wanted to use. I honestly don&#x27;t think people are that angry about preferences as a webpage.<p>In terms of privacy, Firefox kicks Safari out of the water, and in terms of performance, it is faster, and actually renders everything (something Safari fails way too often at).<p>&gt; &quot;most&quot; Mac users wouldn&#x27;t give a fuck about Chrome.<p>Eh. Safari not rendering elements of the page, constantly crashing, and other myriad of issues do well enough to push people to Chrome&#x2F;Firefox. Also, most people quickly start using Firefox when they realize that UBlock Origin doesn&#x27;t work on Safari and is easily better than anything that comes on Safari.<p>Honestly, for me as developer, Safari is the new IE6, except possibly worse because bugs for IE6 are very well-documented with good workarounds.')
