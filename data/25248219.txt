He knows what he&#x27;s saying and doing. First step is the charm stage. Hell, he&#x27;s the top boss and complained about election fraud months before election even started. He did nothing about it other than sabotaging US Post. Later he latches unto his anchor to defraud half the population, to spread FUD and lies.<p>The fact people can state this without reprecussion, makes him a weak liar. Everyone knows this, and this is how he speaks first, in order to disarm allegations about what he&#x27;s doing. Just project all his words back to him, and you now have a list of all wrongdoings, ironically.')
