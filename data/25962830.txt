A jury means that the government has to prove its case, not just to one person who&#x27;s employed by the government (the judge), but to some random people off the street.  The purpose is to make it harder for the government to just put people away &quot;because we said so&quot; - outside the rule of law.  It also <i>can</i> serve as a brake on insane or unjust laws, though it does not always do so.<p>Now, for a complex or technical civil trial (Oracle v Google, say), it has flaws.  That I will freely admit.  But the businesses in those kinds of trials <i>can</i> choose to have a bench trial (that is, one decided by the judge).  When they choose not to, it&#x27;s because they think they are more likely to be able to snow the jury than the judge.  Unfortunately, if I understand correctly it only takes one side to choose a jury trial, and the one with no real case is more likely to do so.')
