Same problem as with CO2 and global warming, we will only ever respond to negotiation and persuasion, you will never be able to walk over us like we are doormats. It doesn’t matter if there is a way to rationalize how leaving us free might harm others, we generally do not trust your judgement and we will <i>never</i> entrust you with the power to enslave us.')
