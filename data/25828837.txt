Looking forward to seeing where this project ends up in a few years. A couple of questions&#x2F;comments:<p>1) postgres is critical but I saw in another comment you were already on that<p>2) where are the big boys under hosting?  I had an imposter syndrome moment when I clicked on that drop down because I didn’t recognize a single name on it...I’ve been at this for almost 20 years now. AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, and Heroku were some of the things I would have expected.<p>3) anyway to see a sample code base without paying?  I’m not sure how that would work as I don’t know how you can do it without also enabling people to take your work without paying but it’s a non starter for me. I’m probably not your target audience though so take this request with a grain of salt.<p>Congrats on shipping and best of luck with the product!<p>Edit:\nI went back and noticed to hosting options are all serverless so not surprising a crusty old Rails guys wouldn’t recognize them.')
