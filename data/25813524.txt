The only thing Moxie can do is to make Signal closed source, or constantly break the signal protocol on purpose and force everybody to upgrade their signal and telegram apps.<p>Also I tried Matrix, and it started asking questions from me instead of showing my friend list, so it already failed being a competitor to WhatsApp. The only question it should ask is to get permission to access my contact list.<p>I know that interopability is very hard to do, and having multiple clients in 1 app is boring work (especially with features like voice and video calling), but it would be amazing.')
