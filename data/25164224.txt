It ends up being something in between Jupyter and Observable:<p>* One of the goals is to build Jupyter how it would have been if it was designed for the web (only).<p>* It&#x27;s open source [1], plays nice with git (the format is plaintext), and supports local viewing &amp; editing [2]<p>* Because of that you can host it yourself, put it on your blog &#x2F; github pages, anywhere.<p>* There is little magic, it actually is just Javascript at it&#x27;s base. This means you can use standard browser APIs and HTML, and when you are ready to &quot;graduate&quot; the notebook implementation that should be straightforward. In my eyes notebooks are only for the first 20% of the work that does 80% of the job for small applications&#x2F;experimentation (which is often where it ends anyway).<p>* You can &quot;build the ship as you sail&quot;: you can load new cell types dynamically at runtime. This is also how Python is supported (through WebAssembly).<p>* You can have interop with Python and Javascript which is really powerful. Example: Create a drag an drop form using HTML+JS, then process the dropped CSV file using Pandas and visualize using matplotlib.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;starboard.gg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;starboard.gg</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gzuidhof&#x2F;starboard-notebook" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gzuidhof&#x2F;starboard-notebook</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gzuidhof&#x2F;starboard-cli" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gzuidhof&#x2F;starboard-cli</a>')
