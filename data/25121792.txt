I did that a few years back (and I&#x27;m not saying I read the source code, just learned about the base concepts from a few blogs and played around with some more advanced commands), and it has paid dividends _every single day for the last several years_. For example, I avoid tracking branches and have started using `git fetch`, `git merge --ff-only &lt;remote&gt;&#x2F;&lt;branch&gt;`, `git reset --hard &lt;remote&gt;&#x2F;&lt;branch&gt;` and `git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;` to push and pull remote code. Even these slightly lower level commands will start to help you understand what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes and take the mystery out of, say, rebase conflicts.')
