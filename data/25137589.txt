I&#x27;m glad he acknowledges the problem with this:<p>&quot;A Product Hunt launch can easily get you a spike in traffic, but afterwards I really don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing&quot;.<p>Here are some tips to help with this:<p>1) Explore more &quot;steady&quot; acquisition channels. Yes, PH&#x2F;HN are &quot;spike-y&quot; channels and they&#x27;re often not enough to have a business generating sustainable income. Read &quot;Traction&quot; by Gabriel Weinberg (I&#x27;m also doing some research on this topic [1]).<p>2) Maybe flip the script and do the opposite? Choose 1 or 2 promising projects, and do &quot;six months of exploring user acquisition&quot;. Test SEO, FB&#x2F;Google Ads, partnerships, affiliates, appstores and so on.<p>Good luck!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com</a>')
