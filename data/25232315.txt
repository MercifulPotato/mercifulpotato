Item(by='geofft', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606509119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229533, text='&gt; <i>tan(π&#x2F;8) would be halfway between 0 and 1 ie .5?</i><p>It implies that tan(π&#x2F;8) would be &quot;halfway&quot; between 0 and 1 <i>in this sense of what &quot;halfway&quot; means</i>. In this sense, 0.5 is not halfway between 0 and 1, 0.414 is.<p>It&#x27;s easier to visualize it. You&#x27;re standing on the roof of a 1-meter-tall building on a flat earth with a perfectly clear atmosphere. If you look straight out \n(90°) you can see to infinity (tan 90°). If you look down (0°) you can see where you are (tan 0°). If you look halfway between those (45°), you can see 1 (tan 45°) meter straight in front of you. But if you look halfway down again, you won&#x27;t see exactly 0.5 meters, will you?')
