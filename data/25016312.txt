It uses two clocks, both derived from the PLL from an onboard 16Mhz MEMs oscillator: 48Mhz for usb (the usb&lt;-&gt;serial bridge is implemented in the fpga fabric) and 24Mhz for the vga pixel clock (25.175 would be the 640x400@70Hz standard, but I compromised by dividing the usb clock by two).  Using a usb&lt;-&gt;3.3v serial cable or an fpga board w&#x2F;external usb&lt;-&gt;serial bridge you could run everything @25.175Mhz (and save half the logic in the FPGA and a kB or embedded RAM).<p>2. I will have to measure this and get back to you, but can&#x27;t be too much, and negligible compared to the monitor in any case.<p>I can tell you that it&#x27;s powered by a USB port and has onboard 3.3V &amp; 1.2V regulators (300 mA &amp; 150 mA max respectively). It doesn&#x27;t currently implement a standby mode, but for reference the FPGA supports a standby mode which comsumes about 21uA according to the datasheet.')
