But why doesn’t anyone look at the bigger elephant in the room?<p>Sometime in April 2019, reports of a mysterious illness started surfacing. They thought it was related to vaping products. [1]<p>Then in July 2019, a respiratory illness hit a retirement home in Virginia, and killed a bunch of old people. [2]<p>Then the Wuhan military games was in mid October 2019.<p>Then China reported of an unknown pneumonia in early December. They thought it came from a seafood market, which was proven incorrect.<p>The western world harassed them and accused them of eating bats, and transmitting the disease, which is also proven to be incorrect.<p>China then back-traced the earliest case to mid November. Which happens to coincide a few weeks after the Wuhan military games. Just the right amount of time for the virus to incubate and wreck havoc.<p>New evidence is suggesting that the virus was in Italy before it was in China. [3]<p>But the interesting thing, is that when they took MRI scans of the vaping outbreak patients, they saw white orbs in the picture in their lungs. Coincidentally, Covid-19 victims also had these white orbs in their lungs.<p>The whole origin of this virus was always very mysterious. Something just never seemed right about it.<p>The vaping thing just came and disappeared. Nobody really knows what caused it, just a few random theories about contaminated cartridges. But here’s the strange thing. Those vaping pens, are all made in China. And are sold all over the world. People in China uses those vaping pens everywhere, but there were no reports of a mysterious illness from it in China. Only in the United States and a few in Canada. Not even Europe reported any issues.<p>Why was it reported only in the United States? Then soon after, all the other pieces began to fall into place, one after the other.<p>To get down to the true origin of this virus, then they need to check those vaping people. Check them for the Covid-19 antibodies.<p>Then check the nursing home people from Virginia, for those that survived, for Covid-19 antibodies.<p>Then check the people that went to the Wuhan military games for Covid-19 antibodies.<p>Or not. And just conveniently blame China for being the origin of the virus, just because they were the first ones to detect it, and report it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2019%E2%80%932020_vaping_lung_illness_outbreak" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2019%E2%80%932020_vaping_lung_...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;11&#x2F;us&#x2F;virginia-retirement-community-respiratory-illness-outbreak&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;11&#x2F;us&#x2F;virginia-retirement-commun...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;health-coronavirus-italy-timing&#x2F;italian-study-suggesting-covid-predates-china-outbreak-sparks-scepticism-idUKL8N2I351V" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;health-coronavirus-italy-tim...</a>')
