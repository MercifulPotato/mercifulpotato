Item(by='oblio', descendants=None, kids=[25902084], score=None, time=1611570235, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25901564, text='&gt; Recharging should always be done at home overnight (10+ hours of charge time, low power requirement), or during normal daily activities (work, shopping).<p>A big chunk of the world&#x27;s population lives in dense cities without access to private parking.<p>A big chunk of that big chunk lives in developing countries where new infrastructure roll out is very slow, so readily available street charging is probably more than 5 years into the future.<p>My prediction: for the next 5 years EVs will be the domain of upper middle classes and for the next 10 years EVs will be the domain of middle classes. Poor people will keep using ICE cars until at least 2035, maybe more. And they will still account for probably half the cars on the road.')
