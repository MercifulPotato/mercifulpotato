If you live in a dense part of the city, you&#x27;ve got half a dozen other providers to choose from as well.  Google-owned WebPass can put a microwave dish on your roof and offer 100+ mb&#x2F;sec for $50 or less per apartment.  Mine is a local company that runs a huge fiber line direct from the nearest exchange center and puts a managed switch in the basement, with each unit having a cat5 line direct to the switch.  It&#x27;s $25 per month for 250 mb&#x2F;sec symmetrical with direct peering to Amazon, Netflix, Apple, and a few others, and all the common areas like the pool deck and gym have free wifi running at those speeds.  I can upgrade to gigabit for an extra $25 per month, which I did for the first few year.  But it works so well that I don&#x27;t bother anymore.')
