This maintains the phase and frequency of the grids electricity by providing &quot;synchronous momentum&quot;.<p>However this synchronous momentum is lost when the mechanical generators are switched off. And so giant batteries and inverters are used instead to provide this critical function.<p>To put it another way, the giant batteries are not used to power the grid, but instead used to lower the AC impedance of the grid, eg provide synthetic inertia.')
