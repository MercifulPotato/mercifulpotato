Even if they can scoop up the huge graveyard of e.g. Canon 60Ds that photographers will turn over for $200 a piece, or 6Ds for $500 a piece, reverse engineer them, and recycle them into a Raspberry Pi module, that would be amazing.<p>Even with the CMV12000 though, someone should make a RPi module that &quot;just works&quot;, or an alternative RPi that allows it to &quot;just work&quot;, for those of us who want to spend our time working on the actual imaging and software ... it&#x27;s kind of sad there&#x27;s this huge graveyard of good sensors out there that just can&#x27;t be used by imaging experts because electronics people gatekeep the industry and only release them at reasonable prices inside consumer devices, which isn&#x27;t what those imaging experts want at least in terms of programmability, communication, and mounting options.')
