You need to constantly eat and hydrate at colder temperatures because your body is working harder to regulate your temperature. My thermostat is set to 61F, and I&#x27;m comfortable most of the time, but sometimes I&#x27;ll randomly feel really cold even though the temperature and my clothes haven&#x27;t changed. I eat a small snack, and suddenly I&#x27;m comfortable again. When I don&#x27;t do this, I end up sweating as my body tries to raise my core temperature, and then I&#x27;m cold because I&#x27;m wet. And If I do 20 minutes of intense exercise, I often sit around in shorts and a t-shirt for an hour or more and not notice the cold.<p>Also, the material and fit do make an impact on thermal insulation, but not in universal ways. Tight-fitting clothes that aren&#x27;t good insulators - like jeans with elastic - actually end up making you colder because they&#x27;re not good insulators and they increase conduction heat transfer. A loose-fitting pair of non-stretch pants actually insulates better because the material itself is a better insulator, and the air between your leg and the pants is also an insulator [less heat transfer than with the stretchy jeans].<p>Wool and fleece are going to make you feel more comfortably warm than most other garments, the fleece because of all the trapped warm air. But wool specifically <i>generates heat</i> when it&#x27;s moist, even though it sheds water when wet. Wool is fucking fantastic, though I think mostly as a base or mid layer, as wind tends to cut through a lot of wool-knit fabrics. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;weatherwool.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;the-science-of-wool&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;weatherwool.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;the-science-of-wool&#x2F;</a>')
