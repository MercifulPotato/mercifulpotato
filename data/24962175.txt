Reached herd immunity already due to wide spread infections or pre-existing cross immunity(possibly regional exposure to a related corona virus)<p>2. Living on borrowed time<p>Something doesn&#x27;t add up.<p>I think you all may be patting yourselves on the back too soon.<p>Or the population actually has herd immunity already due to having been exposed to similar viruses.<p>That would explain why a lot of Asian countries in China&#x27;s orbit are reaching minimal infections sooner. They may have had Corona or something similar for years.')
