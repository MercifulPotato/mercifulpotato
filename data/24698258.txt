And yet, without him, electric cars would still be in their infancy and rockets would not be landing themselves. These technologies do not develop themselves and market niches do not magically get filled. Many things happen in the world because a single wealthy person wants them to happen. My recommendation is not put too much stock in the future promises, but don&#x27;t diminish the actual accomplishments, which are impressive by themselves. I think there are personal lessons to be gained too, about the power of picking a stretch goal that you know is within your means to achieve, then dedicating yourself to achieving it. Being an egomaniac is no requirement and probably holds him back. We may not be working on the billionaire problem space, but our own goals can be equally lofty.')
