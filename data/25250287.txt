When the language is terse enough it helps you visualize and work with the language as a tool of thought--Matlab attempts to map actual mathematics to ASCII which is not that successful for me at least, since it meets a middle ground where it&#x27;s too difficult for me to think quickly purely in Matlab and it&#x27;s too high level for it to be useful as a practical language.<p>Engineers love it for prototyping, though, so maybe I just haven&#x27;t worked with Matlab enough.')
