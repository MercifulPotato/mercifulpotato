This is a more parsimonious definition because if it&#x27;s going to halt we don&#x27;t really care what it does immediately before.<p>I guess the real lesson here is that it&#x27;s pointless to quibble about this because the number turns on arbitrary features of your definitions.  (Also, if you think Scott Aaronson has made a mistake, even a trivial one, you are almost certainly wrong :-)')
