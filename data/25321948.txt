Do you want to start by banning all alcohol consumption, ban unprotected sex, or by making private vehicle ownership illegal?  Banning abortion saves lives too. Also motorcycles.&quot;</i><p>Except for banning abortion, none of those things has a chance of actually being made illegal any time soon, so no use talking about any of them.  And I don&#x27;t think getting in to an argument about abortion in this thread would be productive.<p>Let&#x27;s see what else you&#x27;ve got...<p><i>&quot;We should just open them then if nobody is going to go to them. In one breath you say we need to restrict them and in the other breath you say nobody will go.&quot;</i><p>Except some highly inconsiderate, ignorant, and&#x2F;or stupid people are still going.  It&#x27;s those we have to worry about.  So I&#x27;d vote to keep them closed.<p><i>&quot;Another amazing feat of physics - like masks. When Covid cases go up it&#x27;s because people aren&#x27;t wearing masks. When the CDC and other international organizations record near-zero flu deaths for the year 2020 it&#x27;s due to mask usage.&quot;</i><p>You know, it could be both?  Because the flu might not be as contagious, and there are other measures being used as well, like increased hand washing, which might be more effective for preventing the flu than preventing COVID-19.  And even if all the measures are equally effective, there just might not be as much flu going around this year.  Anyway, the fact that flu deaths are also going down, probably due to some of the lockdown, mask, and distancing measures is is even more reason to continue them.')
