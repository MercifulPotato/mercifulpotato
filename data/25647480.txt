The worst case scenario of a hastily approved vaccine is so high that it probably makes sense to bear the cost and take the health&#x2F;economic hit.<p>Also this is the first major use of mRNA vaccine, scientists and experts were not sure how well it would work. Administering it without trials could have led to a nightmare scenario for a few individuals and anti-vaccine stance for a larger chunk of population.<p>Ben is probably right, the status quo should change, but I am not sure if the &#x27;opportunity cost&#x27; calculus he makes is accurate in this case.')
