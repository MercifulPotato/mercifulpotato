It should cause you to leave relationships. It should cause you to reestablish boundaries with family members and with colleagues. It should cause you to quit your job. . . . If it doesn’t do that, it’s not real examination. If it doesn’t come attached with destruction of your current life, then you can’t create the new life in which you will not have the anxiety.<p>This is hilarious and feels like something out of the tvshow silicon valley.<p>I guess throwing everything away, literally everything, your job, support networks is incredible easy when you&#x27;re loaded from a decade of cheap easy VC money.<p>These people live on a different planet and should be mocked relentlessly, it&#x27;s a real life comedy.
