Here&#x27;s a little bit of details and background to the tool.<p>I have a decade-long background working as a marketing&#x2F;tech consultant. I&#x27;ve used a similar approach in my projects to save time and remove uncertainty when choosing the content for eg. marketing campaigns or product launches. I have learned how to create tools like this first for myself, but I&#x27;ve also implemented similar tools for companies so that their content and marketing team can perform more effectively.<p>I&#x27;m not a data scientist and this tool is a result of learning from smart people and experimenting with different machine learning and NLP solutions. It uses a combination of feed-forward neural network and bag-of-words analysis to conduct the predictions. In my tests it was able to predict correctly 60%-70% oft times which variation got more points in Hacker News or upvotes in Product Hunt (when using texts that resemble the platform&#x27;s style). It uses data from Hacker News API and Product Hunt API for training the prediction models.<p>The open-source technologies I&#x27;ve used are:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;andreekeberg&#x2F;ml-classify-text-js" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;andreekeberg&#x2F;ml-classify-text-js</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brain.js.org&#x2F;#&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brain.js.org&#x2F;#&#x2F;</a><p>An example of the neural network&#x27;s client-side implementation is available in this Github repo (old layout).\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ihmissuti&#x2F;hacker-ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ihmissuti&#x2F;hacker-ai</a><p>All feedback, questions, or ideas I could make this tool better are highly welcome.')
