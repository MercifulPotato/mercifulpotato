Both feelings and thoughts go hand in hand. Chemical state in your body causes negative feelings and also negative thoughts. You could inject anyone with heroin and they would feel happy and have positive thoughts. Same you could inject anyone with something negative that causes feelings of horror and same with thoughts. Same with external situations causing certain chemical releases in your body, for instance you see someone attractive and then you feel aroused and think &quot;wow they are attractive&quot;.')
