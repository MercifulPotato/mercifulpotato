Item(by='tt433', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602949598, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24807503, text='I don&#x27;t remember the author but one historian of Germany (I think) used the phrase the &quot;historicizing gaze of the camera&quot; to describe how shooting footage of an event freezes that singular, imperfect perspective in amber. When that recording is all that survives of the event in the historical record, it becomes the single &quot;true&quot; way that event unfolded. At the time of film&#x27;s invention, this was very remarkable, although we may take it for granted now. (It cannot be a perfect representation of the event, of course, such a film is impossible unless the event is watching paint dry, and even then the whole wall better fit in the camera&#x27;s view)')
