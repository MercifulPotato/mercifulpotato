Halderman himself confirmed it.<p>do you have a link for this?<p>&gt; You&#x27;re not arguing in good faith.<p>And then you say this:<p>&gt; You think a software vulnerability can conjure pieces of paper out of thin air? Now you&#x27;ve lost me entirely.<p>After I said this:<p>&gt; There are documents on the web, which appear to be sworn affidavits from people who claim to have been election observers that contain allegations that there were many improprieties including boxes of ballots with no chain of custody.<p>Perhaps I was unclear. People who observed the election claim that boxes of ballots were added. Perhaps you disbelieve them. Thats fine, but it strains credulity that you can&#x27;t imagine how someone would subvert a ballot-counting process by adding massive amounts of illegal ballots to the count.<p>&gt; Seems like Occam is rolling in his grave here. Isn&#x27;t the more obvious interpretation just that your candidate... lost the election?<p>he&#x27;s not my candidate, thank you. Ask Occam how likely it is that people might attempt to cheat in an adversarial process with high stakes outcomes and poor process controls.')
