But wouldn&#x27;t a language with static types and a repl not be as powerful as if it was dynamic instead? In the end, you want to be able to redefine everything via the repl in your runtime, and if there is types to be checked all the time and the compiler has to do extra steps for each eval, it&#x27;ll get in your way and make it harder to monkey-patch things.')
