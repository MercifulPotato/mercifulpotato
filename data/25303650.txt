Just dont set it up. I also dont bring a laptop home. Don&#x27;t enable yourself. And if you must, use their laptop or phone and simply turn it off at the end of work day. Have solid boundaries on this, if your boss complains talk to HR or get a new job. This is not unreasonable and they know it.')
