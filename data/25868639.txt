You as a user can run your own Elasticsearch software; I haven&#x27;t modified it and thus I don&#x27;t need to publish anything specific.<p>I as a user can no longer fix bugs in the Elasticsearch that I&#x27;m using. So I don&#x27;t have the four freedoms that copyleft is all about protecting.<p>&gt; What the SSPL says is I must publicize my entire SAAS product - but the user isn&#x27;t paying me to run their own Elasticsearch SAAS product, they&#x27;re paying me to run Elasticsearch.<p>That&#x27;s like &quot;I&#x27;m not blocking you from going into the building, I&#x27;m just blocking you from going through the gate outside&quot;. The point of copyleft licenses is that you need to give the user everything they need to run (or hire someone else to run) the same software (or their patched version of it) the same way.')
