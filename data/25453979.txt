The Index might be better, but it costs 2-3x more, and only works on PC, and needs the lighthouses.<p>The hassle you skip with inside-out tracking is worth it on it&#x27;s own, and the Quest games are honestly pretty good, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with Link to PC. Great for PC VR, great for taking with you to family&#x2F;friends for fun demos (post-covid).<p>I strongly dislike the forced Facebook integration, but it&#x27;s hard to contest that Oculus Quest (and likely 2) is a fantastic product.')
