For example, they&#x27;ve just added a restore command which should make it simpler to undo changes (git restore filename):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;en&#x2F;v2&#x2F;Git-Basics-Undoing-Things" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;en&#x2F;v2&#x2F;Git-Basics-Undoing-Things</a><p>Things I&#x27;d also like to see improved:<p>Undoing things locally should be very simple and intuitive - perhaps restore will help.<p>Conflict resolution when changes happen on the same line, so that there are fewer clashes on rebase&#x2F;merge.<p>Git log should be compact and pretty by default<p>Git push should push tags as well by default<p>Deleting tags etc on a remote has a really weird syntax - git push origin :tagname git push --delete origin tagname just feels really odd instead of using the tag command.<p>There should be a simple way to add all changes and commit - e.g. git add --all &amp;&amp; git commit -m &quot;Message&quot; if that could be git commit &quot;Message&quot; that&#x27;d be great (probably not possible but at least a flag on commit would be nice). I have an alias set up for this. I like being able to add files separately to a list then commit too, but that is far rarer, most of the time I want to commit all changes.<p>A blessed workflow - perhaps this isn&#x27;t possible but having one workflow would make it simpler to move between repos and simpler. Many projects seem to have settled on main=production with short-lived feature branches rebased off main and edit as necessary locally before sharing on main. This works well for us at my workplace.<p>git start - a guided tour command which steps a user through a typical workflow and shows them the commands they need (probably about 5 commands initially), and tells them the difference between local and shared commits (fine to change vs never try to change).<p>These are pretty minor gripes though most of which can just be fixed with some aliases for commands - I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and much prefer it to what came before.')
