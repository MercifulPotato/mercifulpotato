Don&#x27;t they have enough better-quality content that they don&#x27;t particularly need Quibi&#x27;s library? If Quibi themselves couldn&#x27;t profit from these 10-minute episodes after spending $2 billion to make them, why do the people at Roku think they&#x27;ll recoup their $100 million? Is there a tax angle we&#x27;re not seeing?')
