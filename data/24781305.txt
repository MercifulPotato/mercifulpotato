It does everything I need:<p>- cross-fading between songs<p>- a real queue that is separate from the playlist so you can program what plays next and in which order easily (CTRL+D to add &#x2F; remove, and a advanced window can show the queue)<p>- a remote control with an Android app<p>- stop after this song<p>- a giant search &#x2F; filter bar. It does not has to have the focus to start searching, just type when Clementine is the active window<p>- MPRIS integration (obviously)<p>- several playlists open at the same time<p>- the mood bar<p>It also has:<p>- tag editing<p>- integration with many online services<p>- a library handling that does not get in the way but full-featured anyway<p>- support for removable media<p>It&#x27;s awesome. It could use some pretty some improvement for its look, but it is pretty decent and does the job.<p>It&#x27;s a fork and a continuation of Amarok 1.4.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clementine-player.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clementine-player.org&#x2F;</a>')
