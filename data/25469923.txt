But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the only one.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of ways to make money around free software.<p>But pretending that you can maintain the price of the software itself after you&#x27;ve given every buyer the right to sell or give it away for free is silly. It&#x27;s not silly to give it away. It&#x27;s not silly to sell it once and accept that it&#x27;s not free. But it IS silly to pretend that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re doing.')
