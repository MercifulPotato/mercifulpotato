In facebook case - it basically killed most of internet forums as people switched to facebook groups. My experience is with car restoration&#x2F;old car aficionados forums that were replaced by fb groups, but I&#x27;m sure it also aplies to other. \nSo now you cannot find anything as they are not indexed by google, facebook search just sucks and if you set up you own forum then people just don&#x27;t use it as it&#x27;s &quot;to much hassle&quot; to open one more tab. And if you&#x27;re in market for some exotic part fb is your only choice nowdays.\nSecond thing, I don&#x27;t remember where (maybe here?) I&#x27;ve read article how guy missed his childhood friend&#x27;s funeral, because he has no faceboook account, and it was the only way that family informed his friends - by posting on fb that he died.')
