All of those have been leaked and are present on things you present to identify yourself or pay. Also requiring a credit card or home to vote would almost certainly be unconstitutional.<p>Getting a &quot;receipt&quot; is also problematic: You should never be able to prove you voted A over B or vice versa since that opens up ways to intimidate people to vote one way and coerce them to prove it.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible but there are so many problems with electronic voting that I don&#x27;t even know where to start. At least with physical ballots we can manually recount if we need.<p>And that&#x27;s before we even start talking about how current systems are basically swiss cheese for hacks, just look at the voting village for the last couple of defcons.<p>Related (and amusing) links:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LkH2r-sNjQs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LkH2r-sNjQs</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2030&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2030&#x2F;</a>')
