These 3 things are separate tasks.<p>For the first frankly it&#x27;s the documentation + stackoverflow, the second is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phptherightway.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phptherightway.com&#x2F;</a> , the third is the documentation of whatever framework you are using. Final step is to learn how to use whatever server that will front your PHP app, Apache or Nginx.')
