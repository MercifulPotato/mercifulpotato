It&#x27;s actually corporate that pushes the latter through the way they add those ways of expression to their products.<p>I&#x27;m not saying everything has to be boring and same everywhere, I&#x27;d like to see the world that&#x27;s actually quite the opposite, that&#x27;s diverse and where people are pushing the boundaries of expression. Where I see infantilisation happening is where things with very low information ratio (and usually something evoking one of the basic emotions with high valence and high arousal) are described as fun and cool.<p>I think OP&#x27;s product is sitting somewhere on that border, but their marketing angle is definitely pushing it towards the infantility. Just look at the title of this very post, but I guess it worked, in the end we&#x27;ve all clicked on the comments and are here.. :)')
