I do have very high performing teams, though, and I&#x27;m sure that plays a role.<p>I think one &quot;secret&quot; is that we have small-ish teams (3-5 engineers), each with a very engaged and technically savvy leader. I&#x27;ve known other managers to have up to 20 IC reports. I can see that kind of structure falling apart when remote in such a way that your underperformers start completely slacking off and you&#x27;re too busy to even notice. It&#x27;s way harder for that to happen in smaller teams where your team lead&#x2F;manager is very engaged in the team&#x27;s work and your relative output is quite visible.')
