Item(by='baud147258', descendants=None, kids=[25743459], score=None, time=1610391896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25731639, text='I don&#x27;t use the Steam 2FA app and when I sell Steam trading card, there&#x27;s a banner saying &#x27;you haven&#x27;t used our 2FA, market listing will be held for 7 days&#x27;. But then usually the cards I list are sold the same day, I don&#x27;t really understand why; perhaps because (on the Steam client), I rarely have to log in?')
