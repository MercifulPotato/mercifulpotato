Not even a little bit.<p>In fact it says &quot;it shall be as <i>easy</i> to withdraw as to give consent&quot;.<p>So you shouldn&#x27;t attribute complexity to the EU law, when the law actually insists on simplicity.<p>It&#x27;s a myth that the GDPR requires complex forms, or even just banners.  One that website operators (mainly 3rd party advertisers and trackers who provide the banners&#x2F;popups to sites) would like you to believe.<p>A genuine GDPR-compliant banner&#x2F;popup is much simpler.<p>In fact you can make a GDPR-compliant site without any banner&#x2F;popup&#x2F;form at all, while still using cookies, logins, shopping carts and analytics etc.  You just need to do it in a privacy-respecting way, which isn&#x27;t hard.<p>The complexity is website operators attempt to half-comply and half-violate the law, frustrate and arm-twist users into something most people would not agree to if it was easy to decline.  The obnoxious complexity is <i>deliberate</i>, to annoy and frustrate you so that you give in to the &quot;easy&quot; option they very much want you to &quot;choose&quot;.')
