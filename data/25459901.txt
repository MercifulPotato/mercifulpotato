I&#x27;ve noticed that there is a big difference in interviews with people who have been laid off versus those who are searching while having a job - and that difference is confidence. People who have been laid off talk at me so much more than other candidates. They spend precious minutes of a phone screen trying to explain away why they got laid off or giving me a laundry list of achievements. Sometimes I don’t get to ask my full screening list of questions because they have spent so much time trying to explain every single project they’ve ever done.   As a hiring manager, I get that these are tough times and lots of companies are laying off. I do not think it is your fault or that you are unqualified. I would not have taken the phone screen if I did not like your resume! Don’t hide the fact that you got laid off, but it’s much better to note it ‘Yea the company hit hard times and laid off a bunch of the workforce, but I’m really excited to talk about how your company is tackling XYZ.’ Then move us to a conversation about how we could work together. Paint a picture of how you could fit in at the company. Ask about what the challenges are that we have right now, then help paint a picture of how you could help solve them if you joined. The candidates who already have jobs tend to seem more self-assured and spend more time asking me questions or engaging me in conversation - and that is very appealing!<p>I know this may not be very helpful advice because I get that you need a job yesterday. It can be very hard to relax and be your best self in those situations, but if you can slow down a little and put yourself in the mind-frame of &quot;hey they would be lucky to have me and need to sell me on their company&quot; it will help you to come off as a better and more desirable candidate.')
