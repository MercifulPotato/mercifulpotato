Sure, we&#x27;ve got SATs and standardized tests but schools also have jazz bands, rock ensembles, student written plays and musicals.<p>Hell my failing public high school had plenty of room for self-expression, it wasn&#x27;t the sort of conformist prison PG thinks to seem schools are, it just wasn&#x27;t a very good school. No one was going to punish you for writing an essay or starting a club or anything else.<p>My university, one likely to be accused of &#x27;credentialism&#x27; also had the gamut of clubs: campus crusade for christ down to groups for divesting from Israel to Zionist groups, to LGBT groups, etc, etc, etc.<p>Its just bullshit.')
