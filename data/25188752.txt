Believe nothing short of an independent third-party audit from an auditor who doesn&#x27;t walk out half way through like the last one did.<p>The reason I say this should be pretty obvious to anyone whose familiar with the inner working of a Ponzi scheme or other similar investment scam.<p>Bitfinex and Tether wanted to legitimize the use of Tethers, so they found one guy, Matuszewski, they knew was in a position to help them do so. They actually set aside a relatively tiny slice of capital (a few million out of 3 billion) and treated him the way they should be treating all customers but weren&#x27;t. Then they let him loose on the talk circuits to tell the world of the sheer upstanding nature and legitimacy of Tether.<p>This is exactly the kind of stuff Madoff did.<p>Audit, or gtfo. (To Tether, Inc. not you of course)')
