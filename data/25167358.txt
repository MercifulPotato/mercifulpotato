The ARM Surface costs $1500, _without a keyboard_, and it&#x27;s worse than the Intel ones by most metrics. The ARM Macs start at $999 (ignoring the Mini, which has always been a niche product) and come with a keyboard, and they&#x27;re faster any laptops Apple has released previously, and besides that replace existing popular models. The ARM Macs will shift _far_ more units, probably well over 10x (I don&#x27;t think MS breaks out figures by unit, but the sales for the whole Surface line are not inspiring).<p>And besides that, your question gives another clue. Microsoft has actually had two lines of ARM Surfaces; the WinRT-ish ones, and the current ones. With about a five year gap between them. Why bother adding support for something that Microsoft will, based on past performance, probably just kill anyway? Very few shiny new platforms that MS introduces with great fanfare actually survive; see the various incompatible Windows Mobiles, the watch thing, and so on.')
