You can set up a plant with almost no capital, be able to retool at a moment&#x27;s notice to a customer&#x27;s whim, and add and drop employees to production at the drop of a hat.<p>Meanwhile, in the US, unless you are talking about very expensive CNC processes, batch production is not a thing. If you set up a production line, everything needs to be stable and long term. You need permits. You need employee contracts. You need to train people. You can&#x27;t handle a lot of turnover. You bring in robots, and that requires more specialization and training.<p>I firmly believe that things which increase fluidity in the labor market will be key to improving US manufacturing. Things like affordable healthcare and housing. Make it so that people can comfortably live in a gig economy.')
