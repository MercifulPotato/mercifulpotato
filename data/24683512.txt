I was thinking of a more suburban setting when I wrote the comment you&#x27;re responding to, but you do have a point (unless local zoning laws allow septic drainage fields to be used for other things, but that I know too little about). If you can&#x27;t build on top of drainage fields or dual-purpose them, then you&#x27;ll need to sacrifice some building space, which isn&#x27;t optimal from a make-the-most-of-a-land-parcel view.')
