That&#x27;s the easy part. Engineering is gathering requirements, designing the spec and ultimately coding it.<p>To be an engineer one must love to learn, learn fast and be able to learn on his own. It&#x27;s not a job where you can expect to get training, it&#x27;s a profession where you must be able to do some of the growing by yourself. It&#x27;s a constant stream of new tech and new business domain knowledge. Here reading skills are absolutely required: a lot of questions can simply be answered by the relevant man page or by finding a reliable source for whatever knowledge is required for the task. You&#x27;ll effectively have to become a domain expert several times in a career.<p>Systematic thinking and pattern recognition are essential skills to have. Our industry creates buzzwords every month and new fads in programming languages and frameworks but most core concepts remain unchanged since their inception.<p>Logic is absolutely required, and the ability to use the scientific method. This is crucial when debugging where you&#x27;ll have to observe a problem, collect data on state, formulate an hypothesis on what caused the invalid state and verify your hypothesis. There&#x27;s no &quot;big picture&quot; here, and every detail matters when doing this so in practice an engineers will often have to be able to keep the whole state of the system in his mind and step through it.<p>Communication skills are great to have; they effectively allow you to delegate and help colleagues onboard to whatever you are working on faster. From an outside point of view it&#x27;s effectively super-powers, and if you want to play the politics game, allows you to get the best engineers to want to work with you.')
