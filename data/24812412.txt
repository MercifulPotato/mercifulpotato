This is a block storage failure on Rackspace. EBS volumes on Amazon fail all the time, as anyone who manages a large number of instances probably knows (0.1%-0.2% per year for normal volumes):<p>&gt; Amazon EBS offers a higher durability volume (io2), that is designed to provide 99.999% durability with an annual failure rate (AFR) of 0.001%, where failure refers to a complete or partial loss of the volume. For example, if you have 100,000 EBS io2 volumes running for 1 year, you should expect only one io2 volume to experience a failure. This makes io2 ideal for business-critical applications such as SAP HANA, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server and IBM DB2 that will benefit from higher uptime. io2 volumes are 2000 times more reliable than typical commodity disk drives, which fail with an AFR of around 2%. All other Amazon EBS volumes are designed to provided 99.8%-99.9% durability with an AFR of between 0.1% - 0.2%,<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;ebs&#x2F;features&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;ebs&#x2F;features&#x2F;</a>')
