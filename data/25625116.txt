Can someone check my understanding?<p>The F35 has the same or even better air superiority capabilities than the F22.<p>It will have electronic command and control capabilities that will remove the need for AWACS or JSTARS. The vision is that the F35 will defeat any enemy aircraft, enemy air defenses, and provide the sensor coverage that will enable fleets of drones to operate.<p>(The videos I saw had to do with the cockpit main display panel. I was very impressed by it. It really looked like a video game with its touch inputs and ability for the pilot to configure it any way he likes. I am also amazed at how minimalistic the cockpit is. Reminds me of the Tesla but with much more intuitive UI.)')
