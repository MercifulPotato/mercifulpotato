Item(by='scythe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610743468, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25794374, text='Python is extremely popular in <i>education</i> and I&#x27;m convinced this is a huge part of its overall popularity. In that, it displaced Java in a move wildly popular with students; the language designers practically targeted college classes. But professors are conservative and won&#x27;t usually change languages unless there is a compelling advantage.<p>So, you might think Lua can&#x27;t compete with Python in education. But we have an ace in the hole: concurrency. Lua can be a great sandbox for learning concurrent programming, with built-in coroutines and a reentrant interpreter on top of an extremely simple semantics and basic type system.<p>The problem is that nobody is going to want to use an ad hoc combination of Lua and some questionably maintained 3P libraries to teach a course. If Lua is to be useful for teaching parallel programming, it needs a built-in or at minimum endorsed solution for parallelism. Penlight, probably the most popular &quot;Lua batteries&quot; collection, includes almost everything <i>except</i> parallelism!<p>Another issue in education, though, is 1-based arrays. They&#x27;re a minor annoyance in practice, but learning to count from zero is important in many CS courses.')
