He&#x27;s been exposed as a kook - many have known for a long time but if he&#x27;s willing to do this for a now former president, imagine what he was willing to do when not many were paying attention and he was a prosecutor. If you got sent away for life and were prosecuted by Giuliani, you should almost get an automatic appeal.')
