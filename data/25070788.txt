Autonomous driving technology has proven to be a lot more difficult to bring to market than any of the major automakers seemed to have planned for.&quot;<p>I honestly don&#x27;t understand how this has proved to be &quot;a lot more difficult to bring to market than any of the major automakers...&quot; I&#x27;m not an expert, by any measure, but this seemed to be a nearly impossible thing to bring to market anytime soon. The technology seems impossibly hard, sure, but more importantly this is something that is new and looks super scary to most people. Every single time one of these things fail it&#x27;s going to make headlines, and that&#x27;s going to make it even scarier. I just can&#x27;t believe Honda (or anyone else) got this right so fast. Even if they&#x27;re like 95% of the way to having it perfect (or whatever the measure might be), that last 5% seems like it&#x27;s going to be REALLY hard to get right without some serious trouble and some bad PR.')
