The FitBit app is like someone said &quot;Let&#x27;s use a wonderful asynchronous architecture so we won&#x27;t block on retrieving data!&quot; and then completely ignored all the ways that might lead to terrible UX if implemented poorly.<p>My steps stick at 0, then suddenly are the total of the last 3 days&#x27; worth. I log food, and it re-populates the &quot;quantity&quot; field with the old value after I edit it, sometimes up to 8-10 times in a row. My sleep data takes a roulette-spin amount of time to go get processed in the cloud and redownloaded, and even once the main dashboard has the info, the &quot;Sleep&quot; detail page will refuse to admit that I slept last night for another 3d20 minutes.<p>It&#x27;s like someone connecting the pieces of a car with Slinkys instead of bolts because they&#x27;re more flexible. If I didn&#x27;t like the hardware so much I&#x27;d have switched ages ago.')
