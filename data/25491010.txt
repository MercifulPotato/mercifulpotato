I bring it up only because unlike most neuroimaging research, we are able to image children at all levels of disability (since we image them while asleep). We argue that the idea that there is early brain overgrowth in autism followed by a period of regression or normalization of brain volume  does not appear to be true, and the apparent differences in cross-sectional research are due to biases in most studies against including harder to image individuals with autism.
