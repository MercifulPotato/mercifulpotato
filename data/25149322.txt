It doesn&#x27;t include any of the application or options interfaces: menu bar, toolbar, tabs, settings, themes, etc. Your post makes it sound like Notepad++ is &quot;just&quot; a thin wrapper around Scintilla. But there is a lot more that goes into any text editor than just the bit that does the syntax highlighting.<p>However, not to detract from Scintilla. It&#x27;s a great project and has bindings in lots of languages[0]. I&#x27;ve used it to add editors to lots of bespoke editor GUI tools. Can highly recommend using Scintilla.<p>[0] the bindings might all be 3rd party, I don&#x27;t remember clearly (it&#x27;s been a while). Whatever the case, I was using it from .NET, myself. It was very easy to use.')
