Maybe this is the beginning of a new trend! The sentiment is at least echoed in the article:<p>&gt; <i>In the 2015 newswire, Green quoted Dawa Gyalje Sherpa: &quot;We are hoping as young climbers, to take climbing in Nepal to a new level. All of us have climbed much bigger mountains but always with foreign climbers. We want to show that we are not just porters on the mountain, climbing only for our livelihood, but we are interested in climbing because we enjoy it, too.... We are the young generation of Sherpa climbers but we are looking to the future of Nepal and Sherpas also.&quot;</i>')
