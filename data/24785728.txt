I was prescribed concerta for 8 years. It made me extremely anxious and nauseous, but they wouldn&#x27;t listen to my pleas to stop. I ate about half of what the average kid ate at those ages, and my growth halted. I quickly fell into the very lowest percentile for growth. One day I skipped the meds and over-sprung-back from my usual meek self, was actually a distraction, and got myself a mild talking to that I actually deserved.<p>Now that I&#x27;ve graduated, I feel pretty worthless because I&#x27;m so underdeveloped and look so below my age, nobody would ever promote me to a position of responsibility.<p>Now for the really scary part: this is happening to apparently 15% of boys in school, despite the highest estimates from the APA being that, at maximum, 5% of children have ADD.<p>We&#x27;re creating multiple generations of an extremely high proportion of men who were physically and mentally stunted in growth during their most crucial formative years. It&#x27;s like all these parents who decided they didn&#x27;t really want to try very hard with their kids and would medicate them into mediocrity and meekness.')
