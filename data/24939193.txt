I would consider it taking God&#x27;s mercy for granted and treating him like a mechanical forgiveness dispenser.<p>I&#x27;m hesitant to say it&#x27;s always a mortal sin, because it seems like it can happen in a lighthearted manner. For example if someone struggles with gluttony, that person might think &quot;I know I shouldn&#x27;t have a 2nd hamburger, but I&#x27;m weak and it would taste so good, I&#x27;ll have it now and go to confession later&quot;. That doesn&#x27;t seem like mortal sin territory to me.')
