If you look closely, it is unclear whether WSB is actually what drives a pump. Quite often, something happens, a stock gains insane valuations and WSB finds it after the fact and spins some narrative or tries to profit even more.<p>The SPY puts weren&#x27;t at the beginning of 2020. I was actually one who took a huge profit from being early with SPY and DAX puts, but I also lost some money later on when SPY puts were still the rage.<p>The fascinating part is that you don&#x27;t really know if WSB is actually the pumper. With smaller caps, that might be true to some extend. They banned mentioning of small caps with less than 1 billion in market capitalization a while ago for this reason.<p>WSB pumps and dumps: SPCE, LL<p>Certainly not: MSFT, SPY drop in Feb&#x2F;March 2020, TSLA, AAPL<p>Probably not: HTZ<p>Unclear about the extend: GME, BB, PLTR<p>So, is WSB a driver of stock prices or is someone else driving the prices and blaming it on the &quot;retards&quot; on WSB? This happened in July&#x2F;August 2020 with tech and one culprit was Softbank.')
