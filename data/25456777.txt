I started with Processing back in the early 2000s, but I have since moved on to Extempore [1], and more recently, Nannou [2].<p>I like Lisps, and Extempore has two languages: Xtlang a low-level language, and a scheme for higher-level programming. You run the compiler as a service (CAAS) and you livecode and hotload your changes. You can program music&#x2F;sounds at the note or DSP level.<p>I started learning Rust and stopped. Then I started playing with Nannou, and I am making good progress and having fun. The compile times can some times interrupt creative flow, but it is getting better. Extempore is great at hotloading changes.<p>Some more esoteric but fun experiments are ok&#x2F;ike [3,4] by John Earnest. They are based on the k programming language. I personally use APL&#x2F;J, but John has really done a great job here for creative coding and array languages.<p>Looking at these examples, I guess I am jaded by these types of experiments except the last one (neural network imagery from left screen objects). I saw many interactive things done in the last 15 years with interactive &quot;pets&quot;, &quot;creatures&quot;, etc. to the point where you had them at malls all over (kids stepping on floor-projected fish to scare them). We had a wall of flipdots or sequins at my last job in 2012 that used Kinects to track people and then silhouetted them in black and white as they moved. The combination of the mechanical dots flipping, and the black-and-white moving image was cool. I forget the company that made it. Not to say it is not entertaining, art, or creative coding, but I find myself looking at a piece and thinking is it strong on art, weak on tech, vice versa, or somewhere in the middle. For me, I like when it is very thought provoking and uses either newish tech or existing tech in a novel, unexpected way.<p>[1]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;extemporelang.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;extemporelang.github.io&#x2F;</a><p>[2]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nannou.cc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nannou.cc&#x2F;</a><p>[3]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JohnEarnest&#x2F;ok" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JohnEarnest&#x2F;ok</a>\n[4]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JohnEarnest&#x2F;ok&#x2F;tree&#x2F;gh-pages&#x2F;ike" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JohnEarnest&#x2F;ok&#x2F;tree&#x2F;gh-pages&#x2F;ike</a>')
