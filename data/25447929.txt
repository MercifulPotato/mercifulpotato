It&#x27;s more along the lines of, &quot;based off my understanding of X, I can assume this bit of JavaScript code works like this under the hood&quot;. Understanding how memory works traditionally keeps me &quot;memory-conscience&quot;, but this may be redundant when working with JavaScript. When writing complicated operations I can use things I&#x27;ve learned previously to improve efficiency. To put it nicely, I&#x27;m not balancing binary trees and sorting my arrays with JavaScript. However, it was helpful when learning how the VDom works.<p>In other industries...<p>I started my Software Development journey with C, then moved into Game Development in C++ as my first job. Game Development DEFINITELY requires a lot of CompSci info (that I lacked). Hash Maps, Pathfinding, Matrix math, physics calculations, Linked Lists; all the works. We were also using a proprietary Game Engine so maybe with other Engines CompSci isn&#x27;t as needed, I haven&#x27;t worked in different engines.')
