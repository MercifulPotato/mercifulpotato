Thymeleaf, iirc, is one way binding.  Don&#x27;t know anything about Jackson, so I can&#x27;t really say.<p>When properties are implemented in the language proper then wiring everything together is much cleaner: find references, etc, all &quot;just work&quot;.  If not, there is a distinction between the template language and the host language that has to be addressed with tooling, or (usually) ignored.')
