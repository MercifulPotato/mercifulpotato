For example, if I share something with my family, there should be a law that prevents a family member from making what I said public.<p>Not only would this be a nightmare to police but it would give rise to some anti-social outcomes. If I was flat out telling my family I didn&#x27;t like race X and wished that religion Y could be outlawed, and then shared in the public realm that racists are terrible and that freedom of religion for all is paramount...shouldn&#x27;t someone be able to call me out on it? And if not me, imagine a person of some power or influence: don&#x27;t we want to know when someone&#x27;s public political stance is different to how they really feel?')
