Until Valetudo came along I was stuck with that janky horrible solution. Now I have arguably a better interface than the official app. It&#x27;s come a long way since the early days it&#x27;s really easy and convenient to hook the vacuum up to Home Assistant.<p>It&#x27;s actually one of the reasons I was recommending Xiaomi vacuum cleaners to friends and family. Unfortunately they have recently changed the firmware password making it impossible to root without using a direct serial connection. I really wish companies would embrace hardware tinkerers, I&#x27;m actually proud of a bloody vacuum because of all the effort I put in to make it do things.<p>Mad props to Hypfer for starting and building something so awesomely cool and useful')
