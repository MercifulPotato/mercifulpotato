Any time those phrases rear their heads they seem to ignite a bunch of defensive hysterics.<p>Just like our enlightenment values such as liberty and reason, all progress on this issue certainly does depend on human conversation. However, I&#x27;m wary of tasking a single group of people to usher us into an enlightenment. I also think it&#x27;s all too convenient to go &quot;well, vegans should improve their marketing if they want me to change.&quot;<p>The thing is, we don&#x27;t need vegans to convince us. They didn&#x27;t invent animal ethics, they are merely the first practitioners. It wasn&#x27;t the first human to rethink the ethics of rape or slavery that convinced everyone else nor had to.<p>We humans came up with animal ethics, slavery ethics, women suffrage ethics, liberalism, and everything else from first principles.<p>A first principle of animal ethics isn&#x27;t vegan voodoo, it&#x27;s &quot;why should a sentient being be grown and killed for my pleasure?&quot; After all, we already hold that standard for other humans and, for most people, even our pets.
