Journey better than the destination', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I suck. I am learning an Indian bamboo wind instrument called Bansuri. I practiced for two hours today.<p>And I had this epiphany. Because I am actually somewhat drunk after the two hours of really slow progress.(I have small hands and I can’t reach the holes..I have never enjoyed washing dishes by hand in hot water as I did today..because it does help to stretch the fingers!)<p>I realized that when I finally perfect technique, it’s going to be really boring. I am not going to enjoy #winning like when I am a struggling student vs when i attain musical perfection.<p>Any musicians here who can relate and tell their stories have my gratitude because I am literally in a state of drunken elation when a small voice is asking me why I am happy when I am struggling. Cheers! What is this strange power that music has over us?')
