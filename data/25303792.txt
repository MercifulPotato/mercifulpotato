Does this allow the tasks to be scheduled deterministically? If I&#x27;m very careful and write the tasks such that they make blocking calls at specific locations, then yes. Otherwise, is there any feedback to inform me that tasks are switching context at places I didn&#x27;t expect? Is it possible to define a custom scheduler that can simply print debug messages at every context switch?')
