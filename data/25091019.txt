I’ve built out a similar websockets on AWS setup at work to what they show at the end, and it’s definitely not as nice as this looks to work with. That was really just an MVP to push live results, I’d like to extend it to do logs&#x2F;progress eventually but I’ll definitely evaluate Durable Objects before adding anything to that solution because this looks way better and cleaner.<p>Is there any sort of run it locally for testing story yet? In theory paid localstack supports websocket API gateways on the AWS side, though I haven’t played with that yet either so not sure how good it is. Looking at the API being used and the fact it’s all dynamic JS land, it looks like maybe you could inject some implementations in to run the websockets and store some state locally?')
