There are a <i>lot</i> of objectivity-minded audiophiles who reject that snake oil stuff with a passion.<p>The fact is that basic audio reproduction -- which is essentially just signal reproduction -- is engineering, not art, and has been pretty much worked out for decades. We know what sounds good and we know how to make it happen. Long story short: reproducing the signal as accurately as possible, with a slight shift to emphasize bass frequencies (Google &quot;Harman Curve&quot;) is what sounds good. Floyd Toole and Sean Olive are names to research if you want to know more.<p>As an example of grass-roots efforts in support of objective audiophile-dom, one example would be this guy&#x27;s site, full of detailed measurements of various gear: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;audiosciencereview.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;audiosciencereview.com</a><p>The perception of audiophiles has become a bit wacky over the years. Essentially, in the 70s&#x2F;80s&#x2F;90s, the stereo magazines became dependent on advertising from snake oil purveyors, and therefore weren&#x27;t really free to decry that stuff. And then the media tends to focus on the really wacky fraud crap like CD demagnetizers and the like. That stuff exists, but that is the lunatic fringe and the rest of us laugh at it.')
