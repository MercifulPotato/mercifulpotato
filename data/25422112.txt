You can spend $1700 for a Mac Mini with 16 GB of RAM and a 2 TB SSD, but that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re stuck with. Forever. Until its time to buy a new computer.  People who bought into AMD&#x27;s AM4 platform at the start were able to go up from the 1000 series to the 3000 series, able to upgrade their RAM from nearly any size to 64 GB, and able to upgrade their SSDs by slotting in a new NVMe drive. To say nothing of the GPU, which for developers of specific solutions, is becoming a serious concern. Also if you game in your spare time, you&#x27;re at a disadvantage not just due to the Apple ecosystem, but also limited by the GPU.<p>For most of us, our machines are disposable. Even though I still build myself a new workstation every 2-3 years, I never bother selling it, I just give it away to family because for me its not worth the hassle, and then I order $3-4000 in parts and build a new one all over again. So buying the new Mac Mini made sense for me, although I opted to go with the base model for $699 so I could evaluate it and determine if going &quot;all-in&quot; for a higher-end model made sense (it does), but not for one second am I under the illusion that this chip is going to be the death of x86.')
