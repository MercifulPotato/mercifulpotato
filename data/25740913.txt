Hipchat was about making code, and Slack was a way to manage people. Reddit was for sharing alternative&#x2F;emerging culture.<p>Disagree. There were plenty of gaming chat tools. The first group I got into Discord with wasn&#x27;t playing games, the first group I got into Hipchat with wasn&#x27;t particularly code-oriented, the first group I got into Slack with wasn&#x27;t the kind of group that had management, and the first subreddits I got involved with were nothing to do with that kind of culture. Those tools succeeded not because they were doing something new but because they made something that didn&#x27;t suck. Sometimes that&#x27;s all it takes.<p>I remember talking with friends 2-3 years before Slack et al about how all the existing chat tools sucked and maybe we should build a better one. We concluded that there must be some fundamental reason why Skype etc. were so bad, something that we were missing. But we were wrong, and Slack proved that.<p>(This isn&#x27;t an argument that Facebook can be replaced the same way, because Facebook has a great UX. My point is just that you don&#x27;t always have to do something different. Sometimes &quot;x, but better&quot; is enough).')
