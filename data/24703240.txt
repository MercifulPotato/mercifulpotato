(CO2 can be used as a refrigerant, but requires instead conditions that pit a lot demand onto materials...).<p>And Walmart is going to require these to be super cost effective. MS and Google have lots of slack in their budgets, so if DC energy costs go up by 30%, no big deal. Walmart will be forcing the tech to be cheap, meaning that <i>everybody</i> can adopt it once Walmart does.<p>When Walmart it more ambitious than an entire political party  in the US, our politics are completely messed up. Walmart should not have to pull along the word, we should be pushing Walmart. It&#x27;s ridiculous.')
