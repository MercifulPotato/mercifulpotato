Then a gameloop, where you had one function for drawing and one function for handling clicks&#x2F;screen presses. So when you pressed &#x27;play&#x27; on studio, it opened an &#x27;empty game&#x27; on her own phone. All you had to do to make a game, was to edit 2 different functions and to make variables to pass info.<p>After that we started coding together and I no longer touched the keyboard. I just asked what she would like to do next, and gave advice how it could be done. She had patience for about 15 minutes at a time, and after of total maybe 2 hours, calendar time 4 weeks, we finished a &#x27;hit a mole&#x27; game. I was quite careful not to put any pressure like &#x27;lets do a bit more&#x27;. And asked maybe twice a week, &#x27;would you like to do some coding&#x27;.<p>After the project she said it was &#x27;not her thing&#x27;. This summer she was coding web-UI with Java+IntelliJ in my work as a summer trainee, and now she said she enjoyed it.')
