Item(by='alkonaut', descendants=None, kids=[25323608], score=None, time=1607264255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25320536, text='LinkedIn is fine provided you follow some very simple rules.<p>1) never use the social features like the timeline. Don’t post things, don’t comment on things. It’s just a bad Facebook for people with ties trying to become workfluencers. People who think that by promoting their employers blog post they’ll rise in the ranks (and they probably will but I don’t want any part of that charade).<p>2) Only <i>only</i> ever connect with people you work or worked with. Never recruiters. Recruiters want to build a huge network of random people, and it ruins the fundamental idea where I can see if I actually have someone with a work relationship at a company.<p>3) Don’t reply to messages from people not in your network. Either connect with them (if not recruiters) or ignore. Do <i>not</i> say “no thanks” or “not interested”.<p>4) Disable all mail notification. You likely get enough email.<p>Using it like this, I find it’s a pretty simple way to keep track of where my past colleagues are, without being spammed by recruiters or having to wade through message spam in LinkedIn. I check in a few times per year to see what old friends are up to.')
