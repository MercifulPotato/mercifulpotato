So, the short-reels produced by the government and distributed to movie houses during WW2 would have been a form of propaganda. The classic &#x27;Uncle Sam Wants YOU!&#x27; posters as well.<p>As for contemporary propaganda - right now, during COVID we are absolutely being subject to forms of propaganda particularly related to masks.<p>Do you remember at the start of the pandemic and they were saying <i>don&#x27;t</i> wear masks?<p>And now everyone is shaming those that don&#x27;t?<p>“There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.” - Dr. Fauci, March 8, 2020.<p>How on earth could we pull a &#x27;moral 180&#x27; on some behaviour so quickly without really any new information?<p>&quot;Why are you wearing that mask! Dr. Fauci said no!&quot; ----&gt; &quot;Why are you not wearing a mask, spreader! Dr. Fauci said we need to wear masks!&quot;<p>The line of reasoning was that masks were in deep shortage, and in the scenario it made more sense to get supplies to front line medical staff, and particularly to avoid people hoarding masks.<p><i>The effectiveness of masks was purposely downplayed to affect desired outcome of the population</i>.<p>You were lied to point blank, or rather, the information you were given was completely misrepresented, on purpose. Note that Dr. Fauci&#x27;s statement in March 2008 was not &#x27;a lie&#x27; - it was in fact factual, just misrepresentative, or rather, it was a specific articulation of facts with some kind of objective in mind.<p>Take a moment of self awareness to grasp this implications of this, and that it was probably rational and necessary.<p>This is the tip of the iceberg, and government officials are concerned with this issue of communications on a daily basis. &#x27;What you are being told&#x27; and how you are being &#x27;messaged&#x27; is very much controlled, it&#x27;s not just an information dump of transparency. What we want and need is for behaviour to adapt, not so much for people to be specifically informed, especially on issues that are not hugely practical like the details of r0. This is propaganda.<p>This is a pretty good example of what propaganda is because it demonstrates the moral ambiguity of &#x27;truth, communication and outcomes&#x27;.<p>FYI I should note, I&#x27;m not against masks or even the current public communications (i.e. propaganda) measures being used there, rather, just illustrating this is absolutely propaganda, i.e. &quot;information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.&quot;')
