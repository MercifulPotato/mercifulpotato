Investing in and contributing to Lucene is a core part of the Elasticsearch team. We contribute more to Lucene than any other organization, some of our employees are amongst the top committers, and several of our employees are members of the Lucene PMC. We give back to and [celebrate][0] Lucene openly. We love Lucene.<p>Disclaimer: I am an engineer on the Elasticsearch team; I welcome any and all feedback.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;celebrating-lucene" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;celebrating-lucene</a>')
