What happened was scientists found a new way to measure the effects of gravity that can substantially distinguish between different proposals to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics.<p>The article says it got &quot;harder&quot; because the theory of general relativity wins every measurement, and that means the search space for potential solutions is much smaller - you have more constraints that you need to fit.<p>But this is actually a good thing. Finding the right theory is like looking for a needle in a hay stack. These new measurements are the functional equivalent of removing a huge portion of the hay.<p>Yes, it means there are now fewer places to check, but that&#x27;s actually what we want. We&#x27;ll spend less time chasing dead ends because it&#x27;s easier for us to see they are dead ends sooner.')
