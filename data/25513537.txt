In my case it was caused by a combination of burnout, untreated mental illness, alcoholism and social isolation (each of which compounded the others). I’m not saying all or even any of those are contributing factors for you, but if you feel like they may be it’s definitely worth looking into.<p>For me, while I wouldn’t say I have the playfulness I did in my youth, it’s a lot closer to where I’d think it should be for my age and personality. Here are some of the things I did:<p>- accept that I had a drinking problem, detox and take a break, reintroduced with the awareness that I may have to remove it again[1]<p>- start therapy[2]<p>- get an ADHD diagnosis and start medication[3]<p>- make&#x2F;accept more social plans than I would normally feel comfortable with[4]<p>- get a new haircut, wardrobe, glasses[5]<p>- Got a puppy; no footnote here. Honestly this was the best thing that ever happened to me. We walk <i>a lot</i>, which is great for my energy. When I don’t feel like playing, I remember that she <i>needs</i> me to feel up to it. I can’t say whether this is analogous to having a human child. But I can say that having a smol furry who expects me to not just be active but at least kinda fun is very motivating for me.

But it’s a lot healthier than it was two years ago.<p>[2]: I firmly believe <i>everyone</i> would benefit from counseling. Life is hard, a more objective ear is invaluable.<p>[3]: This utterly changed my life, and I think it’s safe to say it saved my life too.<p>[4]: I’m still socially anxious and awkward but it made me a lot more comfortable. I even moved away to pursue a romantic relationship. That would have paralyzed me before. Obviously there’s a lot of social restrictions now, but I make due with phone and occasional distanced porch visits.<p>[5]: It turns out dressing semi-hobo doesn’t just look bad, it makes me feel bad. Nice looking, good fitting clothes and a clean haircut make me feel more comfortable in my own skin.')
