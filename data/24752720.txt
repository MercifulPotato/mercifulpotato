One from Craigslist and two from a liquidator. The liquidator ones had taken a bit of a beating. The craigslist one was great except for a couple inch diameter splotch of tinted image in one corner. I got rid of them during a move. Now that I know more about electronics repair I think they all could have been fixed. Doh.')
