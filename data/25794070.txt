Item(by='8ytecoder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610734610, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25787252, text='Milk in general is high calorie + high fat and a Starbucks Grande is 5 times the size of a typical coffee I was used to. Not to mention the fact that they charge a good chunk more for other low calorie non-dairy substitutes. A typical meal at an American restaurant is two meals - easily - and our portion sizes are not small by any means.<p>The sweetness is another major put off. There&#x27;s no concept of a savory snack here. There&#x27;s also no culture of an afternoon or tea time snacking. In my personal opinion, having a small post-lunch snack helps me stay satiated for longer and have a much smaller supper instead of a large dinner.')
