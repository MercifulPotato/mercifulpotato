On Christmas 2019, I recorded an album [1] of 9 &quot;Snake Jazz&quot; songs, each 30 seconds long, as a joke on a Rick and Morty episode. Published the album on CD Baby, and had them distribute it on all available platforms. Publishing cost me 80$.<p>Now, about a year later, I have earned 0.47$. 0.33$ of it come from Spotify, where I raked up a full 131 listens, averaging at 0.25 cents per listen. 0.25cents * 1e6 would amount to 2500$, which is admittedly still not much, but two orders of magnitude off from what is reported here.<p>That being said, I believe the main source of revenue for bands has been concerts in recent years (not 2020 though), with ever-increasing prices charged for live performances. I gladly accept that though - it is quite appealing to cut out the middle-man that were Music Studios up until the early 2000s.<p>With the barrier of entry to record an album ever-decreasing (using a Roland Octacapture, Reaper DAW, a Shure SM57 and lots of sweat you can get far), pretty much anyone can record an album in decent-ish quality in the comfort of their home, there is no more appeal to pay expensive studios to do a recording for you.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;music.youtube.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;MPREb_2nw3eEydV25" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;music.youtube.com&#x2F;browse&#x2F;MPREb_2nw3eEydV25</a>')
