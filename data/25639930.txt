What if you and your coworkers like your job but are getting slavedriven for 80 hours a week and that just doesn&#x27;t work out for you? Right now you have the following options: 1. Leave.<p>If you had a union you could: 1. Leave. 2. Decide to stop working along with other coworkers who are also pissed off until they agree to stop slavedriving you. 3. Decide to stop working along with other coworkers who are also pissed off until they agree to pay you more for being slavedriven.<p>I like the latter myself. Having people who care about an enterprise means you don&#x27;t end up getting run entirely by a bunch of MBAs who listen to complaints while watching a spreadsheet of average tenure.')
