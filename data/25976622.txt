So you set your EV to charge after midnight when demand is lowest.<p>This will actually help the grid because today power companies have to throttle up and down production to meet peak demand then overnight lull.  By charging EVs at night it will allow production to remain pretty consistent.<p>Another factor no one seems to get is that people aren&#x27;t going to charge nightly.  This is like making the argument that our gasoline grid isn&#x27;t capable of refueling every car simultaneously.')
