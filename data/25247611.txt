I suspect if I can get the time down to 75 ms with a frw minutes of fiddling, someone who actually cares to run this could spend a couple hours or days on it and get it down to 30ms, which should be tollerable. Reduce as much runtime startup as possible (probably allocator tuning), and then reduce or postpone as much OTP startup as possible.<p>Otherwise you have to deal with things like how do you kill one script without killing the others, version fun including what happens if you are running scripts and update the beam, how to keep scripts separated for reals, etc.')
