Insofar as they&#x27;re even in the same category, hot pockets are a pretty sad alternative.<p>My point was that their nutritional value rests on the same qualities as any other food. Overabundance or lack of certain nutrients. Say lack of fibre, or too much saturated fat.<p>Excepting certain unequivocally harmful ingredients like partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (which could just as easily be added to homemade meat pies in the form of shortening), I don&#x27;t think the number of ingredients or processing steps will materially affects the nutritional value of a food independent of its nutrient quantities.')
