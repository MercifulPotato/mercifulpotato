Can you please be more specific? I&#x27;m against any attempt at overturning elections, and I&#x27;m not aware of any such acts by any of the Democratic officials I voted for or follow closely. EDIT: hopefully you remember how quickly Clinton conceded, and how that still has not happened this year. There&#x27;s evil to see anywhere you look hard enough, but it&#x27;s a fairly simple task to weigh them.')
