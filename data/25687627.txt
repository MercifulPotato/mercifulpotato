Panasonic is the one that&#x27;s actually supplying the technology and building the Tesla&#x27;s battery factories. However, Panasonic&#x27;s market cap is less than 5% of Tesla&#x27;s, and batteries are not even its main business. It seems that the investors value Panasonic&#x27;s battery technology and expertise at something like 1% of Tesla&#x27;s market cap.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what exactly you mean by &quot;infrastructure put in place&quot;, but I can&#x27;t imagine running charge stations to be hugely profitable business: gas stations most certainly aren&#x27;t. They might still be pretty good business, but they clearly are not so good to account for hundreds of billions in valuation.')
