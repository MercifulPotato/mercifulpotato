Item(by='motohagiography', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608409175, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480047, text='While this idea is obviously an outrage and an abomination, it&#x27;s the result of another economic factor. Modern creditors take very little actual risk, and that asymmetry of risk creates a power dynamic that is itself a kind of tyranny by a protected class. Creditors can organize, conspire, conduct surveillance, slander, and do pretty much anything a state can do, and that&#x27;s a set of perverse incentives. Unsecured debt is servitude, and so is debt without an expiry. Some people may be fine with it, but very few who understand it are.<p>Creditors&#x27; low risk manifests as low interest rates, which everyone loves until they create bubbles and other forms of  hyperinflation, which burst, and the costs are socialized.<p>The IMF was a pernicious organization from its very beginnings, basically using &quot;cheap&quot; subsidized debt from central banks to subordinate developing economies to a neoliberal order and force social policies that enabled globalized businesses (resource extraction and financialization) to in-effect loot them. This used to be a major progressive cause, and one that I supported, but it too seems to have been co-opted by the same interests. Now anti-globalization is abandoned by progressives, who used  the activism as a stepping stone into institutional power, where now it&#x27;s no longer necessary to have the popular support of maker and builder classes. Trade tariffs and economic borders have been banished to the backwater of right-wing populist causes, where people still believe in unfashionable things like nations and the responsibility of government to secure a perimeter for growth.<p>This IMF scheme would seem like a troll, but it&#x27;s not. The people behind it have an institutional contempt for anyone outside their power games, and to them we&#x27;re basically livestock. The difference between the 1990&#x27;s and 2020&#x27;s is that leftist led populist revolts against this exact kind of IMF driven policy were largely performative, critical, and non-violent because they were carried out by feckless flower children, whereas in the 2020&#x27;s, I&#x27;d predict they will be carried out by men with little left to lose.<p>If that sounds scary, it should. These IMF people just don&#x27;t get it.')
