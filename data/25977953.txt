Sure, I have Netflix and use it, but during the past 20 years, over 50% of the tv&#x2F;film content I watch is foreign (I&#x27;m American). I keep lists from my favorite countries and ask foreigners what I should be watching. What would surprise me is finding Netflix-like services that curate the best [insert genre].<p>So far, I&#x27;ve come across MhZ Choice (for EU shows, with subtitles), FlixOl√© (for Spanishf films, no subtitles), Wlext (foreign tv shows...pirated). Also, I recommend using a VPN for Netflix to access different shows and films, depending on the country you choose. The other day I found myself watching a Chinese action film that only had Italian subtitles (luckily my Italian is up to scratch).<p>With music, my tastes are boarderless and timeless. At any moment, I&#x27;ll put on 13th century Iberian cantigas, Latin motets, folkloric Sardinian, 90&#x27;s French indie, 1970s Congolese rumba, modern Ivory Coast reggae, South African Xhosa pop, Indian mantras, Peruvian ethno-techno, and the list goes on.<p>But yes, the plethora of options is, at the same time, wonderful and dreadful. I tried to sit down and start reading a semi-dense physical book the other day and it&#x27;s like my mind was too fried to focus due to having just got off the internet.')
