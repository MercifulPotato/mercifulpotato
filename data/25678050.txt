I can&#x27;t see Apple practices being applicable to mission critical fields like transport engineering (with high regulatory burden). They&#x27;re different worlds. Apple also simply has a huge amount of money from hardware and software (App store etc.). I suspect they&#x27;re far looser with resources for their teams than Boeing, whose mechanical&#x2F;aerospace engineers have salaries a fraction of most Apple engineers.<p>Edit: Overarching point is that Apple has a focus on aesthetics that is far less important in aerospace engineering, and has no experience on ensuring human safety.')
