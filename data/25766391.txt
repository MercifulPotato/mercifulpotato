So it’s like pointing to Backbone as an “alternative” to a modern framework - not wrong, but it’s missing the point.<p>What I really wanted to say is that if you take more than 5 minutes to evaluate one of these, you might have a much better idea of it’s capabilities and maybe even learn something new.<p>It’s clear you’re excited about the subject and that’s great, but very little of what you said is true - for example, one of hyperapp’s main value propositions is the built-in centralized state management, so yes you’ll have to “wing” local state because that’s shoehorning a foreign concept into it. You are looking for something that fits your existing mental models, and not really judging their goals and strengths.')
