Avro is the longest supported serialisation format in Confluent Kafka, recently JSON and Protobuf were added. If you are on JVM stack, the drivers to work with schemas are well supported. We use Python, and Confluent driver is lagging behind if you want some advanced stuff like supporting Avro unions for multiple event types per topic approach [1] and missing auto-resolution for schemas for that scenario in Avro deserialiser. It is not difficult to implement by ourselves, but I would prefer not to do it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.confluent.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;multiple-event-types-in-the-same-kafka-topic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.confluent.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;multiple-event-types-in-the-sa...</a>')
