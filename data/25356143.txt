Once people in any culture have lots of disposable income they&#x27;ll do it. Here&#x27;s a video from a few days ago of shopping for traditional hand made jewlery in Kabul, Afghanistan. Language is Dari. Farsi&#x2F;Persian speakers should understand it OK.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7LelKUITywE&amp;feature=emb_title" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7LelKUITywE&amp;feature=emb_titl...</a><p>If there were a sufficiently large population of Afghans with a reliable, secure online payment method, and HSPA+&#x2F;HSDPA&#x2F;LTE data services on their android phones, I have no doubt that those products would show up on the Dari language version of Etsy.
