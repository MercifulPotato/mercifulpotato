Item(by='tatrajim', descendants=None, kids=[25709456], score=None, time=1610249503, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25706993, text='As someone who has lived in both fascist regimes (South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s) and Communist ones (off and on in China during that past two decades), I have witnessed close at hand supposedly private businesses eager to curry favor with the government by silencing their political opponents. Could it just be that the tech titans sense a means of fending off imminent antitrust action by the DoJ, through tacitly coordinated purges of conservative platforms? Surely not!<p>On a related note, as a longtime defender of free speech, I am nauseated at the visage of tech mavens here rhetorically frothing at the mouth to silence those with whom they disagree. This has been a slippery slope indeed, starting with Alex Jones and now extending to platforms used by 10s of millions of people, whose views are now deemed heretical.')
