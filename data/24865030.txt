I think the app does a great job for existing users in providing a 1yr automatic subscription (would have thought parent comment would get this) but I also am confused, and will be confused, when that time is up I think.<p>--<p>Halide is a incredible application. One of my favorites. I don&#x27;t use it as much as I could benefit from it because of the problem of it not having the same immediate access as the native camera app does, but also it does not include Live Photo capture which for me and moments with friends and family is essential. That said, it&#x27;s the best built app I have on my phone, the best design, provides path to incredible photography results, and I will continue to pay for it.')
