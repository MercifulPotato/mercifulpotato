I&#x27;m no expert on the Seth Rich insanity, but my understanding is that this account was basically just a scam artist or prankster.  It claimed some stuff, and then when the Fox reporter took the bait provided some fabricated documents.<p>This isn&#x27;t a criminal suit.  It&#x27;s a civil thing having to do with Fox&#x27;s behavior.  And their failure to validate their sources and documents isn&#x27;t really related to the original identity of those sources.  I mean, we don&#x27;t know who @whyspertech is, Fox certainly didn&#x27;t know who @whyspertech was.  No one knew.  So why is it relevant for us to know now to determine whether or not Fox was at fault?')
