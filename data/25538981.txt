It is really confusing -- there is no 7unzip command. A random third-party tool decompressed the archive incorrectly. The official p7zip package consists of three or more different command-line tools that are meant to handle any operation you could imagine, with different and weird options. Slogging through them takes quite a bit of manpage reading, and there are hidden gotchas. For example, the &quot;simple interface&quot;, p7zip, is optimized for .tar.7z files, and deletes the original archive when decompressing. It is supposed to only do it only if there&#x27;s one file in the archive, but it happened for me regardless.<p>The correct command is &#x27;7z x &lt;file&gt;&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s quite a contrast from the good experience I had with 7zip on Windows.')
