Going to start with what I think your central argument is at first.<p>&quot;why do I want people not to invest their money&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t - you absolutely don&#x27;t want someone to park their money in BTC and avoid spending it. It&#x27;s an economic inefficiency. It&#x27;s also the nature of people to hoard wealth - that&#x27;s why they buy land to &quot;sit on&quot; and why they buy gold. Both do not have the world OR wealth distribution. That&#x27;s also why in the US, we have a property tax - to keep the wealthy from hoarding all the land without generating a profit on it (assuming they aren&#x27;t living on the property.<p>Conclusion - we need, or at the very least have used stores of value throughout history that are not &quot;investments&quot; in the sense of efficient use of resources.<p>&quot;What are the benefits of BTC over existing stores of value?&quot; (&quot;USD&quot; in a bank account, USD (cash), gold, and property).<p>The ones I listed above - USD depreciates. It&#x27;s trite but it&#x27;s also true - you cannot hold USD without losing wealth. Gold has no intrinsic value, you have less control over the asset unless you store it in your basement (managed by third party), you cannot easily move it or transact in it.<p>Real estate is entirely too complicated for a non-professional to invest in. Same with land.<p>BTC does what cash was supposed to - you buy it, it sits there, it doesn&#x27;t depreciate.<p>Now, you will correctly say &quot;No, I buy BTC at $20,000 and tomorrow it&#x27;s $3,000&quot;. Completely correct and true, but the bet is that as it becomes more established it will become a more reliable store of value than a nationally backed currency, kind of like currency was when it was backed by the gold standard.<p>Hopefully that helps you understand my viewpoint without thinking I am trying to shove my opinion down your throat, as most crypto debates go that way, and it&#x27;s definitely not my intent. I don&#x27;t even hold crypto, nor do I necessarily think it&#x27;s &quot;changing the world&quot;.')
