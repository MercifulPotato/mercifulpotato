Please do me the courtesy of not treating me like a child and acting like you are instructing me.<p>The QAnon conspiracy is about pedophiles in government.  The Rotterham scandal is about pedophiles enabled by government.  The Epstein case is a mix of pedophiles and government.  It&#x27;s not crazy to suggest that pedophiles are mixed up with the government.  We have multiple contemporary cases of this happening now.<p>Furthermore, it is exactly the tendency to censor speech which enabled the Rotterham scandal to endure for so long.  Because people were censored for fear of causing offense hundreds of children were raped and victims were ignored.  That&#x27;s an extremely relevant example to a case where people are saying we must not permit people to talk about offensive things.')
