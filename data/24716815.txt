Item(by='brailsafe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602142552, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24714880, text='This is a very long thread, with a lot of interesting talk about taxes and disincentives for single-use plastics, so I thought I&#x27;d hoist this to top level. Canada (as well as I assume many other places) has a deposit system for the fancy milks you might buy, wherein the retailer will often list the milk without the $1 included, because it&#x27;s arguably analogous to borrowing a shopping cart (where you&#x27;d insert a coin and get it back when you&#x27;re done).<p>I was recently surprised to find a similar deposit on a single-use plastic bottle of water (1.5L, $2) of $0.25. I have no idea where I&#x27;d return the bottle to get that 25 cents back, but it was enough to get my attention, and though I use a re-usable coffee canister as much as feasible, I&#x27;ll probably try and find a solution for large quantities of water as well (beyond my 20oz canteen). I definitely find this less convenient during the pandemic, because coffee shops don&#x27;t fill directly into personal mugs anymore, and there aren&#x27;t that many public bottle filling stations around. In a counter intuitive move, many public water fountains have even been shut off for Covid.')
