They just get preloaded[0]. If google preloaded non-AMP sites (which is technically feasible, there has been browser extensions doing this since ages ago), they too would load &quot;faster&quot;, fancy that!<p>There&#x27;s no good part to AMP. It&#x27;s bullshit that doesn&#x27;t really work. Sure in absolute metrics, your website might be &quot;faster&quot; simply by following AMP&#x27;s rule, but it&#x27;ll still usually be way too slow without google&#x27;s cheats.<p>You know what works to make websites load faster? Not including megabytes of javascript, properly configuring your server to compress the data, keeping images at a reasonable resolution, and preferably under the fold.<p>The only thing AMP was ever good for is give Google a convenient excuse to seize control of content distribution, giving them even more insight on users&#x27; browsing habits and whatnot. And golly did it work.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ferdychristant.com&#x2F;amp-the-missing-controversy-3b424031047" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ferdychristant.com&#x2F;amp-the-missing-controversy-3b424...</a>')
