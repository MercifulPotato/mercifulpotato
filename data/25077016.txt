I find it fairly immoral to intentionally prohibit users who have bought your product from using it in ways you don&#x27;t like.  Courts also tend to look poorly on this, but there&#x27;s a narrow path to walk between enforcing interoperability and allowing innovation.<p>I guess I&#x27;d say the concepts &quot;sale&quot; and &quot;ownership&quot; are at stake here. If I buy something, I expect to be able to extend&#x2F;modify&#x2F;repair&#x2F;dismantle that device in any way I choose.  I <i>OWN</i> it.<p>In the physical world, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to put some sort of non-electronic lock on a device that would prevent the user from doing just that.  There&#x27;s no reasonable way to make a cup that could only hold Sprite.<p>So that status quo up until the last 70 years or so has been &quot;buy means buy&quot; and you own the thing.<p>Now we have products with incredibly complicated digital locks, though.<p>It turns out you <i>can</i> prevent users from putting something other than sprite in their cups with a complicated enough digital enforcement mechanism.  The question is &quot;should you be allowed to?&quot;.<p>And that&#x27;s actually a hard question - The answer depends a lot on how many people need to interoperate with you and your products (your marketshare and possible monopoly status), as well as whether you have a genuine benefit you&#x27;re providing your consumer by limiting that cup to just Sprite.<p>So legally speaking, Keurig just settled a case about this exact issue (they&#x27;re out 31 million, btw).  This is not nearly as &quot;problem free&quot; as you so clearly want it to be.')
