Grateful those days are over.<p>Vegans can tell you the worse people are the <i>former</i> vegans, who almost always had a bad experience of some kind being vegan and want to tell anyone who will listen.<p>I think people who tried and didn&#x27;t get Vim are often the ones wanting to disprove that Vim is any good. Because obviously if it didn&#x27;t work for them, it can&#x27;t be any good.<p>The subtitle for Drew Neilâ€™s <i>Practical Vim</i> book is <i>Edit text at the speed of thought</i> and that&#x27;s kinda how it is when you start to get pretty good at Vim.')
