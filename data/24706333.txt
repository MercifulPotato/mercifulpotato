Then the phonograph became big, the number dropped by 90% then over a few more decades another 90%.<p>It&#x27;s no longer an occupation, it&#x27;s just a hobby.<p>There are tons of people who take &#x27;fine arts&#x27; at Uni etc. but they&#x27;re not necessarily that good, and very few of them will be able to work in the field and develop careers.<p>&#x27;Orchestral&#x27; even on big albums is all fake, it&#x27;s just to easy to do and too expensive otherwise.<p>&#x27;Creative&#x27; yes, a lot of that, but have a look at the Billboard 100. It&#x27;s &#x27;audible creativity&#x27; but all made by algorithms, it&#x27;s more &#x27;art&#x27; than it is &#x27;music&#x27; in some sense.<p>The other issue is that the bar to entry is lower as well, so for every &#x27;extra genius&#x27; we get out of that &#x27;open process&#x27; there are also 1000x more posers, fakers, people just making arbitrary sounds and it&#x27;s harder to wade the the noise. &#x27;The system&#x27; used to do that for us i.e. the musical community would &#x27;find&#x27; the talent generally. There is no &#x27;system&#x27; now, just YouTube.<p>Thanks for they Polyphia link though.')
