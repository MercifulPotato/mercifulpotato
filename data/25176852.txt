Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606047332, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25176299, text='&gt; Skepticism of everything is the answer. Beware of believing anything regards the objective world, that does not match with personal experience.<p>Do you believe in the past? Not any particular history, but just that anything actually existed at all before your birth&#x2F;first memory? If you do, then you already accept that we can rationally believe things that we have not personally experienced. You also require this belief to think that places you have never visited before actually exist as well, or that tomorrow will look anything like today.<p>Evolution is a somewhat vague theory that is completely undeniable, as long as you accept that the present is a result of the past. To not believe in evolution, you need to believe that the process of artificial selection and its profound effects on organisms produced in this way (chihuahua vs german shepherd, wild bananas vs bananas) is something that never happened on Earth before us.<p>You also need to believe that genetics is bogus, and that the genetic relationships we notice between species that seem similar or distant are somehow pure coincidence.<p>Now, the precise mechanisms of evolution are still debatable - the role of natural vs sexual selection vs genetic selection; the role of mutation, and how random it is; and many others are still debatable and debated. But there is simply no way to look at anything in modern biology or medicine and accept that while denying evolution, if you think through the consequences.<p>Reasoning about the past is just like reasoning about the future, but in reverse: we look at the laws of our world as a function of time, and extrapolate from the present state - to reason about the future, we look at how they apply to t &gt; 0, to reason about the past we look at how they apply if t &lt; 0. Nothing more magical about that.')
