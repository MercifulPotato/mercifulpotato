They use the Euro, and any EU citizen can move there for work, study or just to live (if they have the money to support themselves).<p>However, it&#x27;s not part of Schengen.  The usual benefit -- no queues at the borders -- is pretty limited, when it doesn&#x27;t border any other EU state, and anyone from the EU must arrive by air or sea anyway.<p>Since it is part of the EU, crossing the border is less-strict for an EU citizen: an identity card is acceptable, and there&#x27;s less ability for people to be detained by border guards.')
