Lua and Python are suited for very, very different tasks.<p>If you are whipping up a command-line script because what you want is too complex to attempt in Bash, use Python.  Lua is terrible for this.<p>If you are making an application from scratch using just the stand-alone interpreter, your scripts and a bunch of dependencies from the internets, use Python.  People work really hard to make this semi-viable in Lua, but it is a path of frustration.<p>If you have your own C&#x2F;C++ program and you want an easy path for configuring and composing features that are written in C&#x2F;C++, deciding between Lua and Python depends on your goals.<p>Do you want <i>MAXIMUM POWER</i> for the scripter to whip together any crazy feature they might dream of?  No concerns about footguns, hanging ropes or corner-painting?  Memory and performance are secondary concerns to flexibility?  Go use Python!<p>Do you want <i>minimum power</i> for the scripter so as to keep their creations constrained within a defined box?  Is there a pre-defined role that the script will play?  Are there definite restrictions on what should and should not be done in scripts?  Are you going to be responsible in practice for debugging some monstrosities that the scripters build for themselves?  Are performance and memory primary concerns above flexibility?  Then Lua is well suited for embedding into your application.')
