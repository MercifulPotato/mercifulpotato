Xi is doubling their nuclear weapon count from 200 to 400, and nuclear technology is proliferating throughout the Islamic world.<p>Both have deep-rooted insecurities over being behind the West, but at the same time show remarkable aggression. That&#x27;s a very volatile combination, and both are ok with huge &quot;acceptable losses.&quot;<p>Mao started a cold war against the US in the 1950s, which the US never took seriously until now, &quot;Hide our strength, bide our time.&quot; And Xi is using Mao&#x27;s playbook.<p>Instead of large kinetic wars, the CCP has adopted numerous alternative strategies:<p>- BRI debt traps to build ports, or buying existing ports<p>- Thousand Talents program<p>- academic donations to buy influence<p>- cataloging and spying on Western officials from city to federal levels (ie. FengFeng)<p>- &quot;corona vaccine&quot; diplomacy<p>- world&#x27;s largest naval fleet<p>- diverting Himalayan headland water from India, Pakistan and other countries in the region to China.')
