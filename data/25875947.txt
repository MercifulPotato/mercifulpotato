Kept gradually getting worse, changed about 20 docs, nobody knew how to treat it and they thought I had mental health problems.<p>Then I took matters in my own hands, joined some forums and subreddits, turn out loads of people were like me. Literally thousands of people in online communities had undiagnosed Low Testosterone. Most docs are uneducated about this as they just look at the blood test lab results, and group everyone from age 20 to age 70 in the same category. Went to a mens health doc, gave me TRT, symptoms gone in a week. Literally saved my life and career, I almost dropped out of college. I put my dad on TRT too, and litterally I tell everyone about this. The Low T epidemic is a really serious issue!')
