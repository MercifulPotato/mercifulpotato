Item(by='adrianvoica', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1607973281, title='Indie games studios, what tools do you use these days?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Indie games studios - both large and small - working with fully-remote team members, what are the daily tools that you are using in these times of &quot;distributed collaboration&quot;? How did you adapt your studios&#x2F;businesses to the new remote working model? I am more interested towards the workflows between artists and developers and the administrative part (project boards, planning, etc.). More like &quot;how are you doing it?&quot; instead of &quot;what are you using specifically?&quot;. It seems that some of the &quot;established&quot; methods keep working, but some need new approaches. What&#x27;s your &quot;secret&quot; (that you can share with the world)?')
