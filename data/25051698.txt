Item(by='joe_the_user', descendants=None, kids=[25055676, 25055079], score=None, time=1605041336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25051516, text='<i>HN likes to masquerade as some sort of upscale establishment, high and above the petty squabbles of Eslewhere, but in the end this place too devolves into a predictable echo chamber just like the rest of them, when it comes to any topic on which people have varied opinions.</i><p>This isn&#x27;t a place where dissenting opinions get upvotes. Why should they? I think a fair of posters with plenty of karma are still willing to post things that get massively downvoted and cause a reaction. I&#x27;m getting better at it. I keep a mental model of how I&#x27;ve reacted to HN, look at the page - &quot;there&#x27;s the reaction, down five or ten points&quot;, &quot;hmm, I&#x27;m guess down and up votes balanced&quot;, &quot;ah, that was a crowd pleaser&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think hn is more broken than America or the Internet or whatever.')
