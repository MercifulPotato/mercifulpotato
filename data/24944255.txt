I think the number is too small, but 3 or 4 seems to me to be an incredibly hyperbolic number of individuals to name as gatekeepers to the entire marketplace of ideas.<p>If you think only 3 or 4 people control the entire marketplace of ideas for &quot;reputable members of society&quot;, then you should be able to exhaustively name them.
