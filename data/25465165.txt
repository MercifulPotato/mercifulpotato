That&#x27;s basically what they did.<p>The rest is BS and media circus.<p>I had iPhones since 2008 and never felt compelled to &quot;buy a new&quot; every year, just because there was tiny percentage perf drop.<p>For one, the drop in battery (and thus perf tradeoff) happens after 3 or more years of use, not after the first year.<p>Apple is the only company that supports old phone models with new releases for as long, and the company with the best resale value.<p>So, don&#x27;t buy into the media&#x2F;ambulance chasers hoopla...<p>&gt;<i>On the &quot;we force you to buy our OWN UNIQUE cables because f... the global standards and nature&quot; they are still doing pretty bad</i><p>Most people already have 2-4 cables at home. Why include new ones if they don&#x27;t need them? Just to churn out more plastic? Or is it a problem that in your $600 to $1200 purchase also needs to factor in a $20 cable if you don&#x27;t already have one?<p>Environmentally speaking I&#x27;d force companies to mimick this: (a) use standard chargers and cables, (b) do not provide them in the box. People that already have several don&#x27;t need them, people who don&#x27;t can buy a standalone one (even third party for cheaper). The Lighting cable is not a standard (i&#x27;d force Apple to move to USB-C), but it&#x27;s ubiquitous enough (it&#x27;s not some obscure, per-device cable, like we had in days of yore).<p>&gt;<i>On the &quot;you can only buy (iOS) apps from us and nobody else, yeah!&quot; I don&#x27;t find that so good either.</i><p>I do. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be forced to use the Google store for certain apps, the Facebook store for other apps, random third party stores with shady malware apps imposed upon the less savvy users, and so on...<p>I buy iPhones because of the integration. Go get a Librem phone for the &quot;ultimate&quot; open experience...')
