The Republicans would&#x27;ve faded into history after Kennedy and Johnson incorporated civil rights into the Democratic platform had Nixon&#x27;s aides not developed the strategy of winning enough votes to be a contender by appealing to all the disgruntled ex-Democrat racists. As a result, the Republican base has been a bunch of far-right loons who fantasize about overthrowing the government for much of that time. This was true long before Trump ever seriously considered politics. Trump just exposed it for what it was, making the American far right feel that <i>finally</i> they were being listened to, <i>finally</i> they were in control. And by approving the insurrection against the government, he accidentally got them to show their true colors.<p>See, I was there the last time an idiosyncratic tycoon had a go at the White House and galvanized the right, namely Ross Perot. He roused the right wing from its malaise and, inadvertently, created the conditions of rage and hatred that led to Timothy McVeigh. So you&#x27;re right -- Trump is just a footnote. The hatred he stirred up is much bigger than him.')
