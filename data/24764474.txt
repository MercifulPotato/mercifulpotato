The Netherlands actually gave Microsoft 500 million euro in free energy credit (by building them subsidized windmills) just so they would build their enormous data center here, an enormous datacenter that is going to employ only 125 people.<p>And those windmills, they were pitched to the people as being able to power 370.000 households. The kicker of course that they won&#x27;t power even a single one, as 100% of the energy has been sold to Microsoft.')
