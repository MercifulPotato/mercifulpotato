At some point you know that you &quot;got it&quot; - you can be dropped in a random point on the earth and make something out of it - and yet you may not know how to be at one place for a long time (I am learning that now.)<p>Also, it makes things less special. In a way I am jealous of people who are dreaming of going to Paris and then experience it for the first time.<p>You do you - save your money, invest in relationships around you, learn things on line, be a good child and parent. If that&#x27;s &quot;all&quot; you have to show against someone who has been everywhere but doesn&#x27;t have what you have, you&#x27;re ahead.')
