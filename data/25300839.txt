Thanks to Roam&#x27;s hype they have backlinks now (+ it&#x27;s possible now to create new page in another page&#x2F;db with &quot;[[&quot;, that will leave only link&#x2F;mention to that new page), which means both structured and flat zettelkasten-style notes (done in some master notes DB) are possible, plus regular DBs and all of the other cool stuff. This is a complete solution for me, all of my notes are much better organised now. And yes, I know, Roam has much more features than backlinks, I was using all of them, queries and block references, and sidebar, and ..., but for real work I&#x27;m not missing anything else than a sidebar. Sidebar is the best part of Roam IMO, even Obsidian with their multipane can&#x27;t compete with that. With Notion I can open new tab in browser or new window in desktop app and keep it side-by-side and it&#x27;s ok too, not as good and fast experience as with Roam, but good enough.')
