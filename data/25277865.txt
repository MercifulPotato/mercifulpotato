Every single &quot;long term covid&quot; symptom study I&#x27;ve read are case studies. The UK one from the publication in Charlottesville covered 60 distinct people and they were all either high risk workers or over 55.<p>We don&#x27;t know what &quot;permanent damage&quot; is actually happening. I remember having pneumonia in the 90s and it took my lungs over 3 months to recover, and that&#x27;s from a normal known infection.<p>I think there is a strong case to be made, that a lot of these &quot;long covid&quot; cases might be a combination of normal pneumonia recovery, nocebo effect and fear&#x2F;hysteria over this disease.')
