My 1&#x2F;20&#x2F;23 $3 AMC LEAPS calls that I&#x27;ve been accumulating since the pandemic struck long before wall street bets took notice are up 227% today as of 10 seconds ago for the day, and 822% overall. Granted, I&#x27;m benefiting from the commotion going on, but I&#x27;m holding until the end, because I believe in the long term fundamentals of AMC and hope to be positioned to exercise rather than sell by the time expiry arrives.
