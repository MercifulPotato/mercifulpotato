Almost all of them have no choice though, so they have to sacrifice their mental and physical health, as well as their pride.<p>I was personally technically an officer on the ship so we get a bit better treatment, such as a housekeeper and we have our uniforms cleaned and ironed. Still, the hours even for us happened to be hell, sometimes on the embarkation days (when guests board the ship) it would go up to 13-14 hours.<p>The blue collar workers, especially in housekeeping normally worked around that 12 hours a day mark, regularly, for 7-9 months onboard.<p>The article mentions 8-10 hours, but that is an exception, not a norm.<p>All in all, CCL likes to aim for a 10&#x2F;10 treatment for the guests and I guess they consistently hit 8&#x2F;10 with their core customers. Crew however, a solid 3&#x2F;10 max.')
