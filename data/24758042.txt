But not reading an article has never stopped me from commenting before! Haha!<p>I’m going to file this story:<p>third-party&#x2F;corporate contract tracing apps sitting on mountains of valuable contact information ask themselves, what should we do with all this free milk?<p>...together with common _business_ practice from some US companies such as Walgreens and Target who require you to show ID for any purchase of alcohol or tobacco products no matter how old you are (prev age was less than 35).
