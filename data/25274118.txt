The issue with architecture SVG generation code that I&#x27;ve seen is that it&#x27;s inflexible once you want to do anything outside common layer computations or arrangements. I found someone&#x27;s code that had a U-Net example and then manually had to go in and modify a whole bunch of stuff to get it to do just what I wanted. On top of that, I opted to do a bunch of postprocessing in an image editor anyway. More importantly, the 3D diagram is harder to parse for anyone looking to re-implement the model. Most (but not all) of the information is there, but you have to work for it. With the 2D diagram, the architecture is fully specified and, I believe, very easy to read (though I&#x27;m open to feedback). It&#x27;s not as pretty, but ease of manual creation and the boost in clarity are more important.<p>NN-SVG looks like a better UI around a beautiful parametrized isometric 3D architecture diagram generator, but it also looks like it suffers from the drawbacks I have experienced in the past. Can it handle residual or skip connections? How easy is it to modify? If you are creating publication-quality architecture diagrams daily, automating it may save you time, but if you&#x27;ve gotta write a bunch of code every time your model&#x27;s components are tweaked and only need pretty diagrams once and a while, you might be better off doing it by hand. Moreover, whether you use a 3D or 2D diagram, I think it&#x27;s worth favoring a format that aids reproducibility.')
