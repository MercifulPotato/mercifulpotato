I went hoping to meet cool technology people and exchange ideas.   When I arrived and started talking to people it became clear that I was the only alum from the engineering school.<p>At that point, I had worked in Silicon Valley for 12 years and had several successful product developments under my belt.  Yet I couldnâ€™t understand a word of what the MBAs were saying.  Their words would stream out and there was no content or substance whatsoever to anything they were saying.   I left with the impression that very few had any idea what technology development was or how to bring a technology product to market.<p>When I mentioned that I was from the engineering school, few wanted to continue the conversation.')
