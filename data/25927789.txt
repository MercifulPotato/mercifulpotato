Yes it&#x27;s cheap. Yes it doesn&#x27;t last a lifetime. Yes it needs a lot of wood. Yes it&#x27;s highly optimized.<p>But guess what, IKEA is a business responding to the needs of people. The negatives that are mentioned frequently are merely a symptom of our ever faster developing society. The people who complain are the same ones that just buy cheap crap from china without even thinking about it.<p>IKEAs ability to produce products that people actually need, at such a scale, is amazing to me. It does what it promises. It&#x27;s cheap. It fills most people&#x27;s needs fully. Customer support is perfect. I know in 10 years replacements for their core products will still be available. Their way of innovating the products is genius.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any other company that even comes close. Well, maybe LEGO.')
