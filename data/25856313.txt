On the first day he takes a can of paint out to the road and finishes 300 yards of the road. &quot;That&#x27;s pretty good!&quot; says his boss, &quot;you&#x27;re a fast worker!&quot; and pays him a kopeck.<p>The next day Shlemiel only gets 150 yards done. &quot;Well, that&#x27;s not nearly as good as yesterday, but you&#x27;re still a fast worker. 150 yards is respectable,&quot; and pays him a kopeck.<p>The next day Shlemiel paints 30 yards of the road. &quot;Only 30!&quot; shouts his boss. &quot;That&#x27;s unacceptable! On the first day you did ten times that much work! What&#x27;s going on?&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t help it,&quot; says Shlemiel. &quot;Every day I get farther and farther away from the paint can!&quot;')
