Item(by='bayindirh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610573152, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25767425, text='&gt; Many F500 type companies pretty much MUST have O365.<p>This is the problem. Putting Linux support aside, focusing too much on enterprise, while necesseary up to a point, kills both the product and <i>personal productivity tools</i> market.<p>Is wanting to decouple work and personal files completely while retaining independence on personal systems a cardinal sin?<p>IMHO, touting about benefits of a work&#x2F;life balance is moot if I can&#x27;t completely shut-off work stuff from my life while using my computer. Dropbox, Evernote and Trello allows me to do that. None of my work stuff is present in these mediums. Similarly none of my work stuff syncs to my personal computers directly. I use company laptop for that stuff.<p>Trello also went the same route. Trello Gold was a personal productivity powerhouse. Now it&#x27;s unmaintained, intentionally crippled semi-premium version of Trello Business class.<p>Do I need to set-up a VPS, install {Next,Own}cloud to it and install all my tools as add-ons there to have a personal productivity space? In 2021? That shouldn&#x27;t be necessary, that wasn&#x27;t the promise.<p>Yet we are here. Every product is targeting the enterprise, where the freelancer or the personal productivity enthusiast is either confined to its corporate licenses or expensive (in terms of time) self-hosted solutions.')
