This seems counter-intuitive coming from other languages, but has been borne out by my experience. The strong typing and compiler guarantees push most run-time errors or unintended behavior to compile-time.<p>As a result, a lot of the iteration that happens is between me and `rust-analyzer` and `cargo check`, which, as you note, is much faster than a compilation pass with codegen and link.')
