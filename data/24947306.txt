There is a linter that can check whether an API follows the AIPs (I know, these acronyms are easy to mix up), available at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linter.aip.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linter.aip.dev</a>. I am building a side project following the AIPs and have found them to be very helpful.<p>Disclaimer: I work at Google, although I would have recommended these resources anyway.')
