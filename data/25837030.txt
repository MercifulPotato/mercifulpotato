Item(by='danShumway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611082065, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25836190, text='Dual licensing (using the GPL and a separate proprietary license) is kind of a hack solution that takes advantage of the fact that business hate the GPL. It can introduce some problems (it effectively bars you from accepting contributions unless you use a CLA, which many contributors won&#x27;t do). However, while community is an important part of Open Source, the most important part of Open Source is the lack of restrictions on how people use&#x2F;modify&#x2F;share the code, so while people can debate whether or not dual licensing is a good idea, that doesn&#x27;t mean the GPL stops applying.<p>Any code that is GPL licensed is Open Source. It might be distasteful to some people to force contributors to sign a CLA, you might get some criticism from some segments of the community, but it&#x27;s not problematic in a way that means it&#x27;s fundamentally non-FOSS.<p>BSL on the other hand is not Open Source, but becomes Open Source at the point where the BSL license expires and is replaced by an Open version.<p>----<p>Personally, I might get some pushback on this, but I actually kind of like BSL more than dual licensing. Dual licensing relies on the fact that people find the GPL toxic. It feels much more to me like a temporary solution, and one that only works by kind of dragging the GPL through the mud. Even among people who don&#x27;t hate the GPL, it encourages them to think of it as a tool to enforce &#x27;fairness&#x27;, rather than as a complicated way to use copyright to push towards a world where every user has the rights guaranteed in the GPL for every program they run.<p>TBH, I vaguely suspect that some of the movement towards SSPL is an evolution of people&#x27;s attitude towards dual licensing, where they thought that the un-attractiveness of the GPL was the point of the GPL, and now feel like it&#x27;s not living up to it&#x27;s &#x27;promise&#x27;. The fact that Amazon is able to use GPL code to provide commercial services is seen by those people as a bug, not a feature.<p>Many of the downsides and restrictions around community contributions with BSL are also present in dual licensing because of the implicit CLA requirements in dual licensed projects. So it&#x27;s not clear to me that BSL is more harmful to community-built software than dual licensing, and given the above trend, it seems a bit more honest (for lack of a better word).<p>Because dual licensing doesn&#x27;t really affect companies like Amazon, it kind of encourages people into these arm races where people say that the GPL has failed in its job because some companies don&#x27;t hate it (again, the point of the GPL is not to be impossible for companies to use). BSL on the other hand is very straightforward, and because it&#x27;s upfront about its goals, it&#x27;s not subject to the same kinds of weird arm races and escalations. You release software as proprietary, we all recognize that it&#x27;s proprietary and that you want compensation for it, and then at some point it becomes Open Source. That&#x27;s a really simple model to think about and build around.<p>----<p>But all that being said, code that is licensed under the GPL is Open Source, period, regardless of what other licenses it is simultaneously offered under.<p>BSL licensed code <i>before it expires</i> is not Open Source or FOSS: it&#x27;s proprietary code that later is Open Sourced once a certain amount of commercial value has been extracted from it.')
