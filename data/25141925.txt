I&#x27;ve learned more through books than any other medium.<p>They take time and, for me, it took a while to realise how I best learnt. I don&#x27;t like reading technical books cover to cover, not on the first read at least. I try to look through the index for concepts that catch my interest, either because I realise I know nothing except the term (so that makes me feel a bit ignorant and curious to check it out) or it&#x27;s a concept I can visualise being applied more easily.<p>Usually from there I will read something I don&#x27;t know what means and go look for that. When I&#x27;ve scanned through a bit to catch my interest then I start reading from the first chapter.<p>It took me years to realise I didn&#x27;t have to force myself to sit down and open a book from page 1. It&#x27;s a bit obvious and stupid but I believe I&#x27;m not alone in having to learn myself how do I like to learn.')
