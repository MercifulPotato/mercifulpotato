Since the filter is lowpass, think just Fourier transform then taking an inner smaller square of the image and inverting, then you can embed the poison image only in that frequency spectrum. Now by playing with the power, if we downdsample by a factor of 4 then just assume that we lose a quarter of the power in the original image while the poison image loses no power. So right off the bat, we are scaling up the poison image power by a factor of the downsampling ratio. For example, we might go from 1&#x2F;4 power in the poison image relative to the true image then to equivalent power. The other aspect would be if the interpolation kernel and strides are known we can just make sure that the poison image has large values at those specific pixels and further increase the gain.')
