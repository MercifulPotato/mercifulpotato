In my case, I find, for example, customizing the right part of the prompt useful; additionally, there are improvements that one gets out of the box, like better copy-paste.<p>However, when I&#x27;ve asked to colleagues of mine why they used it and how, I&#x27;ve found that nobody knew anything beyond the basics.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to go beyond the basics myself, but I&#x27;ve found the manuals very obscure, and I gave up.

I also think it will realistically never take off in scripting.')
