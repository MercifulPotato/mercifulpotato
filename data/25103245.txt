It seems like it&#x27;s more of a recreation of a job system based off of (an older version of) Gitlab CI configuration files.<p>Circle CI has a more decent story around this if I remember correctly. But first-class support for local reproduction of CI runs is the kind of thing I&#x27;d like to see as table stakes today.<p>It can be challenging to debug certain things in the live CI system for developers without being able to recreate locally (otherwise you have to bring in the team that manages the CI system to help them debug with you which takes time).')
