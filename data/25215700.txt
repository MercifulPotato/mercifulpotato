To be honest, it didn&#x27;t cross my mind that Ripcord would be the reason why, considering I&#x27;ve used it for years successfully. I only use it because the bloated Discord electron client makes my laptop want to kill itself, but I guess I just won&#x27;t use Discord on my laptop anymore.<p>I was using the official client when it happened, but Ripcord was open on my laptop (which I wasn&#x27;t using) at the time, so it makes sense that it might&#x27;ve sent requests the normal client doesn&#x27;t when a DM is closed or something. Or maybe you flagged it earlier than that.<p>Either way, I&#x27;m glad to be unbanned now, but this customer service was unacceptably bad. I didn&#x27;t get a real answer on why I was banned (until HN got the attention of a non-CS rep), and when I was told I would be unbanned, I wasn&#x27;t and was ghosted afterward.<p>(Also I&#x27;ll update the page I wrote)')
