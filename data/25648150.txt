According to Wikipedia [1], about 45 million people were vaccinated and 362 of them suffered Guillan-Barre syndrome. Only 1 person died of the actual swine flu.<p>But that comparison actually makes Ben&#x27;s case <i>stronger</i>. What if all 330 million people in the US had been vaccinated against COVID, and 1 in 100,000 of them (about the same proportion as for the 1976 vaccine) had serious side effects? Even if all of those side effects were fatal (and they wouldn&#x27;t be), that would still be only 3,300 deaths--less than 1 percent of the US COVID death count currently reported. And even leaving aside that not all side effects would be fatal, that death count is clearly an overestimate, since in the US people would be given the choice whether to be vaccinated, and not all Americans would take it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1976_swine_flu_outbreak" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1976_swine_flu_outbreak</a>')
