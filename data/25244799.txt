I don&#x27;t know how much exactly it would cost a company like Roblox to develop and maintain all the necessary tools and services provided by the app stores in order to run on all those devices.<p>Probably a lot. In fact, if they could do it, they would be Apple or Google :).<p>Whether it&#x27;s a lot more than it should be, I don&#x27;t know, but it helps to keep in mind that the app store cut is for a lot more than just payment processing.')
