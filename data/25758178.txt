I’d be very surprised if more than a tiny fraction of liberals cheering Parler’s removal from the internet have ever used the platform or know anything about it other than the snippets they have been shown by those seeking to justify its destruction and to depict it as some neo-Nazi stronghold.<p>This is a serious question: Was there a bastion of nuanced discussion and debate occurring on Parler? Almost everything I&#x27;ve ever seen has been amplification of disinformation. I am sure some nuanced discussions were there, but Glenn it making it seem like it was a minor part of the service or perhaps mirrored how common it might be on Twitter and other platforms? Is that what he&#x27;s trying to imply?')
