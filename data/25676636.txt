Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610050189, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25675999, text='&gt; claimed this would have diluted their own votes for the Federal Government.<p>Texas gets x votes of the 538 electoral votes. It gets that no matter how Pennsylvania chooses its electors; the number of electoral votes is fixed as a matter of reckoning by the census. So how can Texas&#x27;s electoral votes <i>possibly</i> be diluted?<p>It should also be noted that the legal theory of &quot;vote dilution&quot; is applied to a very narrow set of cases where one can bring suit, essentially only gerrymandering cases. It has never, to my knowledge, been applied to a case where it was claimed that an invalid or fraudulent vote causes vote dilution for everyone who casts their votes properly. I actually believe a few courts have considered that claim and expressly denied that claim, although that has not made it to the Supreme Court before.<p>&gt; there is literally no other court for Texas to sue in. This wasn&#x27;t really an issue of standing.<p>You&#x27;ve not-so-cleverly dodged the issue I brought up: the law does not give Texas any possible legal standing to sue Pennsylvania. Period. Full-stop. End-of-question. To demand that the court hear Texas&#x27;s plea is to demand that the court <i>violate the rule of the law</i>. The Supreme Court has <i>repeatedly</i> stated that to have standing, you have to demonstrate a <i>particular injury</i>, which cannot be a <i>generalized grievance</i>. Texas did not, and cannot, demonstrate any injury. Hell, Texas compounds its error by complaining about other states undertaking the <i>same</i> actions it took itself (as the DC-et-al brief so kindly points out [1]), which is compounding the bad faith with which it filed its brief.<p>Texas had no injury. It tried to BS its way to one, and its BS was called out as such in all the respondent brief, and Texas&#x27;s reply brief basically amounted to &quot;nuh-uh&quot; without really attacking the gravamen of any reply. I agree with Tom Goldstein here that SCOTUS should have abandoned its practice of dismissing this kind of case with a one-sentence per curiam order and actually release the kind of dismissal opinion that is routine in all other courts laying out just <i>why</i> the case was never going to be heard.<p>Texas doesn&#x27;t have a right to sue PA for not following its own laws. That right is granted only to PA residents--and some residents <i>did</i> sue the PA government in this regard on the law in question, and that lawsuit <i>already</i> failed by the time Texas filed its suit, a fact you again choose to ignore.<p>[1] Yes, I read every single brief in that case. So I know what the actual gravamen of Texas&#x27;s claims were, and it was very clear from the first brief that Texas filed that the case was going to be dismissed with no dissent, as it was [2]. I may not be a lawyer, but what&#x27;s going on here isn&#x27;t exactly delving very deep into the weeds of specialized law: this is basic, Law 101 standing stuff.<p>[2] Thomas and Alito noted that they dissented only insofar as they think the pseudo-cert motion for intra-state disputes must be heard. They would have still dismissed the case for the same reason as the other 7 justices, and they commented as much. This dissenting on grounds of pseudo-cert process not being constitutional was also 100% predicted, with the only question being if Barrett would agree with them here (she did not).')
