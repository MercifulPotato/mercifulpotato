In this environment, pretty much all keywords are in English and having this perspective, I automatically treat words like &quot;trash&quot;, &quot;spam&quot; as just keywords - it would seem weird to have them localized. I have never thought of these words to be an issue for an English speaker. I do agree though that words in en_US may sound weird for somebody speaking other dialects of en_*.')
