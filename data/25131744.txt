Photoshop 6 was released in 2000. That version wasn&#x27;t released for OS X. In fact, <i>Photoshop 6 was still compiled for PowerPC CPUs.</i> The thing wasn&#x27;t even fully &quot;carbonized&quot; until version 7, so it would have had to run in the &quot;Classic&quot; environment -- which hasn&#x27;t been supported on Macs since OS X 10.4.<p>Maybe you think it&#x27;s unreasonable for Apple to not support a program made for an operating system they haven&#x27;t shipped a new version in 18 years for a CPU they haven&#x27;t shipped in a computer for 15 years. I&#x27;m not sure I agree.<p>&gt; Technically in Italy if you bought a license and the manufacturer won&#x27;t support it anymore, you can use it on another platform even downloading an illegal copy.<p>The legality isn&#x27;t the issue, the &quot;Photoshop 6 is literally two decades old&quot; is the issue. :) It may be <i>possible</i> to run the Windows version on Windows 10, but I can almost guarantee there will be strange, quirky issues that neither Microsoft nor Adobe will be interested in helping with.')
