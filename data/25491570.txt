There&#x27;s a reason the males of hundreds of <i>thousands</i> of other species have evolved to impress females of their species.<p>You may not like it. You may not agree with it. You may not condone it. But you&#x27;re <i>not</i> going to change it. You don&#x27;t have the <i>power</i>. The only thing that&#x27;ll change this is time. Lots and lots of time. People think you can separate genetically reinforced biologically-ingrained biases from culture. You can&#x27;t. You won&#x27;t. No one can. It has to progress slowly, over time.<p>The world that many progressive people want <i>may</i> come to pass one day, but it won&#x27;t be today, it won&#x27;t be tomorrow, it won&#x27;t be 10 years from now, it won&#x27;t be 100 years from now.<p>Bookmark this comment and come back whenever you want. See how long it takes for the majority of society to shift. You&#x27;ll have a very long wait.')
