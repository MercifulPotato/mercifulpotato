There are some proposals to make thresholds. Structuring currently only applies to physical cash passing a boarder or physical cash entering or exiting a financial institution. It does not apply to institution to institution transfers of any type and it doesn&#x27;t apply to cryptocurrencies at the moment. Iâ€™ve had this discussion before, FinCEN is trying to change that.<p>Because structuring is a criminal law, they would need to show a court a bit more to convict. But before a conviction they could make your life complicated with dumb rationale to a judge for a warrant or seizure notice, and that has nothing to do with cryptocurrency, everyone relies on the government and private persons not making their life complicated.')
