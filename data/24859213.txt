Very simple, you can set the inhale, hold, exhale, hold times, and you can set start and end speeds and ramp-down time.<p>You can save settings, so I have a &quot;Quick calm down&quot; that&#x27;s just 3 minutes, going down to 4.5 breaths&#x2F;min, and a &quot;Slooow&quot; that 6 minutes long that has me at 3 breaths&#x2F;min for most of it, and a &quot;Slooow continued&quot; that starts at 3 breaths&#x2F;min and just continues for another 5 minutes, for when I just want to stay there for a while. I also have a square breathing pattern saved, 6 seconds per side, but I don&#x27;t much like square breathing.<p>Inhale and exhale is shown visually, by sounds, or by phone vibrations. No other fluff.')
