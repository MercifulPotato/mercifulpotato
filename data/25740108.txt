And all models are lies (and some models are useful).<p>There&#x27;s a few ideologies &#x2F; models going on here. Eg:<p>- A company is like a person, with all the rights of free expression and self governance. From that perspective, twitter and FB are free to have whatever systems of regulation (or be totally arbitrary and capricious). And its up to the market to replace twitter&#x2F;FB.<p>- A monopolistic social media website is part of the public square. So facebook is more like the US federal government than it is like the burger shop down the road. As such, facebook&#x2F;twitter should be held to the norms of a government, not the norms of a business. They should allow free speech by the <i>participants</i> in that space, in accordance with the laws of the land. The market should be free to work <i>inside twitter&#x2F;fb</i>.<p>Both of these stories are internally consistent, and both stories are consistent with the broad ideas of &quot;free speech&quot; and &quot;free markets&quot;.')
