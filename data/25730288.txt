Could this be a slippery slope? Sure, but it&#x27;s not as slippery as the other side of the slope which goes right off a cliff.<p>There is still plenty of time&#x2F;space to have debates about how to move forward from here with moderation and privacy on social networks, but for now we are in the middle of an insurrection that needs to be put down.<p>Also, should another attack take place couldn&#x27;t platforms knowingly providing services to the capitol attackers find themselves liable for providing material support for terrorists? If I were managing risk at AWS that definitely be a major concern.<p>My POV, if we wouldn&#x27;t have a problem doing it to ISIS after an attack on our Capitol, then we shouldn&#x27;t have problem doing the same to QAnon and these &quot;patriots&quot;.')
