Zest is a software (widget) that lets our users leave feedback 10 times easier than before.<p>- Users click on a button (they donâ€™t have anything to install), and Zest records your computer screen &amp; your voice so you can share what you love and what you hate.<p>- Companies installing Zest for their users: (1) receive more feedback (12x based on our current beta users); (2) get feedback of better quality and much more relevant (thanks to audio and screencast); (3) build a much stronger relationship with their users<p>If you are building a product-led company (SaaS), we just made it available to everyone: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hellozest.io')
