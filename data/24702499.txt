It&#x27;s in a 2-level wooden enclosure my father-in-law built just outside our house, with a cat door connecting it to the interior of our house.<p>No reason it couldn&#x27;t be used inside, of course, but it would eventually smell more inside, versus a smaller box you scoop more frequently. (of course, you can scoop a large box frequently too, it just takes longer).<p>I tell myself I scoop it twice a week, but to be honest, it often ends up being more like &quot;weekly&quot;, on garbage day.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.homedepot.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;Plasgad-Black-Large-Concrete-Mixing-Tub-887102C&#x2F;205451585" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.homedepot.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;Plasgad-Black-Large-Concrete-Mix...</a>')
