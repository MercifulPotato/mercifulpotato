The police were arresting her <i>before</i> Huang shouted that she&#x27;s a journalist. How is this supposed to be evidence of the police targeting journalists?<p>The video is less than a minute long. Both the police&#x27;s account and the Buzzfeed article claim that Huang was with a group of people making &quot;anti-police&quot; statements (according to the police&#x27;s account, these included death threats) outside of a hospital treating a pair of officers who were shot in an ambush. What happened between that and Huang&#x27;s arrest is not captured on video.<p>Yes, police do bad thing sometimes. But targeting journalists isn&#x27;t one of them. This incident is not an example of that. There is no indication that Huang wouldn&#x27;t have been arrested if she wasn&#x27;t a journalist.<p>It seems like the only thing that would appease you is if the police immediately ceased arrests when people claim to be a journalist. This is not feasible, because anybody can claim to be a journalist and the police have no immediate way of validating these claims. What they can do is proceed with the arrest and release the person if their claims of being a journalists are discovered to be true. Which is exactly what happened here: Huang was released and charges against her dropped.')
