Always publicly thank contributors for each unit of work I encountered, no matter how mundane, and especially when I recognized the value where it wouldn’t necessarily be visible&#x2F;“hot” otherwise.<p>2. To make regular time for specific recognition of work that stood out to me, both public and direct, again especially highlighting important work that wouldn’t otherwise get a lot of light. (By now it should be obvious that I tend to work in libraries&#x2F;infrastructure where good work tends to be mostly invisible.)<p>3. To try to continuously add visibility where work tended to be more foundational&#x2F;less visible, so others would be encouraged to add to that recognition.<p>4. To make sure positive feedback was included wherever general or even critical feedback was warranted.<p>I’m not perfect and never perfected execution on those goals, but it was always an underlying part of how I interacted with my team. It improved my relationship with every team member who I most butted heads with (save one who was reflexively adversarial and invented conflict for even the tiniest work items; some people are just jerks!). And it also made a lot of people just generally more comfortable with their own contributions and better able to see their own value.')
