There might be a pdf floating around on the internet, it&#x27;s a 20 min read.<p>Basically, it&#x27;s about a reversible procedure called &quot;calli&quot; that turns off the neurological response to symmetry, smoothness, and &quot;aesthetic&quot; of a human face. So someone with the procedure can recognize different faces, but they don&#x27;t feel any better about a pretty face than an ugly one.<p>The story follows a girl who had calli done as a young child, and then decided to go to college with it turned off. When she&#x27;s there, there&#x27;s a push on campus to mandate the procedure, to combat &quot;lookism.&quot; The story is written like a documentary film, so it has little snippets of interviews, news articles, etc. about the debate.<p>The range of emotions we get from looking at other people&#x27;s faces is intrinsically worth saving. But, people get a huge advantage from being good-looking. It&#x27;s effectively discrimination to consider people who are good looking more trustworthy, nicer, etc, yet all of us do -- it&#x27;s hard wired. The world is not really fair to someone with a bad looking face.<p>These apps aren&#x27;t calli but they do mediate how we see the world, ourselves, and others to a huge degree. I don&#x27;t envy any middle school girl who has to navigate this landscape. Anyway, I highly recommend the story, it was such an interesting way of looking at the issue.')
