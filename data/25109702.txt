Many of them actively cooperate with heritage institutions and loaning out for temporary or even permanent exhibitions.<p>Why? First, because doing so is an expression of power and status. Second, because heritage institutions are scientific authorities. Having your works on displays asserts their authenticity, and thereby their value.<p>Barring a handful of well known names, heritage institutions, publicly funded smaller organizations in particular, have always struggled to acquire enough resources to stay operational. Sponsoring, private donations and fundraising events are indispensable. There&#x27;s a good reason why the Met Gala is a thing. And even the Met struggles financially.

Now, what&#x27;s on public display in a museum doesn&#x27;t constitute the entire collection either. It&#x27;s a selection made by curators and scientists based on historical and cultural significance. The Met collection counts 2 million objects, for instance.<p>Some objects are only put on display once every few decades in a temporary exhibition because their fragility and their intrinsic value require expensive logistics, insurances,...<p>Finally, consider how galleries and museums acquire objects and ammend their collections. It doesn&#x27;t happen by accident. Either it happens because a private collector bequeaths their own collection to a public institution; or it&#x27;s because public institutions also participate in auctions.<p>I understand the point you&#x27;re trying to make. There are, indeed, private collectors who simply acquire objects at auctions which then disappear from the public&#x27;s view for many decades. That&#x27;s absolutely not a new thing')
