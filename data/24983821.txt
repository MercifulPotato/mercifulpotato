I&#x27;d not really even considered that places <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> sell battered sausages. It would be almost like going in and finding out that they didn&#x27;t offer fish battered - it just seemed so standard. I guess while I&#x27;ve lived in a variety of cities I&#x27;ve only been to a fairly small number of chip shops, something I&#x27;d not considered until now.')
