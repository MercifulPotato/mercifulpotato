Things like read-only properties being mixed in with read-write properties, and internal code-names used for final production systems.<p>Then the actual client-side tooling is a disaster. The ARM template language is just raw JSON, but isn&#x27;t case sensitive and includes comments and a bizarre expression language. It&#x27;s very weakly typed and then even ignores the weak typing that it <i>does</i> have. I&#x27;ve lost count of the times I&#x27;ve been forced to put a number into a string because... reasons.<p>They&#x27;re working on a replacement language called BICEP, but IMHO they should have gone down the same path that Pulumi did.')
