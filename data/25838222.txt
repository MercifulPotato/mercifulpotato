Basically their argument was that the party structures performed gatekeeping functions and that populists could not even get nominated to a party ticket (even with massive popular support, comparable to that of Donald Trump - they give the example of Henry Ford).<p>Those gatekeeping functions were lessened after the violent Democratic national convention of &#x27;68 (where there was a clash between pro-war and anti-war factions) and primaries became a thing that actually mattered (in 68 Humphrey was selected by backroom insiders who did not participate in a single primary in that cycle, leading to public outcry). However, the gatekeeping effects persisted because of the control the parties still had over advertising channels and the media; that control fell apart post-2000, which setup the conditions that enabled a populist like Donald Trump to actually be elected to the presidency.<p>So it&#x27;s not free speech that kept fascists out of power in the U.S., it&#x27;s institutional gatekeeping (in the 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s).')
