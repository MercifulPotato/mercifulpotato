Any language will have both downsides and upsides and picking this one &quot;flaw&quot; in C and then pretending like it&#x27;s a reason that C absolutely shouldn&#x27;t be used is absurd.<p>Secondly, the Sudo code in question seems to be a result of a poor or nonexistent design process (which also seems consistent with Sudo&#x27;s horrific bloat of features), so this isn&#x27;t a good example for preaching against C.<p>Slightly off-topic, but FTR I view C as somewhat crippled and C++ as an easy to misuse Lovecraftian monstrosity (but much more powerful and useful than C), and I suspect Rust&#x27;s way of forbidding the user from making memory errors is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.')
