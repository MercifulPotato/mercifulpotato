Ever since Apple proposed &quot;safe HLSL&quot;, and then it morphed into WHLSL and then WLSL and then the competing Tint proposal which is now WGSL, everyone (Adobe, Valve, Epic, Unity, NVIDIA) was saying &quot;none of this will do what you think it does, we&#x27;ve all been here before and it&#x27;s very very hard, at the very least, get some IHVs or at least a team that does port work &#x2F; emulation tech on board&quot;.<p>The committee chose not to listen, instead forcing WebGPU down this hell that nobody really wants or appreciates. The whole WebGPU is three years late and still has no users, despite being one of the most complicated specs to land in years. And yeah, I&#x27;m still a bit bitter about it.<p>I am also skeptical of rust-gpu&#x27;s approach, because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to take a CPU-inspired language design and blindly adapt it to GPUs without some difficult questions to answer (they still don&#x27;t have flow control, but I&#x27;m told that&#x27;s coming).<p>But at the very least, I think repi and Embark know what they&#x27;re doing and know about the tough problems, rather than feigning being blindsighted.')
