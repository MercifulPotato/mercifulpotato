The University of Wisconsin-Madison team -- including Shiho Chiba, who ran the hamster experiments -- performed replication and airborne transmission studies with both the original virus and the mutated version created by Baric and Hou.<p>&gt; They found that the mutated virus not only replicates about 10 times faster -- it&#x27;s also much more infectious.<p>&gt; Hamsters were inoculated with one virus or the other. The next day, eight uninfected hamsters were placed into cages next to infected hamsters. There was a divider between them so they could not touch, but air could pass between the cages.<p>&gt; Researchers began looking for replication of the virus in the uninfected animals on day two. Both viruses passed between animals via airborne transmission, but the timing was different.<p>&gt; With the mutant virus, the researchers saw transmission to six out of eight hamsters within two days, and to all the hamsters by day four. With the original virus, they saw no transmission on day two, though all of the exposed animals were infected by day four.<p>&gt; &quot;We saw that the mutant virus transmits better airborne than the [original] virus, which may explain why this virus dominated in humans,&quot; Kawaoka said.')
