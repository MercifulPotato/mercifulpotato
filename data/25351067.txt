It also means that non-browser clients (Sonos, AppleTV, etc.) get ad&#x2F;tracker blocking as well.<p>DoH sort of breaks all of this, unfortunately.<p>Individual devices or clients or browsers can now connect to trackers and ad-servers over HTTPS, bypassing my adblocking resolver.<p>I thought that perhaps there was a solution wherein you would pre-query every single new IP you connected to over HTTPS and send it a test DNS query .. and if it answered DNS, you would just refuse to talk to it.  I think this falls apart, however, if (for instance) google just queries &quot;google.com&quot; ... now you&#x27;re denying google.com because it answers DNS queries over HTTPS...<p>Look, back when 8.8.8.8 came online I could <i>just smell it</i> ...
