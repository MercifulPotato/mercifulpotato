If you&#x27;re targeting PS4&#x2F;XBox, you know exactly what drivers, software, and graphics stacks are going to be installed. And a Flash replacement doesn&#x27;t exist for any of those devices. So I urge some caution about assuming that the tools you want are going to be quickly built for WASM.<p>In some ways, this is exactly the mistake that HTML5 advocates made with Flash. They assumed that all they needed to do was have APIs, and Adobe would do something to save Flash. But Adobe never really seemed to care. They had some half-hearted efforts to target devices like Android, but the Air runtime was never really good at that, and it didn&#x27;t take over as a cross-platform desktop target the same way that modern Electron has. It seems intuitively obvious that if a cross-platform runtime existed that everyone loved, somebody would make a good graphics stack for it that was easy to use and that didn&#x27;t require programming, but I&#x27;m not 100% certain that&#x27;s actually true.')
