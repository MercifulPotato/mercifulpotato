It makes a lot of scientific rigor readable, and presents a few different, useful viewpoints on how this advances science (Or how we should be careful to over-reach). I especially like the frog story - the bacteria treatment solving the invasive fungus issue only for greater forces to keep their fate the same the next year.<p>A recent obsession has been understanding how much the Earth may be giving us that we don’t really comprehend fully.  One clear item is a reservoir for bio-diversity - all the viruses, bacteria, fungi that we’ve evolved alongside.  Our DNA is littered with battle scars or alliances.  The reason for this interest is in the context of colonizing other planets -  we’ll likely abandon a huge part of our biological history.  This will be good in some ways, such as certain diseases (or pests) no longer being a threat, but also could leave our martian children less adaptable or equipped with fewer tools than their ancestors.')
