It can also have surprisingly good strength to weight ratio if used correctly.<p>I&#x27;m no carpenter but I&#x27;d suspect the downsides are that it&#x27;s biodegradable (and hence it will rot and things will eat it), it&#x27;s a biological material and so its properties are going to be somewhat inconsistent, and it&#x27;s very labour intensive to build with.<p>I&#x27;d also be curious just how cheap it is per strength (not weight or volume) compared with steel. I&#x27;d suspect the comparison comes out heavily in steel&#x27;s favour or we&#x27;d be using way more wood.')
