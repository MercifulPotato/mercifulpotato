However, these days <i>which</i> research receives that scrutiny (along with social media outrage) is mostly a function of what the conclusions of the research are and how those conclusions align with political ideology.<p>A simple thought exercise here is to think about how a research paper with the opposite conclusion would have been  treated. It would have been applauded, shared broadly in social media, and would have gone unchallenged rather than retracted. In short, science has been corrupted by political power because we&#x27;ve let one side exercise the power of censorship and deplatforming.')
