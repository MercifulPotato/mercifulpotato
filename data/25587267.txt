I think the far-right in the US are trying to use &quot;covid was made in a Chinese lab&quot; as a way to build anti-China sentiment and also to dismiss the virus&#x27; impact in a way. Their power comes from garnering votes from people who are swayed by boogie men. Keep in mind, the US ruling class is trying to start a new Cold War with China.<p>Someone mentioned in another comment that some on the left were tying criticism of China with racism, and I&#x27;d like to point out that those identity politics only benefit the right. I think this link is mostly coming from some of the US liberal class (financially well off, lives aren&#x27;t directly affected by election outcomes, centrists, etc.) and not from The Left (socialists, left of Bernie types).<p>Blame a government, not its people. There is plenty of criticism to throw at China without being racist. But if anyone is claiming that blaming China is racist then they are just as misdirected as the people that use criticism of a county to be racist against its people.')
