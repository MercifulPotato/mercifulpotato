I&#x27;ve done a lot of podcasts&#x2F;interviews lately where I touch on this subject.<p>Spotify did indeed take away a lot of the &quot;regular listeners&quot; from music blogs, but they&#x27;re not alone in the downfall of music blogs as a whole. I think a lot of that can be pegged on the way the internet has shifted in general. Music blogs lost a lot of things in that 2013-2015 era, including (but not limited to):<p>- A steep drop in advertising revenue (we used to charge $5+ CPM - but folks learned Google&#x2F;Facebook were far more effective). This wasn&#x27;t specific to the music blogging industry - pretty much all independent publishers went through this.<p>- Google giving 50% of their real-estate for song searches to a giant YouTube thumb. Killed SEO for music blogs overnight.<p>- Technology: Spotify just does music-listening tech better than any independent music blog could ever hope to.<p>So, in an age where Spotify is king and everyone&#x27;s buzzing about TikTok, where do music blogs fit? And are they even relevant?<p>Heck yes they are! Thing is, music blogs are where people actually go to <i>discover music</i>. Spotify, on the flip side, caters toward &quot;passive&quot; listening experiences where they make sure you never have to think about it for yourself.<p>Net result is that for artists a targeted blog promotion campaign is still quite important as it can lead to valuable exposure within the industry: A&amp;R teams at labels, Spotify editorial staff, and festival bookers (RIP) still look to music blogs to do the grunt work of sifting through the 25,000+ new songs coming out daily.<p>In 2015 I launched <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.submithub.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.submithub.com&#x2F;</a> to help music blogs deal with the hundreds of music submissions they were receiving daily. That platform has since taken off - recently passing its 16 millionth submission (in less than 5 years).<p>We allow artists to easily connect with blogs, Spotify playlisters, YouTube channels, Instagram&#x2F;TikTok influencers and more -- and compensate those curators for the time they spend listening to and considering each submission. And believe it or not, one of the most-targeted outlet types on there is still the humble &quot;blog&quot;.<p>I could go on for hours, but I&#x27;ll leave it at that for now :)')
