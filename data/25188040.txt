Item(by='mbseid', descendants=1, kids=[25188067], score=2, time=1606146846, title='Show HN: Familio â€“ Private Family Platform (Contacts, Newsletters, Photos)', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi HN,<p>I wanted to share with y&#x27;all Familio(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;familio.life&#x2F;), a private family hub for your contacts, photos, newsletters and recipes. For the last two years I have been using Familio and now it&#x27;s now ready to share for everyone else to enjoy. Not only is Familio a management software for your contacts, photos and recipes but also Familio provides automated workflows to do the tasks you do all the time. All in one platform, you can request friends to update their addresses, share recipes via email or send family update newsletters with a photo album.<p>Enough sales pitch, I wanted to instead focus on why I have built Familio. As I have gotten older, gotten married, and starting to build a family, it has become important to save your core family in a private place. It started off with shared Google Docs and Facebook albums. While these tools worked, it became hard to manage everything and with every automated tool came the question around privacy. I have been consistently trying to get myself off Facebook and each other tool I found was free meaning they would be selling my data. So I decided to build my own platform for the common needs for my family. Thus, Familio was born.<p>There are no analytics, no third party JavaScript and no integrations with external SaaS tools(besides Postmark for sending email). Your data stays secure within the Familio platform just for you and your Family.<p>Lastly, Familio costs $5 a month. Why? Because this allows me to covers the systems costs and ensures your data is safe and secure. If you made it this far, use the coupon HOLIDAYCARD for your first two months free so you can try it out.<p>Please let me know if you have any feedback. Looking forward to hearing what you think.<p>Thanks,<p>Mike Seid')
