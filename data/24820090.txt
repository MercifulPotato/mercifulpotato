The paper linked in the article [1] doesn&#x27;t really explain how they are doing this.<p>EDIT:  this article [2] explains the system in a bit more detail.   For a sense of the scale of forest vs the wastewater supply, it&#x27;s a city of 400K people whose wastewater is supporting a .78 square mile  &quot;forest&quot;.   So it&#x27;s really more like a large park.  It&#x27;s a great demonstration nonetheless, especially if it can be a productive source of food for the city.<p>1. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fao.org&#x2F;forestry&#x2F;35800-094f4eedb0c86a4a33be1a3d906d80d3f.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fao.org&#x2F;forestry&#x2F;35800-094f4eedb0c86a4a33be1a3d90...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intelligentliving.co&#x2F;egyptian-desert-forest-recycled-sewage-water&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intelligentliving.co&#x2F;egyptian-desert-forest-recy...</a>')
