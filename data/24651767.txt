Some usb will charge my phone very slowly, maybe at 3w.  Some will charge what I call &#x27;medium&#x27;, at around 15w, and some at 30w.  And the charger that came with it is its own special usb-c thing that isn&#x27;t standards compliant.  I noticed that cord doesn&#x27;t even attempt to charge my Stadia controller.  Sure, they all do plugin and most do charge.  But have fun guessing which ones charge at which speed.')
