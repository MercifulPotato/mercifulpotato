Perhaps one started off making $7&#x2F;hr, but that&#x27;s just where one was at that point in time. At a later time both skills and safety net will increase. At that point quitting Google is still a risk, but circumstances are much different now. Transitioning into software is already a leap, but if one has already done that and has the skills&#x2F;safety-net&#x2F;desire to be their own boss -- why not take the next leap?')
