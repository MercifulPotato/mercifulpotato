I check billing and the things at 30usd in a single day, from a norm of &lt;1usd per month, so it&#x27;s showing a 13,000% increase (this is for documentation of open source projects). I&#x27;m writing their support and at the mercy so to speak - technically I ran up the bill. I ended up paying up, but I secretly hoped I&#x27;d get some AWS credits for the projects, heh<p>Aside: Amazon has some nice features for rule-based alarms on accounts so when you spend more than X dollars, you get an email.')
