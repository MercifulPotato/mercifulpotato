Item(by='rurban', descendants=None, kids=[25536632], score=None, time=1608901318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25531124, text='The report fails to address the non-importance of a new variant.<p>Every single new infection introduces around 3 new mutations into the derived virii to infect others in the next 5 days. Around 95% of these mutations are deletions, leading to less severity and higher transmissibility. So why is now higher transmissibility newsworthy? Do they report that a rice bag fell to ground in China? No, obviously not.<p>So if we estimate around 2 million infections so far, we can estimate 15 million mutations, if which around 6m infected someone. So they caught 2 of those 6m in Africa. Great reporting! They could have caught them in their local hospital also. Hundreds!')
