Otherwise &quot;Let&#x27;s Play Videos&quot; on YouTube would not be possible(and they actually show all the content in the game, while this shows single screenshots). Same goes for games review sites, Metacritic, game wikis etc that all have screenshots. It&#x27;s definitely not in the interest of a game publisher to disallow the internet to show off their game, but they probably can&#x27;t legally stop it either way.')
