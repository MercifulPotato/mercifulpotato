I&#x27;ve used them all via both vim-fireplace and now Conjure. But I&#x27;m sure we wouldn&#x27;t have been in the same place without them.<p>If you&#x27;re around Bozhidar, thanks a lot for your endless supply of love and time to the Clojure community, it&#x27;s a lot better and well-maintained because of you (and others).')
