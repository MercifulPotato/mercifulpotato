I’m not gunna be like USA is an amazing place but there is some derangement syndrome going on about how people think life is like in different countries. People actually believe Europe is this perfect establishment and USA is a death sentence for black men. Europeans are crazy as Americans lmao. It’s just you need to compare USA to all of Europe and suddenly the differences in how people\nAct are less. And this is my theory, I garuntee random Americans are kinder and more generous than a random European. I would be willing to put money\nOn that')
