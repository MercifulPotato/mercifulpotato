It&#x27;s unlikely that Apple will eliminate their &quot;slow&quot; cores from their desktops. Mac Pros spend big chunks of their time doing mundane things which their efficiency cores do just fine. By using their efficiency cores, they can bring down total power requirements and their desktops can essentially run continually as opposed to entering a dedicated sleep more.<p>I suspect the Mac Pro will sip power and run cool as a cucumber most of the time when it&#x27;s not getting hammered for high end tasks.')
