You legally must have:\n- one person who opens the envelope containing the ballot and unfolds it\n- one who reads out loud the ballot\n- at least two who write down what the person above said<p>And all that is supervised by the same people who were manning the polling station (at least 4 them).<p>So it becomes a lot harder not to trust humans when you have at least 4 persons who saw the ballot and a couple others observing if everything is being done as expected.')
