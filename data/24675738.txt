Talking about single person choices is disingenuous. There is an industry around building houses where they shouldn&#x27;t be. The entire zoning, tax and development system is broken, cities depend on building permits for income because they can&#x27;t effectively tax existing lots. And basically, no one pays for the real cost of exurban sprawl till the whole thing burns up in a forest fire.')
