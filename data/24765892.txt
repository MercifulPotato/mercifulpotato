Apple, for example, will have clout.<p>But long-term I think the cloud providers will assimilate so much power that the embedded side will follow its diktats.<p>Big iron mainframes have longevity, but will absolutely die out close to complete extinction - I&#x27;ve worked on those systems, I understand their strengths and the legacy issues, and there&#x27;s no way that cloud isn&#x27;t going to gobble up that market, it&#x27;s just going to take a long time (as you say, beyond 2030).')
