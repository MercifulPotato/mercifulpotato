There are a lot of different game modes for CoD -- Cold War has <i>eleven</i> game modes. This means that the pool of players for each mode will be smaller, making fair matchmaking more difficult.<p>2. Some of those game modes have unusually large teams -- two of the signature game modes in Cold War have ten or more players to a team. This makes it more difficult for a matchmaking algorithm to fairly assess any individual player&#x27;s contribution to their team&#x27;s win&#x2F;loss. It also makes it more likely that one or more teams will contain a player whose skill has been poorly assessed, meaning that their team has an unfair advantage or disadvantage.')
