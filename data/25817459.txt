Often I am also learning about them from the interview. Because, after all you are interviewing them as well. You’re <i>NOT</i> sure you want to work there yet :)<p>My first job I was curious because they were located in a college town, not a big city, and lots of friends worked there. The company had a long history &gt; 100 years (which I was learning about on the interview). That long engineering legacy was another reason I appreciated before accepting the offer.<p>My last job, while I was more senior, I reached out to them and said in my email why I might want to work there. But that was just my initial sense. I also spent time learning about the people and the company and my role. I was asking them “why do you want me” in the same way I was asking “why do I want them”.')
