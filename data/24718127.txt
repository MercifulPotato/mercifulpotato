The interference should mean that there&#x27;s less acoustic energy, but since the anti-sound wave won&#x27;t always be a perfect match with the wave being cancelled I suspect the result is that there will be soft beats[0] of very high and&#x2F;or low frequency that may still stimulate the ear in a way to trigger tinnitus. The first time I put on my noise-cancelling headphones it made me dizzy - that is also likely caused by low-frequency beats.<p>Anyway, I just lowered the volume, that seemed to help quite a bit. I don&#x27;t need the higher volume anyway now that the surrounding noises are cancelled.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Beat_(acoustics)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Beat_(acoustics)</a>')
