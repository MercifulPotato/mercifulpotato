Ken White, a former federal prosecutor, wrote a sort-of-famous blog post about this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popehat.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;05&#x2F;crime-whale-sushi-sentence-eleventy-million-years&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.popehat.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;05&#x2F;crime-whale-sushi-sentenc...</a><p>35 years is a &quot;whale sushi sentence&quot;. You have multiple ways of knowing it&#x27;s false, if you dig in: again, Swartz&#x27;s lawyer, the prosecutors own statements, and a straightforward reading of the sentencing guidelines (2B.1).<p>A particularly important detail of how sentencing works: charges group. The press releases often imply that you might serve time on every count, but in reality, in almost all circumstances, you serve the sentence associated with the most severe count.<p>The TechDirt article makes the same mistake. TechDirt has gotten better over the last few years; Mike Masnick got tight with the Ken White &#x2F; Popehat scene, and I assume they get feedback now on legal stuff. But that article is exactly the kind of thing what White is talking about when he says that the media bears some culpability in people&#x27;s misunderstanding of how sentencing works.<p>To be clear: all I&#x27;m litigating is whether Swartz faced a &quot;lifetime&quot; in prison --- or, for that matter, any double-digit-years sentence whatsoever. I&#x27;m not qualified to evaluate the sentencing guidelines, but my layperson read of the guidelines results in Swartz facing 1-2 years if he&#x27;d been convicted on everything. You shouldn&#x27;t take my word for it at all, but do note that my reading lines up with what Swartz&#x27;s attorney said as well.')
