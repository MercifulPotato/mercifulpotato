It&#x27;s not like there is a strong definition, or that everyone identifies the same with it. It&#x27;s also not helpful to personify a vague group of even more groups (of business entities) and then assume they all had some concerted &#x27;hand to play&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s possible that there is some emergent behaviour in markets with large companies and it might even seem like it&#x27;s a single &#x27;person&#x27;, but it&#x27;s not and it makes discussing specifics really hard. Perhaps it&#x27;s an american thing, but it seems really odd looking from the outside in.')
