This makes it usable, not just recallable. It&#x27;s holographic, in that I can also recover it from other things I know, like the shape of the missing jigsaw piece, or a theorem or proof.<p>However, I&#x27;ve come to realize that the very act of engagement to understand is, in itself, aiding memorization.')
