Or maybe the problem is that it&#x27;s a little _too_ serious of a bicycle.<p>$400 for just some tubes, glue, and dropouts, plus another $800-$2500 for the other parts needed to turn the frame into an actual bicycle, plus however much you value several days of labor, and then from their FAQ...<p>&gt; <i>How long will a bamboo bike frame last?
