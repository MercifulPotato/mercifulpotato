Currency debasement is the engine that creates wealth inequality.  The Catillion effect means that people who get the newly printed money (eg wall street) benefit from it, while the regular people only pay the cost via reduced purchasing power.<p>Bitcoin is really a savings technology that allows people to escape debased currencies, like the zimbabwe dollar or the Venezuelan peso.<p>It also has censorship features and other useful properties, but this is the aspect most at odds with the assumptions in your post that the other user apparently disliked.')
