But do you have to spend 5 years grinding out only C code? No.<p>Spend some time with C and learn the basics, do some experiments, and then learn Rust concurrently. It&#x27;s not like you have to pick one or the other. You can be proficient with C while still becoming more fluent with Rust over time.')
