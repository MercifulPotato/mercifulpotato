If it was just about the API code, there wouldn&#x27;t even be a case.<p>The idea that an API <i>could</i> legally be an &quot;original work of authorship&quot; makes a lot of sense; but the technical implications could indeed harm the industry overall.<p>Essentially what this means is: I build a system, you&#x27;re not allowed to build a compatible system. Yet another reason why open source is the only way forward.')
