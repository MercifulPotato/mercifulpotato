Some people wedge Microsoft into the acronym and&#x2F;or leave out other letters. And Netflix&#x27;s product on the face of it is certainly what we would consider a feature for most big software companies (and indeed many of them have a competing streaming service). If, for instance, Netflix significantly declines in popularity in the next few years, we might just drop it from &quot;FAANG,&quot; and someone might still say &quot;When you are against GAFAM every product is just a feature.&quot;')
