EU only personally sanctioned him.<p>&gt;there was a Security Council resolution banning him from traveling outside Iran<p>These restrictions were lifted in 2015 as part of the Iran nuclear deal framework. US unilateral withdrawal didn&#x27;t change the fact that UN sanctions have been lifted.<p>&gt;Their call was non binding since the agreement was with the Iraqi government<p>The call was aimed at the government, which due to the US pressure ignored will of the Iraqi people represented by the democratically elected parliament.<p>&gt;since ISIS still exists<p>ISIS got chance to exist mostly due to the US chaotic meddling in the region. Not only it weakened Iraq by direct invasion, but it also fueled the Syrian civil war. Syria is perfectly able to not let ISIS reappearance with the Russian help and negotiated relationship with the Kurds, but I don&#x27;t see the US leaving Syria any time soon.')
