The largest asset management firm on Earth holds over 9 million Gamestop stock, none of the big banks that received bailouts in 08 are affected by this, 99.9% of hedge funds are not affected by this, high frequency traders are probably making a bundle. Institutional money was long Gamestop before this story entered the public consciousness. The idea of governments stepping in to bolster hedge funds is ludicrous, the whole point is that the government and SEC is hands off with them.<p>Ultimately, a few medium-sized hedge funds were caught doing something stupid and the market has rightfully taught them a lesson. It&#x27;s great that retail investors got in on a high-level play like this and made money.')
