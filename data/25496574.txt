A maid in Singapore will run on the order of $10-20k per year. Cost depends on standard of living and the maids country of origin, with discounts given if there is an elderly dependent  in the household. This is an amount of money well within the ability of US dual income households to afford. I&#x27;d go so far as to say that economically it&#x27;s a no brainer if such an option were available.')
