The United States is, after all, not the most populous country in the world.<p>The GP was arguing that per-capita deaths should replace total deaths.  In context, your argument is &quot;Total deaths are a useful metric and should be included, because the US is not the most populous country.&quot;  Maybe it&#x27;s true, but the argument is non-sequitur.  As we all know, the real reason total deaths is a useful metric is that pancakes are delicious.<p>Also, the GP was explicitly arguing that the US is the largest of the 18 surveyed countries, which gives an implicit nod to the US not being the largest country in the world.<p>Edit: changed OP to GP.')
