Even modern automobiles are only momentarily disrupted, if at all, by significant pulses produced in a controlled test setting. As I understand it, common measures taken to protect vehicle electronics against electro-static discharge (ESD) also provide some level of protection against EMP attack. Your mileage may vary with commercial off-the-shelf drones, of course, but itâ€™s not an expensive or difficult technology to retrofit.<p>My understanding derives chiefly from a U.S. government-commissioned study on the effects of an EMP weapon or natural disaster on things like cars, trucks, airplanes and computers.
