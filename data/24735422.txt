Cultural differences are challenges that cost time, money and effort to overcome.  Sometimes it&#x27;s not worth it.<p>I will also add that it&#x27;s kind of sad that you imply that people who just live according to their culture are &quot;less good&quot;, or &quot;cheaper&quot;, or &quot;less experienced&quot;. Price and cost have nothing to do with it. It is normal for people to live and behave the way they&#x27;ve been taught.')
