It&#x27;s a tad DIY if you want the bar, and also if you are a really high end player you might need to mod it with the arduino hack, but out of the box it&#x27;s good for most players.<p>The StepManiaX stage isn&#x27;t a wait list, it&#x27;s the opposite with first come first serve and literally sells out in ~20 seconds every time a batch goes on sale. I have one and can attest it&#x27;s absolutely spot on and worth the hassle though.')
