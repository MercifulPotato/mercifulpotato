It would be folly for me to guess. Still, the notion of intelligent design explaining the awesome complexity of life by waiving it away with an additional, spontaneous and inexplicable divine entity of essentially infinite complexity just occurring out of nowhere makes even less sense to me personally than the spontaneous existence of a &quot;basic&quot; &quot;unguided&quot; universe with the potential for cumulative selection to cause complex life independently of a guiding hand. Intelligent design postulates that a divine entity spontaneously existed and all complexity is the result of that entity, whereas evolution explains complexity via long term cumulative selection. I struggle to rationalize the spontaneous complexity that intelligent design must justify.')
