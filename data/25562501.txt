Hence the current situation where residents cost more in services than they bring in in property taxes, incentivizing cities to attract businesses and wiggle out of their responsibility to build more housing units.<p>A good illustration of this dynamic is “RHNA” \nprocess for allocating housing unit quotas to each city in California. it is a very conflictual process where city councils typically fight tooth and nail to get their quotas reduced.
