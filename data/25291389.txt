I absolutely wear a mask indoors in stores etc. And I&#x27;ll pull up a mask&#x2F;neck gaiter outdoors if I&#x27;m approaching other people, even if I&#x27;ll be somewhat distanced from them, especially if they are wearing masks. But, no, I don&#x27;t if I&#x27;m on deserted forest trails or if I&#x27;m 50 feet away from anyone else.<p>I&#x27;ve <i>rarely</i> eaten at an outdoor restaurant since March, I haven&#x27;t eaten indoors at all, and have been generally minimizing trips to stores so I&#x27;m conservative. But I&#x27;m not going to do something just to send a signal that I&#x27;m a &quot;good&quot; person.')
