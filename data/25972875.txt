Astra Zeneca can ship them wherever they want based on contractual and legal practices. Those are privately owned AstraZeneca facilities. The idea that you can separate out &quot;EU money&quot; within a private company is also ridiculous.<p>If the EU wants to start playing games then other countries and corporations will simply remove the EU from supply chains etc. Japan and South Korea for example trusted that normal contractual and legal practices would be followed when they ordered vaccines produced in the EU, and are now publicly stating their concern.<p>Do you think they&#x27;ll ever trust the EU again if it tries to violate their contractual rights on the moronic grounds that &quot;they were made in the EU therefore they belong to the EU&quot;?')
