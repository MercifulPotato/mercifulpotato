Sure there&#x27;s gonna be days, weeks or even months worth of really cool stuff you&#x27;d work on, but majority of your career is going to be spent on mindless, completely soul sucking work while also dealing with other aspects of working with other human beings. Let&#x27;s just put it this way, cool problems that need solving are rare. And 99% of the solution for those cool problems are gonna be not so cool.<p>Not everyone gets to build a rocket to Mars, even if you work at SpaceX. Some sucker is gonna have to write a shitty internal facing utility that everyone hates and no one uses, because that&#x27;s part of the larger &quot;cool&quot; endeavor of sending people to Mars.')
