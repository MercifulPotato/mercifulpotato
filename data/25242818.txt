I&#x27;ve actually seen all combinations on the spectrum of fun work  &#x2F; BS work (e.g. calling your engineers at night because something on a web page mostly used in the same time zone is not pixel perfect and being mad in the morning they were not available); young &#x2F; old; and doing good work &#x2F; crappy work while at it.<p>So there&#x27;s definitely something genuine to it, but many more have to fake it. I am working at a place where you don&#x27;t have to fake it nearly at all and very happy about it...<p>Think about it... it might seem unfair, &quot;unfair&quot; towards e.g. me. I&#x27;m usually only passionate if the work happens to be very interesting for me in particular, otherwise I&#x27;m going to do good work with passion about quality&#x2F;etc., but only 9-6, after which I&#x27;ll go be passionate about other things.<p>But, I&#x27;ve worked with quite a few engineers similar to me in ability, or better, who would totally work 14 hours a day for no reason, no pressure or crunch. If a business had a choice, why would they hire me over these guys?')
