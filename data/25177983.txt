We don&#x27;t talk about it a lot, because talking about things working isn&#x27;t all that interesting. We don&#x27;t talk about it when things don&#x27;t work, because the failure isn&#x27;t the language but the design.<p>We don&#x27;t talk about COBOL so much as we talk with COBOL. I have email after email with COBOL snippets discussing various projects (and I&#x27;m an analyst here, not a programmer). No one mentions COBOL by name, but almost anyone, even nonprogrammers, understand it to a degree that they can reason about what is happening and point out errors in the assumptions made by the programmer.<p>There are IVRs that talk to mainframes via tn3270 to execute CICS transactions. Most CICS programs are written in COBOL. There are external websites, internal web applications, even VBA macros that rely on tn3270 and CICS, thus COBOL.<p>While other languages may dominate the business of languages, COBOL dominates the business of business.')
