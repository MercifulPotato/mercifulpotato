You seem to be saying that the &quot;cost of storage&quot; numbers already include averaging the storage cost between storage and not storage, but I can&#x27;t get anything like that to work our to reasonably plausible numbers. Check page 8 of the PDF of their very slightly  fuller explanation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451418&#x2F;lazards-levelized-cost-of-storage-version-60.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451418&#x2F;lazards-levelized-cost-o...</a><p>The project is cheaper than wholesale arbitrage because they don&#x27;t have to pay wholesale prices to charge the battery, inverters are used for multiple purposes, and most PV solar designs already throw away some electricity, so that&#x27;s free.<p>Also on that page, doing some napkin math on the project lifetime MWh of 1,260,000, and the purchase price of $600-$1000&#x2F;kWh is higher than most grid batteries deployed these days. These are very conservative numbers!<p>Lazard&#x27;s numbers are difficult to compare to most actual storage payment contracts, because every one I&#x27;ve seen is structured around paying for capacity, in kW-months, rather than straight payments for every MWh of energy dumped on the grid. But the capacity payments end up working out to numbers that are on the low end of Lazard&#x27;s cost estimates when translated.')
