Scott wasn&#x27;t getting it so Joe said &quot;no.. no, type cat slash proc slash cpuinfo&quot; and eventually got on the keyboard himself.&quot;\nThis part really resonated with me. I always find it hard to tell commands to people. Anyway I never reach for their keyboard. I try to take the blame myself for not spelling out the command correcty, this way they don&#x27;t feel mistaken and take a defensive stance.')
