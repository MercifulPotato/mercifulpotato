They generally just throw compute at the problem, attempt to acquire every possible satellite at every possible location in parallel, and then download all their ephemeris data in parallel (which is more precise than the almanac, but only available once you&#x27;ve actually acquired the satellite). Makes the almanac kind of redundant, and typical acquisition time is anout 45 seconds doing it that way since the ephemeris data is broadcast much more often.')
