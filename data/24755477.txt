It has a wealth of information, experts and allows for larger questions to be asked than &quot;How do I write to a file&quot;, like, &quot;how would you design this database schema&quot;.<p>Googling questions brings me to stack overflow which has years worth of information, and answers to all of these how do I do X with Y questions, along with links to the documentation. Why would I want to use this site rather than stack overflow, what does it do differently? If SO has everything your site has plus more, (and lets be honest, SO has answers for those questions), I don&#x27;t see the benefit here.<p>&gt;  I personally am not a Python developer and just seeded some initial snippets<p>While I understand why this is done, this is exactly the issue. The code you have right now is wrong, but stack overflow&#x27;s is correct.')
