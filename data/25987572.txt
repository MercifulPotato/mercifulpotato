I did write a wiki engine where the editing is done with sed commands and all responses are text&#x2F;gemini. It works but people used to modern web apps are not going to love the UX.<p>You <i>can</i> serve other mimetypes over gemini (the protocol). That&#x27;s useful for some use cases (eg. ansi.hrtk.in serves modem download emulated versions of ANSI art; requires a streaming-capable client).<p>But all in all, Gemini tries hard to <i>not</i> be an application platform. These exercises in stretching the limits are fun and IIRC have also guided the development of the spec. But the focus of the project is on text-based content.')
