His position as founder&#x2F;CEO of SpaceX lets him actually work towards making that dream a reality.  You or I can dream all we want but we can&#x27;t make them reality.  If this is something you care about, then he&#x27;s clearly successful in ways that we aren&#x27;t, that are directly attributable solely to his role as wealthy person&#x2F;founder.')
