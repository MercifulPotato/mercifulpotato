Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607600851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25370296, text='&gt; If Reese doesn&#x27;t get to collect $400 then this bet is an academic wankathon.<p>You know, there is a conflict of interest. It was Reese that created the academic wankathon in the first place.<p>The bet is a sure win if he had predicted 1 million casualties through a virus. However that&#x27;s not what he did. He added extra restrictions that decrease the probability of his bet turning out to be true. The challenger is obviously taking those restrictions into account and thereby estimates that it is easier for the challenger to win. If you now go and change the terms so that the restrictions are gone then if the predictor wins he has merely won through deception. A shallow victory that undermines longbets as a platform.')
