As a person who has tried twice and failed both times, I totally agree there is no easy path.   There are however, <i>lower difficulty</i> paths and those paths lead to better outcomes for entrepreneurs.<p>If you keep at it, are smart, have good ideas and execute, I think you can probably build an equivalent network over time that leads to success.
