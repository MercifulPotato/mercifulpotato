Item(by='runarberg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609887936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25651879, text='&gt; Shifting sunrise forward an hour would result in a dramatic quality of life increase for most people.<p>These claims need to be backed up by data as there is a conflicting claim that potential sleep deprivation caused by the offset would negate these benefits.<p>The fact that school already starts too early, makes me doubt that changing to a permanent DST would magically fix that. In fact I would argue that it would make the problem worse. Much more robust is to move to standard time.<p>I think most people actually prefer sleeping through the first hour of sunlight, and would continue doing so given the choice. I think it is only exceptional that people wake up earlier to enjoy longer part of the day, e.g. during a vacation. During the everyday life I think most people would naturally prefer starting their day with the sunrise (as opposed to before). And in fact I believe there are health implications in forcing people to do otherwise. Not with everybody, but with significant enough portion of the population that it would be unwise to force it on everybody.<p>Your point about school hours being independent of the rest of the population is naive. Parents life syncs with their kids as they prefer to be working while their kids are in school, cities set bus schedules according to school hours, businesses open in accordance to when school is over, etc. Peoples lives are heavily depended on school hours.')
