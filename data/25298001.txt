To me, it&#x27;s simply an interesting topic to discuss.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure Amsterdam is an accurate reference point.<p>1) Size. Was Amsterdam spending $1B fighting drugs?<p>2) We&#x27;re not talking about cocaine being legalized, we&#x27;re talking about the gov getting in the coke biz. The latter is a significant change in paradigm.<p>3) What are the unintended consequences? When that $1B spent on &quot;fighting it&quot; stops, what happens? Jobs lost? Etc.?<p>Note: I&#x27;m not suggesting it&#x27;s a bad idea per se, only that it&#x27;s more complicated than &quot;X works in Country Y.&quot;')
