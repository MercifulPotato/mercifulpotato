Low center of gravity is key.<p>&quot;In addition to its near 50&#x2F;50 weight distribution, Model 3 was also designed with an extremely low polar moment of inertia, which means that its heaviest components are located closer to the car’s center of gravity.<p>Even though Model 3 has no engine, its performance is similar to what’s described as a “mid-engine car” due to its centered battery pack (the heaviest component of the car) and the fact that Model 3’s rear motor is placed slightly in front of the rear axle rather than behind it.<p>Not only does this architecture add to the overall agility and handling of the car, it also improves the capability of stability control by minimizing rotational kinetic energy.&quot;<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;model-3-lowest-probability-injury-any-vehicle-ever-tested-nhtsa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;model-3-lowest-probability-injury...</a><p>This also has some safety benefits such as low rollover risk:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L24xzJkCGdk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L24xzJkCGdk</a>')
