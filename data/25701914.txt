A few buildings were burned down in isolated incidents during several months of protests across multiple cities.</i><p>That&#x27;s neither here nor there. I didn&#x27;t say &quot;burning for months&quot; (e.g. the same fires keep burning for months), I said &quot;burning and looting for months&quot;, that is incidents of burnings and lootings occuring for months. There have been dozens, if not hundreds, and have lasted (not each individual, the case of them popping has lasted) for months...<p>&gt;<i>The vast majority of participants in the protests following the Floyd murder did not take part in any violence. It is all but certain that the fraction who did is much smaller than the fraction of 1&#x2F;6&#x2F;21 protestors who illegally entered the Capitol.</i><p>That&#x27;s not certain at all. The videos show a totally different story.<p>&gt;<i>Looting is not well-documented but my friends in Portland didn&#x27;t seem very concerned.</i><p>Many of those in favor aren&#x27;t, especially if they live outside of the affected radius.')
