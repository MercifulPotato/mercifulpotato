Things link dotfiles in home and ~&#x2F;.ssh should certainly not be accessible or editable by a sandboxed application without knowledge.<p>I think the Downloads, Documents and Movies folders people tend to have etc. those major sub-folders would be enough for normal use.<p>Also, perhaps file type limits could be imposed that mean at that files are only accessible to apps that can open them. Of course, I&#x27;d want my text editor to be able to open files across root file system, if I open it as root - so I can see how quickly a person can want sandboxing, and then also want none - but the less apps with privileged access, the better.<p>Also I think some people had hopes it would be closer to IOS level sandboxing, which is heavily restricted on file access, and frankly can be annoying because of it, but does have the security benefit at least.<p>Also, the security update gripe is significant. The isolation of packages only matters if it works. Like at least if I run stuff myself inside container, I can choose to update the underlying OS and force certain packages etc. at the same time as sandboxing, and mount only certain folders if I actually need them.<p>I think it&#x27;s hard to make it both simple for users and powerful enough provide the levels of granular access I&#x27;d expect for context specific sandboxing. I would want a principle of least required privilege, with some ability to escalate it (like Android asks me all the time if I want to allow software to do stuff at point of the privilege being required).<p>I had high hopes for Flatpack, Elementary OS went all in on it for a better way to deliver their curated apps. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.elementary.io&#x2F;elementary-appcenter-flatpak&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.elementary.io&#x2F;elementary-appcenter-flatpak&#x2F;</a><p>I guess though, they curate and approve the apps, so perhaps they are able to make certain assurances that are not universal to Flatpak availability.')
