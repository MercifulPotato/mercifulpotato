Or -6.<p>RISC-V is pretty close, so work on verifying -V should mostly carry over to -6. A MIPS engineer posted a list, recently, of errata that mostly would not be hard to fix, such as (IIRC) having separate opcodes for call and return so the microarchitecture can optimize them independently.<p>I would add making the ABI bool true value ~0 instead of 1; and a POPCNT instruction in the base set, not dependent on a big &quot;bitmanip&quot; extension package.<p>The extensions infrastructure is itself a problem, illustrated by the last point. Often, certain key parts of an extension are disproportionately useful, but you don&#x27;t get the sink without a whole kitchen attached.<p>We probably won&#x27;t get a new mainstream architecture for decades, so it is worth getting this one right before too much is committed. It would be disruptive to try to fix -V, but -6 work can go on in parallel.')
