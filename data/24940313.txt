Money is a promise, so a form of a contract, and promises or contracts cannot be meaningfully duplicated, so they are scarce.<p>Recordings of thoughts can be duplicated at will, and so are not scarce.<p>Before someone points out that money is a recording of a promise, I&#x27;ll mention that multiple recordings of a contract don&#x27;t make multiple contracts :)<p>&gt; So the thing that these licenses are doing is slapping on a &quot;price&quot; at a strange step in the pipelineâ€“but only because copyright law is strange that way<p>If the law is strange, maybe abolishing is a reasonable reaction? We could conceivably have laws placed at a better step in the pipeline.')
