In all of the mask discussions, there should be more focus on the kind of life we want and less on the science of masks. I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that masks have immediate infection control benefits, and always will.<p>But it&#x27;s a perfectly valid opinion that the benefits do not outweigh the societal impact of treating each other like infection vectors instead of having normal social behavior (as well as the option to wear a mask or stay away from people if your priorities are different).<p>I would rather risk death than live the rest of my life in a bubble, and there needs to be more of a discussion of what people value and the tradeoffs we&#x27;re making.')
