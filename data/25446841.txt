Item(by='antognini', descendants=None, kids=[25447197, 25447254], score=None, time=1608145266, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444069, text='I&#x27;m another astrophysicist who left academia for industry and this post definitely speaks to me.  I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that I regret my decision to leave academia, but I will admit to wondering what could have been if I had stayed.  After getting my PhD I had a postdoc position lined up with a professor I was excited to work with and had won the NSF astronomy &amp; astrophysics postdoctoral fellowship.  (It&#x27;s not the most prestigious fellowship in astronomy, but it&#x27;s not too far down the list, depending on your sub-field.)<p>My feeling at the time was that I was a good enough researcher that getting postdoc positions probably wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, so I could stay in the field for another ~6--8 years if I wanted to.  And if my research had gone well in those jobs there was a <i>reasonable</i> chance (say, 50-50) that I could get a tenure-track job <i>somewhere</i>.  But I wasn&#x27;t super comfortable with that risk along with having very little freedom as to where I would live.  (Having a two-body problem didn&#x27;t help either.)  I also factored in the opportunity cost of staying, say, ~8 years in postdoc roles before switching to industry and figured that if there was a good chance that I was going to leave academia eventually, I should do it sooner rather than later.  Part of this was motivated by some researchers I interacted with who were really smart, did great research, but just kept jumping from postdoc to postdoc and couldn&#x27;t land anything permanent.<p>While I do miss the astro research, I have learned a <i>lot</i> from industry that I would never have even known existed had I stayed in astronomy.  (This may be more a function of working at a startup than industry work in general.)  I&#x27;m not sure what work OP is doing specifically, but the industry work I&#x27;ve been doing has been pretty fulfilling.  It helps that I&#x27;ve mostly been working on applying ML to health technology.  Industry is a big place!  There is a lot of fulfilling work out there even if it can take time to find it.')
