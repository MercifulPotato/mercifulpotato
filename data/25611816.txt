I didn&#x27;t say it was deliberate!!!!<p>The argument is that they were profoundly negligent.<p>As for the lab side of things, the argument is that it was an accidental release (as happened multiple times with SARS 1).<p>My point is whether or not it walked out of the lab (by ACCIDENT) given they knew in 2003 that certain things were major risks, they should have come down on them like a ton of bricks. The fact they re-opened wet markets and took no further steps to tackle that makes them responsible through negligence.')
