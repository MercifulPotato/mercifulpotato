Item(by='kristoff_it', descendants=None, kids=[25623077], score=None, time=1609693321, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620733, text='Hey overflyer, thank you for the kind words, and the criticism too.<p>What you&#x27;re asking is absolutely reasonable and I agree that these are things that should exist. The blocker (for the things that I control &#x2F; can contribute to) is mostly effort and resulting value.<p>I considered the idea of working on a book that would do a proper introduction. It&#x27;s something that would be useful, without a doubt, but the problem is that it would take a lot of effort and time (given my current skillset) and it would take away from other possibilities that in my estimate would be more cost-effective for the project.<p>So the TLDR is that we&#x27;re genuinely thinking constantly of what&#x27;s the next best move to make and, given the situation the project is right now, we think other things have to take priority. Of course we could be making a wrong estimate, so we&#x27;re open to discussing it, but we have to follow the path of least resistance, which means making temporary compromises.<p>My bet is that if we play our cards well there will be enough skilled communicators interested in writing Zig programming manuals, we just have to get there first :)<p>I also want one day to write a book on comptime, hopefully it won&#x27;t take too long!')
