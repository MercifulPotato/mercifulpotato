It&#x27;s one of the assistance features, just like warning if someone stops in front of you and you don&#x27;t seem to be reacting. These features also get better as Autopilot gets improved with less of the nasty edge cases. So even if you don&#x27;t trust Autopilot, Tesla&#x27;s improvement of the system over time is still useful in improving those other assistance features.')
