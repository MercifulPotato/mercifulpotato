Imagine someone saying this in the &#x27;50s:<p>&gt; There&#x27;s a lot of media that uses caricatures to vilify [Blacks], but there is relatively little uproar from [Blacks] about it.  They don&#x27;t seem to be very sensitive apart from a small handful...<p>I assure you, Christians are aware of how poorly they&#x27;re portrayed by the media, and aren&#x27;t happy about it.  It seems to me that this is one of many factors that led many Christians to support Trump.<p>&quot;Representation matters&quot; -- indeed it does; and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen anyone on TV or in movies that looks like me or the people in my church.  Even when they&#x27;re trying to put people in a positive light, you can tell that it&#x27;s someone trying to guess what it&#x27;s like from the outside, not someone who understands it from the inside.')
