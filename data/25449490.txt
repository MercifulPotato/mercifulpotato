Or if not having &quot;the&quot; thing figured out, have <i>something at all</i> figured out. This is dangerous for me because my mindset is that if I&#x27;m not spending most of my time on something, I will not be able to believe I&#x27;m &quot;taking it seriously.&quot; From past experience, the end results of not spending enough time on what I did say as much. It is hard for me to leave my tunnel vision and see other things. (I have evidence this can be partially explained by a mental health diagnosis, but it isn&#x27;t an excuse.)<p>As typical, this is probably amplified by social media. Look at people&#x27;s Twitter bios and look at how many describing words they use. Artist. Musician. Writer. Livestreamer. Some of these people got started when they were not even teenagers. As a result it&#x27;s difficult not to feel as if you haven&#x27;t found the words you&#x27;d be comfortable putting in your own bio. Why label yourself as such and such if you don&#x27;t feel like you deserve it yet? (At least not to the extent that you see people&#x27;s best selves being portrayed in their feeds.)<p>But of course, ignoring comparisons to others, if those people found themselves there at some point, there would probablybe no reason not to write those words describing themselves. I end up believing I can only &quot;find myself there&quot; by deliberate action, not casually following a passion until you happen to arrive where you want. Everybody says memorable accomplishments require hard work.')
