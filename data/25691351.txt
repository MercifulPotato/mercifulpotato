It&#x27;s very good that I can protest out front without worrying about that unfriendly man with his finger by the trigger to the Browning M2.<p>And yet your government offices abroad (embassies) are the most fortified I&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>I&#x27;ve been to several countries&#x27; embassies and the US one was like entering a secret nuclear bunker. There was airport-style security, and everyone I talked to was behind a massive sheet of bullet-proof glass; never mind the gates and moat around the building. This was in a small, US-friendly and highly developed country.<p>Then there&#x27;s the excessive amount of security around any US governmental visit to a foreign country.<p>So I think it comes to a surprise to many outside the US that one of your main government buildings has less security than a museum even when all the most important politicians are inside.<p>But yes I agree, I think government buildings should be &#x27;friendly&#x27;.')
