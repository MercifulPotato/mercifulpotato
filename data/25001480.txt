It has been around, in production, for TWENTY YEARS. If you didn&#x27;t learn about it when you were learning IPv4 you&#x27;re either old and should already have enough experience to know that new things come up, or you should&#x27;ve listened when everyone told you that attending ITT wasn&#x27;t a good idea.<p>&quot;But MY company never deployed it!&quot; Bad excuse. Your phone started using it years ago. If you&#x27;re a network engineer and didn&#x27;t realize that, nobody is going to feel bad for you.<p>Not intuitive? The same can be said about most technologies. Without real examples, this means little.<p>Can&#x27;t phone a friend and give an IP address? I&#x27;ve literally never done this. We all use SMS, Messages, email, whatever, and anyone who does anything like run gaming servers knows about dynamic DNS services.<p>Come up with some better complaints, please.')
