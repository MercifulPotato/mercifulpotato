Gamestop wasnt able to catch up with the times and a pile of money won’t help them. The model isn’t vaible anymore and if they pivot into something else they may as well change the name as it would be irrelevant. A start up experiences most progress when they’re small and nimble. I assume Gamestop as a corp has accumulated a lot of cruft and that would hold them back.')
