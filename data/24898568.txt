That&#x27;s why I said the sweet spot is much closer to Java&#x2F;C#&#x2F;Kotlin.<p>&gt; But I have not noticed that it&#x27;s too often<p>That&#x27;s the problem though. Those silent difficult to detect bugs are what affect reliability and safety. With exceptions, you&#x27;re going to have to explicitly ignore them, whereas with golang errors, it&#x27;s much easier to misuse them. Not to mention the fact that golang errors are basically strings, which makes dealing with them very error prone.<p>&gt; Hard to compare with an anecdote like that, I just haven&#x27;t heard much complaints regarding compile times, if anything the opposite, and certainly not that it&#x27;s a significant problem in a pros&#x2F;cons comparison.<p>My guess is that most people don&#x27;t use golang for large projects, and few who do don&#x27;t care about the long compile times.')
