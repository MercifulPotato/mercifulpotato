Item(by='cesarb', descendants=None, kids=[25613399], score=None, time=1609593754, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612176, text='The worst of these is the &quot;Google&quot; app. For over a year, every single new version has the exact same four-entry changelog, which translating from Portuguese is something like: &quot;enhanced search page appearance; new doodles designed for app experience; off-line voice actions, available only in the USA; web pages opened directly within the app&quot;. I have the slight suspicion that most of the almost weekly updates to the &quot;Google&quot; app do not have these four changes... for that app, &quot;bugfixes and performance improvements&quot; would actually be a <i>better</i> (more correct) changelog.')
