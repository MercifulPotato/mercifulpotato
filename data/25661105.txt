Now however, if you click the green button that says &quot;CONTINUE TO CHAT&quot; on the initial screen, it&#x27;ll load a page with an option to download WhatsApp and another that&#x27;s titled &quot;use WhatsApp Web&quot;, just click on that one. Unfortunately, it will load a new instance of WhatsApp web in the current window even if you already have another open in another tab.')
