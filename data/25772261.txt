Item(by='zie', descendants=None, kids=[25772574], score=None, time=1610600404, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25769849, text='How is fossil-scm tied to a particular platform?<p>The data format is literally a SQLITE DB, which is the most used DB on the planet.<p>Binaries are available for all the major OS&#x27;s and many &quot;alternative&quot; ones.<p>I use Fossil-SCM for my personal notes.  Works great.  I even run many websites with Fossil-SCM as the wiki is fabulous for a super easy to deploy and super easy to edit website, even if there is zero code in the VCS portion.<p>I also use fossil on USB sticks for my legal information on my death.  I include fossil binaries for every platform, so whenever I&#x27;m dead my next of kin can just plug in the USB stick I update every year and hand to them and double click and boom, fossil-scm opens with a VCS of all my files and documents, financials, etc, a wiki with next steps, etc.  Easy peasy, and they get everything they need to take care of all the stuff to handle my estate, in a nice easy to use manner, with basically no work on my part.')
