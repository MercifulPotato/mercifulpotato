AWS is a big ball of mud that keeps getting bigger.  Commercial success does not change that fact.<p>Perhaps the point of starting with a CLI first instead of a GUI is that it creates limits, it favours simplicity and creativity.  If you find yourself creating dozens of single-purpose utlities or one utility with dozens of options, then maybe you are doing something wrong.<p>Rather than looking to AWS as a model, why not look at something non-commercial, like djb&#x27;s software or Wireguard.  There is &quot;power&quot; in keeping a CLI simple.')
