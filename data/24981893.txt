Like any other science. Their uncertainty is larger than something like physics, but not large enough to be considered pseudoscience.<p>In newspapers they’ll shoot their mouths, but in their journals, they’re quite scientific.<p>Your criticisms kinda remind me of data science work, where you say “the effect of doing this will probably be between -3 and +7, assuming X, Y, and Z, so it’s worth looking into.” Which PMs (like politicians) take as 2 (+&#x2F;- 5) and promise the rest of the org a gain of 2. Then we implement it and it comes out as -1 and you need a post mortem about how data scientists (economists) got it so wrong.')
