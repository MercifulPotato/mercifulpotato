The fact that they&#x27;re this close to doing it is both scary and a shame. We have a chance to get back on the right path, and we should do it.<p>It&#x27;s not like an industry and academia consortium wouldn&#x27;t step in to help build the standard. The W3C got us pretty damn far.<p>&gt; The way to unseat Apple isn’t to use the government to force us back in time. It’s to recognize the needs they aren’t satisfying and actually contribute to meeting them.<p>How do you compete with a $2T giant that can easily clone you or lock you out? They&#x27;ve created a &quot;hardware + software + services&quot; megalopoly that does nearly everything. Email, photos, video editing, movies, music, devices, health tracking. When businesses do compete (take SONOS, for instance), Apple comes along and builds their own. Owing to deep integration and ecosystem forces, the competitors aren&#x27;t able to escape the growth&#x2F;funding gravity well.<p>Apple is Thanos, and they&#x27;re snapping freedom and competition out of existence.')
