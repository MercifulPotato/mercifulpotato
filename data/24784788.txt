( May be they did but held back due to pandemic ) i.e The user growth is slowing, or reached ceiling.<p>4.5B people have a smartphone. Most of them are on at least 3rd or 4th Smartphone with plenty of chargers lying around. So it would only effect a tiny percentage ( I am willing to bet less than 5% ). So it is not a bad move from environment perspective.<p>Of coz I wish Apple had at least bundled a high power charger for a few generation before they moved on. But I am ok with the new pricing reduction of their charger. ( $19 )')
