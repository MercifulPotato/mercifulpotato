Prior to that three others moved away when they had kids.<p>The NIMBYs and prop13 are unnecessarily hurting everyone except those that bought property a long time ago and pay relatively no property tax while suppressing any new housing and forcing new buyers to subsidize them.<p>Median housing price on the peninsula is 3 million, you can get a tiny old condo from the 60s for 1.3M if you can find it.<p>SF is a little better with some newer apartments available in the 800k - 1.2M range and some older stuff that&#x27;s cheaper.<p>It sucks and it&#x27;s totally unnecessary. Allowing more housing to be built would reduce the cost. NYC does it, Tokyo does it, it&#x27;s possible and would be better for everyone except the NIMBYs leveraging their luck for their own self-interest.<p>In the context of historical exclusionary zoning and explicitly racist policy about restricting housing access framing it as &#x27;local control&#x27; and &#x27;protecting neighborhood character&#x27; is just a way to continue to block people from entering the community to protect a small subset of owner&#x27;s self-interest that was protected by historically unfair policy.<p>There&#x27;s a deep irony seeing &#x27;black lives matter&#x27; signs on someone&#x27;s lawn right next to anti-housing council member election signs.<p>Rent-Control, &#x27;affordable&#x27; housing are bad hacks that make things worse. We need to build more supply of everything and a lot of it.<p>The current situation also sucks for start-ups where massive costs get eaten up by landlords. Here you&#x27;ve either had one or two successful exits or live with 3 roommates (or your parents are rich, or are locals). It&#x27;d be so much less stressful if housing cost was something you didn&#x27;t have to worry about or it was possible to actually buy something.<p>What if there was enough supply to buy a place for 400-500k? Maybe then my friends wouldn&#x27;t have had to leave to start a family live without roommates.<p>My only hope is something like SB50 eventually passes and takes local control of zoning away from these people:<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sanjoseinside.com&#x2F;the-fly&#x2F;cupertino-council-contenders-draw-fire-for-nimby-hot-takes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sanjoseinside.com&#x2F;the-fly&#x2F;cupertino-council-cont...</a><p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lydia_kou&#x2F;status&#x2F;857012783895912450?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lydia_kou&#x2F;status&#x2F;857012783895912450?s=20</a>')
