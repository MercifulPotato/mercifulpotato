That seems like quite a lot. How did you meet them?<p>As an active member for years I&#x27;ve chatted and interacted with them for years and gotten to know many of them quite well.<p>&gt;Also, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d call that significant Bitcoin adoption if their only use for it is as an intermediary to exit a different cryptocurrency.<p>Why is that so?  As far as I&#x27;m concerned (as an early adopter of bitcoin and other crypto), Bitcoin&#x27;s primary use has always been to fill the void when government-sanctioned currencies and financial systems fail.  Without Bitcoin these poor people would be unable to cash out the fruits of their creative endeavors - its absolutely critical.  Different people use Bitcoin for difference purposes, but none of these purposes is inherently less legitimate than another.')
