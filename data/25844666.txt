Even pictures of Facebook chats are admissible there. If those are more important to you (even if they&#x27;re not happening <i>yet</i>), I would still understand the choice to go for these.<p>Furthermore, admissible only matters to a limited extent. It means someone won&#x27;t go to jail based on this evidence alone. It doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t get considered at all. Even then, there&#x27;s hacks, you could have someone from the company testify to the results of the kit and what the results mean, for example.<p>Using these kids deprives the government and public prosecutor of many options and places a <i>lot</i> of power with the individual. That weakens the case, but that may be a good trade for people. I&#x27;m not sure giving people extra options between keeping silent and going full-on nuclear with zero control and uncertain result (the government route) is such a bad thing.<p>I can also see why a person with this job (and the conviction that makes one take a job like this) would consider it a terrible thing.')
