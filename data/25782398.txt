This is a case where <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;YumaKoizumi&#x2F;ToyADMOS-dataset" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;YumaKoizumi&#x2F;ToyADMOS-dataset</a> really shines because it adds something that didn&#x27;t exist before, and it doesn&#x27;t have to be 100% perfect: anything is better than nothing.<p>This is a link to a dataset, unless I&#x27;m missing something it&#x27;s not about anomaly detection. I looked into this area a few years ago and always try to keep my eye open for breakthroughs... care to share any other links?')
