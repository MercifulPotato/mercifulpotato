They already knew and didn&#x27;t care. The president held a speech in the morning, addressing his supporters who had traveled from all over the country to come to Washington. He told the crowd to storm the Capitol over the loudspeaker, and that he would lead them in doing so. He didn&#x27;t. Instead he returned to the White House.
