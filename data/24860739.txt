If you are doing the same thing everybody does, you are expected to know beforehand what is your product.<p>That is true whether you do those things in a computer or not.<p>But you are pointing on some confusion of investors that think they are getting into a tech company when the company is actually just a copy of something else. That may be widespread for all that I know (I still somewhat doubt it), but most product development does consist on copying nearly everything of another existing one, this does not make it any less tech.')
