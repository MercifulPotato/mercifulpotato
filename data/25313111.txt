Samsung Silicon uses Samsung Foundry, there is a yield &#x2F; quality &#x2F; capacity &#x2F; performance issue.<p>2. Qualcomm patents on CDMA and having much better modem.<p>3. Qualcomm&#x27;s GPU being better than ARM Mali and CPU being better than Stock ARM ( Samsung ) implementation.<p>But All of these are changing and Samsung wants to succeed in these areas. Foundry is catching up a little bit, so may be a little more than  1 year behind in TSMC in terms of league edge and capacity. ( Forget about their goals and Roadmap as well as investors notes they are even worst than Intel ). They have signed a partnership agreement with AMD bringing RDNA to Mobile. Their Modem is improving with each generation, and the patents issues has been sorted out recently. ( Which is pretty much the same deal as Apple )<p>It will take some time. 2021 Exynos may be a little too early so 2022 seems like a safe bet. Although Qualcomm isn&#x27;t sitting still either.')
