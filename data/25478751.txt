Think about it. Making it shorter did absolutely nothing other then save some precious microseconds during reading.<p>Another thing I would argue is that my version of the function saves time. You got rid of xy from the name so now this can only be derived from a type signature definition. If someone encounters this function being called in the wild they will have to follow it in order to derive the xy nature of the return value.<p>But that point is irrelevant in the grander scheme of things. My main point is that the differences between either naming convention has basically no logical significance at all.<p>A better way to illustrate it:<p><pre><code>   find_xy_coordinate_of_dogs_cats_and_baboons_in_picture\n   find_the_xy_coordinates_of_dogs_cats_and_baboons_in_a_picture\n</code></pre>\nthe extra grammar I added does zero damage to the code or meaning it doesn&#x27;t hurt. In fact a weird thing occurs when communicating with the English language instead of code. In English we prefer the bottom way, in code we prefer the top. Both are mediums of communication yet we prefer two contradictory approaches. But in general people prefer reading English over code so the English style of verbosity is in fact provably better.<p>I&#x27;m saying because of this contradiction, long ass function names aren&#x27;t actually hurting anyone... while at the same time the extra info helps communicating much more concepts.<p>&gt; One is the amount of screen space needed to use your function, this bites when the could be many functions with long names used in a single expression .............<p>Others have used the math argument. I&#x27;ll post my replies to those rather then rewrite everything.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25476030" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25476030</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25476474" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25476474</a>')
