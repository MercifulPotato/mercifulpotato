Item(by='codethief', descendants=None, kids=[25593731], score=None, time=1609374818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25578831, text='I mostly agree with what you&#x27;re saying but still, the entire &quot;success story&quot; of AdS&#x2F;CFT is based on other assumptions about quantum gravity <i>none of which</i> has been tested experimentally. Even black hole entropy itself is, up until now, a purely theoretical construct.<p>&gt; String theory [â€¦] is nonetheless a mathematically consistent theory<p>I hear this claim being perpetuated a lot but I have yet to see a string theorist give a mathematically rigorous introductory lecture on string theory. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not saying there are no mathematically precise results in the realm of string theory but I know enough about functional analysis and the issues surrounding the mathematical underpinnings of quantum field theory (or even quantum mechanics) that I&#x27;m not buying your claim and my current view is that <i>some</i> parts of string theory are very rigorous, whereas (most) others are not. (AdS&#x2F;CFT is one such part which belongs to the latter category.) I&#x27;d <i>love</i> to be proven wrong, though, so please feel free to send me papers etc.')
