Sales for a No Code product talks up how you will not need programmers to create solutions<p>2. Company buys No Code product deploys it to users<p>3. A few users &quot;get it&quot; and create solutions with no code<p>4. Something in the environment changes, or the original creators of the solution move on from the company and the &quot;no code&quot; solution breaks,  no one can fix it or understand what broke or even really explain the &quot;solution&quot;<p>5. Devs &#x2F; SysAdmins now have to detangle and figure out how these &quot;no code&quot; solutions works, what they were suppose to be doing in the first place, and figure out why they do not work any more.  Often times this results in the dev &#x2F; admin just redoing everything properly, in a proper programming enviroment because there was no logic to no-code solution')
