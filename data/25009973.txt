Doubly more so if you&#x27;re not the founder and are joining the party late. You&#x27;re last in a very long line of hungry mouths, waiting for an event that can just as well never happen. Ignore the equity, consider whether this is a position that&#x27;s interesting for you, and whether the cash matches your needs and motivations.')
