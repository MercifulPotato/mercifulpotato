Lobe tries to give you more ways to, not only continuously work on your model by adding more images, changing the number of labels, and even re-label a bunch of your images while training a custom machine learning model in the backgroundâ€”but also, it gives you the ability to analyze your results in real time, and test your model while giving it feedback, so the loop to make your model better is continuously happening. I love that about Lobe.')
