For one, Blender is GPL.  For another, Amazon is hardly the first big company to sponsor Blender development: Facebook, AMD, NVidia, Unity, Epic, Intel, Microsoft, Google, etc. all contribute.  They contribute because better free software for 3D modelling helps grow their own markets, for games, VR, graphics cards, gaming PCs, consoles, cloud gaming, visual effects, cloud rendering, etc.  Amazon&#x27;s <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> series used Blender for almost all its visual effects, and they sell cloud rendering services.')
