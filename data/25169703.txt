We don&#x27;t lump all bumps, bruises, and broken bones into physical illness.<p>Yea, it&#x27;s out of touch to tell someone with broken legs to walk it off. But, if someone got the wind knock out of them. That&#x27;s perfectly fine advice.<p>In fact, I hope and believe the majority of mental illness cases are not serious. Like, most physical cases. It&#x27;s just harder to see, so people have a harder time properly categorizing it. Which is damaging to a person psyche. If someone has a sprain ankle, but thinks they have cancer. Imagine the unnecessary trauma and hopelessness the person is experiencing.')
