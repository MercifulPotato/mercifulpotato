Item(by='xxs', descendants=None, kids=[25846060], score=None, time=1611144490, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25844991, text='&gt;% len,<p>Modulus (division) is slow and the length should be pow2 and the operation &quot;&amp; (len-1)&quot;. If you do %len, you have far greater issues. I have pretty extensive experience writing hashmap&#x2F;cyclic buffers and the like. If you have auto-grow structs (and you almost always want that), you want pow2 length arrays. e.g.<p><pre><code>  addLast(e)\n    elements[tail++] = e;\n    tail &amp;= elements.length - 1;\n    if (tail == head) doubleCapacity();\n  }</code></pre>')
