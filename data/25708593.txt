Mostly I&#x27;ve been focusing a lot on the simulation and back-end side of things, but I do think it could benefit from a more modern UI (maybe someday).<p>Nonetheless, we have a small community of virtual sailors who regularly participate in races, and I could not be more grateful for all their feedback and help with this project so far!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23661326" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23661326</a>')
