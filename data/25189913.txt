It is a monumental problem y&#x27;all are trying to solve.<p>I think a large portion of my gripes are due to what I describe as an in-between state right now.  Is HA for those with Linux experience?  Is it not?  If it&#x27;s the later, UI features that don&#x27;t do anything should never be allowed in releases.  Right now, I can&#x27;t delete a dead Z-Wave node.  The button is greyed out.  I have to delete as much as I can from the UI, then clean it up from the yaml files.  This is not something a layman can do.  I just want one button to delete a dead node from entities, nodes, Z-Wave, switch, and devices, or tell me where exactly I need to delete things from yaml and .storage.<p>Also, I think the project needs to get away from entities and nodes, or at least hide them in the UI and end user documentation.  It&#x27;s too abstract and not always relevant to the end-user.')
