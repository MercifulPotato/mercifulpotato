It&#x27;s certainly true for some of the software projects I maintain.<p>&gt; Commercial closed source and SaaS vendors have the resources to leave FOSS and open ecosystems in the dust in terms of features and user experience<p>That&#x27;s not possible even with infinite resources, because FOSS software is sometimes great, often good, and also often the only thing available.')
