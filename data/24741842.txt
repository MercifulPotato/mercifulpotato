The alarm was necessary because I never felt well rested and couldn&#x27;t get up without it.<p>Then I went for a sleep study and was told that during a night of 6-7 hours of what I thought was continuous sleep, I actually woke up 120 times. Eek! Of course everyone normally wakes up at least a few times and doesn&#x27;t remember it the next day, but most people don&#x27;t choke and stop breathing 120 times a night. I rarely got any real deep sleep.<p>I had sleep apnea surgery, which changed my life. Almost right away I got better sleep and was more alert during the day. It was like getting an extra 2-3 hours a day, every day.<p>Now I get up without an alarm every day and never need caffeine. It&#x27;s a great way to live.')
