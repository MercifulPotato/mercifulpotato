Item(by='tyu2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607785749, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398461, text='I remember broadband ISPs used to do that in the end of 90s, early 2000s with high price per MB of traffic, had to write off overages left and right (viruses on windows were a number 1 issue), then competition kicked in and &quot;scumbag billing&quot; disappeared, first they just got rid of overage charges and started merely throttling speed after caps and eventually got rid of caps altogether. Similar things were happening in hosting industry, colocation and dedicated servers in particular, competition eliminated overage charges too. Somehow &quot;clouds&quot; think they are too different, as if they don&#x27;t compete with traditional hosting offerings, but being scambags trying to keep their high margins certainly pushes people away. I used to be an early AWS and Rackspace customer (remember when they were two top choices?), but haven&#x27;t really used &quot;clouds&quot; since then, they are simply not competitive for literally anything, at least for someone like me, who&#x27;s been doing infrastructure for decades.')
