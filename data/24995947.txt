I wrote to Lamport about it. Here’s part of Lamport’s reply<p>It’s nice that you found an apparently new way to explain Paxos, but don’t expect everyone to find it helpful.  “Grasping” or “intuitively understanding” an algorithm really means giving the reader a warm fuzzy feeling, and different people get warm fuzzy feelings from different things.  What really matters is not warm fuzzy feelings, but the ability to rigorously prove that a correct algorithm is correct, and to find the error in an incorrect one.')
