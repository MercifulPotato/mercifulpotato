They&#x27;ve gone to the bother of creating entire new paid-for products - with all the budget and product&#x2F;market fit uncertainty that involves. Surely a paid-for FF option would have been a less expensive experiment?<p>Perhaps the terms of the Google &quot;donation&quot; prevent&#x2F;constrain that.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if so.  Which does lead to an interesting - if probably fanciful - scenario from the anti-trust investigation announced today...<p>...charactertise the browser as a &quot;utility&quot; and require G to (a) transfer it into Mozilla&#x27;s stewardship and (b) force them to license from there.<p>(I know: unrealistic, unworkable, lots of other &quot;just no&quot;s.  But a fun idea nonetheless).')
