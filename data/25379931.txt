Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607640951, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25379621, text='&gt; &quot;The New York Times has long given its op-ed columnists a virtual free hand, exempting their copy from the layers of editing and fact-checking that a regular Times news story would undergo before it appeared in the paper. &quot;<p>Less fact checking is not no fact checking.  That article also cites <i>errors</i> (e.g. misattributing one conservative pundit for another), but you&#x27;re claiming <i>fabrication</i> (made up accounts), which is a far graver thing.<p>Also, that article dates from 2008, and the article I quoted is from 2013, five years later.')
