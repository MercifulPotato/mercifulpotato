The world has <i>figured out</i> how to deal with a Nazi. I&#x27;ve linked this elsewhere in the thread, but it is worth understanding the lessons of this story deeply: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;IamRageSparkle&#x2F;status&#x2F;1280891537451343873" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;IamRageSparkle&#x2F;status&#x2F;128089153745134387...</a><p>Say you&#x27;re something anodyne, like &#x2F;r&#x2F;RomanHistory or something (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s real). For obvious reasons, that is a topic that Western fascists <i>really like</i>; they&#x27;re gonna come by, even if their &quot;fascist hat&quot; isn&#x27;t on right that second. But that train&#x27;s never late, that fascist hat goes on <i>eventually</i>. And the first fascist might be polite. So might his friends. And maybe you see a few off-color jokes that maybe you, as a slightly-but-not-heavily-invested mod, slap down--but those jokes are the way that they start to <i>find each other</i>. And meanwhile, as things grow? What often happens is that one of their more buttoned-up types ends up on your moderation team, because hey, they&#x27;re Respected By The Community (and this happens in person, too, when it comes to groups and political entities; this is a very common foot-in-the-door tactic). And then it just grows from there. Maybe you&#x27;ve got the spine to &quot;ruin everything&quot; by kicking them out at this point, by cutting out the rot, but that&#x27;s going to hurt and hmm, maybe it&#x27;s best to just go along and get along, especially because any time you try to act against it, you&#x27;ve got those folks who pipe up about how Nazis should have freedom of speech too, even if you don&#x27;t like their ideas...<p>...and now you have a fascist community.<p>&quot;Strong moderation&quot;--the bartender in that story telling the <i>first</i> fascist to get the hell out--is not something that can be even remotely taken for granted. You must insulate your systems against fascism because <i>it is a hack of the system</i>. The instinctual emotional attack it employs on a liberal order requires so much more work to stop than it does to continue that anywhere it can take root, it can strangle everything else. This is real, and this is what those coded &quot;free speech ideals&quot; are being weaponized to protect while it grows.')
