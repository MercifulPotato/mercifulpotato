They&#x27;ve also already passed several other bipartisan bills.<p>These mostly just die in the Senate because McConnell does not even allow them to come to a vote. His Senate is mostly focused on confirming judges.<p>There are literally hundreds of bills that have passed the House that are completely stalled in the Senate.')
