Item(by='mikewarot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605999341, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25169621, text='I learned machining, and made gears in a production setting, mostly straight bevel, but some spur, helical and internals. I also did thread milling.  Shifting from computers to a job shop gave me great insight into the needs of industry, previously my work was in only tangentially related IT.<p>I started learning at PumpingStation One, Chicago&#x27;s Makerspace, it turned out I really like turning metal into finished pieces and piles of chips. My nickname was &quot;Metal Mike&quot;, I became the area host, and when a member&#x27;s Dad needed someone to make gears, no experience necessary, I jumped at it, at age 53. If you bought a Marvel  18&quot; bandsaw between 2016 and the spring, odds are I made the lower bandwheel that drives the blade.<p>I learned that making things with a precision of about the thickness of a human hair is relatively easy, in quantity. I know more about gears and gearing than I ever thought I could know... and that was only scratching the surface in 5 years.  I will try hard not to assume something is easy in the future.<p>Since then, I&#x27;m trying to catch up, I want to go back into Programming, which I did before being a system admin for 15 years... my last major code was in Turbo Pascal for DOS. I did little side gigs, learning GIT, Python, a bit of C++&#x2F;Arduino, MySQL, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve been reading everything I can, subscribed to &#x2F;r&#x2F;pascal, &#x2F;r&#x2F;programming and &#x2F;r&#x2F;programminglanguage on reddit where I answer a few and mostly read questions.<p>Hopefully, I&#x27;ll be able to start earning a living in coding again soon.<p>[Edit] To answer a downstream question, we have a child, you have less free time, but more inspiration.')
