I had a lot of fun doing things like writing GTK+ apps and playing around with sysadmin stuff but certain user experience related things never really went away.<p>&gt;I know every system does font rendering a bit differently, and what people like to see really seems to have a big subjective factor it. Personally, I&#x27;ve always had a preference to how fonts are rendered on, for example, Ubuntu compared to Windows 10, especially with 2x scaling on high-DPI displays, but I acknowledge everyone&#x27;s different.<p>At &gt;200 dpi I find that even VGA fonts look good. The difference is clear when you compare MBA 2017 to MBA 2018 font rendering, a HiDPI display fixes everything. I could see Windows font rendering degrade on hiDPI due to Cleartype forcing subpixel rendering but I don&#x27;t possess such display devices.<p>&gt;Not disagreeing with you on this point. However, when it comes to &quot;tinkering&quot;, I find all the cloud-connected nonsense and &quot;extras&quot; that Windows comes with turned on and thrown in your face by default after an install a much bigger annoyance, and I often have to go digging through all kinds of settings windows to get a good deal of that turned off, and even then it&#x27;s not always possible (see telemetry, for example). A new Windows 10 install is a lot more effort in &quot;tinkering&quot; with all the settings into some sane configuration than any Linux distro where you&#x27;re not compiling your own kernel and&#x2F;or packages (and maybe even then).<p>I used the Windows 10 LTSC iso from Windows&#x27; own website and it has no adware or extra apps installed, even Microsoft Store is disabled. Nowadays Windows Defender seems to carry it&#x27;s weight.<p>I guess instead of &quot;I am tired of tinkering&quot; I should have specified it as &quot;I am tired of tinkering on things I don&#x27;t find fun to tinker with&quot; like DPI and drivers on Linux. I&#x27;d rather tinker with Haskell or my job without the OS getting in my way.<p>MacOS seems to be a great compromise between the two. HiDPI macs look great and I can tinker on choice.')
