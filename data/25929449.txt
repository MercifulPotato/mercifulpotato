Look at the size of this thing.  Just imagine the maintenance needed to keep it safe.  Who knows what environmental evils are in there (asbestos, oils, paints).  Either find the millions per year to keep it as a museum piece, or demolish it safely now.  Only then does the question becomes what will that space be used for.  If you have no other use, ya, it can be a parking lot.  It is not being demolished to create the parking lot.  It is being demolished because it needs to be demolished.  To what use the then-vacant land shall be put is a different story.')
