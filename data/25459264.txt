Its just rice, veggies, and meats.<p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s so ridiculous about this &quot;unprocessed&quot; vs &quot;processed&quot; label. Lumpia is just flour + water for the wrappers, and then fillers (beef+rasins is pretty common, but maybe you&#x27;re a veggie-lumpia person). Ultimately, its just flat + fresh dough wrapping fresh foods. Nothing processed about it at all.<p>I bet you that frying your food and filling it up with oils and salts probably has more to do with your health than how &quot;processed&quot; those foods are.<p>----------<p>If you&#x27;ve been to the Philippines, you can watch people literally rip the plantain (a bananna-like fruit) from a tree, wrap it, and deep fry it for you. Its about as fresh and &quot;unprocessed&quot; as it gets. Literally, these people just sit on the side of the road selling this stuff. Its kind of awesome. (Or they&#x27;ll climb a tree and cut a fresh Buko &#x2F; Coconut for you. Etc. etc.)<p>That doesn&#x27;t make it any healthier. Now it makes it really, really tasty and a really good experience. But no way in hell am I going to call that healthy eating.')
