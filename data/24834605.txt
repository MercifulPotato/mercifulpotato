Even the most permissive ham licenses only allow a <i>maximum</i> of 1.5kW PEP with many bands limited to 200W. Ham bands also aren&#x27;t very wide which means it would is trivial for a state actor to jam them.<p>But an unfriendly government doesn&#x27;t even need to bother with jamming. A ham (or pirate operator) relaying Internet traffic over radio would be trivially easy to find. It&#x27;s fairly easy to triangulate the location of a transmitter, especially one constantly keyed up. A government frowning on such activity would just triangulate the transmitter and go arrest the operator. An extremely unfriendly government would just blow up the station, operator and all.<p>If you want to make some decentralized network go buy some cantennas, leave hams out of it.')
