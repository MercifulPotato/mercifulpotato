My browser partially covers the IDE by occupying the right 75% of the screen.  Then I can follow the console&#x2F;log of the IDE.  Even though only the beginning of each line is visible, that&#x27;s enough to tell me when it is time to switch back to the IDE.<p>If I were to make the IDE window smaller, the console&#x2F;log portion of it would be too tiny to see anything.<p>If the text editor has no side bars (such as a directory tree), then it makes sense to have a full-height text editor on the left and maybe to half-height terminals on the right.<p>But then I think that maybe some IDEs allow to pop out the console&#x2F;log piece into a separate window, and perhaps that could work nicely with a tiling arrangement.  I haven&#x27;t tried.<p>Thoughts?')
