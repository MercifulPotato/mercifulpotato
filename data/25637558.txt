There are presumably deposits of gold that we don&#x27;t yet know about.<p>There&#x27;s a difference between known unknown with high variance and known unknown with low variance.  As I understand it, astrophysicists have a non-controversial model for how much gold is present on earth.  Geologists probably have a reasonable model for how much gold is easily accessible.')
