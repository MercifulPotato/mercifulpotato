As a Portlander, I can tell you first hand our police are regularly doing much worse than &quot;arresting&quot; mothers and grandmothers, they&#x27;re first shooting them with tear-gas, impact munitions, then batoning and pepper spraying them on the ground. Watched it, first hand, just a few days ago.<p>As a former Marine, until watching our cops in action this year, I was all about them. Now I&#x27;m disgusted with them, and will do everything I can to take the toys away from these children. Until you&#x27;ve seen them first hand (or you are one... Just quit and live a better life), it&#x27;s actually really hard to believe just how awful they are. Are cops are the &quot;war on drugs&quot; cops who bend or disregard every rule so they can &quot;come down hard&quot; and &quot;make an example&quot;. That&#x27;s the attitude. And if you think that&#x27;s okay... Wait till your kid gets pulled over, or stopped for riding a bike through the wrong part of town. These people are thugs, and operate where no laws will touch them.')
