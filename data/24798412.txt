I work in an office and I live with flatmates&#x2F;roommates who aren&#x27;t close friends. My work problems stay in the office, my domestic problems stay at home, and my social&#x2F;relationship problems don&#x27;t follow me home. It&#x27;s less about one or the other being a coping mechanism, but my (lack of) capacity to deal with multiple problems simultaneously.')
