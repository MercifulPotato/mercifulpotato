And you don&#x27;t give it a 133.33 box. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re in effect doing now by having the compositor scale the whole screen. You give it an actual 133px box because since you&#x27;re working at native resolution apps get snapped to pixel boundaries.<p>&gt; It actually is much worse for the one that doesn&#x27;t match, because now you have lost the ability to do pixel-perfect scaling.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by this. Pixel perfect scaling is precisely what&#x27;s not possible right now. If you have a 1.3x screen and a 1.5x screen you can&#x27;t render 1:1 to any of them. With this you could at least have 1:1 in the 1.5x screen and be pixel perfect there.')
