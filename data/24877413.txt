A signal requires detail and structure, and any attempt to send a detailed signal will always be faster sent through the air than through an unreliable barrier.<p>This argument doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me.  One particle arriving can signal information that some event has occurred at the source. Re: structure&#x2F;complexity I imagine you could use different elements (and maybe spin too?) to form several bits.')
