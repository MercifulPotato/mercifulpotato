You&#x27;ve also got the hills in the East Bay and various options in Marin and points north if you&#x27;re in Marin.<p>But Boston, in addition to various coastal walks has a bunch of nearby parks and small mountains&#x2F;hills to the west and in southern NH. Also tons of sea kayaking&#x2F;canoeing. Depending upon where you live, bigger peaks in NH are maybe 2-3 hours.The Sierras are further than that from the SFBA.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. The Bay Area has great recreational options but so do a lot of other cities depending upon what you&#x27;re looking for.')
