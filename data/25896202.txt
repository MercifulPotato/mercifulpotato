Item(by='joe_the_user', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611523320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25895453, text='Mastodon is only a little confusing (it&#x27;s inherently going to be a bit more confusing than Twitter, which was the GP&#x27;s main point). The complaints of the OP and much of the thread are more related to Twitter and microblogging being kind of, well, terrible. The &quot;us versus them&quot; quality is magnified if Mastodon consists of Twitter refugees. Twitter is moderated by the way the whole world can hear you when you scream - and that does not seem to moderate it well. Equating these constructs with BBSes seems kind of absurd. BBSes are the opposite are far as &quot;controllabillity&quot; goes - of course. You can moderate them any way you wish, including no moderate or even moderation intended to set people against each other (if you&#x27;re truly evil). But the BBS or web forum belongs to someone and has this flexibility.')
