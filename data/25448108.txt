I see lots of new grads that take classes in &quot;Agile&quot; and I cringe just knowing how instead they could be taking difficult courses in graph theory, theory of computation, abstract algebra, advanced algorithms, distributed systems, or any other number of advanced topics. As we get older it&#x27;s easier to pick up tricks of the trade (various Git workflows, &quot;agile&quot;, etc)... but it gets harder to sit down to do 3 hours of homework 4 days a week doing your pushdown automata or linear algebra exercises.')
