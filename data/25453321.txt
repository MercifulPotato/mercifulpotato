Which often has a revolving door into certain Industries for some reason...<p>I think this has more to do with widespread corruption within certain set class of people in Society than it does as a single isolated issue of incompetent individuals. The goals shouldn&#x27;t be to get those standards to apply to a c-level and below employee, it should be to phase away with those incentives completely.<p>Elon mentioned the over MBA-ization ruining US business culture and innovation, which is no doubt a factor; but to be honest the lack of accountability and that actual punitive punishments for their mistakes seem to often be non-existent are for me way more systemic and a greater drag on overall progress, since the wrong incentives (like this) are already baked in to the process of a &#x27;successful career&#x27; by default.')
