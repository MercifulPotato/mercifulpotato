Mushroom toxins are similar.\nOnce your ribosomes stop working you die from lack of protein synthesis. The body makes its own ribosomes - if there is a shortage, however, the broken ribosomes register as functional, even when broken, so no new ones are made from the ribosomal DNA.\nSPread by the wind, this gene driven plague would inexorably infect all corn = toxic.\nThere are other ways that gene mongery can harm others. Gene drive block all read heads, in a few hundred years = gone.\nAll this said, we need to establish ways to monitor these risks. Once found, a counter gene can be created,')
