Thanks!<p>The author - a surgeon - describes his experience asking and getting a retired surgeon to coach him for self-improvement purposes. It works out really well although he does mention some minor uncomfortableness like having to talk through one almost-fsckup. Although the author lists this as a slight negative it is actually an endorsement of coaching: self-improvement.')
