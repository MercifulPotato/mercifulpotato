I don&#x27;t expect that she&#x27;s necessarily in the initial market you&#x27;ll be addressing.<p>While I can imagine you&#x27;ll have a variety of styles, you won&#x27;t be able to produce enough styles to match the breadth of the market.  It would be a shame if your growth were capped by how many axes of preference you could address with your limited resources.  You definitely want enough to bootstrap the market (and you mentioned that part of your business plan was to be able to sell additional earrings to repeat customers), but I suspect the long game is in creating and licensing the standards for mating the active components and the earrings.  Other companies may be taking part of the pie, but as long as it keeps growing exponentially, there&#x27;s plenty for everyone.')
