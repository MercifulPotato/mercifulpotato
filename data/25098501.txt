Not just known-breached, but somewhere where it&#x27;s obvious that anyone could look it up as easily as looking up a phone number or mailing address. Somewhere so public that everyone else knows that they&#x27;re no longer &quot;secret.&quot;<p>Using Social Security numbers as some sort of proof you&#x27;re who you say you are is batshit crazy these days. But we all pretend that it&#x27;s still secure somehow. If there was an embarrassingly public list of all SS#s, then banks would be forced to improve their vetting of applicants.<p>At the same time, the onus needs to be on a financial institution to prove that I opened an account. If I discover a line of credit in my name, all I should need to do is disavow it, and make the lender prove that I was the one who authorized it.<p>Yes, this will increase the cost of doing business. But that increased cost is already here, just born randomly and disproportionately by the victims of &quot;identity theft.&quot;<p>Want to issue a credit card with a $15,000 limit? Have the applicant walk into a branch, provide a thumbprint take their picture. Or get them on a video call standing in front of their house, attesting that they&#x27;re the person they say they are. Or if you think that&#x27;s too inconvenient you can take on all the risk if the borrow later disavows the debt.<p>A piece of paper or online form with the magic numbers is just not enough.')
