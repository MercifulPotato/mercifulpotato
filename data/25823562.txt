See how long it takes to chop an onion, record it. Now you know the REAL prep time for a recipe based on it&#x27;s ingredients.<p>What really saves time is having an idea what order you&#x27;re going to do things and how to parallelize tasks, but for that you need to have some intuition about time so you don&#x27;t accidently burn something. There&#x27;s a recipe I make that takes twice as long if strictly prepped first then cooked.<p>Also, just going to state the obvious, but if you&#x27;re cooking for more than two people, it&#x27;s just always much harder.')
