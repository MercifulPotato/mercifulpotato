What is the practical limit today? How many cores, and how much more memory can Apple add before they run out of Silicon? From what I understand there are a number of practical limits to how big they can make the silicon die, because the equipment on the factories are not really made for arbitrary large chips, and anyway the defect rate will quickly rise if you make too large chips.<p>Like can we expect say something like a 32 core M3 chip with 64 GB RAM, or will that be too much for this design?')
