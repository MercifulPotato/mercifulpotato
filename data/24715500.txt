Why do these containers need to be broken down into raw material and then reconstituted?  If they were high quality enough, could they not just be sanitized and then repurchased by restaurants directly from the recycler?  Seems like there&#x27;d be much less waste of material. The big question would be if the sanitation process would be not be more expensive than just remanufacturing the containers.')
