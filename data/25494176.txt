That&#x27;s not the same thing.<p>Salespeople and sales partners are often compensated with a sales based commission, which is a revenue sharing scheme. It&#x27;s common and expected, and practiced everywhere there&#x27;s deal flow.<p>Technical people can rarely prove &quot;ownership&quot; of revenue, so they can&#x27;t leverage that in negotiation and are left with &quot;general&quot; ownership through options or RSUs or whatever.
