Not just in energy consumption but also in road use (congestion) or commuting services (packed subway cars), in super markets (low fraction of total available checkouts needed during most of the day). I&#x27;m sure you can find other examples if you think about it.<p>Flattening the demand over time by allowing to spread out daily routines (by not requiring or forbidding certain opening hours or office hours for example) so our infrastructure would not need to be dimensioned for outsized peaks instead of almost-average demand would be adressing the underlying issue. Building nuclear plants and streets might be the easier task thn this as it would require personal and societal change ... and people are creatures of habit which is something one never ever should underestimate.')
