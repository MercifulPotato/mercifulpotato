If you could go even 1% c then you could make journies that are multiple light years on the scale of centuries.  It’s not until 50% c does time dilation start playing a significant role, but it would allow making a 10 l-yr journey in 17 years.<p>Nature doesn’t care if we think there should be aliens or FTL travel.  Nature doesn’t like casualty violated and that means we’re all going to be following its rules on the speed of causality.  There are no cosmic-scale sentient forces that can shape space-time near us or else we would have noticed in observations decades ago.')
