Most mathematicians subscribe to the daily arxiv email updates for their subfield and will take notice of any paper close to their work â€“ and the identities of the authors. It is exactly these closely related works that mathematicians are usually asked to referee (precisely in virtue of their expertise). So I would guess that the blinding is not very effective.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;escholarship.org&#x2F;uc&#x2F;combinatorial_theory&#x2F;authorGuidelines" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;escholarship.org&#x2F;uc&#x2F;combinatorial_theory&#x2F;authorGuide...</a>')
