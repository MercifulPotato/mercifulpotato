It&#x27;s in fact actually something very recent in terms of the TeX timeline; it was released in 2004. It has Unicode support, which seems to be the big thing.<p>That is more recent than, I think, the last time I used TeX; which worked absolutely fine.<p>Someone rewriting TeX in Rust should work with Knuth&#x27;s original Pascal sources, in my opinion, not some knock-off (and look at XeTeX behaviors and documentation in order to do the Unicode stuff in a compatible way).')
