While, yes, as an American, English is my first and primary language, I&#x27;m afraid some of its phraseology still confuses me. I think it has to do with parts of society that I don&#x27;t understand, granted. The visceral reaction to the word &quot;slavery&quot;  seems much more than to the more sanitized phrase &quot;forced labor&quot;, or even &quot;labor camp&quot;. Those are what we are what we&#x27;re discussing here, like it or not. Uighurs are being sterilized and used as forced labor, but the phraseology is so sanitary as to not disturb our modern pallet of consumerism, we dare not draw a comparison to Nazis. While there are no crematoria, there are certainly shallow graves and executions, and parallels to be drawn. The word slave and forced labor is, at best, an argument of semantics of note only to those on the sidelines I&#x27;m sure, while those in bondage don&#x27;t care what they&#x27;re called.')
