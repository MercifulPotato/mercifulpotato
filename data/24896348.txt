For example RL sounds fascinating, but I&#x27;m not sure remote client opportunities would exist so much in it. What would serve me best for this kind of remote freelance work? NLP? Classical AI algos? Times series and LSTMs? CNNs? Or something more like datascience and data wrangling? Any thoughts?')
