It worked fine on Linux, but it required a recent Kernel for the distro to find its disk.<p>I don&#x27;t know what comes with the Thinkpad you&#x27;re looking, but make sure you get one with the newest Tiger Lake graphics, it&#x27;s significantly better than Ice Lake and miles better than the 14nm stuff.')
