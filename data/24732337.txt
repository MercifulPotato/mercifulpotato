The Romans, for example, did not use market pricing, but instead were primarily a &quot;cost-plus&quot; economy (you paid the cost plus a known margin).<p>I know it is extremely hard when most of us have been embedded in a neoliberal, market-centric culture for our entire lives to think this far outside the box, but there really is no law of nature that says that what I pay you to do work for me must depend on how many other people could do the work.')
