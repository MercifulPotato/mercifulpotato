During the Bush and Obama administrations if you did a study where you asked GOP voters to describe how they think DEM voters would describe there political views and vis-versa there was a much bigger gap between what Democrats thought Republicans  believed and what Republicans themselves reported then the other way around. Although I have not seen data from the trump era I suspect that the discrepancy would be in both higher in both comparisons.')
