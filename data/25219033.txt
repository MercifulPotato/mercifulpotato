Because it’s finally in a machine we can actually do things on.”<p>This quote drives home well how the iPad feels, well... Perennially not-quite-there, for anything other than a certain kind of digital artist (but not most people who work in 3D, since the App Store doesn&#x27;t have good general-purpose 3D modeling apps, and if it&#x27;s not in the App Store, well...). When Apple eventually releases a competitor to the Surface Pro — that is, a tablet that runs macOS with a detachable keyboard (and Apple already has a great detachable keyboard!) — people will lose their minds and whatever that thing is called will fly off the shelves, just like people are so excited about the M1 when it&#x27;s essentially just the chip from the iPad running a more-useful OS.<p>Until then, the iPad will still trundle along, supported by those artists who can use it and the hardcore Apple enthusiasts. But it feels like the iPad&#x27;s stuck in a weird corner where they&#x27;re too much of an appliance and not enough of a computer for most people, and trying to iterate iPad OS to be less appliance-y seems a bit pointless when macOS can now natively run iPad apps, and merely lacks hardware that includes a touchscreen. Plenty of other manufacturers have shown they can put a touchscreen on a laptop, and sometimes even make you buy the keyboard separately as an accessory. I&#x27;d bet Apple eventually ends up there with macOS as well; and if Apple sells a touchscreen computing device that runs macOS, I think it&#x27;s curtains for iPad OS.<p>(They might still call it an iPad, of course. And hopefully give macOS a more touch-friendly UI! But it&#x27;ll be the end of the iPad-as-appliance, which I think many of us here will be thankful for. And I think it&#x27;ll sell better, too.)')
