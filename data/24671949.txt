These tend to be a problem when bugs crop up, because bug reports are like a personal insult to them.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve long held the view that practically all code is buggy one way or another and that many things can mean throwing code away is the best way forward, so one just shouldn&#x27;t be attached to a few bytes. One should rather feel attached to the project at hand, which then naturally results in one trying to improve it, which means bug reports are GOOD and EXCELLENT because they give very clear hints were the project can be improved.')
