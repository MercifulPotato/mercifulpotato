Look at where liquid hydrogen for rockets is sourced.  It could be made from water.  In reality, it is made from hydrocarbons because that is cheaper.  And even if CO2 is pulled from the air, a huge amount of energy is need to compress&#x2F;store that rocket fuel, energy that could be put to far better uses.  Instead of launching a passenger rocket to london, I&#x27;d rather divert that energy into shutting a coal-fired powerplant for a week or two.  Once all those powerplants are shut, then we should look at passenger rocket services.')
