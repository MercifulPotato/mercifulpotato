Item(by='mumblemumble', descendants=None, kids=[25257884], score=None, time=1606756494, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25253237, text='&gt; &quot;Je n&#x27;ai jamais&quot; in French could literally be translated &quot;I not have never&quot;; but in French it&#x27;s not a double negative, it&#x27;s just &quot;agreement&quot;.<p>In that particular spot, I&#x27;d say a more correct literal translation is &quot;I not have ever.&quot; <i>Jamais</i> in the absence of <i>ne</i> tends to be more equivalent to &quot;ever&quot;, and I would guess that the etymology of &quot;never&quot; is that it&#x27;s a contraction of &quot;not ever&quot;.<p>You could also argue that the French grammar isn&#x27;t a double negative. <i>Ne</i> functions like a linguistic particle that introduces a negative phrase, and then the kind of negation is indicated by the subsequent <i>pas</i>, <i>rien</i>, <i>jamais</i>, etc.<p>Why I&#x27;m bothering to dig into this is, that same &quot;prestige dialect&quot; sort of debate functions differently in French. The <i>ne</i> is disappearing from informal spoken French. The French Academy isn&#x27;t too happy about this; their official position on the subject (which I&#x27;ll paraphrase - I&#x27;m feeling too lazy to hunt it down and translate it) is that words like <i>pas</i>, <i>rien</i>, and <i>jamais</i> have no negative character of their own, so omitting the <i>ne</i> renders the sentence nonsensical.<p>(To which I suspect any practicing linguist would respond, &quot;Huh? If it&#x27;s nonsensical, then how come people who speak this way can understand each other perfectly?&quot; But that kind of distressingly pragmatic attitude is exactly why practicing linguists don&#x27;t get elected to the Academy. I imagine they&#x27;d sooner admit une Ã©crivaine.)')
