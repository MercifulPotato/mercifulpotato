The disgusting content was literally its reason for existing, despite all of the bland &quot;we&#x27;re just a free speech site&quot; stuff.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true. I downloaded the app a few months ago to check it out. I followed some of the same folks I followed on Twitter (I guess you&#x27;d call them center-right?) and it was basically civil discourse about politics.<p>I didn&#x27;t see anything &quot;disgusting&quot; and I didn&#x27;t work hard to avoid it. Granted I didn&#x27;t spent a ton of time in the app and didn&#x27;t explore deeply, but the claim that it was just filled to the gills with something terrible doesn&#x27;t ring true to me.<p>Unless the definition of disgusting is &quot;someone who may not have voted for Biden&quot; - but I don&#x27;t share that definition and I don&#x27;t think most sane people do.')
