A bunch of them were DoD studies from the 1980&#x2F;1990&#x27;s, and the one thing that stuck out were a couple of studies that looked at style issues with ada&#x2F;c and noted that the matched brace style significantly lowered a couple different defect types.<p>Yet today, particularly in the opensource world matched brace style is almost completely non-existant, since its a religious war thing, and some of the early opensource projects were run by people who didn&#x27;t like it.')
