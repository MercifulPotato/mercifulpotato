But, based <i>solely</i> on the text of the email I&#x27;m inclined to give the editor the benefit of the doubt.<p>As a matter of fact, I was firmly in Greenwalds&#x27; camp before reading the email exchange. It does read like a bit of tantrum IMHO. It certainly doesn&#x27;t scream &quot;censorship&quot;.<p>I concede, said &quot;tantrum&quot; may actually be justified based on history that we aren&#x27;t privy to, but the raw text of the exchange alone does not paint Mr Greenwald in the best light.')
