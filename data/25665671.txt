Item(by='throwawaylolx', descendants=None, kids=[25665886, 25665809], score=None, time=1609981074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25661629, text='Yeah, I do based on the evidence presented (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hereistheevidence.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hereistheevidence.com&#x2F;</a>), the lack of legal cooperation and understanding from the Democrats, and the premature media dismissal and disrespectful treatment of the Republicans. I know a large part of the evidence is not compelling, but the combination of factors before, during, and after the election made me require a proper localized audit for several key places to be convinced fraud hasn&#x27;t happened. I&#x27;m not satisfied with the care that was taken to guarantee the election was not fraudulent.')
