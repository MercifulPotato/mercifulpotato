Roller coasters, haunted houses&#x2F;corn maze etc. They get people as close to the edge of that feeling as possible. They won&#x27;t get that full effect though because people know they are safe. If you wanted to get the full effect you need to break the illusion that customers signed up for midway through. Convince riders that the roller coaster is broken while they&#x27;re still going full speed. While in line for the corn maze have a sociable &quot;couple&quot; (staff) go before you. While you&#x27;re going through have one of them start screaming running back past you - you continue and find the other &quot;dead&quot;, background music turns off, bright lights, &quot;exit the maze immediately&quot; over a loud speaker... cue chainsaw man.')
