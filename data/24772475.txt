It&#x27;s rather distracting.<p>So anyway.<p>The problems are (1) the phrase &quot;begs the question&quot; is much more evocative of the &quot;wrong&quot; meaning than the &quot;correct&quot; meaning and (2) the wrong meaning is needed far more often than the correct one (people talk about things that need to be talked about more than they talk about making conclusions that accidentally assume themselves).<p>Thus, I suggest we officially (perhaps a people&#x27;s petition to the white house? I&#x27;m <i>sure</i> the current president would be sympathetic to our cause) abandon the use of &quot;begs the question&quot; to mean &quot;assumes the conclusion&quot;, and finally put this annoying matter to rest.')
