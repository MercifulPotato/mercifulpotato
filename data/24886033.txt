I walk everywhere (combined with public transport for longer distances). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a super power as such, but it does keep me relatively fit with little intentional effort. Going from A to B just includes an incidental light workout. Gives me time to think, to unwind, sometimes to read. Can recommend it to pretty much everyone. Some things might take a little longer, but if you have to dick around on HN or watch Netflix, you have time to walk to places.')
