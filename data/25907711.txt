Item(by='throwaway10923', descendants=None, kids=[25908419], score=None, time=1611603515, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25906367, text='&quot;A  staggering  number  of  votes  required  adjudication.This  was  a  2020  issue  not seen  in  previous election  cycles  stillstored  on  the  server.This  is  caused  by intentional errors in the system. The intentional errors lead to bulk adjudication of ballots  withno  oversight,  no  transparency  or  audit  trail.  Our  examination  of  the server logs indicates that this high error rate was incongruent with patterns from previous  years.  The  statement  attributing  these  issues  to  human  error  is  not consistent  with  the  forensic  evaluation,  which  points  more  correctly  to  systemic machineand&#x2F;or softwareerrors. The systemicerrors are intentionally designed to create errors in order to push a high volume of ballots to bulkadjudication&quot;<p>&quot;\nAntrim County failed to properly update its system. A purposeful lack ofproviding basic   computer security   updates   in   the   system   software   and   hardware demonstrates incompetence,  gross  negligence,  bad  faith,  and&#x2F;or willful  non-compliance in providing the fundamental system securityrequired by federal and state law. There is no way this election management system could have passed tests  or  have  been  legally  certified  to  conduct  the  2020  elections  in  Michigan under   the   current   laws. According   to   the   National   Conference   of   State Legislatures â€“Michigan  requires  full  compliance  with  federal  standards  as determined by a federally accredited voting system laboratory\n&quot;<p>&quot;\nSignificantly,  the  computer  system  shows  vote  adjudication  logs  for  prior  years; but  all  adjudication  log  entries  for  the  2020  election  cycle  are  missing. The adjudication process is the simplest way to manually manipulate votes. The lack of  recordsprevents  any  form  of  audit  accountability,  and  their  conspicuous absence is extremely suspicious since the files exist for previous years using the same  software. Removal  of  these  files  violates  state  law  and  prevents  a meaningful  audit,  even  if  the  Secretary  wanted  to  conduct  an  audit.  We  must conclude that the 2020 election cycle records have been manually removed. \n&quot;<p>so this is just made up?')
