Lots of people who only use github don&#x27;t know about them. Copy-pasta from an old comment of mine:<p>&quot;So, git hooks are basically executable scripts (of whatever language you have available, I use bash) placed in the .git&#x2F;hooks dir, whcih are then executed at whichever event is designated (by the name of the script itself) For me, it&#x27;s post-recieve. After initial setup, a push automatically triggers the post-recieve hook that does something like the following from my git dir:<p><pre><code>    GIT_WORK_TREE=....&#x2F;example.com git checkout -f\n</code></pre>\nand voila, pushes are insta-live, but commits can be pulled and worked on in the meantime.<p>Learned from a few sources (shout out to Dreamhost for my original intro to this idea), but here are some relevant readings:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibm.com&#x2F;developerworks&#x2F;library&#x2F;wa-git&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibm.com&#x2F;developerworks&#x2F;library&#x2F;wa-git&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.com&#x2F;life&#x2F;16&#x2F;8&#x2F;how-construct-your-own-git-" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.com&#x2F;life&#x2F;16&#x2F;8&#x2F;how-construct-your-own-git-</a>... &quot;')
