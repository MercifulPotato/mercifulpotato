This is one of those instances where for this specific purpose, I kinda wish the manufacturers had access to the data of which features people use.  All the complicated multi-timer stuff for cooking different types of foods is so rarely used that I wouldn&#x27;t even trust that I know how to program it correctly if I ever wanted to.  I imagine that if they had telemetry on feature use, they&#x27;d realize that everything but the most dirt-simple UI is completely wasted effort on their part.  Of course, the bells and whistles are how they fill checkboxes, so there&#x27;s a marketing aspect to it even if it&#x27;s worthless.  Most people are going to look at two otherwise equal microwaves and pick the one with the best feature list.<p>BTW, amusingly enough, my microwave manages to overcomplicate even the &quot;add 30 seconds&quot; button, because after 7 presses, it switches to &quot;add 60 seconds&quot;.  You can&#x27;t use it to do 4:00 because the 8th press goes from 3:30 to 4:30.  :D<p>Edit: I should add that I absolutely do not want my microwave to record telemetry and phone home with it.  But if they could magically know that 99.99% of user scenarios could be covered without all the fancy features, I think that would be useful.')
