It doesn&#x27;t explain why a bitcoin is worth $25,000 rather than being worth, say, $5. None of this seems to boil down to any sort of fundamentals, and I&#x27;m not even sure what it is anymore. What&#x27;s the purpose of a bitcoin?<p>Bitcoin used to be an alternative currency that was anonymous, but with a current $7 transaction fee it&#x27;s clearly not going to be used as a currency to buy a morning coffee (i.e. it fails the transferability requirement of a currency). It&#x27;s also not useful to a merchant to lower the transaction fee and wait a day for your coffee payment to clear compared to other payment methods.<p>It&#x27;s entire value is predicated on the idea that it&#x27;s value will go up, with no clear use-case for what a bitcoin will do in the future. The more bitcoin goes up in value, the higher the transaction fees and the less useful it is as a currency.<p>So I guess the question is, what&#x27;s the purpose of a bitcoin?<p>Is the purpose just to become more valuable because of its scarcity with no utility?')
