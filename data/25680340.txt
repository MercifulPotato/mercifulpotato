I would&#x27;ve imagined IQ genes would be dominant there.<p>Edit: after reading the blog post I&#x27;m not surprised anymore. Since non-IQ genes are defined as &quot;...behaviors and abilities that are not measured by traditional IQ tests but are thought to help people be more successful in school, in their jobs, and in life generally.&quot; it would be surprising if they didn&#x27;t have significant correlation.')
