R1 is Alice&#x27;s message xor Alice&#x27;s one time pad. R2 is Bob&#x27;s message xor Bob&#x27;s one time pad. The one time pads are &quot;random&quot;. Then it&#x27;s discovered that R1 xor R2 generates a third party copyrighted work.<p>It is common among computer people to think the law can be hacked like an algorithm. It does not work like that. If you xor two apparently random files and they surprisingly produce the full text of the Harry Potter series, you do <i>not</i> have plausible deniability if you start distributing it.')
