Item(by='gfxgirl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610328929, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25719796, text='MacOS also has this issue. The thumbnails are so small as to be useless. Especially if you have multiple similar images. In the Finder you can choose larger thumbnails but not in a file open dialog.  Used to be able to several versions of the OS ago though you had set some internal OS setting (no UI) but that setting no longer works.<p>If Windows does anything better than MacOS this is one tiny area. I don&#x27;t understand who at Apple thinks not being able to have large thumbnails is a good design.')
