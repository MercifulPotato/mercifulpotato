I know that this is not quite what’s being argued for, but I am equally certain that is how it would land in practice.<p>I’m not convinced re-framing&#x2F;codifying our social, environmental, and human capitals as financial instruments is any kind of progress towards salvation, rather it’s a doomed attempt to take everything that never fit inside the tidy box of capitalism and cram it inside of the box anyway in an attempt to make the world comprehensible to a mind accustomed to that manner of framing.<p>This problem needs novel thinking, more novel than finding a direct way to account for it within the existing framework. I regrettably don’t have a better idea.')
