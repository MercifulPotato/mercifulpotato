Wifi on the other hand uses a medium amount of power when idle, and a medium amount when transmitting. (this is really generalized and there have been a lot of recent advancements to optimize power usage of both).<p>This is why general guidance for years was to use wifi when you are actually using your phone for browsing the internet, taking advantage of wifi&#x27;s lower power efficiency when in use, but to turn off wifi when your phone is just in your pocket&#x2F;idle to take advantage of cell network&#x27;s better idle power efficiency.<p><i>However</i>, the above is really only true for urban&#x2F;suburban areas where you have good signal. If you are in an area with poor signal, your phone will use a lot of battery power via the cell network even when &quot;idle&quot; (because in reality even though your phone is &quot;idle&quot;, the cell radio isn&#x27;t actually idle, it&#x27;s constantly struggling in the background to maintain the connection through the poor signal).')
