There&#x27;s gonna be stuff you miss, mistakes you make, etc.  Coming someplace you&#x27;ve admitted you&#x27;ve never been before, and claiming they need to &#x27;change&#x27; because you&#x27;re upset is just silly.  You have not idea how the moderation works here, so how can you claim it needs to &#x27;change&#x27; or &#x27;improve&#x27;?

For instance, googling your company name (a &#x27;vanity search&#x27;). HN is actually pretty small potatoes compared to FB, Twitter, Yelp!, etc.  You might want to check those sites too.
