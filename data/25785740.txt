Even if you&#x27;re passionate about statistics, machine learning, or any ds related discipline don&#x27;t think of work as being a bigger part of your identity than the average star bucks barista does. Find a team&#x2F;company that pays you well and isn&#x27;t too opinionated, with low ego (if possible). Don&#x27;t look for challenging work, the few places it exists already have the people they need, whereas the companies that pretend they have challenging problems tend to be insufferable. Look for a team where you can check-in and check-out without too much stress and get paid well.')
