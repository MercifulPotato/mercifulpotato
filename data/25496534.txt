It was sold to me under the auspices of drug testing, even though ADHD meds are out of your system in 48h. A month later I received an explanation of benefits from my insurance company that said they received a 14k bill and had paid 4k of it, so I was on the hook for the other 10k. Furious I went to my psych. They casually said “we’ve taken care of it, you shouldn’t receive an actual bill”. Uh, that’s not the point? The point is why was it necessary to send my urine for 14k in testing in the first place? You cannot convince me they weren’t getting kickbacks from this program. Finding a new psych is difficult, so the next time they asked me to pee in a cup I asked if they’d charge my insurance the same way again. I haven’t been asked for a urine sample since, which is odd considering they have signs clearly posted saying drug tests are mandatory. I guess not _that_ mandatory, huh?<p>It’s wild that individuals are forced to navigate this system, much less fight it when they’re being fucked. The idea that there are people who’s sole purpose is designing beurocratic gears to grind money out of sick people makes me sick. And they employ an army of low wage call center folks to do their bidding, work that I can’t imagine is super rewarding. How much better would the world be if we tore down these machines and paid all of those people to do literally anything else?')
