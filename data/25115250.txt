But I suspect that you’re not in favour that either.<p>We shouldn’t be building technical systems that “trap” people, just because they might be doing something bad and might want to prove that one day.<p>Additionally you’re also ignoring the whole “people have the right, to not have their emails stolen” argument. DKIM signatures are only useful if the emails are stolen, are you trying to suggest that it’s ok to steal emails from people if they’re bad?')
