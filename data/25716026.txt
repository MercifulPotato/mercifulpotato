There would be a much clearer value proposition for lawyers if it was summarized in a way like - learn how to build APIs - examining the key claims and decisions from the Oracle v. Google Java API case. As advertised, it seems like a regular CS overview course. They&#x27;re definitely on to something, it seems like a class to help attorneys better understand key concepts of programming to be better attorneys, rather than a transition from the law to programming career. If that&#x27;s the case, they need to do a better job advertising how each bullet point will help them become better attorneys.<p>It also might have more credibility if they had an instructor who was an attorney.')
