I&#x27;ll bookmark this comment as I&#x27;m trying to take stock of what would be most helpful.<p>There are two kind of opposing directions I see a need for:<p>- &quot;Beginner Unity&quot; take tailored for an Engineer. E.g. let&#x27;s talk about the input system, frame-rate independence, overview of rendering&#x2F;lighting, a high level overview of the editor, etc. And get that out of the way.<p>- Satisfying what I might call a thirst for idioms&#x2F;best practices from a SWE perspective. E.g. separation of concerns in MonoBehaviors, using ScriptableObjects, etc. Also maybe overview of things like &quot;Should I still use Git with Unity or look into Collaborate?&quot; and the like.<p>My current sense is that I&#x27;ll end up toeing the line between these two. But, regardless of this specific series, I enjoy writing about best practices and software patterns in anything I&#x27;m working on, and Unity is no exception -- so stay tuned!')
