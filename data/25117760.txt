I learned C and Python with ease from it,\nand wrote several fanfics - all enabled by  the sheer ease of  being able to slide open that keyboard (with the satisfying click) and precision typing a paragraph with what to the outside world must have looked like a series of well-timed squeeze-rubbing motions.<p>I could type blind too - talking and interacting with someone whilst finishing a sentence with my other hand brain. I miss it so much.')
