It takes a lot of discipline to go into a gym and only deadlift upto like 70-75% of your max. The deadlift frankly is easy and fun, it&#x27;s really only a challenging lift in the high 90s of intensity. So people who deadlift, probably do it too often and at too high intensities such that it takes away from other stuff.<p>I think one caveat he doesn&#x27;t mention, is all the pro athletes choosing cleans over deadlifts also have coaches there who are making sure their form is good.<p>In that case then yeh, it&#x27;s a more technical lift and provided you&#x27;re getting good coaching you&#x27;re less likely to burn out your CNS on a clean than on a deadlift.')
