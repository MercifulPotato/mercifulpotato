If it helps you can imagine that the functions have side effects and always evaluate to their input.<p>Maybe think of it this way:<p><pre><code>  xxxxx {\n    xx\n    xx\n    xx {\n      xx\n      xx\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nvs<p><pre><code>  (xxx\n     xx\n     (xx xx xx xx)\n     xx)\n</code></pre>\nI can make a pretty safe guess that the first example is implementing something not worse than O(n^2) before accounting for what the individual calls do, or maybe there is some conditional branching. I can make some guesses about how the code works with probably fair accuracy. That would survive even if I took away the {} braces.<p>In the second example there is not a lot that can be deduced. Whether that matters to you influences whether you are happy coding in a lisp.<p>I prefer the lisps, but there are less hints from the shape of the code.')
