Item(by='maybelsyrup', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605773250, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25138988, text='Transparent plug but also sincere offer: I&#x27;m a psychotherapist. (I&#x27;m also a psychiatric researcher, which made me something of a data scientist, which is how I ended up on HN.) I work in private practice, dealing mainly with relationship and mood issues, and I&#x27;ve seen no small number of men and women in the kinds of fields that make up the HN readership over the course of my career - tech, STEM, etc.<p>It&#x27;ll surprise no one to hear me say that I agree with locochef about investing in oneself through therapy^, but I also want to say that one of the most fascinating and simultaneously scary aspects of my work is seeing day in, day out the degree to which human beings excel at having stress pile up while ignoring it, denying it, believing themselves to somehow deserve it, &quot;tough it out&quot; to nearly-lethal degrees, or being kind of unaware of it entirely. A corollary of this observation is that the people (or the couples, or the families) who decide to see a therapist &quot;early&quot;, when the challenge &#x2F; problem &#x2F; dilemma isn&#x27;t yet at crisis level, are often the ones who benefit most. Like someone said down thread, it&#x27;s like any other part of health: it costs less to not eat those cheeseburgers now than to have the bypass surgery later. Small investments made somewhat early can forestall a lot of ugly shit down the road. Frankly, if half the shit I help people with every day was taught universally in the fifth to tenth grades, I&#x27;d be out of a job (but happily so).<p>If anyone has general questions about therapy or related topics, I&#x27;m happy to answer if I&#x27;m able (or give you a nice &quot;I have no idea&quot; if I don&#x27;t). Email in bio.<p>^ Sometimes! It&#x27;s not for everyone, nor even for the same person at different times of their lives, and it can be harmful or end up being something you regret. But I agree in a general sense.')
