I simply have a different experience with this sort of thing. One example I used in another comment on this thread is random graffiti with a kind message. Those can and have brightened my day, and I don’t feel they are cheapened by the fact that everyone on the street sees them.<p>Though I can tell you “I like your shoes” isn’t in the rotation, things like “you are a special person” are, and I get that it can sound dishonest, but I genuinely believe everyone is special and that some people will receive that message in the way that I intend it. There are also messages like “may you be happy” or “thank you for being here” and perhaps you would agree that these can genuinely be addressed to strangers. I’m certainly grateful for anyone who visits my GitHub repos, or who takes a look at this project and gives me feedback, so thank you. :)')
