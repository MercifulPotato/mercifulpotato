The greater the wealth inequality in a population, the bigger a percentage of this new money goes to an increase of assets as opposed to day-to-day expenses. This shrinks CPI inflation for an equal amount of money supply expansion, which in turn allows the money supply to expand ever faster and inequality to grow further.')
