Limestone calcination: CaCO3 â†’ CaO + CO2<p>The world concrete production is a larger source of GHG than the entire world fleet of trucks used for goods transportation, with some margin. And that&#x27;s only accounting CO2 emitted by the chemical reaction itself, not even accounting for the production of the energy necessary for the reaction, that often comes from natural gas.<p>That CO2 is not being displaced by nuclear power plants, solar panels, wind turbines or batteries in fancy cars. It&#x27;s being replaced by not using concrete anymore. My point is that GHG emissions go way way further than just electricity production or gasoline to power cars or planes: it&#x27;s chemistry (fertilizers, concrete, etc) and metallurgy.<p>I don&#x27;t hear much about it, not least because I think it&#x27;s a very hard problem: right now, using less concrete means less constructions. There aren&#x27;t enough trees, and they don&#x27;t grow quickly enough, to do everything using wood, although that could be a partial solution. But the construction sector employs A LOT of people. So the path to less concrete is a path to fewer jobs, and a shrinking economy...<p>We are in for a very rough ride indeed.')
