Item(by='delroth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611668710, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25915428, text='&gt; I think people just want the same iPhone they have now, with additional &quot;repairale&quot; property. That is not going to happen. The repairable iPhone will be thicker and less elegant than the non-repairable iPhone (compare iPhone to Fiarphone). And suddenly people are not buying it anymore.<p>You&#x27;re going from one extreme to the other. You could for example require Apple to provide access to their spare parts supply chain (replacement batteries, screens, maybe some key ICs that regularly fail, etc.) to independent repair shops. This would greatly increase the repairability and decrease electronics waste. Right now, many repairs aren&#x27;t possible simply because you can&#x27;t find parts, or because customs will block your parts from entering the US, or even because Apple has decided that only they can have the tools to pair a new home button with your current device.')
