EVs are a threat in this regard and you&#x27;ve already seen this play out with the Bolt&#x2F;Volt to a degree.<p>Heck, they wanted ~$300 to run a DPF regen on our truck when it went into limp mode(yay for open-ish OBD protocols so we could do it ourself).<p>I just don&#x27;t see them wanting to sell them and without a channel it doesn&#x27;t matter how good of a product you make.')
