If I read the OP correctly, they have such a common address that random people mindlessly type it into various subscription nags. Can you think of a such @fastmail address?<p>If it&#x27;s not that common, then their address was just leaked and ended up on the spammers list, so tagging as spam is a proper thing to do. However it sounds like the OP also spam-tags bulk emails they don&#x27;t like even if they are subscribed to those, which is as ass thing to do. It hinders delivery to others, nicks the sender reputation, etc.')
