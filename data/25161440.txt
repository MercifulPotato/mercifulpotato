You&#x27;re kid can be in a group chat with their friend and other strangers, which I&#x27;m not delighted about.<p>Downside #1 is that anyone can send a friend request and your child can accept them.  Whenever I go into my kid&#x27;s account I do a friend review - &quot;How do you know this person?&quot;.  My child also always has a dozen pending &quot;friends&quot; requests from as-far-as-I-know complete strangers which I decline for her.<p>Downside #2 is that Roblox can have odd restrictions if &quot;chat&quot; is turned off - you can&#x27;t give your pets names &quot;Adopt Me&quot; for example.')
