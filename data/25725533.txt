Item(by='FeepingCreature', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610347562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25702058, text='&gt; The fairness doctrine only ever applied to broadcast media, it never applied to cable or print media, which FB and Twitter are conceptually much closer to. Nobody ever (seriously) argued that a book publisher should be required to print rebuttals to a recent title. Nobody ever (seriously) argued that cable media had to follow the same pre-1987 FCC guidelines.<p>To be quite forthright - maybe they should have! I mean, I for one will argue that. I don&#x27;t have evidence how much support that view has, sadly. But it seems to me that there should be a line drawn between an editorial service and a utility service, and a utility service should not be permitted to act in an editorial fashion. (In other words, I am a GPL liberal rather than BSD liberal.)')
