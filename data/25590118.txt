It has always been the case, which is important to understand the mindset of the government and the Chinese society in general. The &quot;unemploytables&quot; constitute a &quot;problem&quot; to society, which must be solved. This is not much different than prostitution is a &quot;problem&quot; for most countries. If you follow Xi Jinping&#x27;s rule and his propaganda (which I doubt), his big agenda for 2020 is to &quot;eradicate&quot; poverty, this makes it easier to understand what is really going on in Xin Jiang.  Xin Jiang happens to be a place where both poverty and radicalism are intermingled, so their approach could be different than say, Gui Zhou province (where it&#x27;s mostly poverty).  But this year I&#x27;ve read so much from CCTV (CCP&#x27;s media) that they lifted people from poverty by giving them &quot;a means of living&quot;.')
