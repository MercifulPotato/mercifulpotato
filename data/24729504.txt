Can you trust the food you buy at the supermarket or at the restaurant is not poisonous? That your doctor or partner isn&#x27;t going to kill you in your sleep? That policemen will not shoot you? That drivers won&#x27;t run you over?<p>It&#x27;s not about science. Society is impossible without trust.<p>^ except that scientists do check each other&#x27;s work and occasionally find mistakes. Scientific progress is real and has provided concrete and undeniable improvements to people&#x27;s lives, and this should give credibility to science as a whole. But I see your point, outsiders cannot understand nor verify science without the proper training and equipment.')
