I wasn&#x27;t alive in 50&#x27;s or the 60&#x27;s (and I was too young to even remember the 70&#x27;s), so my whole life I just took for granted that what the history books had to say about racial inequalities at those times was true.  It&#x27;s hard to miss, though, that people are saying the <i>exact same things</i> today when I can look around and observe that they aren&#x27;t true and haven&#x27;t been at any point in my lifetime.  It doesn&#x27;t make me question my perspective on the world as it is today, it makes me wonder how true the history books reflected reality at that time.')
