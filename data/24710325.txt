In Greece, UHT milk is often sold in similar packaging as fresh milk (i.e. in plastic bottles rather than cartons) and placed in the refrigerated section alongside fresh milk.<p>To confuse matters further, some UHT milk is sold separately, outside the fridge and in the typical carton packaging that one expects it. So it&#x27;s very easy to be confused about what is UHT and what is fresh, just by looking at where a product is and how it&#x27;s packaged.<p>Of course you&#x27;d think that the taste would give the milk away- but I find that if UHT milk is refrigerated, its &quot;burned milk&quot; taste is much reduced and can easily fool someone who only drinks a little milk at a time or mixed with other foods or drinks, e.g. in their coffee or cereals.')
