(I&#x27;m still not sure we ever found out <i>how</i> exactly it was recorded?) So there were lots of announcements that certain governments &quot;knew&quot; or &quot;suspected&quot; it was Saudi Arabia with little or no substance to back up their claims until the existence of the recording was later leaked.<p>I think there was similar discussion after MH17 when western governments &quot;knew&quot; Russia-backed rebels had shot down the plane and only later did we learn there was a recording of a conversation about what happened.<p>I guess even after Snowden governments like to do their best to pretend they don&#x27;t have the entire world under surveillance at all times.')
