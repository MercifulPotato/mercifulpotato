I buy used cars coming off their three year lease. Most leases require all the service be done on time and by the dealer so you know you&#x27;re getting a quality used car - and I&#x27;m saving thousands of dollars. Then you drive it for five years because there&#x27;s a market for people looking for cheap, reliable cars for second cars or for their kids to drive. Seems to work for all involved and for me personally, I&#x27;m minimizing my purchase price while minimizing my need to do major repairs.')
