Two columns. Why? In the 1980&#x27;s computer science conferences like STOC and FOCS would hand out telephone-book sized proceedings, and it took two columns to squeeze it all in. Not relevant now, but the two columns make it that much harder to read on a tablet. I don&#x27;t generally wish ill on anyone, but it&#x27;s hard not to wish that the editors responsible for this idiotic convention would just die or retire in either order.')
