Where we probably differ is that I also uphold the rights of private companies, however large, to set their own standards of what can be posted to their platform. Now, if we want to have the debate about whether the platforms are too large, have too much power to shape the conversations we have, etc, we can have that debate. But it isn&#x27;t censorship for a private company to remove information it believes violates it&#x27;s standards (whether because it&#x27;s false, misleading, or for other reasons).')
