If you think it would be more effective to take a straight dose of 10mg than to use the time release mechanism, I think you could achieve this by getting the drug out of the pills you already have.<p>I am also using concerta because it is the only form of ritalin legal in my country. I don&#x27;t really notice a difference compared to taking ritalin the other way.')
