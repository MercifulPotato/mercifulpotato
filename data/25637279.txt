Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609791533, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25636879, text='I think the implication with many of the &quot;it&#x27;s just a bubble&quot; comments is that &quot;it&#x27;s just a bubble [...and after it crashes it will fade into irrelevancy (eg. tulips or beanie babies)]&quot;. In that respect the prediction has yet come to fruition. However, if you&#x27;re talking about it being a bubble in the same way that the stock market or the economy has bubbles[1] you wouldn&#x27;t be wrong. The GP mentioned &quot;Once it pops then the fun will be over&quot;, which makes me think he&#x27;s closer to the first camp than the second camp.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Business_cycle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Business_cycle</a>')
