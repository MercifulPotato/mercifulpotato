If you are wealthy you want your assets to increase in value but what you 100% want to avoid is that the income of workers is increasing. The easiest way to achieve that is by... letting the central bank give the wealthy more money but not give the poor a single penny.<p>If an average worker makes $20&#x2F;h and you own $100 million you want to grow to $200 million but if an average worker now makes $40&#x2F;h you haven&#x27;t gained anything. Worse, if inflation is greater on the consumer side (the money is flowing into assets first so this will never happen) you can actually end up with &quot;only&quot; a $200 million net worth but workers who demand $60&#x2F;h. You are actually less wealthy than before despite the increase in net worth! Workers massively benefit from consumer inflation.')
