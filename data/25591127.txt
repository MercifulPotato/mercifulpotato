In particular, just 60 years ago you could find small clams almost in any beach and we believe homo erectus ate those.<p>But just less than 80 years ago, rivers started carrying all kind of new chemical compounds, like mines&#x27; waste, from coal cleaning particles to mercury and cadmium compounds.<p>Then we added other chemicals like detergents, or machine oils, or silver halides from photography, plastifiers and plastic or resins synthesis residues, Hormones like &quot;the pill&quot;, fertilizers, heavy metals like Pb, industrial acids, pharmaceutical residues and I could go on and on.<p>In some places like in the Mediterranean sea clams just have been dissolved by acid waters or pollution just killed most of them.<p>This is specially true in the river mouth of big industrial rivers.<p>It is not lack of rationality, quite the contrary, people with information,like those that do quality analysis of waters will never eat things like fish coming out of some of them.')
