The most effective way is probably teaching something, although sharing your &quot;behind the scenes&quot; story can work as well.<p>0-10: Start with friends. If you&#x27;re on twitter for example, following your friends will get you your first few follow-backs<p>10-50: decide what you&#x27;re going to be &quot;about&quot;.  Don&#x27;t tweet&#x2F;post about everything - pick ONE or TWO major topics, and just post about those, with the goal of _helping_ people.  Share your knowledge.  Then, start replying with helpful posts to other big names.<p>50-100: same as 10-50.  Make sure your bio is hyper focused on your one or two topics, and that you post consistently, and with posts that provide a ton of value.  Answer people&#x27;s questions in public.<p>How I did it:<p>exactly the same as above until about 500 followers on twitter.  Then I had a _giant_ follow event with the twitter thread &quot;Learn React in 10 Tweets&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;chrisachard&#x2F;status&#x2F;1175022111758442497" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;chrisachard&#x2F;status&#x2F;1175022111758442497</a><p>After that (and gaining several hundred followers in a day, then several thousand in a few more days), it became easier to get engagement on posts.  Continue to be helpful to people, and people will continue to follow.<p>I wrote about the process here too: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrisachard.com&#x2F;triple-your-twitter-following" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrisachard.com&#x2F;triple-your-twitter-following</a>')
