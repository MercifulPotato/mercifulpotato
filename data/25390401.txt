If Facebook acts against these radical groups without a court order their Republican investors and shareholders will flee en masse. A federal order is unlikely due to Trump&#x27;s appointments and lack of precedent or law. A new law is unlikely because Mitch McConnell would sooner die of covid19 then let the democrats score a win, or make Republican social media wetwork harder in the future. McConnell is a founding father of the modern problems with money in Congress and he&#x27;s been boosting about it for decades.<p>So, to sum it up. Mark is choosing to not do anything and keep profiting off of this shit because he has the legal cover to do so from Trump down. Trump just wants to kill platforms that aren&#x27;t for him, just like he wants all democrat votes shredded..')
