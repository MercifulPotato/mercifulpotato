If you don&#x27;t trust the site or don&#x27;t think you are going to use it for more than a trial then if you use your real email address you risk getting spam either through database leaks, because they have signed you up to a bunch of newsletters or because after signing up for a thousand different sites you get privacy policy updates every week.')
