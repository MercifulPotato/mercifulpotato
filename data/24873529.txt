For an obvious example, see public sector unions. For another, NASA. The public school system. In the news lately are the police interests. The military. Organized religion.<p>They wield considerable political power via controlling large voting blocks.<p>Other means historically used are military power. The end of the Roman republic is an obvious example, but the historical examples are endless. (Even in the US, George Washington was offered a military dictatorship, but turned it down.)<p>None of these are capitalist, and all are present in non-capitalist systems. The idea that under non-capitalism there wouldn&#x27;t be powerful special interests is hopelessly untrue.')
