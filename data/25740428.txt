Every times I have to setup emails, I feel a pain, and anyone I talked to (my co-worker) share that pain. And at that point, to me, it validated my idea.<p>But shipping your side project while having a day job is hard, especially if you had kids(I do).<p>Here are a few tips to make it works:<p>1. Work on your side project first. I woke up at 3:30AM and work till 8AM. Not every day of course but at first month it was like that<p>2. Don&#x27;t focus on weekend. You should rest on weekend. Why? You asked? Because it give you a wrong illusion that you will have a lot of time on weekend which isn&#x27;t. On weekend, you will have to take you kids out, help family, cleaning up houses etc. The gap between weekends are 7days, you easily lost momentum, and if you skipped one week, it easily to go down the rabbit hole and skip doing the whole thing.<p>3. Have a weekly sync with someone you can show and tell about your product and your progress. Make sure you demo what you worked on. It forces you to ship daily.<p>4. Pick an ideas that requires minimun front-end work or on-boarding work.<p>5. Ship frequently. Have a real domain and a site even if no one looks at it. Deploy to it often. Post it to social media even though no one gonna read it :-).<p>All the tricks is to force you into a mode where you can see progress and trick yourself into thinking you are shipping a real product until it become a real product.<p>IMHO, companies don&#x27;t care and don&#x27;t want to steal your work but obviously they don&#x27;t want you to develop the same thing that the company do or work on your own idea to achieve same thing. So don&#x27;t worry too much about conflict as long as you work on something else.')
