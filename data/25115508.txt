It failed because despite how hard you try to tell people that it&#x27;s nothing to worry about, people will start to realize that hospitals are overrun. Your solution is not only demonstrably poor, but is also how we ended up in this mess. It&#x27;s a tall order to tell people there&#x27;s &quot;nothing wrong&quot; while nurses are working 12 hours shifts.')
