They love to &quot;know more than&quot; even if they have to make it all up. The paradox is their assessments are supposed to be reliable. How can anyone trust a word any of them ever say? That&#x27;s the stupidity. They&#x27;re all very &quot;bright&quot;, they just don&#x27;t have any scruples at all. It&#x27;s basically a social club for sociopaths, wannabe &quot;unlanded&quot; social-climbers and insecure narcissists who just gotta find a way they can pretend to be better than anyone else. I don&#x27;t think this unprofessionalism applies to military&#x2F;signals intelligence which is too strict and results focused, only the other &quot;human&quot; types. But the reality is you need people like that, you need people that are easy to control. That&#x27;s why so many of them have some sort of dirty secret, because the organizations can more easily rely on people they can blackmail. The obsession with secrecy is not just an occupational requirement, it&#x27;s a deep seated psychology issue for many of the people, that becomes an organizational psychology issue, because of all the twisted crazies they have roaming around in their ranks.')
