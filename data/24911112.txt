Slack also tried to make this argument in the name of &quot;security&quot; when I wrote to them about it. But yes to your point, NO they do not get a say in what users install.<p><pre><code>  Thank you for taking the time to write in and share \n  your concerns.\n  We hear you and understand how important this issue is \n  to developers. As a communication company we want to \n  make sure we don&#x27;t put our customers and their data at \n  risk, and it&#x27;s something we take very seriously. We \n  provide a full-featured platform with many avenues for \n  improving user experience while working with Slack, but \n  we need to also provide the security and privacy \n  controls business owners, IT administrators, and users \n  expect. We&#x27;re happy to continue the conversation about \n  UX improvements and future extensions to the platform. \n  This is something we&#x27;ll keep working on as we listen to \n  feedback from the developer community.\n\n\n  That is a cop out and you know it. An it administrator \n  or corporate is not using this extension and they would \n  lock down their users from installing BROWSER \n  extensions if they thought that was a security risk. \n\n\n  Thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate your \n  thoughts on this matter.\n  I&#x27;d like to pose a hypothetical to you if you don&#x27;t \n  mind! Bearing in mind Slack is a product designed to \n  help teams work together and is geared towards business \n  and enterprises — imagine for a second we&#x27;re working \n  with an enterprise considering adopting Slack and their \n  security team comes across this extension (or something \n  like it) — and identifies it as a \n  security&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;reliability concern. Our job is to \n  alleviate these concerns. They expect better from us \n  and we&#x27;re doing our best to meet and even exceed those \n  expectations. We&#x27;re certainly not perfect and we can \n  always do better — for businesses big and small and for \n  developers.\n  It is important to note here, we&#x27;re learning from this \n  experience. We&#x27;re working with the developer to find a \n  middle-ground which is beneficial to everyone involved. \n  We&#x27;re reevaluating our processes for these situations. \n  We&#x27;re listening to feedback from users such as yourself \n  and identifying areas we could improve.\n  I understand this has been a disappointing and \n  frustrating situation and I do apologise for any \n  difficulty it has caused you. I promise you, we&#x27;re \n  working on it. I for one am very excited to see what \n  comes from this. It&#x27;s been a learning opportunity for \n  us all.\n  Let me know if you have any questions, or suggestions. \n  I&#x27;m here to help!</code></pre>')
