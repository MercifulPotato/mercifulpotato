But this is not in dispute.<p>The post doesn&#x27;t appear to be disputing that the fire in a theater example is a legitimate illustration of the limits of speech under the first amendment. They just proceed from there to make a more general principle that this example can be invoked by people who intend to suppress speech. Which I also don&#x27;t think is in dispute.<p>So I don&#x27;t think that post has anything to do with anything, insofar as this comment thread is concerned.')
