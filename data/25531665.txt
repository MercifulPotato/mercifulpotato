Let me drive the damn car and not fidget with my phone or your distracted driving inducing touchscreen buttonless usability nightmare that is in fashion in cars today (see Tesla).<p>In my Mercedes they charge thousands more for &quot;hands free calling package&quot; when my basic toyota comes with that out of the box. This upselling of basic tech functionality needs to end and I&#x27;m glad Tesla and hopefully Apple car disrupt the mired incumbents.')
