I believe that stance is misguided. I&#x27;ll illustrate why with a story. A few years ago, my best friend, who is blind, was trying to do something on PayPal, and couldn&#x27;t complete the task with his screen reader. I tried to do the same task, with the same screen reader, and didn&#x27;t have any problem. So I figure we got caught in an A&#x2F;B test or phased rollout. And it occurred to me that PayPal would never know that he failed to complete the process because he was using a screen reader. If we allowed websites to know what screen reader a user is running, they could collect useful data that could help them improve. And frankly, the problem that we actually have with accessibility is not willful discrimination, but indifference.<p>P.S. It was a weird feeling to hear the name of a product that I developed from the ground up in the &quot;What about ...&quot; section heading. Yeah, I&#x27;m talking about System Access, the most obscure (and perhaps poorly named) screen reader mentioned in the article. No offense taken though; I understand where the author is coming from.')
