You get a sweet house with a reasonable lot instead of a tiny flat. Likely better access to nature, more calm environment etc. If you&#x27;re fine with a run down house and want to fix it up yourself, it&#x27;s easy to buy a liveable house with a garden and whatnot in bumfucknowhere for really cheap. Cheap as in less than a year&#x27;s salary of a programmer in a city.<p>Commute varies a lot depending on specific location. Want to live in a village in a national park? You&#x27;re looking into at least a good hour off-peak to two hours including city traffic. Random small town? May be an hour, may be two. If you want to stick close to your parents and they happen to live deep in backcountry... You may be looking into 3-4h one way depending on which city the company is located in.')
