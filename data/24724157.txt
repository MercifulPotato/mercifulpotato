Upload or paste an excel or csv file that contains latitudes and longitudes or addresses and instantly see your data in a table and map. In the event that the file does not have latitudes and longitudes, we ask the user to select the address components and we will geocode each record on their behalf. Everything done while in the tool is saved to the user&#x27;s Google Drive if they are logged in.<p>I have a few example datasets on the homepage that you can use to test if you donâ€™t have a location dataset available.<p>A little background:\nWorking as a programmer in the real estate space, it seems that all anyone wants is to see their data on a map. This project is meant to create a generic website that anyone can use to do just that without any custom code or tedious setup.')
