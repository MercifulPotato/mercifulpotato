I&#x27;ve done the whole &quot;work not socialize&quot; thing and it comes up in 1:1&#x27;s as anti-social behavior.<p>Same. I&#x27;ve had managers in the past express this in different ways. Eventually I learned to just be present, smile, and crack some jokes. Usually that affords me the ability to say my dog needs me, or something.<p>&gt; Self-learning was the only way to getting a successful career after a very toxic &quot;education&quot; experience I went through in the middle-of-nowhere Iowa.<p>Mine was a private school. Interestingly the content was great. The methodology for teaching was not so much.<p>&gt; I legitimately do not know if I would be OK if it wasn&#x27;t for the internet. It allowed me to self-learn whenever I could, and allowed me a platform&#x2F;audience to hone skills.<p>I thank my lucky stars the internet and IRC knew what to do with me.<p>Thanks for sharing, we should definitely get weekend-citizen-beers sometime.')
