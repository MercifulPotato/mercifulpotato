Dairy production is just another demand created in the modern world by marketers and little to do with actual nutrition [1].<p>The dairy farmers in this article try to portray a peaceful relationship between farmer and cow, yet 99% of dairy in the US is produced in factory farms quite different from idyllic pastures [2].
