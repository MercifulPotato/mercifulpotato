There&#x27;s X11-specifc solutions and Weston has a config option for this, but I would absolutely love to be able to just load a kernel module that I could pass a number of displays and their resolutions and it would pop them up seamlessly, just as if I plugged in a display adapter.<p>EDIT: I did find evdi [0], but it&#x27;s broken for the kernel I&#x27;m using. Does anyone have any experience with it?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DisplayLink&#x2F;evdi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DisplayLink&#x2F;evdi</a>')
