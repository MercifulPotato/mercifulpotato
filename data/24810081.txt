Item(by='ironman1478', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602943782, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24805717, text='C++ has a serious tooling and discoverability issue. The syntax of c++ can be annoying and there are other oddities, but that isn&#x27;t going away. C++ isn&#x27;t about making the easy things easy, it&#x27;s about making the hard things not intractable (you can&#x27;t build a self driving car or a game in python).<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that the compilers don&#x27;t automically turn on -werror, -wall and other useful flags that can help alleviate lots of arcane issues. I also think the tool maintainers do a poor job of promoting the use of UBSAN, ASAN, TSAN, etc. If you watch talks, you&#x27;ll learn about these tools that solve most headaches, but you have to be so in the know to be aware that these tools exist. You have to dedicate time outside of working hours to really absorb all this information and imo that&#x27;s unacceptable. Other languages put a larger effort towards making their tooling easy to use and provide amazing documentation (c# is the best at this imo). I&#x27;m a c++ dev and I love it in a masochistic way, but if these issues aren&#x27;t addressed rust will eat c++&#x27;s lunch.')
