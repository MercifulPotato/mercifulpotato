That joke &quot;proof&quot; only works for natural numbers and goes like this:<p>Theorem: all natural numbers are interesting<p>* Base case: 0 is interesting because it is the smallest natural number, as well as the identity element of + operation.<p>* Inductive case: Assume the theorem holds for all m, m&lt;n. Take n. If it is not interesting, then n is the smallest non-interesting number. But that&#x27;s interesting because it&#x27;s the smallest such number. Therefore it cannot be non-interesting. Therefore theorem holds for n.<p>By induction, we conclude all natural numbers are interesting. QED.')
