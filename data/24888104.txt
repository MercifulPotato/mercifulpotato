A 5% chance of rain is a mathematical possibility but people &quot;feel&quot; like 5% = &quot;will never happen&quot; and get angry if it rains.<p>Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman&#x27;s life&#x27;s work is about this, what he calls &quot;System 1&quot; and &quot;System 2&quot; of our brain, where System 1 is a fast responder that provides insta-feedback but is largely incapable of processing mathematical inputs. His 2011 book &quot;Thinking Fast and Slow&quot; summarizes his work well.<p>I&#x27;m not sure popular media can be trained to frame statistical probabilities in a way that doesn&#x27;t provide people with the certainty they crave. But who knows?')
