Hardware that&#x27;s built to run free software out of the box is important, and it would be ideal if all those blobs were gone and we didn&#x27;t have to worry about them. I&#x27;d absolutely be on board with an effort to enforce free drivers for the hardware we buy.<p>But... in the short term, given that&#x27;s not currently the case, we still need a way to move forward, right? And it&#x27;s much easier to demonstrate why free drivers are important if you have working software to show for it. (&quot;Hey, there&#x27;s this whole phone OS and app ecosystem that we could run on this hardware if it had free drivers!&quot;)<p>That said, yes, the endless reverse engineering required to keep the devices you&#x27;ve bought secure beyond the 2 or 3 years that the manufacturer supports it is ridiculous. I wish it weren&#x27;t so. But given that that&#x27;s unfortunately the situation we&#x27;re in, I applaud anyone contributing to the RE efforts. (But I sure am keeping an eye on hardware that doesn&#x27;t require it!)')
