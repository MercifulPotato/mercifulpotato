Lots of people know about the genocide in an intellectual sense, although that doesn&#x27;t affect their politics and they don&#x27;t appreciate reminders.<p>Free speech protections weren&#x27;t obviously relevant to the genocide as it has occurred, although it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me to learn e.g. that a native counterpart to Frederick Douglass had been silenced unfairly. As for speech in the other direction, the worst things were said (and done) by the &quot;greatest statesmen&quot; [0] so I doubt that corporate speech codes would have been much help. If it isn&#x27;t too presumptuous of me to observe, it&#x27;s unlikely that such things would have done much to slow down Hitler or Mussolini either.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indiancountrytoday.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;nice-day-for-a-genocide-shocking-quotes-on-indians-by-u-s-leaders-pt-2-itTXslul5EKc694gf4DLfA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indiancountrytoday.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;nice-day-for-a-genoci...</a>')
