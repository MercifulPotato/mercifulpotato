This has been especially valuable for the CFO, the most inward-facing of executives.  It&#x27;s surprisingly common for the CFO not to really know what the product is beyond what&#x27;s in the company&#x27;s own sales literature and what comes through by what&#x27;s discussed on the P&#x2F;L.  Very enlightening.')
