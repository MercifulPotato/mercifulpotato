Cause of course, the remarketing plugin the client needs&#x2F;wants installed just introduced some weird edge-case bug when used in combination with the latest version of the forms plugin you use. Or they ask (demand) administrative privileges &quot;cause they&#x27;re paying&quot; and proceed to start messing with the configuration themselves and destroy everything. All the local development copies in the world won&#x27;t make it less temperamental and brittle.<p>Its success - IMHO - doesn&#x27;t have much to do with its technological merits but familiarity. Most &quot;content&quot; people know how to use WP, so companies like to have WP for their content management.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m just bitter of my time working in the kind of environments that tend to focus on WP.
