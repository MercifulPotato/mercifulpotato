I measure between 1.5 and 5.0 milliseconds out of Azure App Service, for example.<p>Compare with the same Azure region where VM-to-VM can easily get down to 50 microseconds, which is within spitting distance of the underlying storage latency of 20-40 microseconds for Optane SSDs.<p>NVDIMMs have latencies of a few hundred nanoseconds! Getting anywhere near that kind of latency to really unlock the potential would require the cloud vendors to stop wasting everyone&#x27;s time with layers upon layers of network abstractions. There would have to be a fundamental rethink of how data centre networking is architected, public or private. No more deep packet inspection firewalls. No more deep buffers on switch ports.
