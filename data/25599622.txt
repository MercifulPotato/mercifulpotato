Item(by='wtallis', descendants=None, kids=[25603581], score=None, time=1609463685, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25598623, text='Again, <i>what the hell are SIM cards for?</i> Skip the alphabet soup, please.<p>On some level, a SIM card must authenticate you to the local tower operator as authorized to place calls, and identify what other carrier gets billed for that if you&#x27;re roaming. They also identify (in an authenticated manner) what the phone number is for your cell phone, so that the local tower operator can start routing calls to that number to your handset. This seems sufficient for the local tower operator to ensure that you aren&#x27;t using your smartphone to place tons of robocalls with spoofed numbers, using only infrastructure that is already universally implemented.<p>I don&#x27;t see where a landline telco on the receiving end of calls originating from your smartphone needs to know anything about any of that process; the mobile network operator that&#x27;s connecting the first hop of your call can be and should be the one responsible for preventing you from abusing the network. I want <i>my</i> phone company to hold the mobile network to that standard before letting calls from that network make my phone ring.<p>&gt; This goes back to the suggested shaken&#x2F;stir method of authentication. There is really no other way to determine what is valid and what is not. The carrier can attach nearly any number and that number can be entirely valid.<p>This sounds again like you&#x27;re deciding ahead of time that the problem can only be addressed by a technical solution that turns out to be basically intractable. You&#x27;re saying that solving the spoofed robocall problem requires every telco to be able to fully validate in realtime who owns what number and is roaming where. I&#x27;m pointing out a relatively non-technical solution where each network is only responsible for restricting the bullshit the let into their network, at the boundaries where it seems practical to enforce without overhauling the entire protocol stack for the whole industry. And lax enforcement would get a carrier blacklisted, or at least make all calls originating from their network readily identifiable as <i>suspicious</i> and trivially blockable.')
