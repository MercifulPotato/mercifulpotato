My sister went off to the states almost 20 years ago. Got a job as a teacher, she was trained for it here in Sweden.<p>At the time I worked at a small web hosting company, we had her personal homepage for free since she was my sis.<p>Suddenly she calls me from the states telling me I need to go into her website and edit out some links.<p>Apparently lawyers working for the school where she was applying to work had found her homepage (which she made under an alias and afaik had no references to her person) and didn&#x27;t like some of the links on it.<p>I&#x27;m still blown away by this. The links were about certain sexual fetishes, but again, her website was under a pseudonym. I have no idea how they connected it to her. Could have been something dead simple like her using an e-mail address on the same domain, or using her pseudonym in her e-mail address on hotmail. She wasn&#x27;t that careful about remaining anonymous, it was just a thing back then that people would have alter-egos online.')
