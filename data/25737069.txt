They hurt a messenger that has done a great deal of good for protestors and other political rebels.<p>If I take the kindest interpretation of your statements, they are factually wrong in whole but true in part. That is, the Telegram server code is closed source, yes. But Telegram clients and the protocols they use to &quot;speak&quot; are all either open source or documented where source code isn&#x27;t applicable (MTProto 2). What&#x27;s more is that reproducible builds are available for Android and iOS.<p>There&#x27;s nothing really wrong with MTProto 2. You appear to be pointing to a very long time ago when MTProto 1 was in use. MTProto 2 is based on standard crypto primitives and is well-documented. No vulnerabilities have been announced by security researchers in the years it&#x27;s been in use. It is ok that not everyone uses the Signal Protocol. Not everything needs to descend from Moxie.<p>I run my own Matrix homeserver and it&#x27;s great. I also have it rolled out to all our employees at my workplace. It&#x27;s an excellent choice. I also use Telegram because I appreciate its&#x27; balance of features and security. All of my family members love Telegram and that makes me happy because they&#x27;re not using a Facebook product.<p>The way Matrix handles keys for E2E by default is not great: it&#x27;s very easy for users to lose the key encryption phrase or not care and throw it away. I&#x27;m not sure how much better we can make E2E by default.<p>I am completely ok with turning on Secret Chats as I need them for chats I know to be disposable. My message history is extremely precious to me and Telegram does an admirable job protecting it and making it searchable for later reference. It truly is a sort of outboard brain for me.<p>This does not need to be a turf war between Signal people and Telegram people. I have expressed many times on the Telegram subreddit the need to come together in our use of better tools for communication than the incumbents. A person choosing Telegram or Signal over WhatsApp and Discord is a huge win for all of us.')
