The rotary engine is the most interesting thing about the RX-8, but without it it&#x27;s still an overall pretty good car, and there&#x27;s a surplus of used RX-8s out there with about 100,000 miles that need an apex seal replacement at the least, which the owners are willing to unload very cheaply.<p>I could have looked for an RX-7, but those seem to be a lot more expensive and harder to find, and besides I like the look of the RX-8.  I also wanted modern safety features and a vehicle that&#x27;s relatively new.  The RX-7 is about 200 pounds lighter, but it&#x27;s also a 2-seater so less room to haul stuff.  (Mazda also made a rotary pickup which would also be an awesome conversion, but those are much rarer.)<p>Really, the main decision point for me was whether to get an RX-8, or go with a Miata, which is about a thousand pounds lighter.  In some ways, the Miata might have been a better choice, but I live in a rainy climate and sometimes want to transport large objects.  Also, used Miatas tend to be either thirty years old or expensive, so I went with the RX-8.<p>As for what I&#x27;ll do with it?  Mostly just use it to get around town, like any other car.  I&#x27;ve never owned anything that one could plausibly describe as a &quot;sports car&quot;, and I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll do any stereotypical sports car things like drive it up and down windy roads or take it to a track.  It should at least perform decently.  The motor I&#x27;m putting in it is about 120 HP, which is a lot less than the 230 or so HP that the rotary could put out, but the torque is about the same and I get full torque from 0 rpm.  I&#x27;m keeping the 6-speed and clutch, so that should go a long way towards not needing a super-powerful motor.<p>The hard part of the project so far has been building the battery enclosures for about 450 pounds of LiFePO4 cells, a little over half of which go in the engine compartment, and the rest go under the car where the gas tank was.  It&#x27;ll be a little heavier and probably have the weight a little forward of where it was originally, but it should be at least close.<p>Tl;dr: RX-8s are really cheap if you don&#x27;t need a working engine, and if you&#x27;re going to convert a sedan you might as well go with something with something more fun than a Toyota Corolla or whatever.')
