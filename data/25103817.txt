If you don&#x27;t think it should be here, flag it and hide it and move on. If it gets removed it gets removed, if it doesn&#x27;t, well you&#x27;ve hidden it so it doesn&#x27;t matter anyway. It wouldn&#x27;t have made the front page if people hadn&#x27;t been interested in it and upvoted it.<p>The story isn&#x27;t really politics or crime, it&#x27;s a company forking an open source project and taking over the name.<p>I personally find these kinds of stories interesting. Especially this, I&#x27;ve seen some underhanded attacks on open source before, but this one&#x27;s one I haven&#x27;t really seen and it seems pretty insidious to me.')
