But there is a World cup every four years and in most cups in the past, let&#x27;s say, 20 years, there is an eliminatory game with an equally great or greater goal. I think this goal has become legendary because of:<p>- Maradona&#x27;s dominance as a player throughout the -86 cup\n- The Falkland Islands war just a few years prior giving this game a special tension and attention\n- It&#x27;s beauty relative other goals at the time<p>My comment is just a reflection to often heard comments about it being the greatest goal ever. Judging it just by what the clip shows, it has faded for me.  But the historical context is important.')
