A second person comes along and builds their own system&#x2F;software b&#x2F;c of some real or perceived issue with existing software (for example someone thinks something is poorly designed or not the right(tm) technology, etc). This second system then forces integration, APIs, TCP connections between apps.<p>No big deal, right? But the next person comes along and says &quot;I don&#x27;t like those systems - I want to put tech3 on my resume (a little resume oriented architecture, anyone?) and they build a 3rd system.<p>Now it&#x27;s really hard to develop features across those apps. One has to be an expert in all those techs. Integration becomes 80% of the work. Now ppl <i>have</i> to create new or buy software just to get anything done. And so it goes.<p>There&#x27;s a name for this, used a lot on this site.')
