Why would this be RW? Well, RW fear &quot;being controlled&quot; and have a deep distrust of the state. They like their freedom, and don&#x27;t like to be told what to do, even if that would be in their best interest. So they reject this idea of being told &quot;inject this into your body&quot; and concoct stories about how the state plans to give everyone autism. Same with flouride in the water, etc.<p>At the same time, well-off mums that probably vote left or green reject vaccines too, but for different reasons.')
