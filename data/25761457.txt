He lets things get approved by other people and then goes back and quietly rewrites it later and has his buddy approve it. Sure, my code could use some improvement occasionally. But it isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> bad and he could just comment on it when I do a PR. He does not do this to anyone else.<p>I don&#x27;t want this to be about the fact that I am a minority in tech and the only one on the team. But, I am pretty sure it is. My career has been blissfully absent of these kinds of issues thus far and I have no idea how to handle it.')
