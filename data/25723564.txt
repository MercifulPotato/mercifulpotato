Item(by='masswerk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610332101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720266, text='Actually, I do own a MBA&#x2F;M1 and it is certainly not similar to a Chromebook. (It just happened that the energy management of my old MBA became bricked by an OS update, so I had to jump the train for a first generation device, against all considerations.) Hardware-wise, I&#x27;m positively surprised.<p>Regarding the real issue, Big Sur, it&#x27;s in its infancy and you can&#x27;t fall back to OSX, which might be the real show stopper for some. Personally, I&#x27;ve been using Apple systems for 30 years now, and I&#x27;ve always been disappointed by every major revision since Snow Leopard. However, Big Sur, against all odds, isn&#x27;t actually as bad as I expected (being the zoo of micro modes that it is). Some stability and maintenance issues are to be expected from a brand new OS, and Big Sur isn&#x27;t the Black Swan invalidating the general advice to never aspire to early adopting an entirely new platform, if your primary goal is stability. I would certainly advice against an upgrade at this early stage for a production machine, if you can do with a previous revision. That said, my personal verdict on Big Sur is still pending. Let&#x27;s seeâ€¦<p>And, I can&#x27;t see where any of the changes, which are related to the issues listed above, are related to the M1 architecture. Rather, you may point at the T2, which isn&#x27;t exactly new, but has been gaining some in importance, and the general perspective on OS security, as exhibited by Big Sur.<p>PS: Some real criticism of the hardware (however, not related to the M1 architecture): Lack of ports (my old MBA had USB on either side and a card reader in about the same form factor!), no MagSafe, somewhat hollow audio (probably related to repurposing the old shell, now using space formerly occupied by fans as overly bass heavy resonance chambers.) An overall more flimsy feel of the shell and keyboard (again, as compared to an older predecessor.)<p>PPS: This is my 3rd ARM device and it certainly <i>is</i> a game changer.')
