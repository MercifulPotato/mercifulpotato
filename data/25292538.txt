Your perspective changes when you have kids.<p>As a personal anecdote, we just had our first baby 3 months ago.  My wife had spent the last 3 years getting her masters degree and getting her teaching certificate.  She pushed hard. It was important to her.  She got the email that her certification came through the day after the birth.  She didn&#x27;t care.  All she want&#x27;s to do right now is take care of her baby.  That will likely change, and she&#x27;ll probably work part time sometime in the future.  But saying we&#x27;ve deprived half the population of their right to work is missing another perspective.  The joy and privilege of raising a family.  Yes, the efficiencies are wonderful, and for my wife (and for me), that means more time with our family.<p>Who is being deprived now?  I would hate to see my daughter deprived of her time with Mom so Mom could sit in an office all day.  And I feel like our society is suffering because kids aren&#x27;t being raised by their parents anymore.')
