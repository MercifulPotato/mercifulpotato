It&#x27;s not our business, quite literally. It is (or was, earlier in the discussion) entirely possible they have a license, the parties are fine with it, and they just don&#x27;t want the rest of the world to know or care.<p>Second, you literally have contributors themselves starting to come to defend him against you:<p>&gt; I’m @{name} in your CC list and I was hired to work on Octotree. I’m no longer involved, but I was there when we rewrote Octotree. Just so you know.<p>Is it possible <i>some</i> people may have been wronged here? Sure. Is it possible they haven&#x27;t? Yes. We don&#x27;t know, but even before you even knew some were paid and all that, you&#x27;d already leveled an accusation against them of bad faith and gotten people all across the world piling on. Given you&#x27;ve gotten at least part of this wrong so far, one would think maybe a less confidence in your accusation might&#x27;ve in fact been warranted, <i>especially</i> given you&#x27;re just a bystander?')
