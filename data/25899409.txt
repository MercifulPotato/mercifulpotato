It would however probably mean a change of business model.<p>Whatsapp could say &quot;we&#x27;ll never profit from you data, we&#x27;ll only give them to law enforcement after review of the request and we delete all after 5 years&quot;, 3 lines and easy to enforce in front of a judge. In truth, none of those auto-approved contracts nobody reads can fully be trusted to be enforced by a judge. The excuse of &quot;I misunderstood it and just clicked anyway to talk to my children&quot; could very well be a defence. You can&#x27;t say &quot;if you breath, it means you accepted this contract of 2000 lines of legalese&quot;.<p>One day I suspect, at least the EU, they&#x27;ll think of doing something where you can&#x27;t deny service for non-respect of a new contract and will have to offer a multi layer service for each contract level. That sounds rational and I can&#x27;t believe a company can lock me out of an email service or whatever just because I can&#x27;t accept a contract change I don&#x27;t even understand.')
