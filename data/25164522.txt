The verb &quot;is&quot; does not mean &quot;fulfills the same function as&quot;.  Just because atheists have to answer the same questions as theists does not make atheism a religion.<p>If you want a word to describe what atheism and religion have in common, I&#x27;d go with &quot;spirituality&quot;.  Not in the sense of &quot;burning incense&quot; or &quot;believing in ghosts&quot; but rather in the sense of holding beliefs that are not rational and deciding to care about the world and about humanity in particular.')
