The area they have narrowed down is nearly in line with the mountain range that falls off into the ocean.<p>The way ocean waves &#x2F; currents hit the topology of that mountain range?  Some geologic activity that is somehow more active when the ocean is more active?<p>Hard to imagine anything to do with ocean waves and storms could be consistent enough to produce this effect. I understand there is some average wave periods but storms normally disrupt patterns.<p>All very interesting.')
