I feel like the other people replying to this comment is misunderstanding the intention of having a baby monitor and the state of a mind a new parent is in.<p>I still remember the panic that set in when the cheaper camera loss signal and didn&#x27;t notify us. The good monitor made a loud beeping sound if it&#x27;s losing connection or is low on battery. It&#x27;s a peace of mind knowing there are safe guards when the technology fails you.<p>I don&#x27;t expect a baby monitor to keep track of the child&#x27;s health status, but I do expect it to work reliably as digital link to the room.')
