That is foolish, for how does it compare to the high art of painting on a cave wall? Rhetorical question, poorly of course. Cuneiform completely bypasses hunting for most crimson okra , blackest ash, and sparkling chalk. And that is before we get to the availability of the writing surfaces. Tablets are cheap but caves are rare! We are talking about pondering for many moons of what messages to send to the far futures versus mindless hammering of most inane things. It is plainly obvious that the gulf between the two is like that of Arecibo message compared to a conversation between two twitter bots.<p>Given the most pervasive argument that is as a matter of fact is a fact. I am sure you will agree that cave paintings are the most superior form of communication bar none.')
