It&#x27;s just not the point.<p>I also strongly agree with the sentiment in the discussion that simple is often better than elegant. If it takes an entire article to figure out what&#x27;s happening, that says something about how careful you should be with putting it in production code.<p>Anyways, thanks everyone on HN for a great discussion and for all the insights, comments and suggestions!')
