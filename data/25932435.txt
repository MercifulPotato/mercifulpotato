These arguments are &amp; always will be abused. But: just because something is regularly abused doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no validity to it. And of course, <i>pointing out</i> that these arguments are abused is itself a kind of Quake laser cannon argument.<p>Ultimately, you just have to decide yourself based on context cues whether an argument is valid.<p>† <i>Obviously, I am one myself</i>')
