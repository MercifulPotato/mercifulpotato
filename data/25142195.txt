Most parents will find out during pregnancy, immediately after birth, or within a few weeks of birth.<p>In our case, somehow none of the health professionals noticed or said anything (yep, we seriously found out later that at least 3 of them suspected and said nothing - because it &quot;wasn&#x27;t within their remit&quot;). Typical Down&#x27;s facial features are not quite as prominent in our daughter, and developmentally, for a long time she tended to match her peers, or only lag behind a little. But coming on for 2 years, she still wasn&#x27;t walking and her speech was lagging being, and we went to see a paediatrician - he recognised it <i>immediately</i>, and told us without even waiting on karyotyping. It was something of a shock :)')
