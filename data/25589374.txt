They are not fought for the reasons given such as deposing dictators because they are dictators.<p>So in this &quot;insane&quot; worldview, the activities of some states take on a less altruistic character and more a brutal practicality.  In this worldview, the operating paradigm is not essentially civil.  It is &quot;might makes right&quot;.<p>Now if you go further and put the deployment of nuclear weapons into that context, you will have an even more &quot;extreme&quot; worldview.<p>So in this paradigm, China may, like other countries before it, seek to improve it&#x27;s access to resources and general power.  And like other countries before it, it would be operating in the &quot;brutally practical&quot; paradigm.<p>So if one was brave and &quot;crazy&quot; then one could speculate that the Covid-19 event may have been the Hiroshima of the bioweapon age.  And even if it wasn&#x27;t intentional, it could be said to serve that purpose.<p>Even &quot;crazy&quot; people hope that isn&#x27;t truly part of the paradigm now.  But some of the braver &quot;crazies&quot; might still be able to admit some slight possibility.')
