That&#x27;s frustrating when it happens.<p>But in the opposite direction, it&#x27;s also easy misinterpret someone as though they&#x27;re saying the second thing, when they&#x27;re really trying to say the first thing. And when someone gets misinterpreted like that, that&#x27;s frustrating too. I think a pretty good compromise is to try to assume people are saying the first thing as much as possible.')
