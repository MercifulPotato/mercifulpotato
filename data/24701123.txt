On the X server applications will get touchpad gestures regardless of whether one is running Plasma or GNOME. However, workspace-wide gestures are not implemented in either on X yet.<p>On Wayland the display server is the one which handles workspace-wide gestures. Additionally, all events go through it to the applications. Perfect touchpad gesture support needs support in both. As far as I know Mutter (GNOME) handles both parts already and KWin (Plasma) currently handles neither.<p>Implementing touchpad gestures on Plasma would fall within this initiative, I will most likely work on that at some point in the future. Please vote in the poll so that we know this is important to you.')
