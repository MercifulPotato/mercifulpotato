I know this at first doesn&#x27;t make much sense in a EV but it is one of the big(est) reasons one bike is chosen over others. See Harley Davidson for example. Being realistic about it HD doesn&#x27;t have much going for them outside branding and sound; it is piss poor quality and very expensive, but they sound good and have great branding. The current electric motorcycles on the market are falling into the same trap as modern ICE motorcycles: they are for many reasons converging on the same style, sound and price. Many buy old vintage motorcycles for this reason and many of those that does not at least make sure to change the sound with a better exhaust. Sound is extremely important in a motorcycle. I for one don&#x27;t think I would want one without it. It might be great fun but in my world it would be a very fun bike -not a motorcycle- without the soundtrack.')
