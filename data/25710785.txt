Nobody took them seriously. Look what happened.  The president and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and other followers incited it.  Yes the execution of the insurrection was ham-fisted, and it failed to prevent the electoral count from completing, but that&#x27;s irrelevant.  If the mob had managed to find and destroy the electoral certificates, or if the flex-cuffs guys had captured members of congress, we would be talking about something very different now.<p>The president has a history of responding to setbacks by doubling down.  His followers have now begun talking about returning with arms. Only fools would assume that these threats are idle talk or jokes.<p>The western liberal value of free speech has never extended to incitement of violence. My assumption is that the leaders of Apple, Google, and Amazon don&#x27;t want to provide a platform for sedition.')
