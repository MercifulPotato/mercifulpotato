Exiled Palestinians were unwelcome to neighboring Arab states. I think you should read the book because your assumption is incorrect about its content.<p>This is cheeky of me, but... A hint for starters: the Zionists did invade Palestine with the intent to destroy it. The Zionist movement in Israel did not respect the partitioning of Palestine set up by UN Resolution 181. Zionists committed mass murder against the Palestinians even outside of typical warfare â€” there were significant civilian casualties. There is no need to equivocate the criticism that &quot;what Zionists are doing to Palestinians is similar to what Nazis did to Jews&quot; to a very different claim that &quot;the Holocaust and the Nakba are wholly the same.&quot;<p>We are horrified that Israel would commit ethnic cleansing against another group of people. It is especially horrific given they did so immediately after having been dealt the same atrocity at the hand of Nazis.<p>You can narrowly criticize Israel for these historical and present-day actions, and you gain credibility by standing firmly on that point.<p>Because my response seems to have gained some traction, I will offer you a couple more sources. I don&#x27;t require or expect you to purchase and read the aforementioned book, but I hope you will look over the following:<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1948_Palestinian_exodus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1948_Palestinian_exodus</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;2017&#x2F;5&#x2F;23&#x2F;the-nakba-did-not-start-or-end-in-1948" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;2017&#x2F;5&#x2F;23&#x2F;the-nakba-did-n...</a>')
