Their job is to keep their company and customer&#x27;s data secure. At this job they failed.<p>No.  Their job is to use the resources they’ve been allocated to manage risk within the organization <i>to the risk level senior management has agreed to accept.</i><p>Maybe that shouldn’t be their job, but it is.  There isn’t a security team on the planet that gets to dictate security to the rest of the organization or unilaterally make decisions that influence the running of the business to achieve the level of risk mitigation that they themselves would prefer to attain.<p>That is putting aside the fact that defending against a determined nation-state adversary is a nigh-on impossible task that would require countermeasures like ‘don’t connect to the Internet at all’, ‘don’t hire anyone you haven’t personally known since childhood’, ‘hand-deliver your product to your customers’, and other equally impractical mitigations.<p>Nobody outside of Solarwinds knows if their security team succeeded or failed in the mission they were given.')
