Item(by='OliverJones', descendants=None, kids=[25048106], score=None, time=1605026426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25046691, text='Here&#x27;s a contrarian view of this (deplorable) situation, from someone who developed for Microsoft platforms for years. The low quality of the documentation has two reasons:<p>* Protectionism: The poor documentation defends expert third party developers against competition from new entrants. It ensures a shortage of competent developers and so enhances the revenue of established experts.<p>* Low commitment: The publisher (Apple) is unwilling to make the functional commitments implied by good documentation. Once the documentation says &quot;this does that&quot; it&#x27;s harder to change &quot;this&quot; to do something else.<p>In the distant past, Apple teamed up with the publisher Addison-Wesley to create and publish high quality documentation. They could certainly do so again, with A-W or O&#x27;Reilly or whoever.<p>But they won&#x27;t do it as long as they have business reasons not to. They have sufficient control over their marketplace to refuse to do this and get away with it.')
