Especially since the Surface was fan-less, the reduction in heat actually helps with performance as well. The only quirk is the BIOS of Surface provides no such options and I have to use intel extreme tuning utility, which crashes sometimes.<p>If Linux gets undervolting support, that will help a bunch of laptops without highly configurable BIOSes.')
