We&#x27;re discussing law in the comments here like we&#x27;re all lawyers but let&#x27;s face it--very few of us are up to the task of determining what is and is not illegal, and even fewer of us could actually survive if that assessment was challenged. User generated content ends up having a massive upfront legal cost, and I predict it will become extinct (both future and retroactive) for US-based sites if Section 230 is repealed...<p>&gt; The centralized nature of Facebook actually allows for larger scale manipulation of the narrative.<p>...except on sites like Facebook, who make unimaginable amounts of money and can likely afford to fund private development of automoderation software and can weather the storm of lawsuits for content that manages to evade the filter. Facebook will only become more centralized as other online communication platforms are unable to bear the costs of publishing user generated content, and their control over the narrative will increase.<p>&gt; Maybe that would drive people to create their own websites once again.<p>Sure, but how are people going to find these websites if I&#x27;m effectively reliant on the tech giants to tell people about it? Do you trust Facebook to not start censoring links to external websites? If there&#x27;s no Section 230, then they could easily justify censoring off-site linking by saying they can&#x27;t moderate the content of uncontrolled sites. How is Google going to exist if it&#x27;s liable for what it links to? How are content aggregators going to exist? Forums? Chat rooms?<p>&gt; Facebook just disappeared off of the Internet tomorrow - I&#x27;m not really sure I would mourn that<p>Same, but Facebook&#x27;s not going anywhere. It&#x27;ll just start charging its billions of users directly and continue telling me what I can and cannot read according to the whims of people I don&#x27;t know and have no influence over. Meanwhile, all of my other options for discussion will slowly start disappearing as it becomes too costly to continue operating. There are better options than allowing that future to happen.')
