They&#x27;re trying to just create a not-as-good cloud provider which lacks even a 3rd US based data center.<p>Oh and their free LE certs require you to hand over the root domain to them so they can manage it. Completely baffles me why they can&#x27;t figure out nameserver delegations and accept they&#x27;re incompatible with companies like Cloudflare.<p>Really DO, build a 3rd US data center that is somewhere in Texas so you have a little more geographic coverage besides the coasts. Fix your terrible access key permissions (oh yeah a storage client should be able to delete my domain registration...)')
