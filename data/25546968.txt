This is just showing that &quot;independent&quot; media isn&#x27;t sufficient for these types of uncomfortable truths.  Nor do I believe democratic media would be sufficient, as we&#x27;ve seen that almost half the US wanted to vote for a delusional, racist, fascist <i>again</i>, after actually <i>seeing</i> the results of doing so the first time.<p>I agree with you that what we&#x27;re doing right now isn&#x27;t working.  I don&#x27;t have a solution or a proposal, but I just don&#x27;t see how there&#x27;s any way for media in general to get this sort of stuff out onto the airwaves.')
