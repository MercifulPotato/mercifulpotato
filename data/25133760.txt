Low whole sale energy prices in Germany cause policy failures that increase the EEG surcharge.<p>Here are some made up numbers. If the wholesale price is 0.10€ per kWh but the subsidized price is 0.20€ per kWh then the EEG budget has to make up the 0.10€ difference. That difference is added to the retail price so you end up paying 0.10€ for the electricity itself and 0.10€ per kWh for the EEG surcharge.<p>Industrial users are exempt from the surcharge so consumers end up paying electricity bills for the biggest energy consumers.<p>You actually end up paying 0.10€ for the electricity, 0.10€ for the EEG surcharge and 0.05€ for the EEG portion that industrial companies didn&#x27;t pay for. Total: 0.25€ which is higher than even the subsidized price. Meanwhile industrial users only pay the wholesale price of 0.10€.<p>Of course I have simplified grid costs and taxes but this is the general problem with the EEG surcharge.')
