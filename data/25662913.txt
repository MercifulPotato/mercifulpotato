Item(by='trhway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609969124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25662579, text='&gt; In my mind any system involving hundreds of millions of people<p>in a popular vote elections even a hundred thousand votes would be  just a rounding error. In US electoral system just a few counties going wrong way could turn the elections, ie. theoretically &quot;some bad actors, mistakes, fraud, etc.&quot; would be enough to do it.  Add to that the facts like Dominion Voting Systems (whose machines were used in some of those key states and counties if i remember correctly) being a client of SolarWinds ... and one can have more than enough for a good conspiracy theory. At least i have :)')
