If it crashes, you lose all your text since the last save, which is very bad. But the editor also does other things  like  playing animations when you click somewhere, a lowering button, or a show a rotating hourglass as mouse cursor.  If it would show a wrong animation, that is completely irrelevant. Or it has syntax highlighting with a range type for possible user-defined colors. If it shows the wrong color, that is no big deal.  But if you have a new version of the editor, adding more colors, and you use those colors in the user&#x27;s setting, you cannot downgrade to an older version, because it would crash when it does not know the new colors.<p>I just had an actual problem with such an exception when calling GetFileAttributes. It returns INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES (unsigned 0xFFFFFFFF) on failure. But I was calling a wrapper around it, which casts it to a signed value and then return -1. Storing the return value in an unsigned variable and then comparing it to 0xFFFFFFFF  gave me a range check error. But compiled with range checking disabled, it works perfectly fine.')
