Merely pointing at a DoH&#x2F;DoT supporting DNS server in the settings GUI won&#x27;t do it, the OS doesn&#x27;t do any probing and automatically use it just because it&#x27;s available. For applications DNS Settings is covered under the Network Extension framework [0].<p>It&#x27;s definitely nice Apple now has this built-in, and since they&#x27;re onboard with Cloudflare&#x2F;Fastly maybe this new twist will be pretty fast too. But obviously they&#x27;re going to have to make this more automated for it to really make a widespread difference, ideally it&#x27;d simply see if the supplied DNS server (manual or DHCP) could run DoH&#x2F;DoT and then just use it by default with no interaction required.<p>----<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;networkextension&#x2F;dns_settings" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;networkextension&#x2F;d...</a>')
