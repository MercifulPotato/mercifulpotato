Item(by='tartoran', descendants=None, kids=[25334743], score=None, time=1607360358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25333591, text=' I&#x27;m white and not a racist at all (have multicultural family, think we&#x27;re all capable humans but also think any race&#x2F;religion can have its antisocial parasites amongst them) but do find that song more as stirring hate rather than coming from a place of grievance. The song is putting all whiteness and all history in one bucket and setting it on fire. That&#x27;s no different than a white guy being mugged by a black guy and crying black is evil and pointing at the guy&#x27;s color. This song doesn&#x27;t help the black cause at all, the blacks in America have indeed been deprived and put down and am willing to put a hand and stop it<p>What happened to the unifying message of love? Hate is divisive and never brought anything good to the table.')
