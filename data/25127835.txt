The discussions in this thread and crawling servo.org make that abundantly clear.<p>Original post:\nAs an embedder, I just don&#x27;t get the point. Servo is a nonstarter. The idea of Servo minus Rust is great, because most embedders don&#x27;t use Rust. They use C, because C is easy to embed with, and the availability of FFIs across languages that interface with C is tremendous.<p>As someone who has used CEF, looked at Webkit ports, and has even written a compositor compliant with a subset of CSS 2.1, you just cannot sell Servo to me without a C interface.<p>My problem isn&#x27;t, &quot;I need an embeddable web browser written in Rust.&quot; My problem is I need <i>any</i> embeddable web software―at least a CSS 2.1 compliant compositor―as an alternative to CEF accessible through C, C++, or an FFI that talks to C, but almost no one makes one.<p>I don&#x27;t even necessarily need anything beyond a CSS 2.1 compositor, because so much of &quot;web development&quot; is either CSS 2.1 or JavaScript, and I don&#x27;t need the latter for my embedding purposes.')
