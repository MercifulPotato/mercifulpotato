I want to hack some projects. I find setting up a database, creating entry&#x2F;report forms  and scripting in current RDBMS environments quite demanding. Any suggestions for a RAD tool that is similar to FoxPro for my type of coders. I am comfortable with RDBMS concepts but would like a IDE and database with plug-n-play simplicity of FoxPro.')
