It&#x27;s the governance and management of the project. The distro has managed to be amazingly consistent and stable for years. But the reason for this is how the project is run. It&#x27;s hard to do that for so long with minimal drama and they deserve tons for kudos for that effort.<p>Like some others, where CentOS was my go-to distro, I&#x27;ve started moving over to Debian as my distro of choice when I can. Thus far, I&#x27;ve been very happy with this choice.')
