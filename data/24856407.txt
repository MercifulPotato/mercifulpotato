It&#x27;s called the Auto Train: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amtrak.com&#x2F;auto-train" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amtrak.com&#x2F;auto-train</a><p>Runs from just outside of DC to Florida.<p>In the Northeast, Amtrak has pretty much captured the NYC &lt;-&gt; DC market for business travel.<p>What&#x27;s holding it back is a lack of capacity and slower speeds than you&#x27;d find in, say, Europe.<p>Why it&#x27;s slow is a complex problem with many causes.<p>It&#x27;s partly due to US regulations that cause trains to be heavier, slower and more expensive than overseas.<p>The infrastructure is also old, dating back to the 1800s in some cases, causing bottlenecks in key areas. One 1870s-era tunnel in Baltimore brings speeds down to 30mph for what feels like an eternity.<p>Amtrak is also not super great at running the NEC. The physical infrastructure could do more, and relatively cheap changes could have a large impact.')
