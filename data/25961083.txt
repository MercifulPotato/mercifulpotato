There is a strong school of thought that we don&#x27;t want perfect enforcement of all laws, at least not ones based around nonviolent crimes.<p>&gt; Here&#x27;s a not-entirely-hypothetical thought experiment for you: would you allow your life to be recorded and made public if it would prevent a child from being abducted?<p>To me, it is hypothetical, because we still had a Capital riot even with increased surveillance. After the riot, it didn&#x27;t take ubiquitous surveillance to catch those people, they bragged about it in livestreams on social media. We can do better with the capabilities we have.<p>It seems intuitively correct to say that the NSA surveillance is improving security, but (surprisingly) I don&#x27;t see strong evidence that the programs are actually helping to catch terrorists. We&#x27;re giving additional capabilities to people who aren&#x27;t leveraging or making good use of the capabilities that they already have.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not a particularly good person (I do my best) and I like my privacy, but I think I would have to take that bargain.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t. To me, it sounds like a nonsensical comparison, it&#x27;s like asking whether or not I&#x27;d switch to eating only bugs to stop a kidnapping. I don&#x27;t believe that it would help, I don&#x27;t believe the bargain you&#x27;re proposing makes sense on an individual level. And as a widescale solution to crime on the macro level, the consequences of constant surveillance for everyone are worse than a kidnapping. It&#x27;s not a good trade.<p>I do agree with you in one way, which is that regulation of this tech is not a perfect long-term solution. We need to figure out how to enforce regulations, and outside of the regulatory world we need adversarial research into the technology itself as well. Banning facial recognition will not be enough, on its own, to solve the problem -- solving the problem will require a combination of multiple solutions. But it is a problem we should try to solve. Whether that&#x27;s by normalizing mask wearing, researching how to combat systems like gait detection, making it easier to detect cameras -- we should be thinking about how to give people tools to hide from omnipresent facial recognition.')
