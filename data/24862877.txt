My personal theory (take it for what it&#x27;s worth) is that at least two major factors in the stagnation:<p>The first technical.  Scientific advancement seems to be dependent upon two technical factors: our tools of observation (which includes mathematical tools like statistics which help us to &quot;see&quot; patterns in data) and the ability to produce energy.  We need better tools for &quot;seeing&quot; and more abundant energy to make further advancements.<p>The second factor is social.  Scientific innovation requires creativity, but scientific institutions are increasingly hostile to the needs of creativity.')
