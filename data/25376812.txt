I know for a fact it&#x27;d take much more time tech wise to get something of equivalent revenue up and running.<p>I have to question these &quot;I spent years making $40 a month working 8 hours after hours to built &lt;project&gt; but now &lt;project&gt; makes $60k a month&quot; stories, since at some point you really have to ask yourself how much your time is worth.  Thousands of hours for $1M pre-tax, not to mention how much life you gave up for that is kind of idiotic IMO.<p>My metric generally is, &quot;if someone on etsy selling magic rocks is making more than my tech project after three months, time to move on&quot;.  I&#x27;m not being shitty, this is just a standard I hold myself to when it comes to valuing my personal time.  Also, don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m not one of these people who thinks my time isn&#x27;t worth cooking or cleaning (like many YT gurus and even Financial Samurai now claim).')
