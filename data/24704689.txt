Ain&#x27;t like a kernel is a mystical land in a far away galaxy. It&#x27;s just another program. In DOS era every program was a kernel when was running. If you wanted to play nice with others you&#x27;d do a TSR program and make sure you did not freeze the PC. I know it&#x27;s an oversimplification but the basis is the same. When you write for kernel you make sure to no tip over anything, just like with a TSR in DOS.')
