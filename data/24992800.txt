It&#x27;s doable, but very difficult in an era of deep polarization and partisanship. For example, many think the electoral college is undemocratic and outdated, but there is a vested interest by both parties in keeping it in place.<p>That said, the &quot;middle ground&quot; is probably the states. For example, Oregon I believe just decriminalized all forms of recreational drug use. Who knows how that will turn out, but it&#x27;s a social experiment that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Another example - think of the communes in the 1960s or the Israeli kibbutzim or other experimental communities throughout history. Maybe try out your ideas on a small scale with a small group of people and see what works.')
