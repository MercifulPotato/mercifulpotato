Keeping downlink in the open is actually pretty standard with satellites, but uplinks are almost always protected, because you don&#x27;t want third parties to send commands to satellites or probes - be it adversaries or bored teenagers with a radio and a dish.<p>(And particularly in context of a high-profile mission like this, they definitely would want to keep telemetry open for third parties, to ensure their achievement is independently verified and recognized by the international community.)')
