There really was a world before the internet was universal. People used tools like Fortran on these things called Crays; (or CDC6600 or IBM doodads before that) -you&#x27;d bring your data on a VHS cassette or reel to reel tapes, because your university only rented a single T1 line -1.55mbps FWIIW; it was seen as plenty of bandwidth for all the scientists in the university. Nobody but the scientists used the internet in those days.<p>That universe is still around; matrix math is still ultimately Fortran -matrix math is why people invented computers in the first place, as amazing as this may sound to people with ipotatoes in their pocket. That&#x27;s 50s and 60s tech; with gotos and line numbers: back then, using multiple <i>files</i> for your software was considered getting fancy. You were usually submitting jobs as a stack of punched cards. I never did, but my older roomies in grad school certainly did.<p>Similarly, the OS you&#x27;re using is basically mid-1970s technology, written in mid-1970s programming languages. Back then, package management wasn&#x27;t so much of a problem; the whole source code for the OS could be published in not-too-big book form (and was, FWIIW). Just a reminder: the runtime for modern Rust is absurdly bloated compared to those days; &quot;Hello World&quot; in Rust is literally larger than the entire hard drive of 1970s computers with the OS written in C; hell there were 80s computers with 4mb drives that were seen as fairly adequate. Anyway, that&#x27;s why C++ (basically PDP-11 assembler with Bjarne&#x27;s deranged ideas about objects ... and some later better ideas) has a shitty package management story. It&#x27;s not so bad really; just a skill that n00bs don&#x27;t have any more. I personally never needed anything fancier than makefiles, and saw CMake as a regression from autotools.')
