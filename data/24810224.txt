There&#x27;s a whole section at the end on &quot;Change doesn&#x27;t mean to quit&quot;.<p>To address your specific points, and as someone who&#x27;s done a lot of hiring for different companies over the years:<p>- Yes, lots of job hopping <i>can</i> be viewed negatively (please see below).<p>- I&#x27;ve been amazed by the number of people I know who&#x27;ve changed jobs mid-pandemic. Clearly there is still a job market out there. With that being said my default position agrees with yours: unless you have a very compelling reason to change jobs, if your current job is secure, stick with it.<p>Back to job hopping...<p>If you&#x27;ve been working for 10+ years and never held down a job for more than a year or two the alarm bells start ringing. If you&#x27;ve pulled that off for 15 - 20 years <i>all</i> of the alarm bells go into maximum overdrive.<p>However, I certainly don&#x27;t mind a <i>bit</i> of job hopping early in your career: it can take a while for people to find a position that really suits them.<p>Similarly, peoples&#x27; circumstances change: they get married, they move, they have children, they&#x27;re made redundant, they have health problems, they need to care for a relative, they suffer bereavement, or they just get bored and need a change and it takes a while to figure out - not to mention all of the other changes that can happen within a company that make them to look for work elsewhere. The result is that people might go through another period where they change jobs more often: they might start contracting, or if they move and have to change jobs the first job they land might not be that great.<p>Often I&#x27;ve seen on CVs where people have been with a company for a long time, then might change two or three times after that because really good jobs that suit you well aren&#x27;t actually as common as we&#x27;d all probably like. Again, that&#x27;s generally OK.<p>What I do want to see is some solid evidence that under the right circumstances you can hold a job down and stick at it for a few years. The amount of evidence I&#x27;ll want to see of that increases proportionally to the length of your career.<p>This is an inexact rule of thumb. Changing jobs a lot may not immediately put me off a candidate but it will, at the very least, mean I dig into the issue very thoroughly during the selection process, and if I don&#x27;t like what I find then obviously you won&#x27;t get the job (but that&#x27;s true of any aspect of selection).<p>With that said it <i>is</i> possible to stay in a job too long. I was with one company for 10 years, and that was too long. Far too long. But not because it was 10 years: the company had stopped growing at the time and I&#x27;d run out of opportunities to really develop and advance in my career. I&#x27;d say I wasted at least the last 3 years there. In terms of career advancement that 3 years has probably cost me more like 5 - 7, because I was burned out and pissed off, so I spent a couple of years contracting before moving back into full time employment.')
