Item(by='m-hilgendorf', descendants=None, kids=[25194463], score=None, time=1606167620, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25190770, text='I was introduced to convolution in a undergraduate signals&#x2F;systems course in continuous time where it&#x27;s basically magic that you memorize to pass your course.  I think a better introduction would be through discrete convolution by reexamining polynomial multiplication (which is convolution through a different lens - the coefficients of the product of two polynomials is the convolution of their coefficients).<p>That serves as a less magical introduction to the operator. You can then point out that the polynomials whose coefficients one convolves can be considered power series, which has a nice interlude into the Z transform and its usefulness as an analytical tool when working with convolutions (and then on to the Fourier transform, etc).')
