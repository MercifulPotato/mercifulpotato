I hardly hear anyone talk about inequality in my circles. Many would be considered top 10%, but most would at least be top 25%.<p>On the national level, many people in high cost of living areas may be in the top 10%, but may not feel as blessed because of the high cost of living. For example, you may be making $300k per year in a dual income family in SF, but an average house might cost $750k.<p>In my opinion, if one complains about something multiple times, but does not do anything to fix the issue, then that is hypocrisy.')
