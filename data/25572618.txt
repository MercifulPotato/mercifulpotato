Even healthy 12 grain bread SERVING has about 5g of added sugar. 15g is about 1 tablespoon so in total a half loaf can have up to several tablespoons. And that&#x27;s on the good end!<p>These guidelines always sound like hopes and dreams in the US. Companies just pump their foods with sugar to bump up calories or make it taste better.
