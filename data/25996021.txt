I have an iOS and a web&#x2F;electron client at the moment, and a simple Chrome extension for bookmarking. I plan to eventually add files (blobs), definitions and support extensibility via WASM applications.<p>Its backend (Exocore[2]) is built on top of a personal &#x2F; private blockchain and is made from the ground up to be hosted in a semi-decentralized fashion on your own personal devices (your computer, raspberry pi, a cloud instance, etc.). It is written in Rust and has iOS, C and Web (WASM) clients.<p>It has very rough edges, but I&#x27;m using it daily to organize my life. It has also been my learning playground to improve my Rust skills over the last two years (it was on another tech stack before).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appaquet&#x2F;exomind" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appaquet&#x2F;exomind</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appaquet&#x2F;exocore" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appaquet&#x2F;exocore</a>')
