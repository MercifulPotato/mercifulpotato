Item(by='andrewjl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602380728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24737512, text='&gt; There&#x27;s nothing humane about preventing people from being able to work<p>My reading of the argument (maybe different from OP) is the choice to work a low wage job isn&#x27;t a choice made completely by one&#x27;s own volition due to a huge stack of societal factors.<p>Let&#x27;s break your counterargument down a bit, preventing people from being able to work denies them sustenance yes, but also embedded (IMO) in your argument is the <i>intrinsic value of a job</i> as a part of someone&#x27;s life. Here we agree and this is why I don&#x27;t support cradle-to-grave welfare and think it would be a disaster if implemented. It is something welfare advocates tend to ignore, to the detriment of their credibility on other economic matters.<p>A retraining program coupled with a large hike in minimum wages and temporary retraining assistance could sustainably raise the minimum standard of living with no government takeover of the economy. The program itself can be a private one if designed the right way. Prior retraining programs didn&#x27;t work due to 1) lack of accountability and 2) lack of demand for upskilled labor. A very high minimum wage fixes that on the cost side and also on the aggregate demand side. (Something approaching the median US wage today or possibly 1.5x-2x higher, phased in over several decades to give business a measure of predictability and planning capacity.)<p>Most low paying jobs can be automated, when they aren&#x27;t it is because human labor is so cheap that the expense of capex to automate isn&#x27;t worth it. By raising the floor cost of labor, government provides business an incentive to retool the economy around higher-wage paying activities. Any business that can&#x27;t automate and relies on cheap human work to do drudgery isn&#x27;t worth saving in my opinion. A bonus is that the resulting capex will generate second and third order effects that will catalyze economic growth and spare many otherwise impacted small businesses from failing.<p>We want to idealize the person who starts out in a fast food restaurant, learns discipline and organizational skills, and moves on to higher paying work. Several decades of data have shown us this is a nice theory that fails in practice in most cases. Those people remain stuck and that is <i>bad for economic growth</i> in addition to causing needless suffering. Keeping the minimum wage low hasn&#x27;t solved this problem and won&#x27;t solve it in the future.')
