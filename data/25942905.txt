A vertical icon bar is created at the edge of the screen, which basically acts as if there were multiple windows where to group tabs by topic. For instance, personal, work, media, research, topic x, y, z. The only improvement I see would be to optionally isolate the workspace from one another (so as to have different sessions on the same websites).')
