That extra time was invaluable. If we wanted to go on a weekend ski trip, for example, it meant that we could leave early to beat the after-school rush <i>and</i> I could be all caught up on everything around the house so my conscience was clear. It was a much bigger difference than it might seem, lifestyle-wise.<p>The reason I nominally worked 30 hours&#x2F;week might also be interesting. It was supposed to be less, but it turns out that none of the systems at work - payroll, insurance, PTO, stock vesting - were set up for a permanent salaried employee working less. I get the impression that many companies in the US are like that. You&#x27;re either salaried, full time (or close to it), full benefits, or you&#x27;re hourly with no benefits at all. We need to get better at supporting work arrangements other than those standardized in the early industrial era.')
