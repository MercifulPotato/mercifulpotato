A lot of keywords I was #1 for, I&#x27;ve now fallen down considerably, even onto the next page, or dropped entirely. Looking at the data, the change happens a couple days after I removed the Google products, after running the alternatives side-by-side for a couple weeks. Am I crazy or is this actually a thing?')
