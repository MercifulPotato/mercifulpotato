China has shopping malls â€” does that make shopping malls communist?<p>Also, a Land Appreciation Tax isn&#x27;t really radically different from the status quo in the US today. Land appreciation is already taxed as capital gains, it&#x27;s just that the capital gains tax is intentionally set to be low to incentivize investment. The argument here is that we should not only NOT incentivize speculation on land, we should deter it by carving out a &quot;special&quot; capital gains tax on land.')
