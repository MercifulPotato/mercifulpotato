Do you think this is any less true now? This part acknowledges what seems like your exact concern:<p>&gt; Communications between nations must promote understanding: So went another dream. But the machines of communication can be channeled or choked. What is communicated can be truth or lie. Communication is a strong force also, but for either good or bad.<p>The change of this sort since 1955 that most comes to mind, for me, is that we have more information hazards analogous to &quot;blueprints for a working A-bomb&quot;: now we have &quot;genome of smallpox&quot; and (maybe soonish) &quot;algorithm for superhuman intelligence&quot;. But it&#x27;s not like Feynman had no personal acquaintance with that category of hazards; and the current drive for censorship is way <i>way</i> broader. I think his case against it is just as good now, and more needed.')
