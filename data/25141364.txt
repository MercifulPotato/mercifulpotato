I still use a company-issued Mac laptop at work, because it came with the job, but it&#x27;s been over five years since I&#x27;ve bought any Apple hardware for personal use, and I see no reason to expect that will change.<p>This article&#x27;s closing remark is apt: &quot;When someone says &#x27;weâ€™ll give you the full experience&#x27;, settling into that requires trust. And my trust that Apple and me are in alignment keeps fading.&quot; I do not trust Apple enough to submerge myself in their world of proprietary lock-in technology; I can&#x27;t imagine trusting any corporation that much.')
