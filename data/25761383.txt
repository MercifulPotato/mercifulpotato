I used to work out at the type of gym the author describes. People were mostly in Greek statue state (can’t say I’m included) and did not appear to be on steroids. I moved away from the coasts and the gym next to my home clearly has at least a history of steroid use. Everyone is <i>gigantic</i>. The gym is near several schools with sports programs. The lifts are all very heavy. They do not look like a statue. More like a Marvel movie character. I’d be surprised to find much steroid use in the health focused gym world as no one really expressed the same values. They wanted to look good and live a long life. They were not looking to lift heavier and heavier or look like a walking mountain.')
