Abstractions are useful because they can simplify your code while providing good performance. Because certain things (eg optimizing, reasoning about locks, writing tests for a concept) are expensive and it&#x27;s better to only do them once really well.<p>If a pattern is regularly repeated, it often makes sense to abstract it. Why would that be any different in code that deals with concurrency??')
