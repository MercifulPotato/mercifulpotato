I&#x27;m sure there are plenty in the realm of software&#x2F;hardware.<p>On the other hand, is there any difference between this kind of misconception and others? I feel there is. The observed correlation is very strong, and the wrong causal relationship is made based on assumptions that are extremely common. We sniff a thing, and what we sense is what we call that thing&#x27;s smell. But again, this is probably a wrong conclusion very often (depending on how you want to define a &quot;thing&#x27;s smell&quot;). If I smell a book, is it actually the book that smells or some kind of organic thing that grows on the paper? Is it meaningful to separate the two? &lt;&#x2F;saturday morning philosophizing&gt;<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waterandhealth.org&#x2F;healthy-pools&#x2F;busting-chlorine-swimming-pool-urban-myth&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waterandhealth.org&#x2F;healthy-pools&#x2F;busting-chlorine-sw...</a>')
