They are generally located on vacation friendly roadways and are frequented mostly by travellers on their way to the beach.<p>Adding several electric recharge slots would be a great way to bring people and keep them there for 10-20 minutes.  Restroom and snacks (or even meals) for 4-5 people plus you get to clean the bugs off of your windscreen.  I personally make this trip every year (sometimes twice a year) and would love to see more electric refueling stops.')
