At the surface there are ostensibly common APIs, but the underlying components (networking, storage) are not necessarily interchangeable. There may also be custom policies around e.g. labels, SecurityContexts, or NetworkPolicies. In my own K3s cluster I generally just manage the YAML specs for the deployments by hand, since I’ll often need to e.g. specify the arch constraint to run against, or ensure that it’s running a multi-arch image. It’s a really interesting problem though, and it’s something that we’re targeting.')
