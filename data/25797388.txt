Item(by='weichi', descendants=None, kids=[25801793, 25798604], score=None, time=1610749816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25797028, text='I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &quot;premise&quot;, but I really hope that the justification for &quot;treating everyone equally under the law (or otherwise)&quot; is not because doing so &quot;helps prove beyond a reason of doubt who the elite truly are&quot;. For that would imply that if a better way is found of &quot;proving&quot; who the elite truly are, we could abandon the idea of equal treatment. Or that we could abandon equal treatment if we agreed that &quot;proving who the elite are&quot; is actually unimportant. In fact, I&#x27;m personally skeptical of the value of &quot;proving beyond reason of doubt who the elite truly are&quot;, but also highly committed to the principal of equal treatment, so I think the two are unrelated.<p>Perhaps I am misunderstanding your point?')
