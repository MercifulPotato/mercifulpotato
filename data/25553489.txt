Item(by='geofft', descendants=None, kids=[25553540, 25555967, 25554452, 25555265], score=None, time=1609096824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551187, text='This seems like what xkcd called &quot;citogenesis&quot; - something inaccurate gets published on Wikipedia, a traditional &quot;reliable source&quot; (newspaper, published nonfiction book, etc.) retells that bit of information without a source, Wikipedia cites the source, that information is now firmly established as truth for the rest of humanity.<p>I worry about this with Google&#x27;s language translation models, too. It&#x27;s entirely possible that it&#x27;s making up phrases or connotations that never existed in organic human speech, but people who aren&#x27;t fully fluent in the language use Google Translate for assistance, publish something, and then suddenly it&#x27;s in a published text by an actual human and Google reinforces its own belief.<p>For at least the past five years, Google Translate has translated &quot;who proceeds from the father&quot; into Latin as &quot;qui ex patre filioque procedit&quot; - inserting the additional word &quot;filioque,&quot; which means &quot;and the son.&quot; The question of whether to add this word is a 1500-year-old theological argument: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Filioque" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Filioque</a> Since the Western Church added the word, most texts in Latin include it, so Google is almost certainly deciding that the phrasing with &quot;filioque&quot; is more popular - but it doesn&#x27;t know what the words <i>mean</i>, so it can&#x27;t realize that the phrase it came up with means something different!')
