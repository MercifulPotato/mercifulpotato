Item(by='ForHackernews', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611346843, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25875686, text='&gt; when a technology becomes convenient enough so we don&#x27;t have to think about it while it fulfills it&#x27;s purpose,<p>Is a tragically limited view of what computers are.<p>Programmable computers are fundamentally different from steam engines. A steam engine will never be anything except a steam engine. Most of the manufactured objects we encounter in everyday life are similar: single- (or occasionally multi-) purpose goods that do what they were designed to do.<p>A general-purpose computer is not like this. It can be made to serve virtually infinite purposes. It can be made to do things the manufacturers never imagined anyone doing, and things the manufacturers wished it couldn&#x27;t do. Almost nothing has the kind of raw potential for human expression. Perhaps a blank notepad and pen might be analogous.')
