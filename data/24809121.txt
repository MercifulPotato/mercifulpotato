I tried looking for a good pasta sauce recipe lately. I remembered something recommended by Pocket, which was amazing (Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking), but it didn&#x27;t even show up in the first few Google search pages for pasta. None of the results were even a variation of the superior recipes.<p>The top search result has 9 (!) ads, mentions the book, but butchers everything that makes the recipe good. It shows rave reviews and a rating of 4.8. It probably is better than what everyone&#x27;s mom taught them, and better compared to a generic tin can sauce. But I think the old school algorithm of &quot;best selling cookbook&quot; does better.<p>Try looking for other heavily SEO-ed things and it&#x27;s even more hopeless: weight loss, business advice, games.')
