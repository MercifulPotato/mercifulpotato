What&#x27;s the point of masks?  To slow the spread of the disease.  So unless you&#x27;ve got some reason to think that death rates per infection are radically higher in Detroit than anywhere else along the route, then death rates are a somewhat-imperfect-but-still-somewhat-useful proxy for infection rates.<p>And therefore your comment is pretty pointless.  If Detroit is doing worse about preventing infection than all these places that aren&#x27;t using masks, then being there for the next month is probably going to be worse than passing through all those non-mask-using places for a week or two.  (Unless you have reason to think that Detroit not only reached herd immunity, but did so long enough ago that people aren&#x27;t currently contagious there.  But if you think that, I&#x27;d like to see your data.  More, I&#x27;d like to see why you think that about Detroit but not about the non-mask-using-and-therefore-presumably-spreading hinterlands.)')
