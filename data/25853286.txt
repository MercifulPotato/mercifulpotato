If you&#x27;re correct, why doesn&#x27;t anyone point at a famous portrait painting by a renowned artist, or a photorealistic pencil sketch of a fruit bowl and say, &quot;anyone could do that&quot;? These works might have very little creative effort, but people recognize they wouldn&#x27;t be able to reproduce such a piece, so they don&#x27;t make that statement. Instead, they look over at that painting with the square patches of color (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.kastatic.org&#x2F;ka-perseus-images&#x2F;f832e28211a5c9793935b60e12c9cb53d555a391.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.kastatic.org&#x2F;ka-perseus-images&#x2F;f832e28211a5c9793...</a>) and say their child could do that.<p>So, when someone says, &quot;anyone could do that&quot;, it&#x27;s likely a statement about being able to produce a similar piece of art. Could they paint a painting similar to the squares above that people could mistake as another painting from the same artist? Yes, so they make that statement. Could they write a novel that could be mistaken as a follow-up book from a famous writer? Not likely, so they don&#x27;t say it. So, it&#x27;s not a statement about being able to directly copy the work (like I might have referred to in my previous comment), or a reference to the creative effort involved, but a statement about being able to produce a similar piece. However, I think people mostly take into consideration the technical ability of the artist, they overlook the creative process to reach that point, and they&#x27;re focused on a single piece when a large part of the talent is in being able to consistently produce such work.')
