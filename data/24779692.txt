They say making deals in business has always hinged on &quot;who you know,&quot; and going forward, I think being anonymous is going to actively count _against_ people, rather than personal connections being a plus.<p>Maybe that&#x27;ll mean having less &quot;meta-work&quot; to deal with, because your real work will stand on its own, and you&#x27;ll have professional connections who can back you up. This change will make it harder to break into the system, though, and will make it harder for under-performers to succeed.')
