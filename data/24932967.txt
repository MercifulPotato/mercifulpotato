I had booked a hotel near the destination airport for one night before continuing to travel to my actual destination. The hotel advertised that they can give refunds or change booking with 24 hours notice.<p>My flight was cancelled and rescheduled for the next day, making that one-night hotel stay a waste if I couldn&#x27;t reschedule or get a refund for it.<p>Apparently hotels.com doesn&#x27;t have the same policy as the hotel I had a reservation at, so while still in the airport, I had to argue with about 3 layers of people before it was made apparent that I wasn&#x27;t speaking to the hotel.<p>In the end, hotels.com &quot;made an exception&quot; for me and refunded my money which I was then able to use to book another night. I suspect that exception was made because they were able to get a refund from the hotel itself.')
