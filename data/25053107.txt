I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just to prevent sticking to the oven or not, but it produces a texture I really prefer.<p>See, that&#x27;s the thing: there really is an infinite variety. I know that&#x27;s true of other foods, but very few other foods are available in such diverse forms with that level of ubiquity. In a 5-square mile area I could easily get 10 different types, and it&#x27;s all available with pretty much the same convenience as fast food.')
