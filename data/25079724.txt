Nethack and DCSS, so in that sense it feels more RPG-like.<p>I never really got into Nethack much because it&#x27;s just so punishing, and while ADOM is definitely far from an easy game, it <i>felt</i> better. DCSS is also similar to ADOM in the sense that the development community tries really hard to make it an enjoyable experience.')
