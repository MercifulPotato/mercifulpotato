This was always an issue for me in using Synthesia [2] - a piece of software that &#x27;gamifies&#x27; leaning a piece.   Synthesia is capable of displaying fingering information, but only if someone has manually input it - and without the fingering it&#x27;s almost impossible for a beginner to learn difficult passages.<p>If MIDI files contained accurate fingering (by which I mean which finger of which hand...although maybe there&#x27;s more to it?), and then could be input into a game - is this useful education tool?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;fayezsalka&#x2F;status&#x2F;1314613736511016961?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;fayezsalka&#x2F;status&#x2F;1314613736511016961?s=...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthesiagame.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthesiagame.com&#x2F;</a>')
