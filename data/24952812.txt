You have to be able to exchange them for something else or they&#x27;re worthless.<p>The question then is whether 7 tx&#x2F;sec really is sufficient to support broad global adoption, even if it&#x27;s just for savings. Dollars and physical gold have no such limits. Other blockchains are vastly expanding scalability, as well as eliminating the energy usage.<p>Another issue is whether Bitcoin can maintain its monetary policy for the long term. Here&#x27;s a paper from Princeton saying that if miner rewards are dominated by transaction fees rather than block rewards, the chain destabilizes, suffering frequent long rollbacks.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.princeton.edu&#x2F;~arvindn&#x2F;publications&#x2F;mining_CCS.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.princeton.edu&#x2F;~arvindn&#x2F;publications&#x2F;mining_CC...</a><p>If they&#x27;re right, some future generation of bitcoiners will  have to choose between keeping the issuance schedule, and having a blockchain that functions reliably. There&#x27;s no way for us to know which they will pick.<p>Personally, I think the right choice is a functioning chain. That last percent or two of inflation isn&#x27;t a problem for maintaining value, because economies grow at the same rate. So does the supply of gold in the economy.')
