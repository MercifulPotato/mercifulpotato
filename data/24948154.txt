But you can see what needs doing. So write up what should be done, and who ought to hire to do it. Then just put it out there.<p>If we did that as a community, we&#x27;d build up a body of specific suggestions rather than noisy politically-opinionated complaints. And probably some workers, and some hiring authorities, would act on the open-sourced suggestions for what work needs to be done and funded.')
