The point of this article isn&#x27;t that we now have a &quot;mechanical&quot; process to make faking easier. That&#x27;s been known for awhile. The headline specifically calls out acting for the purpose of deepfakes, but the article goes on to discuss the troubles deepfakes can cause.<p>It&#x27;s certainly arguable that doppelgangers made &quot;deepfakes&quot; easier in the past, but only easier to those who could hire the actor. And that this technology makes it so that hiring the doppelganger is unnecessary, but it&#x27;s by no means easier like the printing press made copying books easier.')
