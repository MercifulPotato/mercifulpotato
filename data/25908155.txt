Traveling for pleasure, while on-call at work, etc. Thing fits in my jacket pocket.<p>- Working on my car (plugging into the OBD port, tuning, etc).<p>- Gaming&#x2F;video while traveling. Its single-channel memory severely limits what you can play (unlike GPD&#x27;s gaming line), but I&#x27;m into oldschool and indie games so it&#x27;s fine. I could use my phone but I like PC games and software better.<p>Also it&#x27;s weird and I like weird things :)<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a primary workstation unless your situation really calls for it. I&#x27;ve used it with a USB-C docking station as a primary machine while I was between homes. It worked fine, bit slow. Went back to my Zen2 beast as soon as possible.<p>It charges and runs off of a normal USB-C power bank, which gives me ridiculous runtime for cheap. My &quot;minimal&quot; travel kit has the GPD, my phone, and one charger between the two. Crazy capability in a jacket pocket.<p>Things I don&#x27;t like about it:<p>- Whiny fan. Not sure what could be done, it&#x27;s so tiny... you can turn it off with a handy switch above the keyboard, but I don&#x27;t really like doing that.<p>- Single channel memory. Severely cripples the GPU. GPD&#x27;s gaming machines don&#x27;t have this issue.<p>- No video output over USB-C, you have to use the full-size HDMI.<p>- Display is wired sideways. Linux&#x2F;GRUB doesn&#x27;t auto detect this; Windows does.<p>- Wish it had a nub mouse. Would free up space for a more normal KB layout.<p>Edit: formatting')
