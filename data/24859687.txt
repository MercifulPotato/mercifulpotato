But I seem to remember that it arose because of slowly changing password requirements. Like I remember having a password in my teens for Myspace and other web services, and one day when signing up for a new service I was prompted with &quot;your password must contain at least one number&quot;. So I just took the same old password and put a number on the end of it. Then a few years later the same thing happened with special characters: &quot;Your password must contain at least one number and a special character&quot;. So then &quot;okay, just tack a special character on to the password I already know&quot; and voila &lt;word&gt;&lt;number&gt;&lt;special char&gt; is now my password.')
