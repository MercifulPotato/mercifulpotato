Item(by='swebs', descendants=None, kids=[25554402, 25554036], score=None, time=1609100526, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25553377, text='&gt;My name was SLJ7 until a few days ago, when that account got suspended. For those who don&#x27;t know, suspentions are Reddit&#x27;s answer to the controversial shadowban. I&#x27;m still able to view Reddit, but can&#x27;t interact in any way with my subs. I got a PM alerting me to this fact, and it very unhelpfully referenced the content policy, which I&#x27;m 99% certain I haven&#x27;t violated. So, I went through the fairly easy appeal process, stating that I don&#x27;t know what I did and would like to have my account back. I received what was certainly an automated response telling me my suspention would not be lifted, and I should familiarize myself with the content policy.<p>It seems like every year that website just gets worse and worse.')
