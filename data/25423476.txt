When I started using Gmail, my other mail client was mutt, but every other client at the time showed replies to email threads properly as a tree.<p>As an aside, you could argue that email conversations should look like a DAG (since you could totally quote multiple emails and have multiple In-Reply-To headers, why not) but I&#x27;m not aware of any clients that did that.<p>Gmail went a third way, completely linearizing a thread into a &quot;conversation&quot;.  This view makes it harder to have discourse over email:  if you want to make sure to split a conversation and have both forks get addressed, you have to change the subject line to un-thread replies to your message.')
