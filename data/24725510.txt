If so, why?<p>I use ed extensively. At least I have EDITOR=ed by default. This started mostly as an experiment to &quot;stretch my mind,&quot; but over time ed grew on me.<p>It changes the way you think about text editing in the same way that Haskell or Clojure or Forth change the way you think about programming.<p>Ed isn&#x27;t particularly interesting at first. It feels klunky and editing is slow. But a similar statement could be said about almost any musical instrument. It only really becomes interesting once you have interalized the mechanics of using your tool.<p>Personally, I find myself organizing text differently than when I use vim. With the latter, I definitely want my code to be <i>visually</i> appealing, while with ed I want it to be appealing <i>to edit</i>.<p>Definitely encourage you to give it a good, solid try if you&#x27;re interested.<p>Of note, there is a mildly famous APL programmer, Aaron Hsu, that claims to like line editors. He wrote his own actually: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arcfide&#x2F;ALE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arcfide&#x2F;ALE</a>.')
