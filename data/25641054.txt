Item(by='9wzYQbTYsAIc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609811413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640817, text='&gt; Seems like he has a couple of flag words &quot;cheap and fast&quot; in his URL that others have used in the past as indicators of spam domains, at least I&#x27;ve seen that for email. Even good isn&#x27;t great to use.<p>My own sense of spam smell got triggered by the name of the site, too. Sounded like a gimmick; you can have all three, after all.<p>A rebranding might solve his issue.<p>It could be very interesting to see a sort of A&#x2F;B test between the current site and a clone of the site but with a different name.')
