Immigration is becoming a citizen of another place. Americans can move almost anywhere. Becoming a CITIZEN is an entire different kettle of fish.<p>I feel like this is where a lot of misunderstandings in these discussions come from--the difference between being a permanent alien and being a citizen. In the United States there&#x27;s a process for people to become a full member of our society. There&#x27;s also a process for being a working alien here. Two different paths that don&#x27;t have to necessarily overlap.')
