Depending on the week NY is outperforming lots of states in the vax distribution.  Relative to Feds, State governments are not that big and do not have a lot of idle capacity.  Whatever idle capacity we did have has been taken out by PPE distribution, testing roll out and dealing with all the sick.<p>Realistically this is a FEMA&#x2F;NatGuard issue at this point.  We can’t expect to have any nurse capacity for vax considering hospitals are all full.  It’s a shame there was no planning for that in advance, but par for the course with DJT.\nFortunately it sounds like Biden is going to pull the trigger on that in first 100 days.')
