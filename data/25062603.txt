I think that although there are new movies coming out, the patterns are fundamentally the same and so movies have gotten boring<p>I completely agree. I used to read only non fiction books. I have started reading fantasy fiction books a year or two ago and the thing that blew my mind is that these books have stories! Not the Nth variation of the same pattern that exists in every Hollywood movie but something I had never encountered before. I had given up on novelty years ago. That is really refreshing.')
