Notably: this is not a subject Schneier has particular expertise in. There&#x27;s a layperson belief that &quot;cryptography&quot; is a single domain, but it is subspecialized. You might take Schneier seriously for block cipher cryptography (though that field has moved far past the last serious engineering writing Schneier did about it), but I don&#x27;t think it was ever the case that Schneier was someone you&#x27;d take to the bank for asymmetric cryptography.')
