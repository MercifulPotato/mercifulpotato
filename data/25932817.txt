Sure, tests usually contain sections of &quot;applying&quot; the knowledge, but ultimately it&#x27;s still studying to <i>and because of</i> the test.<p>If you&#x27;re lucky enough to be both versed in a subject <i>and</i> visit a school that provides extra-curricular engagement on these subjects, you may get a glimpse of what it feels like to solve a challenge <i>because you want to</i>. Otherwise you have do that completely separately from whatever formal education you receive.<p>It has personally taken me many years and several key experiences <i>outside of school</i> to fully grok that presentations aren&#x27;t just condensing a topic you don&#x27;t care about into a scheme somebody else dictates, held in front of an audience that would rather be elsewhere. Or that playing music isn&#x27;t just about getting the notes and their volumes right. But <i>now</i> I deeply enjoy both. I would imagine that many are similarly stuck with a terrible mindset regarding learning or problem solving due to the way they were educated, even if they would find it exhilarating with the right frame of mind.<p>&lt;&#x2F;tangent&gt;<p>So yeah, show off your self-directed projects in your resume. Thrill your interviewers with the cool problems you tackled. Mention key challenges you overcame.<p>Without exaggerating too much, I would say online course certificates are as indicative of your technical abilities as a screenshot of a completed Tensorflow download. And that extends to the message you send if you include them in your application.')
