The GGP correctly claimed it&#x27;s &quot;not hard&quot; for small teams to make games. The games they referenced were made by small teams. The fact those games used an off the shelf game engine is immaterial. There&#x27;s no &quot;point&quot; to make about it.<p>Your &quot;point&quot; comes off as a qualitative judgement about those developers using an off the shelf engine. If you&#x27;ve got no problem with someone using Unity what point are you really making?')
