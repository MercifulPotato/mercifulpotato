AFAIK you have to look them up yourself.<p>The navbar has links to new, threads, past, comments, ask, show, jobs and submit, but none of them even give a clear redirect link to get to the guidelines ... wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to add them to nav, or configure the site such that they&#x27;re displayed the first time you visit ? Always seemed a bit funny to me from a design perspective.')
