Even the ones Apple released today, notice how bad are the night shots they display on the website.<p>I have a dslr with two fixed (portrait and panorama) lenses, and night or day, every single shot is timeless. The quality won’t be outperformed by the next smartphone getting released next year. Of course, I can’t spontaneously shoot photos, need to decide when I want to actually shoot photos so I carry my camera.<p>Which is not a cons, even an advantage, if you’re truly looking for quality, not quantity.')
