And do they have to retire an old lens line to make room for a new one?<p>And this is way too much to ask here (I&#x27;m sure I need to read an optics intro), but how in the world do they solve that they need 12 elements, etc. to make some aberration go away, by combining 3 different index of refraction glasses in a certain order, etc!   Amazingly complicated.<p>I imagine now there are ray tracing solvers for it, but I wonder how they did it in the early days of lens design!')
