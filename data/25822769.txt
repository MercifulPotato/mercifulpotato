PCB shops look more or less the same anywhere in the world.<p>Most interesting things come after that.<p>&quot;Robots&quot; are very easily beaten on cost by manual labour unless there is crazy commitment to volumes, long production runs, and having robotisation done very thoroughly.<p>Automation has economic advantage in very narrow sets of circumstances.<p>Though the variance in non-automated assembly lines can be giant. You can easily spend 10 times to assemble a widget with same amount of people, and equipment by getting the process management wrong.')
