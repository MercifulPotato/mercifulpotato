You have to be conscious of the consequences of what you write. You shouldn&#x27;t rely on non-fixed-width types having specific lengths or on signed integer overflow, unless your code guarantees that things will work (preprocessor&#x2F;static_assert checks against standard&#x2F;compiler-specific properties). The worst offenders I see often is violating aliasing rules, especially in ways that could cause alignment issues.<p>In C, function isn&#x27;t an object, you can&#x27;t convert a function pointer as a void pointer and back, and use it. Yet I&#x27;ve seen that done many times, and it&#x27;s probably safe on things that act as if they have a von Neumann architecture.<p>If I&#x27;m relying on implementation-dependent functionality, I try to make it so that whatever it is will fail to compile instead of having incorrect behaviour.')
