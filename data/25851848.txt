Item(by='kansface', descendants=None, kids=[25852055], score=None, time=1611176039, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25851023, text='&gt; I think they couldn&#x27;t really. If you look into modern artists they are extremelly talented and their unique style that seems like _anyone could do it_ comes in later stages in their life.<p>This is incorrect (although I don&#x27;t know anything about the artist in question).  Contemporary art degrees are heavily moving away from teaching craft or even consider it a valid aesthetic or criterion for judgement (along the lines of rejecting the notion of good&#x2F;bad&#x2F;better&#x2F;worse).  Was there any identifiable craft involved in this piece?  Did the artists remove from circulation the boxes that weren&#x27;t broken in just the right way?  Is the art more interesting to look about than to talk about?  Marginally... I find the pile of boxes sorta aesthetically pleasing, but its not clear to me that was even done by the artist (and not the gallery).<p>What part of this piece are you proposing that a total outsider&#x2F;complete amateur couldn&#x27;t create on a first pass?  The form of the glass looks to be haphazard, (ie, unimportant the artist).  The boxes are off the shelf.  What else is left?')
