The system finds a set of morph points in successive keyframes and morphs between them. This can do slow motion without jerkyness, and increase frame rate. Any modern GPU can do morphing in real time, so playback is cheap. There used to be a browser plug-in for playing Framefree-compressed video.<p>Compression was expensive, because finding good morph points is hard. But now hardware has caught up to doing it in real time on cheap hardware.<p>As a compression method, it&#x27;s great for talking heads with a fixed camera. You&#x27;re just sending morph point moves, and rarely need a new keyframe.<p>You can be too early. Kerner Optical went bust a decade ago.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;VBfss0AaNaU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;VBfss0AaNaU</a>')
