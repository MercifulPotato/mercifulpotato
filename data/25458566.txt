Your privacy isn&#x27;t our priority. It&#x27;s not even close. Not because we want to track your every move. But because we simply don&#x27;t care. We&#x27;d rather spend what limited time we have actually improving the web site. We&#x27;re into taking pictures and adding content, not obsessing over what your dog had for lunch so we can sell it to MegaEnormousBigCo. We&#x27;re not tracking you. We&#x27;re not tabulating you. We&#x27;re not folding, spindling, or mutilating you. Seriously, your personal life is not important to us.
