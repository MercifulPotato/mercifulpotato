There&#x27;s an office and everyone has a desk and is presumed to be in the majority of the time but if you want to WFH you just did and let your team know. There was an understanding that for certain events you should try be in the office (big planning&#x2F;roadmapping meetings, retros and manager 121s) but otherwise it was at will.<p>If for some reason you needed to WFH for an extended period of time that was a conversation they were open to. For example a colleague&#x27;s partner was ill so he WFH for a month to help with the kids, or another colleague was changing meds and that was easier to cope with if they WFH that week.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ve just been lucky with employers but flexibility around WFH has always been a given for me.')
