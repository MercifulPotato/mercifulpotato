That the CPython maintainers have, time and time again, decided for a &quot;simple implementation&quot; has pushed away many professional VM engineers and researchers who would be more than willing to help maintain a JIT.<p>I also will say that a lot of the complexity of making a Python JIT is all the weird edge cases and special interpreter functionality. To a VM engineer, CPython is a very bizarre codebase; all the complexity is tucked away in corners other than its C codebase.<p>Your complexity has to go somewhere.')
