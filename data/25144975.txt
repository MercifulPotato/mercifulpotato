Apparently people suffering from addiction is the last group we are allowed to be prejudiced against.<p>Spoiler alert, the phone didn&#x27;t break your daughter. You and society did.<p>The major issue this brings to light is the complete ignorance around addiction. It is not caused by the substance or the activity, but rather other underlying issues (trauma, unmet needs). This mom sounds overbearing. This poor kid has probably been on the Ivy League track since preschool. School until 6:30PM, I can&#x27;t imagine what is wrong.<p>Addiction problem? Find the needs that aren&#x27;t being met. We have such a lack of knowledge about mental health, as a society, that most people don&#x27;t even know where to start.<p>The end of the article brings no reprieve. The mom basically throws her hands in the air and we can only assume that she will double-down on her overbearing, unhelpful approach.<p>You can ban phones and vaping, but it won&#x27;t do anything to address the underlying issues. Until we learn to proactively address mental health, it will only get worse. This article gives me zero hope.<p>Although it may not sound like it, I have a ton of compassion for the mom and the daughter. I used to have severe addiction issues, I was a real mess. I had to figure this stuff out by evaluating available information and (dis)proving it to my satisfaction through trial and error. With a lot of support, I managed to unfuck myself. I think I&#x27;m just frustrated with society in general. So many issues, so many simple ways to make headway on them, so little action or even understanding of the problem space. I can tell you one thing for sure, this lone autist is not going to save the world.')
