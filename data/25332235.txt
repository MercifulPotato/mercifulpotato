Climate change is real, it is an existential threat to human civilization, and it is to a very large degree caused by CO2 from burning fossil fuels. Those are scientifically established facts.<p>&gt; quite literally millions upon millions tons of persistent, bio-accumulating chemicals that are dumped into the rivers and oceans by large polluters.<p>This is <i>also</i> a serious problem. But it is A) not in fact as big of a threat, and B) would in fact also be significantly reduced if we stopped burning oil as fuel, because the oil extraction industry is one of the worst (quite likely <i>the</i> worst) source of &quot;persistent, bio-accumulating chemicals that are dumped into the rivers and oceans&quot;.<p>&gt; They love setting people on quixotic quest against fairly harmless CO2 while they continue dumping actual toxic poison into ecosystem.<p>You are doing exactly the thing you are criticizing.')
