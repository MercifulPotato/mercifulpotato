After awhile I got tired of having to go back and get a refund when the game&#x2F;movie would not come out for at least 1-2 years after the pre-order.  Now I just wait, and usually wait for a sale.  By the time the price falls the big crazy bugs are usually worked out.  The only time it made sense to pre-order is if there was some sort of merch to go with and even then it better be some nice swag.  Now I have a box full of useless junk that no one really cares about (even me) and a set of games I forgot about a long time ago.')
