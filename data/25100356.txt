As a result Apple will have only &quot;the faithful ones&quot; and will avoid reactions like recent Unreal fiasco ( in this case the faithful one is Unity). And as I see its working perfectly, most of tech you-tubers are in the bag by default, most of the designers and creative users are lazy (and technically challenged), corporate users, semi pros and regular iPhone crowd are already locked in and don&#x27;t care.
