If there are multiple options, I&#x27;ll chose the single header lib any day. If there aren&#x27;t and the library turns out to be cumbersome to integrate, I may just reinvent the wheel or do something different. E.g., I&#x27;d never ever integrate boost ever again into any of my projects and just reinvent the wheel instead or just not do whatever would have required boost.')
