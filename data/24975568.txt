To me it seems that binding those words together with hyphens makes the name harder to understand. What exactly is meant by Knowledge-Secure-Noninteractive-Argument? Surely a lunatic must have pasted all of those words together. The phrase doesn&#x27;t just change its meaning but loses it because some of the words were not glued on with hyphens and fell off.<p>In other words, my point is that arbitrary and gratuitous hyphens can make it more difficult to understand what ZK-SNARK means. The only system of hyphenation needed is the one that causes people to parse the meaning in the way that the writer intended.')
