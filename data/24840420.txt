Good question.<p>I split my time between the US and UK. One of the interesting things about GDPR has been that a lot of non-EU information controllers appear to have adopted it as their de facto DSAR &#x2F; right to be forgotten standard, so for many of these &quot;services&quot; GDPR works irrespective of territory (or the GDPR standard), and nearly all others have a simple format for deletion.<p>The thing which GDPR turbocharges is that you can submit a DSAR or deletion request to _any active email address_ and it must be actioned. So you don&#x27;t actually have to use the obnoxious forms they try to force you through.')
