If something is missing on a REST API you have to ask the backend developer to change it or create a new endpoint. In case of the former, the REST API gets bloated in case of many API consumers. Compare that to GraphQL and persisted Queries. The frontend developer can change the query themselves. If a change is required to the API they would still have to ask the backend developer to implement it. However, due to the nature of GraphQL other API consumers don&#x27;t get affected by the change. All in all you get more for less.')
