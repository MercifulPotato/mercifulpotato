The things I like about it are a good backlit keyboard that hasn&#x27;t been forced too thin, a bright screen I can see in sunlight, and a good battery life that hasn&#x27;t significantly diminished as I have owned the laptop. The only complaint I have is it will sometimes turn itself back on in my bag and drain it&#x27;s battery. The Precision 55XX line is basically their XPS line with a Quadro card baked in. The new 5550 model has a few spec bumps and a slightly nicer webcam placement and would be my recommendation if you need a Quadro card. Otherwise check out the latest Dell XPS line.')
