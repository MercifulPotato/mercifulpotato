The last mile means so much, probably will require some implementation from the competition. The real competition is challenging and making it cheap for amazon to rely on them so they can rise the price. I say that because majority of Amazon&#x27;s fulfilment is fraudulent in either or actual delivery.<p>Lasership is the Smaug&#x27;s missing scale for Amazon. They FAIL and FRAUD on every single shipment they have made to my apartment. When I see something is being shipped by them I by default do a return.<p>The competition will need to be able to affirm that every single shipment is made without widespread fraudulence.')
