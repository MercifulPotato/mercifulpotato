Ransomware attacks because of aging stack has nought to do with privacy or care.<p>There is very very little need to aggregate data given the risk of leaks, and very little value to any single patient when his data gets aggregatated. A system not influenced by pharma or software industry would make it incredibly expensive or hard to collect aggregate data, while keeping individual records usuable<p>The harsh reality is hospital administration and regulation tends to be skewed with doctors, it is the same with legislators who tend to be lawyers, or professional management tend to be sales than tech. None of these groups  understand the nuances of tech always to manage or regulate them better, sometimes they are smart or trust their advisors and get it right, but it hit and miss.<p>Data is money today , so industry is not interested in better safety of medical data either, preventing aggregate collection will loose a lot of value for med tech companies.')
