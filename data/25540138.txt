In my view they should have been planning for this right from the start and they unnecessarily screwed up a lot of people&#x27;s Christmas plans by leaving it until the very last minute to make this change.<p>Now even if the variant turns out to be a &quot;non issue&quot; (and we still have rising numbers anyway), I think it&#x27;s better that they took this action to further limit Christmas (as tough as it is for everyone) rather than take the &quot;wait and see&quot; or &quot;hope for the best&quot; approach, both of which seem to have been UK govnt strategies at one time or another during 2020.<p>* I&#x27;m being slightly flippant here.  This is clearly a tough time for a lot of people, and many families will be spending Christmas apart and will find this very hard for all sorts of reasons.')
