Item(by='yawaramin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607736170, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25393022, text='Was just thinking that the article carefully talks about &#x27;loneliness&#x27; and skirts around &#x27;happiness&#x27;. It points to another article[1] that claims to show that being alone doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean being lonely--but that article fails to make a case for that:<p>- First of all, in absolute numbers it shows that a <i>lot</i> of older people in developed countries are lonely. It may not be a <i>majority</i> of people but that&#x27;s kinda like saying &#x27;don&#x27;t worry, covid has a mortality rate of just 1%&#x27;.<p>- Then the article tries to show that people in these countries self-report that they have social support--that they have someone who can help them if they get in trouble--but it fails to show the breakdown of those who have social support <i>by age,</i> which is kind of the critical question here: do older people have social support?<p>- Then, the article tries to show that there&#x27;s not much correlation between being alone and being lonely--but it again fails to show whether this is true for older people specifically, or just for the aggregate sample.<p>- Then it talks about &#x27;aggregate&#x27; statistics again, instead of focusing on older people.<p>There seems to be quite a lot of bending over backwards trying to convince us that older people are not lonely, but no cogent argument.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;lonely-not-alone" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;lonely-not-alone</a>')
