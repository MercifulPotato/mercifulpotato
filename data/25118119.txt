I think the short answer is that Tesla is the future, and GM is the past.<p>Tesla is the technology leader in electric cars. Meanwhile existing automakers have massive inertia because their entire company is built around ICE cars. There is not only substantial technical know-how that you need to acquire, there is also substantial know-how that becomes obsolete, and the positions that have this know-how might resist any change.<p>In the case of GM you can also add that GM is largely irrelevant outside of the US and China, while Tesla finds international appeal and seems to have a much larger potential market than GM can find.')
