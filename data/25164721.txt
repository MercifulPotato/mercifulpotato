We had a similar experience with a &gt; $5K eval board from Xilinx that we were basing a product on, and a customer wanted to start software development before the product was ready so we sold them a setup that was equivalent to our product in design (and embedded the Xilinx board) They found a problem which turned out to be a design defect on the eval board so we went to Xilinx for a warranty replacement, they refused saying they expressly disclaim any &quot;fitness for purpose&quot; on their eval boards and their terms of service disallow using their eval boards in a product. I rather rudely asked them why they charged money for them then.<p>A very annoying experience.')
