Item(by='defen', descendants=None, kids=[24811955], score=None, time=1602956406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24811438, text='The wikipedia summary (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Citizens_United_v._FEC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Citizens_United_v._FEC</a>) is pretty good. The government can&#x27;t prohibit anyone (people, corporations, unions, etc) from making political speech, so long as it&#x27;s not directed by the candidate. So I can&#x27;t donate a billion dollars to a candidate&#x27;s campaign, but I can run a billion dollars of ads supporting him (or against his opponent), so long as I don&#x27;t receive direction&#x2F;instruction from the candidate. Or, in this case, make and advertise a movie. The question you have to ask yourself is whether the alternative would be worse.')
