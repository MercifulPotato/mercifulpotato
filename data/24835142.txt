I&#x27;m not up to speed with the exact politics, but I&#x27;ve heard the term in non-right wing contexts.<p>Seems to me like that would make it impossible to talk about things, which is what I&#x27;m seeing. How would you talk about Twitter canceling people without using the term &quot;cancel culture?')
