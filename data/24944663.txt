Take it with a grain of salt and kindly correct me where I misstated something.<p>If you view PyPy as a sophisticated test bed for virtual machine research it was a success. There are lots of conclusions about what works and what doesn’t, and benchmarks that show faster code when using many core. But the project ended with the conclusion the the STM model and the tracing JIT model don’t play well together, and the PyPy team preferred to stay with the tracing JIT.<p>Python and Ruby are very similar. The same JIT that powers PyPy powers topaz, which still performs quite well in ruby benchmarks even though it has been dormant since 2017')
