By the time anyone can figure out who’s really at fault it’s election time again.<p>Swiss cantons have virtually complete authority over their territories - it’s not surprising to me their large projects go much more smoothly: there are a single entity in charge and at blame.<p>In American society we deal constantly with our division of power: funding comes from all levels and therefore a single hiccup can break the entire chain. Suggesting that a city or state have authority over its own systems makes one persona-non-grata in most conversations - even in SF where our Mayor doesn’t have the authority to even replace the MTA director.
