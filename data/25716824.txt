Rather than having an “edit battle” over a single page and then having them always being locked down why don’t we have an “Omnipedia” where people can just fork a page if there is a legitimate alternative angle on something? We have the technology, just need a clever UI for visually browsing the various forks and a way of preventing the forks from becoming duplicates of the same alternative.')
