The virus is a serious situation but the stock market is acting like the worst is long  over. I know the stock market is not the economy , but I think it is no  longer a  catastrophe but rather more like a wildfire. It could have been a far worse situation if the IFR was 2-4% as originally feared back in Feb-March. Then we would probably be seeing the S&amp;P 500 about 50-70% lower than it is now, cuz when you got airborne cancer, that is not exactly something you can patch over by throwing stimulus money at it.  Now it&#x27;s more like a bad flu in terms of IFR for middle-aged people, but worse though for elderly, so I don&#x27;t want to dismiss that. But it could have bene sooo much worse, and we were spared that.')
