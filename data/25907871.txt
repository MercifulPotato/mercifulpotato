That amount of practice and effort to learn when you only want to spend 10-20 minutes working out is beyond a beginner. Aviron&#x27;s whole website is built around games and varied resistance. Having the rower do all the thinking for the user ala zwift workouts on a tacx is attractive.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why pelotons are popular when a tacx&#x2F;wahoo&#x2F;etc are lightyears ahead in feel and blunting the peaks of &quot;pain&quot; from beginner mistakes. The more advanced ERGs that adjust are super forgiving and the same would be for rowing, avoiding pulling too much lbf and having your arms hurt for weeks = avoiding the workouts.<p>People doing HIIT cardio usually blow up if they put out 10% more wattage for a minute or two than their FTP. If a machine makes it so you can workout &quot;forever&quot; and simplifies the interface of games&#x2F;workouts so users only need to focus on a single metric for game while adjusting all the others, it would be a killer feature.')
