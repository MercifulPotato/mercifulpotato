As far as I can figure out, it is only 1D SAR - that is the X axis is spatial, but the Y axis is actually <i>time</i>. If you fire radio waves at the ground at an angle, and the ground is flat, then you can easily map time to position. But buildings and hills mess up that mapping. I always assumed SAR used 2D arrays.<p>Again, really terrible explanation. It feels like they really didn&#x27;t want to explain it at all.')
