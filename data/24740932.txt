In 2019 and 2020 it has resulted in ~5% returns, in 2018 it resulted in 20% returns. Why? Athletic bluetooth earbuds. That single category was such a stinker that it singlehandedly quadrupled my return rate. 2015 had a similar spike when I started equipping an electronics lab, but 2016 and 2017 were fine. In any case, I think the reasonable return rate is a heavy function of what you&#x27;re buying. One person&#x27;s 10% return rate might be borderline fraudulent while another person&#x27;s 30% return rate might be perfectly reasonable.')
