While the job description always says spend a significant amount of time coding, I tend to eschew that if I can get away with it. I&#x27;m only writing code if I need to get in the trenches or things are in a such a good place that I have big blocks of free time.<p>My workday is 10-4:30. Of that I&#x27;m probably doing 3-4 hours of productive work a day (code review, architecture, planning, 1-1s, meetings). I don&#x27;t have any useless meetings, but the real killer is the 30-60 minutes between meetings where you don&#x27;t have enough time to do anything productive.<p>Unicorn startup in Canada.')
