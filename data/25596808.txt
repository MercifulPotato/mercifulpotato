Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m in Seattle, but I feel like their reputation has really turned a corner in the past year or two.<p>There&#x27;s still a lot of cruft from who they used to be, but I feel like most people I know echo the sentiment that Satya has been a revolution. Things like them embracing Linux,  acquiring and not ruining NPM and Github, contributing to open source projects, and all the work they&#x27;ve done with Dotnet Core seem to really have bought them a lot of goodwill, at least with the people I know.')
