(High Fructose Corn Syrup)<p>What does an apple contain?<p>HFCS comes in mostly two forms HFCS 42 and HFCS 55. The number denotes the dry fructose content. The rest is glucose. This means that 100g of dry HFCS contains 55g of fructose and 45g of sucrose.[0]<p>100g of raw apples contains 10.39 g of sugars. 2.07g of sucrose, 2.43g of glucose, 5.9g of fructose.[1] Sucrose is fructose and glucose connected by a single oxygen atom. Sucrase in your small intestine splits sucrose into equal parts glucose and fructose. Effectively you&#x27;re getting 6.935g of fructose and 3.465g of glucose or 66.7% and 33.3% respectively. Even if you want to keep sucrose separate<p>If you press these raw apples into juice then you&#x27;ll get a sugar profile that&#x27;s not too dissimilar from the soft drink that&#x27;s sweetened with HFCS. It really shouldn&#x27;t matter which you drink. Blaming all of these issues on HFCS specifically just means that these companies will switch to something like &quot;All Natural Apple Syrup&quot; that has even more fructose than HFCS did.<p>I do want to mention that eating an apple is different from drinking juice made from that apple. The fruit itself contains fiber, which will slow the absorption of sugar and will mitigate some effects of it. When you press a fruit into juice you tend to lose the fiber.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;food&#x2F;food-additives-petitions&#x2F;high-fructose-corn-syrup-questions-and-answers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;food&#x2F;food-additives-petitions&#x2F;high-fruct...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fdc.nal.usda.gov&#x2F;fdc-app.html#&#x2F;food-details&#x2F;171688&#x2F;nutrients" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fdc.nal.usda.gov&#x2F;fdc-app.html#&#x2F;food-details&#x2F;171688&#x2F;n...</a>')
