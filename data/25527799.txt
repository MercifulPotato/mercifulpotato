Either you pay up-front or you pay a subscription. Work out the total cost of ownership (you&#x27;ll need to estimate how long you likely keep the car either way.) Now take that final figure and either it&#x27;s worth it to you or it isn&#x27;t. How that final figure gets paid doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal?')
