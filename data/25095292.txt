Matrix is 6 years old.<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;foundation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;foundation</a> is effectively its own standards body, and once Matrix is more mature I hope it&#x27;ll end up being ratified by IETF or similar too.<p>In terms of &quot;XMPP not being adequately improved&quot; - XMPP is a very different proposition to Matrix.  Matrix is all about replicating conversation history around the place.  XMPP is message passing and pubsub.')
