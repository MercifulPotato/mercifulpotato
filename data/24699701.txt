It can be reduced to, &quot;if it were a public spat, it would be a public spat,’” I agree. It’s pretty self-evident. What I’m doing is highlighting that it <i>was</i> a public spat in the case of Fortnite, and <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> in the case of Bose.<p>I think the bit you’re missing is that once we’ve established that there is a difference between something being a public spat and something not being a public spat, we can use a phrase (like quietly stops) to add that information into a statement. Thus there’s a point to saying quietly, and the word is appropriate. That’s the point I’m making.')
