Most people don&#x27;t understand what BIFL means for a certain products because they don&#x27;t use it frequently, understand its breadth of use cases, understand its construction, etc.<p>Things like knives or cookware require a decent understanding of the materials used, construction process, and potential use cases to really guage if it&#x27;s BIFL or not in all common contexts. You&#x27;ll wind up with most people rating it based on two things I think: How long they&#x27;ve personally had it, and how much they like it.<p>You&#x27;ll also get people adding items like an iPhone because they just like it. But a phone is essentially a disposable electronics device. It doesn&#x27;t really belong on a BIFL website.<p>Perhaps a series of parameters need to be defined in order to enter a review at all. Try to determine the attributes that comprise a BIFL product and have reviewers define how the product meets these criteria. How is it durable? Why? What is repairable about it? Is it easy to find repair services? How long do you think it would really last for a typical owner?<p>Just trying to help - I&#x27;m a major fan of BIFL items, but over the years I find I&#x27;m routinely disappointed by what others believe fits in the category. I essentially don&#x27;t pursue BIFL items on the internet through any social means anymore because it tends to be pretty bogus.')
