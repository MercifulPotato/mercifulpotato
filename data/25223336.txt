From the studies I&#x27;ve read, the decline in capital returns has been compensated for by increase in rents, capital gains, and increase in housing value. It also takes into account all countries, instead of just the US. So in the end it&#x27;s not really relevant to the rate of return on capital, because they don&#x27;t even make an attempt to evaluate it - the closest they get is equity, but then they count capital gains and have incomplete dividend data.<p>It&#x27;s not immediately clear that increases in productivity growth or increases in innovation would necessarily lead to increase in returns - because if <i>everyone</i> innovates, you won&#x27;t be able to transform those into increased profit easily.<p>There&#x27;s only a few dozen studies on the return of capital, instead of general returns, and they tend to be made by heterodox economists, but they are correct and peer-reviewed, such as this one : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;0486613411423899" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;04866134114238...</a>')
