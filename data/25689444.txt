Users will expect it to work (unless the docs point out it is unreliable).<p>You should be suspicious of using floats and expecting the solver to detect if a solution is real. Consider the polynomial $x^2 + C$ for $C \\approx 0$. Are all of its roots real or complex? The problem is that even a very small change in C, maybe caused by rounding errors, can easily change a root from real to not real.<p>When solving polynomials, either use complex numbers throughout or insist on <i>exact</i> solutions and don&#x27;t use floats.')
