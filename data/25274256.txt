It&#x27;s basically C with classes.<p>If they haven&#x27;t kept up with the changes in their current language, what makes one think that they would &quot;move on&quot; to the alternatives, two of which aren&#x27;t even alternatives?<p>Before they switch to Rust it would be much faster and more efficient to use smart pointers, std::array, std::vector and stop using memcpy.')
