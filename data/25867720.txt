TFA is about batteries.<p>If you mean, self driving is a bigger competitive advantage, and that&#x27;s a bigger risk to Toyota&#x2F;Japan Inc... well, no.<p>Tesla sold 0.5M vehicles last year and is having trouble scaling up.  The total addressable market is over 100M vehicles per year, and self driving isn&#x27;t going to be a factor in most people&#x27;s purchase decisions for at least a decade. (More cars are sold in Asia than in the USA.)<p>&gt; I imagine accidents per km will become a huge purchase decision when self driving is more commonplace.<p>Accidents are reduced by advanced vehicle safety systems: &quot;self <i>stopping</i>&quot;, not self driving. Those systems can be fitted--even retrofitted--to <i>any</i> vehicle. [Edit: and they <i>are</i> being fitted to more and more vehicles.]  This is one of the most sad and tired arguments for self driving.')
