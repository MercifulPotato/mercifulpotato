Awkwardly, in modern academia.<p>- You can&#x27;t now easily define what  &quot;white&quot; means in your context (since this definition is not fixed or absolute), for example, so how can we understand the foundation of your work?<p>- You don&#x27;t now have a word for talking about how the experience of being a woman or disabled or gay etc is different (or not) for black people than it is for white people.<p>- You don&#x27;t now have a word for the experience of ethnic or cultural groups becoming discriminated against with political involvement.<p>It&#x27;s akin to saying research in computer science is fine, but the words &#x27;algorithm&#x27;, &#x27;lisp&#x27;, or &#x27;big data&#x27; show it to be bogus.')
