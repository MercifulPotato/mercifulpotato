I&#x27;ve always understood you only needed third party insurance, and the EU website [0] seems to back this up.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s very hard to imagine how payouts would be anywhere near those sums.<p>If you kill someone or permanently incapacitate them, you could be on the hook for their lifetime loss of earnings. Here&#x27;s [1] a family being awarded €650,000 following the death of their mother. Agreed, it&#x27;s still hard to rack up €20 million and I don&#x27;t know what the precedent is if you run over a billionaire, but in theory I believe the payout here is uncapped.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;europa.eu&#x2F;youreurope&#x2F;citizens&#x2F;vehicles&#x2F;insurance&#x2F;validity&#x2F;index_en.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;europa.eu&#x2F;youreurope&#x2F;citizens&#x2F;vehicles&#x2F;insurance&#x2F;val...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.personalinjuryireland.ie&#x2F;news&#x2F;fatal-car-crash-injury-compensation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.personalinjuryireland.ie&#x2F;news&#x2F;fatal-car-crash-in...</a>')
