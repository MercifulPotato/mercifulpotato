His action arguably made sense at the time, and didn&#x27;t require sacrificing Taiwan.<p>The US had plenty of time to safely pivot to a different position regarding China&#x2F;Taiwan (e.g. letting Taiwan get nukes in the 70s-80s; Shifting diplomatic position and recognizing Taiwan right after the Cold War was over; Not allowing Globalization to go so far in the 90s-00s). If the US didn&#x27;t take that option, one can blame successor presidents rather than Nixon.')
