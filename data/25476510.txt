And if you consider that the world at that time had just about 2 billion people, a modern Spanish flu would have killed 175 million people (100 times more than covid19), and probably more since denser population makes it easier for viruses to spread.<p>Now, we have the (repeatedly) proven ability to avoid such a disaster, and you argue we should not? You really think protection from disease is not a basic human right?')
