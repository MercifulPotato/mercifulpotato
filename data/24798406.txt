Being an incompetent grifter isn&#x27;t &quot;radical.&quot;<p>&gt; - increased military spending to Iraq war levels during peace time<p>The defense budget is significantly smaller as a percentage of GDP than under Obama: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;trumps-defense-spending-exaggerations&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;trumps-defense-spending-ex...</a><p>&gt; - trillion dollar deficits during boom times<p>Bad, but not radical.<p>&gt; - fired dozens of cabinet members and other top officials whenever they didn&#x27;t display dictator levels of obsequience to him<p>&gt; - got impeached for using US diplomacy for personal political gains<p>Bad, but not radical.<p>&gt; - tried to kick millions off of SNAP<p>Clinton did way more welfare reform than Trump.<p>&gt; - had DOJ help states kick people off voter roles<p>Cleaning up voter rolls is required by federal law.<p>&gt; - reduced confidence in the election process<p>Bad, but not radical.<p>&gt; - changed DOJ&#x27;s long standing definition of civil rights to instead protect religious people and white and asian discrimination<p>Not radical. In Evanston, Illinois, Asian kids are now being held back from returning to in-class instruction: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;can-school-be-antiracist-a-new-superintendent-in-evanston-ill-has-a-plan-11601982001" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;can-school-be-antiracist-a-new-...</a>. We can debate the merits of this, but it&#x27;s not radical to suggest that discrimination against asians is a violation of civil rights laws.<p>&gt; - pulled out of major international agreements with little notice including the Paris Agreement and the Iran deal<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;radical&quot; to pull out of an agreement we had been part of for less than a year since its effective date: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paris_Agreement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paris_Agreement</a><p>Presidents change course on foreign policy all the time. Trump&#x27;s foreign policy has been relatively successful.<p>&gt; - attacked european allieas and weakened NATO<p>Are you talking about a concrete policy?<p>&gt; - cut legal immigration in a bunch of ways including cut refugee by 80% and cut H1B.<p>Not radical. European countries have done the same thing recently, after realizing their 2015 actions on refugees were ill-advised. Calling a cut to H1B &quot;radical&quot; is hard to credit. Is every small shift to the right from a Republican President &quot;radical?&quot;<p>&gt; And implemented draconian inhumane policies on illegal immigrants.<p>Very bad, maybe radical.<p>&gt; - appointed hundreds of extremely ideological judges<p>No, just normal conservative judges. The &quot;extremely ideological judges&quot; are ones that think you can look at a 230-year old document and find new things in it that nobody realized were there before. We have normalized that gaslighting, but taking a view that the words on the page mean what they say isn&#x27;t &quot;radical.&quot;')
