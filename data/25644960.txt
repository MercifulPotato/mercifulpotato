No backups, no sympathy, simple as that.<p>2FA is worthless if you start to put holes in it like that.<p>So if you value your data, make backups - preferably locally the old-fashioned way, e.g. HDDs stored in at least two different locations or at least using several different cloud providers (which have their own infrastructure and aren&#x27;t just relying on AWS&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;etc.).<p>There&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;trade-off&quot; when it comes to cyber security - either commit to it fully or just don&#x27;t use 2FA at all.<p>Personally, I think 2FA that doesn&#x27;t rely on physical devices (phones, keys, smart cards, etc.) is unreliable and sketchy anyways.<p>If you can&#x27;t spare a few hundred bucks on a NAS that you can just put in a storage unit or bank vault if need be, you data can&#x27;t be that valuable anyway.')
