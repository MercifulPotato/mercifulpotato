There&#x27;s a new major release every six months, and upgrading is usually fairly painless.<p>It&#x27;s fantastic for large applications. I&#x27;ve used it in a large product with hundreds of pages and forms and dialogs, and it would have been a nightmare without the sort of structure that Angular provides. It reminds me of Rails a little bit, in that it&#x27;s opinionated about how things should work and you might feel some friction if you try to do something unusual.')
