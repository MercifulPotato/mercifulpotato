Usually it&#x27;s lovely, but now during Corona times it&#x27;s an absolute nightmare. There are no sleeper trains, because something something infection, so you get to sleep in normal compartments. Also, the train passes through five countries. Normally you don&#x27;t notice, but now they&#x27;ll wake you up at every single border too look at your passport, say hmmmm and then let you sleep again.')
