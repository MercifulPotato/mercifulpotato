And of course, $200 taken out of a paycheck before you receive it doesn&#x27;t feel as bad as a monthly $200 charge to your credit card.<p>The other reason is adverse selection: When an entire employee base gets health insurance together, the people needing expensive care and the people not needing any care all average out together.<p>But in the individual market, less healthy people are insured but more sick people are. Healthy people forgo health insurance, so the average cost per person rises.')
