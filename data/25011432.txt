I mean after probable initial period of discomfort for some, it would be of great benefit to everybody to naturally get used to our differences and to see that say a maga wearer can be a great guy and coworker what you can talk with and not some stupid redneck from backwoods, and pride wearer is also a normal person like you, not just some perverted servant of Satan.
