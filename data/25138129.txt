It&#x27;s conceivable that the excess power could be used for that or some other peripheral. I know I can charge my MBP off the excess power from my Dell w&#x2F;thunderbolt 3, with a similar power supply discrepeny (only ever measured 50-60W used in system, but power supply is rated for 110-120W IIRC)<p>Or, they&#x27;re just being lazy&#x2F;economical and reusing old stock.')
