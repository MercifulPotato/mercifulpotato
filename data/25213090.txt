Here is my experience about reskilling: I quit my banking career 3-4 years ago with the thought of career transition. I thought the daily routine that I had could easily be automated. Therefore, I made the decision to leave my job quite easily after having a burnout. First I took a gap year in a foreign country to recover from burnout totally. I came back to my country in the beginning of 2019 start learning to code immediately. I learnt Python. It was, and still is, a popular language, so learning Python should be a logical decision for me. I thought 6 months would be enough to learn fundamentals and transition your career. First I took a bootcamp that lasted 6 months and applied for jobs after I finished it. It didnt go as it planned. I couldnt find a job. Now it has been more than 1 and half years. Still no job. I have started my master degree in IT and am specializing in Data Analysis&#x2F;Science to be more specific. I consider my undergraduate degree relevant to Data Science, which is Mathematics. Still no positive response  from employers. I completed all necessary stuff to put on my resume like end-to-end projects and MOOC specializations(yes it&#x27;s more than one) Luckily, I am earning my living by tutoring and no financial concerns for near future. My point is reskilling and learning to code are not always guarantee someone a new job as the caption suggests. At least, I love spending time with computers and totally enjoy what I do whether I can find a job or not.')
