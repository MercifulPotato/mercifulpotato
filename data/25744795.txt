Amazon removing Parler hurt them from my subjective view a lot more than hosting them. I will never host anything on AWS since I know I could get removed at any time because of political reasons.<p>I am sure Amazon hosts a lot of sites that I don&#x27;t agree with but that doesn&#x27;t mean I will hold them accountable. It is simply stupid.<p>If you think Parler did something wrong, which I don&#x27;t think they did (at least if you compare equal shitty places like Twitter), hold Parler accountable and not Amazon for hosting them.<p>Don&#x27;t be part of the angry mob. Be smarter.')
