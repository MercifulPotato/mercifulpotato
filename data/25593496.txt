People without those inherent advantages have fewer resources and would like more of them. People don&#x27;t like to lose what they have, but they&#x27;d take more if they can.<p>Not saying this is the &quot;correct&quot; or morally right interpretation, but I&#x27;m just pointing out that this study probably says less than it appears. I don&#x27;t think this study allows you to make a call on whether some people empathize with other people.')
