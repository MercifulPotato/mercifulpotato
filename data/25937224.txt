Too long lines are not comfortable because it&#x27;s difficult to find the start of the next line, that&#x27;s true. But too short lines force you to find the start of the next line every couple of words, and that&#x27;s annoying too. There&#x27;s a middle ground somewhere, and I think it&#x27;s not the same for everyone. The 650px used on the &quot;better&quot; size is certainly too short for me. I can&#x27;t count the number of sites where I open the style editor in dev console and go hunting for max-width or whatever to set it to a more comfortable width. So just respect the width of the browser window, which anyone can choose to their own liking. Some margin left and right is OK, perhaps even preferable.<p>The other thing is font size. Browsers have settings for font size, and in modern browser you can change the size with ctrl+ and ctrl-. Why override that choice?<p>I like overview: being able to not just see the sentence I&#x27;m reading, but a whole lot of context. Short lines, large fonts and large line-heights all work against that.<p>What I do like, I think, is #444 for the text instead of pure black. Looks less aggressive that way. And some amount of margin left and right. Something like the original page plus &quot;body { margin: 40px 100px; color: #444; }&quot;.')
