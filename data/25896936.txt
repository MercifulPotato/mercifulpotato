This is the key to understanding the &quot;clueless&quot; or the &quot;educated gentry&quot; ladder, they are unhappy with being in &quot;labor&quot; but lack the balls&#x2F;intelligence&#x2F;true desire&#x2F;luck&#x2F;whatever else to be the &quot;elite&quot;, so they come up with alternative scoring rules. Why do you think writing an op-ed in the NYT is so highly desired in that ladder? The other ladders don&#x27;t dabble in praise, they either want their jobs to satisfy basic life needs (labour) or want ever-growing power with minimal regard to others opinion (elite), more specifically others opinion is only relevant insofar as it is a stepping stone on the path to more power.')
