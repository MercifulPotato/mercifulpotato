I think, although it is perfectly technically feasible in a vacuum it is not in real life.</i><p>HN is likely not the best forum for this argument, but I&#x27;d have two answers to this:<p>1. Email is popularly adopted. It&#x27;s difficult to add improvements because it&#x27;s a federated protocol from the 60s, but it is still popular.<p>2. The reason we haven&#x27;t had popular adoption <i>since</i> is because: (a) email was publicly developed, whereas most newer tech is private; the market favours easy (cheap) over better (hard, expensive) and federated is harder to do (with worthwhile benefits); and (b) the major downside of centralisation -vs- federated is vendor lock-in, which is bad for users but good for shareholders.')
