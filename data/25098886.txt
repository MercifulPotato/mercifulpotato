My understanding is the Mongols had no writing until Ghengis Khan, nowhere near the written culture of the chinese, but don’t know we’ll enough to argue the details)<p>&gt; Military techniques that work transcend culture.<p>Material culture, ie no guns or steel armor. Military technique is <i>highly</i> contingent on the society and technology that gives rise to it: the army is always in some fashion a mirror of the state. For example <i>Fire in the Lake</i> is a really fascinating analysis of (in part) why transplanting western military practice to south Vietnam (as ARVN forces) failed while the Viet Cong flourished.<p>Ignoring that requires reducing military knowledge to  contextless aphorisms like “decapitate the command structure”. I’m open to seeing evidence, but I’d be shocked if the Inca <i>actually</i> never thought of “kill the leader”.<p>I’m not saying that military history isn’t valuable or important. Obviously it is. My point is that the transmission of practice and the study of history are not the same thing. Calling the study of military history the decisive factor <i>in military history</i> is a strong claim that calls for strong evidence. Just identifying having a highly developed material culture with having greater access to historical knowledge doesn’t cut it.')
