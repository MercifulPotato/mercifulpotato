Signing is a way of ensuring the email has not been tampered with. The attacker created a domain that looks similar to the original (e.g. using gooogle.com instead of google.com). Google gets around this by owning all the alternatives but many other companies cannot realistically do this). Even if we had secure end-to-end email, their emails would still be signed because the scammers are using their domain, and can set DKIM, SPF, DMARC records to ensure their emails are not tampered with. In a future where our emails are encrypted with PGP, email recipients would look up the PGP public key of a email sender, and would get the one the scammer had uploaded.<p>The reason why people hate on LetsEncrypt somewhat, is that these scammers can create a TLS certificate immediately and for free for their new phishing domain (e.g. gooooogle.com). It would have otherwise been a small financial barrier for scammers to get this setup, and some of these scammers operate on volume (trying many different domains, getting only a few victims). I think LetsEncrypt does a great job, yes there is a small price to pay to allow the rest of the internet to have secure http traffic (https).<p>I think the real issue is of user experience. There is no easy way to check who your emails came from except from checking the from: field in the email. Reading these emails is boring and tiring. I think if email clients warned users to validate sender email addresses when receiving emails for the first time, it would make it safer. Therefore, bob@goooogle.com will show up for validation again, and the user has to read and validate it.<p>Effectively, I suggest using &quot;whitelists&quot; instead of &quot;blacklists&quot;. If I had a startup, I would think deeply about not provide emails to my employees. That&#x27;s how bad I think it is. But then again, to communicate with other companies, its either email or linkedIn...')
