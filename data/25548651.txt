How do you actually edit your wiki? As far as I can tell, when I make changes the wiki &quot;saves&quot; by making a new commit and pushing it to GitHub, but it doesn&#x27;t modify the file itself. Meaning in order to update my local copy, I have to manually pull the changes down from GitHub every time. This seemed extremely awkward to me and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing something or doing something wrong')
