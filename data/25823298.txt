I work with Turquoise. We&#x27;re actually building some stuff where patients can collectively bargain outside their insurance. But for now, it&#x27;s most useful to people with insurance that see that one hospital down the road has a lower rate for their given insurance. (EG, the blue cross rate is better the next town over). We&#x27;re going to make it easier to filter for insurance shortly.<p>Also, very useful for cash pay.')
