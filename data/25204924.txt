I like the Precursor&#x27;s approach to making the hardware and software verifiable, but actually I think it&#x27;ll just attract more attention. &quot;Oh, you have a Precursor&#x2F;Trezor&#x2F;Ledger&#x2F;etc, what are you hiding?&quot;<p>My personal solution is twofold - I have no secrets, if you know the right questions to ask me. There&#x27;s no reason to kidnap my loved ones or blackmail me, if I&#x27;m quite willing to tell you directly (but only if you ask). Some things I&#x27;m quite happy to publicly announce: I&#x27;m not a spy, have never worked for a government, and have no interest in military-related research of any kind. I&#x27;m more of a &quot;maker&quot; kind of &quot;hacker&quot; than a &quot;penetration&quot; kind of &quot;hacker&quot;.<p>The second part of my superficial protection is hiding in plain sight. I keep a lot of adaptors (DP-HDMI, SD-WiFi, USB host-WiFi, WiFi-USB HID) in the back of an iPod.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;150180606@N08&#x2F;49613276321&#x2F;in&#x2F;photostream&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;150180606@N08&#x2F;49613276321&#x2F;in&#x2F;p...</a><p>That goes through airport security no problem (in pre-COVID days at least). It&#x27;s still a functioning iPod. Inside it looks like electronics. Therefore it doesn&#x27;t attract attention, at least not as much as the SwissCard pocket knife that lives next to it. I&#x27;ve got some software steganography ideas that are similar, but that&#x27;s a blog post for another time.')
