Item(by='tloup', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611215909, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25854841, text='IIRC in a documentary about spanish produce vs german greenhouse produce they calculated that german produce is much higher in co2 output than spanish, even when the spanish produce is delivered by a semi all the way from Spain! Simply because in spanish climate there is no need for a greenhouse to grow e.g. bell peppers or tomatoes. \nI only found a german source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.umweltdialog.de&#x2F;de&#x2F;verbraucher&#x2F;lebensmittel&#x2F;2015&#x2F;Klimakiller-Tomaten-.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.umweltdialog.de&#x2F;de&#x2F;verbraucher&#x2F;lebensmittel&#x2F;2015...</a><p>it says:<p>German, heated greenhouse outside of season: 9.3 KG of CO2 per KG tomatoes (well, that is unexpectedly high)<p>Non heated greenhouse: 2.3KG of CO2 per KG tomatoes<p>open land in spain: 0.6KG of CO2 per KG<p>open land in Germany in season, conventional: 0.085KG of CO2 per KG<p>open land in Germany, organic: 0.035KG of CO2 per KG<p>although it&#x27;s from 2015, I don&#x27;t think that much has changed in 5-6 years to make up such a big difference between heated, nonheated, open land and regional. It also factors in transport from Spain to Germany which is why open land in spain has a higher co2&#x2F;kg than german open land.<p>edit: of course I can&#x27;t find anything that compares vertical hydroponic farming to greenhouses, all I can find relates to CO2 dosing in greenhouses :&#x2F;')
