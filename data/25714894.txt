It does not seem like a stretch to assume that a significant part of the BLM&#x27;s decision calculus involved weighing the cost-benefit analysis of the gun-fight that would likely result from them trying to force the issue.<p>That being said, there are, of course, a bunch of other examples of armed conflicts with the government that do not turn out well for the &quot;citizens&quot; when the government decides to violently pursue its goals (1985 MOVE bombing, Waco, Ruby Ridge, etc).  But, I guess my point with all of this is that, for better or worse, the proliferation of guns in American society certainly does have an effect on the decision matrix of the government (even if the &quot;citizen militia&quot; ultimately does not stand a chance against a determined government response...')
