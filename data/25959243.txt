For example, now they know people with breathing difficulty should be kept in prone position. I dont know if that applies outside of Covid19, but I thought it was really interesting to see them learn it. Like &quot;oh, what we&#x27;d normally do is bad but this variation is good&quot;.<p>Medicine also suffers from a fear (justified) of litigation. If they dont follow accepted practices they may get sued if someone dies. The funny thing with Covid was watching that fear when there was no accepted treatment. Seeing them say &quot;The FDA hasn&#x27;t approved that for covid&quot; when they hadn&#x27;t approved <i>anything at all</i> yet.')
