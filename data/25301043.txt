That plus loads of speculation presented as fact. &quot;The Dothraki were based on demeaning stereotypes as evidenced by their clothing choices&quot; is unconvincing<p>Historically inaccurate: sure. Granted. Motte.<p>Demeaning stereotype: Let&#x27;s take an offhand comment, load it with unsupported meaning, link it with Historical Inaccuracy, call it demeaning. Boom. Bailey.<p>Edit: responding to your edits<p>&gt; * &quot;nomad cultures are nothing like this&quot; *<p>He cherry-picked ways that the Dothraki are different from horse-riding, raiding cultures and labeled this demeaning. Did he talk about ways that Dothraki culture is similar to horse-riding, raiding cultures? No, he did not. It&#x27;s All Wrong and Bad<p>&gt; * Cancelling&quot; refers to censorship. You cant cry censorship ... *<p>You literally just redefined a word that I used and argued against this new, less defensible, dumb position. Don&#x27;t do that.<p>&gt; * Also, author criticized other aspects of GoT a lot previously ... *<p>Not sure what that has to do with this article being a <i>motte</i> and <i>bailey</i>. I&#x27;m sure his other articles are marvelous.')
