They are independent, so they have their own budget -- and they to keep it pretty balanced, at least judging by their road condition. They get a tiny amount from federal&#x2F;state level (less than 1% of their income). And you cannot say &quot;it is all subsidized by high-density areas&quot;, because those towns do not have such areas.<p>As far as &quot;taxes to the local city&quot; -- the city their residens are likely commuting to gets plenty of money from the all the commercial housing taxes (in 2020, it got 65% of the taxes from the commercial properties)<p>Seems pretty sustainable to me. Yep, it is expensive and I (for example) cannot afford to live there, but they have no problems selling houses. And they have great parks, too, so I like that they are around.')
