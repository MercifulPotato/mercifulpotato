Rather, I think it&#x27;s not <i>immoral</i> to negotiate down a salary based on fair yardstick (COL). Annoying, perhaps, but not immoral.<p>It&#x27;s immoral to exploit your employees, lie to them, not keep to a contract, deny them the growth opportunities they were lead to believe they have etc. But to negotiate a lower pay, that&#x27;s not immoral. As an employee, take it or leave it.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;d love to get a SF salary and live in an Alpine valley in Italy or France. Maybe the world will come to that arrangement. But if not, I wouldn&#x27;t call it immoral.')
