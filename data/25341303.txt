The judge went ahead and issued a warrant even though all actual evidence said her house was not involved. Cops lied and said it totally was, and the judge just said &quot;sure thing bros, we&#x27;re all such buds.&quot;<p>My point is just because a judge issues a warrant doesn&#x27;t actually mean anything at all. It has the same factual basis as me saying the sky is actually made of M&amp;M&#x27;s and judge granting a decree that it must be true because I said it.')
