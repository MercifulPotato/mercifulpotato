He has secured a profit of $13.8 million dollars, and his remaining open position is valued at $45 million.<p>I would caution people to not quickly fall into the &quot;if he&#x27;s still in, I&#x27;m still in&quot; meme. He has secured a $14 million bag, regardless if the stock goes to zero he&#x27;s already secured a life changing amount of money, he can afford to weather the storm. If you&#x27;re holding because he&#x27;s still in and you haven&#x27;t taken any profits you are nowhere near in the same position as him.<p>A hodling mania has overtaken the subreddit that would make btc blush. Know that we don&#x27;t know what kind of deals are happening behind closed doors in these two last days of manipulated activity. A sustained short interest does not necessarily mean that the shorts are holding their initial position, they could have closed and reopened at these elevated levels.<p>The narrative has changed so quickly from this being a value play, to a short squeeze, to now militant activism via buying stock as a means to sticking it to the man. The rhetoric is as volatile as the price. The overall market is stressed, things are getting weird and I would not be surprised if this is the beginning of another stock market crash.')
