Even though I&#x27;ve tried to find dark places to see the stars, I have never in my life seen the night sky without light pollution.\nI&#x27;ve thought about it a lot and there probably isn&#x27;t the political will to start something like this, but I think there should be, on the last new moon in August (any day would work, but it has to be the dark and clear), a national night sky holiday, where everyone turns off the lights for an hour after midnight, so we can all get a chance to really see the stars. (Turning off the the power for an hour would be even better, but that might cause problems with the power grid.)')
