Presumably that would be a good way to get that user banned from most popular servers.<p>Suppose @alice:example.com says “Empire Strikes Back is bad”, and @bob:example.org labels Alice with “uploaded child abuse”.<p>The label attached to @alice:example.com is not “uploaded child abuse” but “uploaded child abuse, according to @bob:example.org”.<p>Perhaps @charlie:example.net discovers this and labels Bob with “false moderator”. Maybe @drew:example.horse labels Bob with “false moderator” and Charlie with “true moderator”. Each server can decide whether they trust Bob, Charlie and&#x2F;or Drew.<p>Anyone who cares enough can check whether Bob&#x27;s assertion about Alice was correct, and so they can learn whether to trust Charlie and Drew.<p>This is similar to how blocking works on [scuttlebutt](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ssb.nz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ssb.nz</a>), which is subjective by design — if I can see that a few people I trust have blocked a certain identity, and they&#x27;ve left a message saying why, I can choose to trust them and block that identity myself.')
