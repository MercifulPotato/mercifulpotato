E.g. cameras that would regularly go offline for maintenance between 3am &amp; 4am (precisely when you need it...), or cameras that would freeze and show you a sweetly sleeping silent baby that turned out to be simply a frozen frame from 45 minutes previously etc and the live stream had failed, cameras that would lose wifi for no reason that required intricate sequences of button-holding-down-for-x-seconds-then-tapping-then-releasing-etc (not great when you&#x27;ve had about 30 minutes of sleep over the past 36 hours), app-connected things with <i>awful</i> apps that crash or don&#x27;t quite work right unless you do things in the exact right order etc. We even ended up with a digital clock in-frame for a while so when we looked at the video we could tell if it was &quot;live&quot; or not... this is how unreliable a lot of baby monitors you find on amazon or high street retail.<p>Once these things fail you once, they cannot be trusted again. Ever.<p>Perhaps me and my wife are just ultra neurotic, but there you go.<p>We ended up with a fairly reliable set up for multiple redundancy that seems to work:<p>- a DECT-based monitor from BT that actually <i>does</i> detect cries (you can entirely mute the intercom but it will audibly-beep and flash a warning if it hears a cry - also does temperature read outs and alerts).  100% ultra bullet-proof reliability so far.<p>- a Google Nest camera (only camera we found that has been acceptable in terms of reliability &amp; non-shonky app - it does mysteriously &quot;go offline&quot; from time to time, but it sends a notification &amp; and email as well as the app being clear it is offline, and usually recovers on its own fairly quickly). Expensive compared to other options (and not specifically a &quot;baby monitor&quot;) but worth it I think (we do not pay for the subscription though)<p>- an &quot;Owlet&quot; heart-rate and oxygen sensor (although this has poor hardware reliability - the charging port physically crumbles and the &quot;sock&quot; that the sensor goes into is easily moved to a bad position by the baby squirming around.... although the fail-safe there is that it will alert if this happens).')
