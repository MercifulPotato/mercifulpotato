Granted I have an older phone - Galaxy S7 - but for something that worked just fine on even older devices, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a valid excuse for it being nearly unusable on an S7 now. Thankfully Maps Go is pretty quick, but the biggest feature I miss out on with the Go version is offline maps.')
