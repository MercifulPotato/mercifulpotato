I did a Google search and the thing that came up were all on HN. Did they at least make a few PR pieces saying that they are using ECC memory now because I dont see any with searching. Admitting they made a mistake without officially saying it?<p>I mean the whole world of Server or computer might not need ECC insanity was started entirely because of Google [1] [2] with news and articles published even in the early 00s [3]. And after that it has spread like wildfire and becomes a common knowledge that even Google doesn&#x27;t use ECC. Just like Apple using custom ARM instruction to achieve their fast JS VM performance became a &quot;fact&quot;. ( For the last time, no they didn&#x27;t ). And proponents of ECC memory has been fighting this misinformation like mad for decades. To the point giving up and only rant about every now and then.
