I&#x27;d say the assumptions are that<p>1. Amazon knows the fakes, if they exist, came specifically from this seller. I doubt this because of their comingling problems.<p>2. That the threshold of complaints required to initiate this type of action is a reasonable one. And furthermore that the complaints are valid. It could be a matter of a few 3rd party competitors, it could be the original wholesaler trying to throw a wrench into Amazon&#x27;s systems, it could be customers who are angling for credits, free products etc. As well all of this plays with assumption #1 and comingling.')
