I suspect it&#x27;s a fear of the overly vocal ones - ie, perhaps they(OP) thinks hiring someone with that label would be like hiring someone holding Jesus signs on street corners or dudes at colleges with microphones.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say that hiring those people is bad, but i suspect OP has been burned by people who can&#x27;t keep their personal lives personal. Many religions inherently push you to share and spread the religion, so it&#x27;s not unreasonable that a lot of religious people focus on pushing their agenda.<p>With that said i don&#x27;t think a twitter profile is a good indication on whether or not someone would let their religion get in the way of their work and&#x2F;or work relationships.')
