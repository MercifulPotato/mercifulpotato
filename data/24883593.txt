I rely on Gmail, so I don&#x27;t use any of their other services. Wouldn&#x27;t be able to delete accounts for their other products, might accidentally trip something that gets my Gmail disabled, etc. Not worth the hassle or the risk.<p>So no more Facebook, no more Instagram, don&#x27;t currently use Whatsapp and will keep it that way.')
