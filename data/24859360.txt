If they didn&#x27;t want to inconsistently enforce the rules for individuals, they could have a policy like any account with at least xx million followers must implement 2fa.<p>What incentive do they have to not do something like this? Surely anyone with millions of followers isn&#x27;t going to leave Twitter because of this requirement (new users might, hence only requiring it for accounts of a certain size)')
