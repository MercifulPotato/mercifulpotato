Item(by='toyg', descendants=None, kids=[24980450], score=None, time=1604397207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24977473, text='<i>&gt; do not see the same talk about H2 (agricultural workers) coming in to work in US and people arguing that they are making the farm wages depressed.</i><p>That’s just because people affected by that policy are not able (or educated enough) to make their argument in any forum you might be reading, and have long resigned to the idea that they are shit jobs anyway so might as well leave them to the poorest of the Earth — particularly when it means everyone benefits from low food prices.<p>The same happens in the UK (and other wealthy European countries). Society as a whole has accepted that seasonal rural work should be left to a transient workforce from poorer areas <i>in order to keep food prices down</i>. Locals wouldn’t be bothered with those jobs without a significant wage increase, which would push prices up quite dramatically. Even in the context of an isolationist and xenophobic wave, it was always assumed the UK agri sector would be exempted by migration restrictions - and effectively it has been. In many ways, it’s a more honest and frank argument than in other sectors, in its brutality.<p>I’m a migrant myself but I’ve long come to the conclusion that we should be a bit more honest in this particular debate. Yes, we do keep salaries down, which increases profitability and competitiveness for companies, keeping the supply-side of the economy well-lubricated in the age of global competition. This is largely necessary, unless you want to stagnate like early-00s Japan. It just has to be compensated with higher corporate taxes and more quality services &#x2F; low prices for everyone, to keep society fair.')
