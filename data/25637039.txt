I chose a single large screen in preference to a multi-monitor setup.<p>I&#x27;d probably have liked it even more when I was a teen with great eyesight.<p><i>&gt; Do you use a tiling window manager to allocate all that space?</i><p>No, but you <i>will</i> often want to use multiple windows - CAD software and things you might still fullscreen, but webpages and suchlike don&#x27;t generally benefit from it.<p>When I got it, Ubuntu let you tile windows with Ctrl+Alt+Numpad - alas they dumped that feature, so now I have to resize my windows manually.<p><i>&gt; Do you use it for gaming at all? If so, how hard is it to keep track of everything on the display?</i><p>Yes, but I generally play slow-paced games like Civilization.<p>Many games scale up the entire UI with screen resolution, and you can always move your chair back if you want the small-screen experience.<p>Obviously, if you want to play fast-paced games like FPSes in 4K you&#x27;ll need a $$$ graphics card; initially, I had a &quot;4K capable&quot; GPUs and it would run spreadsheets and web browsing and 4K video no problem - but not a triple-A FPS.<p><i>&gt; Do you find yourself having to turn your head to keep track of everything?</i><p>With my seating I move my eyes rather than my head.')
