There were 4 executive orders about it in late July. Once was specific to insulin, but the important order enforces most-favored-nation status on drugs. The USA is supposed to get the cheapest international price.<p>This won&#x27;t help everybody. It has the same flaw as price-matching at Best Buy. The manufacturer could sell a different model in each country. For example, the USA gets one set of pill sizes (20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg) and the rest of the world gets a different set of sizes (25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg).<p>To combat that obvious maneuver, the orders make it easier to import drugs. Americans had been getting in trouble for importing drugs, even if the same ones are sold here. This made it easy to have different prices in different countries. It was like DVD region enforcement. The orders change that, making it really hard for manufacturers to keep the USA price high.<p>The type of insulin you get for &quot;$300 per vial&quot; might only be available in the USA, or it might actually cost that much (and seldom be prescribed) outside the USA. You might also be facing the issue of retail prices lagging behind wholesale prices. Check other retail locations.')
