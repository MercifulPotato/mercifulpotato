The sense of &quot;wait, you can do that?&quot; For me, it has often been the case that b I&#x27;ve encountered new concepts that I&#x27;ve never clearly thought about in my own head before, but that once I hear stated openly, are as clear as day.<p>For the longest time, I had not encountered a concept of &quot;self-care&quot; but then I started seeing that term pop up around the internet and it seemed quite obvious that it was an important thing. That might seem silly, but if your timeline for these things reaches back to the &#x27;90s, like mine does, a notion like self-care is relatively recent on the historical timeline as a familiar concept.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen this in writing, with how you handle plot and character development. Or even some things that are silly but obvious like the fact that you can just go out and go on hikes if you want, and there are tons and tons of places to do that.<p>I feel like there&#x27;s all kinds of hidden mental blocks that you can go your whole life not knowing that you have, and I appreciate this idea of elevating the concept to its own genre and targeting it with articles such as the one posted here.')
