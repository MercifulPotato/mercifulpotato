In a lab they&#x27;ve constructed enzymes [1] that are able to do some replication with as few as 160-190 bases of RNA, but they aren&#x27;t self-replicating, they spew out some subset of themselves.<p>RNA is just half of DNA with each base in a particular sequence being one of four possible nucleotides (A, C, G and U).  In the smallest case above, you have 160 nucleotides giving the entire string of RNA a molar mass of ~ ~50kDa [2] (approximately 50kg per mole of that RNA string).  There are ~4^160 combinations of just this extremely short and as far as we know insufficient string of RNA to build even the simplest self-replicator.  4^160 is approximately 2e96 combinations.  If you wanted to try every one of those combinations, you would be assembling (2e96 &#x2F; 6e23) approximately 3e72 moles of RNA.  To do it in one shot you would need more mass than in the observable universe (closer to a billion universes).  To do it with just the mass of the earth (forget surface&#x2F;hydrocarbons&#x2F;biomass) in four billion years you&#x27;d have to recycle at relativistic speeds.<p>Obviously it happened, and the above &#x27;needle in a haystack&#x27; assessment has many problems as well.  But the numbers are so big that no matter how you slice it I can see a scenario where it plausibly only happened once in the history of the universe.  Either that or the stochastic parts of the explanation of abiogenesis are incomplete.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1126&#x2F;science.1200752" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1126&#x2F;science.1200752</a><p>2 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu&#x2F;files&#x2F;Nucleic%20Acids_Sizes_and_Molecular_Weights_2pgs.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu&#x2F;files&#x2F;Nucleic%20Acids_Siz...</a>')
