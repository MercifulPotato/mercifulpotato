The remaining users wouldn&#x27;t pay for year two, because to many others would have left the platform.<p>No, I&#x27;m extremely critical of many aspects of Facebook (and implicitly Whatsapp as an FB property, especially now) but to say they provide so little value based on how few people would possibly pay these amounts uses flawed assumptions. If people didn&#x27;t pay it wouldn&#x27;t be because they don&#x27;t gain at least 1 or 2 dollars in value (many people almost certainly do, I certainly do with my own use), it would be because the model of offering high value for free in exchange for massive amounts of saleable user data is so lucrative that alternatives with free versions would quickly take over market share. In absolute terms, the use value of FB or Whatsapp to a user is often much more than 1 dollar per month, but compared to the ease of switching to someone who in the existing market again offers the same for free, it could quickly descend to less than 1 dollar.')
