What appears to be their own hand rolled gossip protocol (that is clearly terrible compared to raft or paxos, a thread per cluster member? Everyone talking to everyone? An hour to reach consensus?) and the front end servers being stateful period breaks a lot of good design choices.<p>The problem with growing as fast as Amazon has is that their talent bar couldn’t keep up. I can’t imagine this design being okay 10 years ago when I was there.')
