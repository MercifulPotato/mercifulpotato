Nobody is advising people buying lottery tickets that they should borrow money to buy as many of them as possible because they will make a nice easy profit at the expense of the rich. It&#x27;s often said lotteries are a tax on people that don&#x27;t understand probability, but at least people playing don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re doing arbitrage.<p>And governments often do restrict other forms of gambling associated with more problematic losses. There are those who would like them more restrictions on it, and those who would like fewer, but at least the latter group don&#x27;t argue that without loosening gambling laws, the little guy doesn&#x27;t stand a chance of wealth improvement.')
