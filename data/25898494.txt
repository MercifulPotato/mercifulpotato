I picked it up for its reputation for being the Python of the Scheme world, but I think the analogy doesn&#x27;t hold up and you&#x27;re better off accepting Racket on its own terms.  Racket doesn&#x27;t have the standard library of Python, nor does it have the syntax, nor would you structure a program in the same way.  Indeed, I think the idea of bringing a more Python-like syntax to Racket would only delay the realization that Racket is not Python with an inferior standard library, but a totally different animal.<p>I&#x27;m excited about Chez for the performance gains, and I think it&#x27;s really nifty that it allows more of Racket to be written in Scheme.')
