If you&#x27;re looking for utopia, you won&#x27;t find it anywhere, but this is nowhere near the hell you claim it to be. I would advise you experience what racism really is like when it&#x27;s the entire nation and government like in the Middle East or even countries like Japan. Maybe that perspective would help.<p>Stop trying argue with strawmen. No one is saying that America is more racist than the middle east. It is in fact possible to be less racist than Saudi Arabia and still have racist elements.<p>The context of this discussion is about comparative racism between different segments of the American population. It has nothing to do with America&#x27;s international position on the racism scale.')
