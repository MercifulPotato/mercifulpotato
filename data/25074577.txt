I can open stupidly large files and not worry, or mash page down and have no lag. It&#x27;s a pretty much invisible part of my daily workflow and any time I have tried another editor the speed is the first difference I notice and find immediately frustrating. Every other editor I have tried, even including Emacs (sorry), has at least a slight, but perceptible, difference in speed.<p>Yes I probably shouldn&#x27;t open massive log files and hold page down, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I can.')
