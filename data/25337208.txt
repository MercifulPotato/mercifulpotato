First offering a job to someone out of state. Maybe they save some money and the next hire, they look Ã  little further and they pick up an employee from another English speaking country, they save even more salary. The more these tests work out the more companies will expirement. Eventually hiring an American will seem unnecessary and costly if you&#x27;re distributed anyways.<p>It&#x27;s great news for non-Americans though, USD goes a long way in a lot of the world.')
