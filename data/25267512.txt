Wacom tablet is awesome and really close to what it feels like drawing on a paper. And yes when drawing, you are looking at the monitor and don&#x27;t really feel the need to look down. On my 13&quot; 2016 MBP, there was no noticeable delay. The biggest drawback for me was that it is not as portable setup. You need a computer for it to work.<p>I switched to iPad and Procreate app because it was just easier to do random drawings while watching TV or in a coffee shop etc. But drawing on iPad doesn&#x27;t feel like drawing on paper. I even got a screen protector that is supposed to add paper like feel but it is still not as good as Wacom tablet.')
