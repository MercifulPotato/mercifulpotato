It&#x27;s not that people who got a 2015 flu aren&#x27;t still immune to the 2015 flu, it&#x27;s that wild flu virii look different in specific ways that cause them to slip by. As such, I think these drug companies don&#x27;t really have much to release for each vaccine.<p>(That isn&#x27;t to say the immune system can&#x27;t forget immunity - TDAP boosters are for evolution, but for refreshing the immune system - but that super short term immunity like flu, AIUI, is about the virus not the vaccine.)')
