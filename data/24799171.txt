There are different types of fraud and not all are covered the same.<p>I don&#x27;t know US legislation, but what you should know, legislation or not, Visa and Mastercard offer chargeback program (don&#x27;t mistake with cashback) where you can notify your bank when the transaction was not authorized by you or when you have authorized but not received the service or the goods or services did not agree with the what you agreed with the merchant (ie. when you got blue shirt when ordered green one). This is <i>NO QUESTIONS ASKED</i>, ie. now it is up to the Merchant to prove that they are in the right and if they can&#x27;t prove it, you are credited with the amount automatically.<p>Now, this happens when the transaction happened <i>through</i> Visa&#x2F;Mastercard network.<p>When you are using the card at ATM this is fundamentally different thing. The ATM is most likely operated by your own bank or through an agreement with some other entity that is not Visa&#x2F;Mastercard.<p>You can think of this, that the card functions as an identifier that can be used to run transactions using completely different systems.')
