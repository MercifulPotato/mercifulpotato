Two BILLION users, in ~100 countries (each with its own standards on what is acceptable, legal, repulsive, etc.).  If you had one moderator per 100 users, that would 20 million moderators.  I don&#x27;t think they could hire 20 million high quality moderators (there&#x27;s only one dang, and we&#x27;re not giving him up), and certainly not with 18.5 billion.')
