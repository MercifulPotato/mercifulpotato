Capitalism&#x27;s whole ethos is based on rule of law — especially property law — and competition; anti-competitive monopolies with near-infinite money that can commit intellectual property theft without meaningful penalty aren&#x27;t capitalist. I don&#x27;t know what they are. Broken, certainly.')
