In my opinion, this just means that Chrome, Firefox &amp; co. just don&#x27;t support ES6. They don&#x27;t support it but with a small foot note, they just don&#x27;t support it. Period.<p>I just wish we&#x27;d live in a world where people were willing to write code using TCE and just say &quot;wontfix&quot; when users of non-compliant browsers complain that &quot;the code crashes&quot;, but alas, in 2021 browsers can just choose to not fix non-compliances and blame the website instead. This is just fucked up.')
