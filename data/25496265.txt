If the company doubles in value and I have the same amount of money, then what&#x27;s the point of getting options instead of USD?<p>This like saying, &quot;don&#x27;t worry, your lotto ticket won&#x27;t be devalued: We&#x27;ll make sure that even if those numbers win the jackpot, you&#x27;ll still get the same $2 and it won&#x27;t be diluted below that.&quot;')
