Because this is a story that has absolutely been vetted, but the issue is all of the left-leaning mainstream media (read: literally everyone except <i>parts</i> of Fox News) have absolutely refused to cover this story.<p>Do you really believe if the same story were about a member of the Trump family, that NPR would refuse to cover it?<p>One more point on credibility - we literally have videos, images, text messages, e-mails of which the other recipients have been confirmed - this is all basically undeniable at this point. So the only question is, is the actual story of how the material was obtained (the laptop repair shop) true, or was the material hacked and then they basically used parallel construction to hide the true origins? That&#x27;s a fine question to ask, but if you think that the material itself is false that&#x27;s just completely incredible.')
