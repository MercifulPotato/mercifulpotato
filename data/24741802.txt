Any consumer good is transported by internal combustion engine from the factory, to some intermediate places, to the door. <i>Maybe</i> someone uses a bike for the last part, but mostly, they drive to the store in their private automobile.  Amazon uses package delivery services, which is much more efficient, and warehouses have a smaller environmental footprint than stores, which are all backed by warehouses anyway.<p>It&#x27;s either a small amount of additional cardboard and plastic, or a whole additional building and a few miles of driving a single automobile. It&#x27;s pretty clear that Amazon wins this comparison.')
