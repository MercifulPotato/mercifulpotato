Item(by='alasdair_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609800800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25637047, text='The original system for the Electoral College (where some electors from a state could vote differently than others) made sense. So did having the vice president be the runner up (before the 14th Amendment) - this is why the VP getting the ability to break ties in the senate made more sense too.<p>The current EC implementation is terrible however. Small states already get massive overrepresentation in the Senate, they don&#x27;t need a second system to weigh in their favor.<p>I very much want to see one person, one vote, with approval voting (i.e. pick ALL the people you&#x27;re happy to see being president, the winner gets the job) being used for presidential elections.')
