If you&#x27;re willing to move to a lower cost of living area, you can get a pretty nice home and land for about $200k, let&#x27;s say $250k. That leaves $750k to live off of after that (or you&#x27;re paying a mortgage and keeping the full amount). If you can keep your expenses under $50k, that&#x27;s 15 years ignoring earnings on the money.')
