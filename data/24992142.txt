Hog is actually an inefficient food production method because they need to be fed more corn&#x2F;soy etc than the food they produce.<p>If your goal was to make food more accessible to the poor then one way to go would be to stop this inefficient food production method and just consume the corn&#x2F;soy protein directly. That would be healthier also. Consuming corn&#x2F;soy directly would drive down the price of food because we would need less of it.')
