It gives me an extremely uneasy, disgusting, feeling.  On the other hand, I acknowledge that the composition is quite masterful.  Thus, it is a work of art that does not leave you indifferent, and you remember it for a long time after having seen it.  I guess that makes it a very good, unforgettable cover for a music album.')
