I&#x27;ve lived din large cities in Europe almost my entire life and that experience was &quot;normal&quot; then moved to the US suburbs where almost nothing happens. But a few years later when I visited New York and stayed for 3 nights, oh man, it was such a weird energy. It felt like I needed to be out every second, it felt that if I spent an hour sleeping in my hotel it&#x27;s an hour wasted somehow. The fact that at any point in the day or night there were people filling the sidewalks made me want to be out there with them. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but there was an energy driving me to do more.')
