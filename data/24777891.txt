Item(by='zimmund', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602690213, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24775885, text='Last.fm allows you to track your whole listening history (and you can export it or play with their API). I agree it could be interesting to infer something valuable from what a person likes (musically), but I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s much to read between the lines other than &quot;if user likes artist X probably will like artist Y&quot;. You may infer my location (from local artists listened), and from that paired with timestamps you could tell some of my habits (work, school, commuting). Personal taste can hint an age group and gender as well, but it wouldn&#x27;t be precise at all. Perhaps mood? I don&#x27;t see much value on that info, compared to what you can gather from navigation history, messages or other services.')
