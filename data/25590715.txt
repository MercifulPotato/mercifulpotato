It allows you to compile your Arduino sketch to WebAssembly and run it in a browser, all using the Arduino IDE.<p>The Arduino IDE usually requires a physical board, which can be cumbersome. For example in a classroom setting: holding up an Arduino board showing the entire class a LED blinking is not very doable. This is where Wasmino can be used.\nWasmino can also be used as a stop-gap during the first few classes, giving students time to purchase an actual Arduino board.\nOther solutions exist such as 123D Circuits. Wasmino is different as it is integrated with the Arduino IDE, providing a seamless experience - using Wasmino is just like using an actual Arduino board. Migrating to a physical board is also as simple as selecting another board in the Arduino IDE. I believe this is valuable in a classroom setting. Wasmino is also open-source, while most alternative solutions are not.<p>Needless to say, this project is in a very early stage - feedbacks welcome. Also if you can think of other use cases, let me know!')
