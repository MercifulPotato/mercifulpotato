Not sure about the other &quot;gaming&quot; voice chat software as I haven&#x27;t really used it, but I&#x27;ve found Mumble&#x27;s latency at least to be miles ahead of the videoconferencing software I&#x27;ve had to use for work.<p>Makes me wish I could have work meetings there, honestly.<p>An old POTS landline would be nice too, but my understanding is a lot of landlines now are basically VoIP anyway.')
