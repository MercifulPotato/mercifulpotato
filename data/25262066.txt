Item(by='dahart', descendants=None, kids=[25262571], score=None, time=1606794316, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25261376, text='They’re both overloaded terms, but with today’s common usage, path tracing is built on top of ray tracing, so path tracing in a sense is ray tracing (but not the other way around). So while it’s true that they’re not exactly the same, if that’s what you meant, your sentence as written can be easily misinterpreted.<p>Is there a reason to make this distinction here? The site &amp; book are doing ray tracing, so the title is accurate. It mentions path tracing once at the very beginning, because the end goal is a path tracer. I think the goal is achieved, so in this case the book is both ray tracing and path tracing.')
