Item(by='bravura', descendants=None, kids=[25853301], score=None, time=1611180314, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25851932, text='I&#x27;m a firm believer in this, having lived through &quot;NYC <i>used</i> to be so cool&quot; or &quot;Burning Man <i>used</i> to be so cool.&quot; If you focus on the essential 10%, you learn what that thing really is about.<p>NOW. Here&#x27;s where it gets personal and interesting.<p>I went with a friend to a shitty diner and ordered eggs benedict. I love eggs benedict. And he was like: &quot;Why did you do that?&quot; &quot;I love eggs benedict!&quot; &quot;I love eggs benedict too, but I don&#x27;t like lame eggs benedict.&quot;<p>That struck me as so inconceivable.<p>Then I remembered a friend who would constantly order shitty burgers by delivery. And I gave them such grief: &quot;burgers are only meant to be enjoyed when they are amazing, why order a mediocre burger??&quot;<p>In retrospect, I realized that there are certain things that you will like even if they aren&#x27;t great, once you appreciate them. And certain things you will only like if they are done the excellence. I like any egg benedict, even if it&#x27;s lame. I am a snob when it comes to burgers. Switch this for your world-view.<p>The important point is that you must learn to <i>appreciate</i> something, before you sort it into &quot;I enjoy it&quot; vs. &quot;not good enough&quot;. You can&#x27;t simply dismiss an entire genre based upon some theoretical a priori motive. But after you have tasted it, and I mean truly tasted it, you can decide whether you can be an elitist about it.')
