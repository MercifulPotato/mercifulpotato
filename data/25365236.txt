A $35,000 car will typically earn the manufacture $3-7k in direct profits, the financing arm gets ~$1800, the dealership gets ~$600 (plus profits from extended warranties, service, etc).  There&#x27;s still a ton of money to be made in automobile manufacturing.<p>And that&#x27;s for an average car (actually, below average, the median new car price is nearly $40k).  Vehicles like Porsches or an F-150s have insanely high margins.  Porsche has the highest margins in the industry (50% for the 911) by a comfortable amount and Ford reports the percentage of F-150s sold for over $50k in their annual reports, and have for years, because it&#x27;s the most critical aspect of their bottom line.<p>Tech companies benefit from having really dispersed revenue streams: they make a few dollars off of billions of people while car companies make thousands of dollars off of a few million people.')
