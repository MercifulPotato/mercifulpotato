Item(by='agloeregrets', descendants=None, kids=[25904180], score=None, time=1611587318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903511, text='This isn&#x27;t about the money.<p>France is doing the same thing and Google is fine with it.<p>It&#x27;s about the detail that Google is required to share all algorithm changes with news co&#x27;s four weeks in advance of them. This massively ties their hands and would require the AU news to effectively use an entirely different stack of logic and rules to display news articles...which are worth basically nothing to google because they have to pay handsomely for it.\n Also very little of the money goes to smaller orgs and there are incredibly nonsensical rules around what content qualifies you for payment.<p>Oh and be aware of a dark detail here: The reporting on this is biased in nature because it directly aligns with the ability for increased money for the reporter reporting. This is why they are ignoring the reason why Google is actually leaving. Kinda like the McDonalds hot coffee thing, it&#x27;s a whitewash over the truth. (Not that google is the good guy either, part of their game here is based on scaring other governments to not do this.)')
