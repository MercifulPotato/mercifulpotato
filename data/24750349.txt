Women get people finding their addresses and visiting their houses, their online accounts enumerated, their profiles stalked etc. It wasn&#x27;t that long ago that there was a Reddit bot which searched posters&#x27; submissions for GoneWild posts, which was invoked whenever a commenter revealed themselves as a woman. I&#x27;m sorry people were rude to you, but the degree and kind of abuse women face online is so disproportionate that these examples (particularly in a thread full of similar) only serve to diminish and distract from that fact.')
