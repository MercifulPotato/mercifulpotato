Item(by='heptathorp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609797629, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25638403, text='&gt; This report of someone spending 800k already might well even be part of the scam, the same way any con artist on the street will have stooges pretending to throw in cash in order to convince others that it&#x27;s legit.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what it is. This sale was to their &quot;partner&quot; company Polyient Games, and they&#x27;re putting 10 more up for auction next week. This sale was to anchor the price.')
