Included among the instructions for the year of jubilee was the requirement that all debts be forgiven and all land revert to it&#x27;s ancestral owners. Basically the financial system gets reset every 49 years.<p>It seems to me that there are great things that can be done when a business has the right resources but at a certain point business stop competing and start regulating or burying their competition out of existance. Now of course we can&#x27;t due it exactly how the bible outlines things but I&#x27;ve been increasingly interested in the idea of a regular societal reset on a half a century or so basis. This creates enough time for large firms to grow innovation to happen and wealth creation to happen. Whilst at the same time it prevents eternal dominance by a handful or large players .<p>What would y&#x27;all think of a societal reset?')
