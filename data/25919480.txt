Agree this isn&#x27;t likely to happen in my lifetime.<p>Right up there with, mostly hated, Javascript, I happen to think there are good parts of the semantic web technologies and that the pivot towards industry adoption of the graph data models related to knowledge graphs, ontologies, and SPARQL shows there are benefits outside of academic paper mills.\nI don&#x27;t have a dog in this fight (TerminusDB), but applying some reasonable expectations and accepting the limitations of the semantic web tools has been very successful on many projects. Even more so, innovation and improvements in graph data repositories are making triple-stores and graph-based models compelling for some use cases. Not going back to CSV hell if there are better alternatives.')
