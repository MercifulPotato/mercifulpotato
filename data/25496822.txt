There&#x27;s very little true choice, participants are typically under duress when seeking expensive services, and prices are hidden.<p>If there was ala-carte transparent pricing and no insurer lockouts things may be a bit better.<p>My suspicion is that Private Equity has been funneled in healthcare for two decades intentionally distorting the market behaviors for increased profitability which is why the US has such excessive healthcare costs without any apparent justification.')
