You could print stuff, but only so many people could read. So even if someone wrote something in a pamphlet, you wanted to find your buddy who could read to explain it to you, with the added benefit of lively discussion.

You can&#x27;t have a credible intellectual discussion about anything without having heard of a certain set of old guys anymore.
