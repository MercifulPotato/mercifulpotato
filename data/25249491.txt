Just that it&#x27;s a powerful and thus dangerous tool, and that you should ideally find a doctor you trust and then maintain contact with them, probably by visiting them regularly, now that I think about it, and maybe occasionally giving them a nice gift. :)<p>I advise the exact opposite, to visit doctors as little as possible, unless you experience pain which does not go away after a day or two.<p>In my experience, doctors will find something to do with you, and it will rarely work out to your advantage, unless it is emergency medicine.<p>My personal experiences: One doctor told me I need to get circumcised because I had minor irritation on my glans due to a scratch, which I told them about.<p>Another doctor <i>insisted</i>, without even looking at my X-rays, IIRC, that the cast on my broken hand was not sufficient, and that I needed him to take the cast off and perform surgery, or I would not be able to use my hand properly again.<p>If I had listened to these doctors instead of thinking for myself, I&#x27;d be without my precious foreskin and undergone unnecessary surgery, which would&#x27;ve delayed my getting better.')
