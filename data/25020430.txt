Ignoring it stops real progress.<p>Also, feynman&#x27;s Nobel was about blending cosmological concepts into quantum theories.  If he didn&#x27;t obsess over that stuff we&#x27;d be without a lot of tools we used for nuclear engineering, and I&#x27;d argue distributed computing considering how inspired by feynman&#x27;s work Lamport is.')
