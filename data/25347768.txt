Item(by='wait_a_minute', descendants=None, kids=[25347820], score=None, time=1607446130, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344762, text='I paid some $350 for the latest and great Sony wireless headphones earlier in the year, that I returned a week later. Why? Because they were not polished. For example, pairing to both my laptop and my phone at the same time was a nightmare. I could not listen to music on my laptop and instantly receive phone audio if someone called me. I also could not listen to music on my laptop, then close the laptop and resume music on my phone with instant playback.<p>I also found the Sony privacy policy on the headphones to be lackluster. If the Apple headphones are more privacy conscious and also make this experience across devices as seamless as they&#x27;re promising, I&#x27;ll pay for them.')
