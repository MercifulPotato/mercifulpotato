If we were to be compelled by a court or similar to give over information, all we would ever able to hand over would be uncoupled search queries, referral data, and requested pages. We log, on aggregate, where traffic comes from at a country level, but we do not and never have logged or stored individual IP addresses. Any information about browsers used is uncoupled from search queries.<p>Does being in the UK subject you to surveillance under the Snooper’s Charter?<p>The Snooper&#x27;s Charter (or Draft Communications Data Bill) was only a bill, it was never implemented. The similar ‘Investigatory Powers Act’ was passed, but that applies to Communication Service Providers, not us. As a non-tracking search engine which respects privacy, we don&#x27;t store any IP addresses or other information that would be useful to the UK Government if they were looking to identify individuals and if we were compelled in court to hand it over. This all being said, we encourage all Mojeek users to use a wide variety of anti-surveillance and pro-privacy tools when browsing the Web.<p>Can you be a private option whilst being resident in a Five Eyes member country?<p>The Five Eyes is an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As Mojeek does not store IP addresses, there would be very little useful information to hand over to the Five Eyes nations were they to compel us to give them data or to allow them to access to Mojeek’s backend.')
