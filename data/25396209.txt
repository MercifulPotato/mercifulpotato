I took the compilers class at CMU, and I loved it.  I went on to take a follow-up class implementing a compiler with higher-order types.  Meanwhile, most of my classmates avoided compilers altogether.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in the industry since undergrad, and I&#x27;ve implemented several interpreters for DSLs.  Sometimes I was asked to make it, but other times I had the flexibility to dream up a DSL on my own, and it ended up becoming indispensable to users.  I&#x27;ve always loved building them, but to this day, parsing is still the most boring part to me.<p>I recently went through Bob Nystrom&#x27;s Crafting Interpreters, and it was great fun.  I implemented an interpreter in Rust.  Material about compiling for GPUs would be interesting.  But for me, personally, I really wish there were something updated for how IDEs use languages nowadays, in particular, walking through a good way to implement the language server protocol.<p>The calculator language that every compiler book starts with should be LSP-first.<p>A MOOC would be great, but I&#x27;d also be happy with a series of blog posts.<p>Does anyone know of good material bridging the gap between traditional compiler architecture and the LSP?')
