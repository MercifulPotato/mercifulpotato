He&#x27;s my best and most sycophantic friend. If I&#x27;m going anywhere he might be allowed, he&#x27;s with me.<p>I&#x27;d be damned if I put him in a crate at the bottom of an airplane for 10-hours straight.<p>When I worked jobs as a janitor, and as a retail worker, I have at various times had clean up the shit, piss vomit, and any number of other bodily expulsions produced by &#x27;emotional support&#x27; animals, invariably left untouched and without comment by their owners, or argued with people whose pets growl and bark at everyone if they aren&#x27;t muzzled. I can&#x27;t imagine being a flight attendant trying to manage that  with a potentially belligerent owner for 10 hours on a plane.<p>No matter how well-behaved your animal is next time, if you aren&#x27;t traveling over the ocean, please just drive, so you aren&#x27;t putting the burden of your pet&#x27;s presence of everyone else.')
