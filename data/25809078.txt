Back then, people basically biked: transit didn&#x27;t exist and cars were very rare.<p>In modern times, rich societies are structured different than 100 years ago: people travel long distances for work and for non day-to-day shopping (to buy a lamp or a wedding dress, for instance) and for social&#x2F;personal things (sports, church, etc.). These changes are of course affected by policy, but for the most part they aren&#x27;t unwanted.<p>Today, almost a third of trips in Amsterdam are by transit, more than by car. Transit trips are mostly a success from the strikers&#x27; goals, and just didn&#x27;t exist back in the 20s.')
