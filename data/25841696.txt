They are intermidate representations like LLVM is. (Approximately).\nThey were designed to be compilation targets.\nJulia wasn&#x27;t.<p>Most of Julia&#x27;s intersting compiler features are unusual because they need to solve problems Julia has in general other languages wouldn&#x27;t,or that would not transfer across language boundaries.<p>The macro stuff is awesome for DSLs.\nMessing with compiler passed is cool for adding capacities.\nBut I think much more in the sense of implementing a micro language that is closely related to Julia, rather than a full on language that has its own goals and identity\n(I want to write one for codegolf called Jules that is just Julia except on an error it tries some other lexically nearby code)')
