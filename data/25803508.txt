Denying that, and trying to find &quot;alternative facts&quot; belong to the domain of psychiatry no less than calls to drink Chlorox.<p>Seeing no acknowledgement that 74 millions of US citizens decided to vote to say FU to the American establishment is a sign that bigger problems for US are yet to come.<p>While the version of events leading to the civil war given in popular history books try no wrap it all around the slavery, it&#x27;s an incredible shallow explanation omitting complete economic domination of northern states, and bigger picture of social dynamics of the time. Saying that the south went to war &quot;just to keep their slaves&quot; is terribly incomplete picture.')
