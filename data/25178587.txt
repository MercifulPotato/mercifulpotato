The relevant market isn&#x27;t &quot;America&quot; but rather that audience on Twitter. Can you reach some of the same people via Facebook? Perhaps. But not all of them. And my suspicion is that the number you can&#x27;t is still quite a lot larger than the number of people who lived in that company town.')
