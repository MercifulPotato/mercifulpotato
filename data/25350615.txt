You can answer the question &quot;Are people with dark personality traits more likely to succeed?&quot; in the negative even if &quot;successful people with dark personality traits learn to cover up their dark traits&quot;.<p>Sure, in some sense the ultimate &quot;dark&quot; person has more options and is strictly better off (or at least not worse off) for that reason. But concomitant with being dark may be a range of other attributes which lead to unhappiness, discontentment, or lack of success.')
