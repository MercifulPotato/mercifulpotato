What I mean is that Trump is so hated that reversing his policies score political wins, regardless of the actual policy—much like how Obama was treated by the radical right. Trump has taken a harder line than previous presidents on China, although to be sure he has done a shit job of it if he actually wanted to stress the CCP. Any liberal politician can expect sweet lobbying on behalf of China-friendly interests, and score political points by reversing Trump’s China policies. Win-win for anyone that doesn’t actually care about the freedoms of the Chinese people.<p>Similar things can be said about other Trump policies that are actually good, like the NASA Artemis project and Space Force. Expect them to get severely defunded under a Biden administration, even though they are actually good bipartisan policies prior to Trump.<p>I’m NOT a trump supporter. But I evaluate his and any other politician’s policies on a case by case basis. I hope that Biden does the same, but I’m not naïve enough to expect it.')
