(A similar, though not identical question, was ultimately posed to Clinton at the town hall).<p>&gt; In the newest email, sent one day before the March 6 Democratic primary debate in Flint, Michigan, Brazile tells senior campaign staff that “One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash. Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.”<p>&gt; The next night, a woman named Lee-Anne Walters asked both candidates a very similar question.')
