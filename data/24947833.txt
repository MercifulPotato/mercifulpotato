This is important for two reasons.<p>1. The kind of supply and demand works very well for modeling commodities, but the difference in networks means it&#x27;s very hard to have two completely equivalent insurance products.<p>2. Insurance companies can incentivize hospitals to behave in certain ways by regularly pruning those who do not behave that way.<p>Also, most people get their healthcare from their employer.
