Having a GUI way of doing this will make walking them through it easy.<p>That said, this environment doesn&#x27;t deal with flaky connections well.  A few toggles of my wifi, and now I have multiple bash orphans on my ECS container.  I shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised, looks like they&#x27;ve repurposed the SSH client from Cloud 9.  It&#x27;d be nice if they brought in something like a Mosh client.')
