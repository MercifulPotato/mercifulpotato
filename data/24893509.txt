A laptop just becomes far tooooo noisy compiling Rust code. These days I use 3 machines:<p>* A fanless Chromebook with decent screen for travel use<p>* An Intel NUC that is hooked to a big monitor, which is also the device I&#x27;m typing this on<p>* A beefy Ryzen desktop that sits in the corner of my balcony, which I usually connect via ssh and perform all the heavy tasks<p>To me I&#x27;m getting all the benefits of each computer, and the combined cost is still less than a so-called macbook pro :)')
