People have learned that usually the #1 comment is a negative one, so you have a bunch of people &quot;competing&quot; to be #1 by trying to nitpick whatever is wrong with the original article (even if there is none) in hope to win the popularity contest.<p>This is why I&#x27;ve seen some friends recently leave HN (their exact words: &quot;couldn&#x27;t hand the toxicity&quot;). I hope that you, as a Head of Growth, can actively work to break this cycle.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;TrueOffMyChest&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jw8xbe&#x2F;if_were_going_to_lock_down_again_we_need_to_stop&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;TrueOffMyChest&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jw8xbe&#x2F;if_w...</a>')
