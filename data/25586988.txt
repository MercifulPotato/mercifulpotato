That&#x27;s quite strongly circumstantial but it&#x27;s not evidence. Possible chimerization and furin-cleavage insertion seem a lot more interesting imo but are weighted much lower.<p>Based on their report [1], most of the likelihood of lab-escape (almost 50x weight)  just stems from the fact that the outbreak is in Wuhan. They state that it&#x27;s because of the proximity to Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and the lab&#x27;s gain-of-function research - only one of 5 locations world-wide.<p>That single &quot;bullet-point&quot; re-weights zoonotic origin from 97% to 56% and lab-escape from 1.4% to 42%. Otherwise their final likelihoods would be: &quot;zoonotic&quot; 85.5%, &quot;lab-escape&quot; 8.5%, &quot;bioweapon&quot; 6%.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rootclaim.com&#x2F;analysis&#x2F;what-is-the-source-of-covid-19-sars-cov-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rootclaim.com&#x2F;analysis&#x2F;what-is-the-source-of-cov...</a>')
