I hope it helped others too.<p>I&#x27;m happy with my contribution involving keeping my own severely mentally-ill relatives off the streets. If our family hadn&#x27;t gotten lucky with some county programs, a couple of people close to me would now be living on the street due to no fault of their own. They&#x27;re sick, and it&#x27;s a full-time job split between various family members to keep them above water.<p>Thanks for your input. I apologize if I come across as overly argumentative. I&#x27;m just bored and interested in the subject. If we were in person, I&#x27;d buy you a beer.')
