People complain about the hamfistedness of Go&#x27;s simplicity.  The downstream effects of it include, for example the wat that you handle JSON in Go.<p>But there are a lot of quite frankly crazy choices, like making (milliseconds) an integer type that is incompatible with numbers.  This means to multiply an time with a non-constant integer, you have to cast an integer to millisecond type first, then multiply.  Which breaks the brain of a scientist like me and makes me want to throw my computer out the window.<p>My daily driver is Elixir, and it&#x27;s not impossible to jump into totally foreign code and debug it.  In fact, just the other day I did an interview where the 20 minute technical problem was drilling down from the frontend into the backend of a new-to-me system and finding the logic bug in a database query that was causing the wrong data to be surfaced.')
