But that&#x27;s not something most people will be willing to do daily, away from home, unless it&#x27;s super convenient.<p>&gt;Solving the day-to-day charging problem .... comes down to availability of charging.<p>This might work in idealized theory, but not in practice. From a market-systems perspective, it&#x27;ll be the opposite, because range is the more flexible, independent variable. More required charges means more constraints, which requires a much more complex (and therefore inefficient) system to solve.<p>And this is even more applicable when factoring in grid supply&#x2F;demand&#x2F;capacity.<p>Separately: the market isn&#x27;t always rational. If people say they want the range to drive to Indianapolis, believe them, no matter how irrational that demand is to you. Especially if meeting that requirement (range) also satisfies their others (daily charging).')
