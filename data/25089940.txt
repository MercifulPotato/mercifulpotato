I started it as a side project to have a local-first, org-mode outliner web app to use on my phone. I chose Clojure&#x2F;Clojurescript because I&#x27;m more familiar with both compared to Javascript&#x2F;Typescript. Several things I like a lot about Clojure&#x2F;Clojurescript:\nData-Oriented Programming, all three (logseq, roam, athens) use Datascript, which is an in-memory database and Datalog query engine.\nREPL (as other lisp languages)\nClojure is very stable, I can run all my old projects without any issues.\nAlso, I don&#x27;t reverse engineering the Roam code(it&#x27;ll cost more time for us), Logseq is hugely inspired by Roam Research, Org Mode, TiddlyWiki, Workflow.<p>- Datascript: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tonsky&#x2F;datascript" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tonsky&#x2F;datascript</a>')
