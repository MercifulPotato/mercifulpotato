I recently put whatsapp on it (with a burner phone number) because my parents refuse to use anything else and would attempt to reach me via nearby people who happen to have whatsapp. I will likely remove it again rather when it forces me to &quot;consent&quot; to data sharing. I am extremely uncomfortable with whatsapp, much more so than wechat even.')
