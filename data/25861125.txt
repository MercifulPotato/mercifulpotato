I have used several generations of Teensy for projects. I&#x27;m a big fan! They&#x27;re powerful, well thought out, and inexpensive. Paul Stoffregen (creator of the Teensy products), is amazingly responsive to users.\nThe only downsides (for some) is that you have to know C to program them. You can use the Arduino libraries if you want, which provides you with a lot of functionality with very little effort.\nIf you have a specific project you&#x27;ll be manufacturing, you won&#x27;t want to use something like this. You&#x27;ll want to design your own board that only has what you need. But for prototypes, small run, or one-off projects, it&#x27;s hard to beat the power of a Teensy 4.')
