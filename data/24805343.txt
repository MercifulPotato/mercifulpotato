In terms of the note-related data contained within a MIDI file, it&#x27;s just a series of noteOn and noteOff event pairs, with a note number between 0 and 127 for each event. There&#x27;s nothing in a MIDI file that specifies the key&#x2F;scale&#x2F;mode.<p>They can describe time signatures and tempo.<p>And yes, they don&#x27;t handle enharmonics because in MIDI, notes are known only by number, not by any name given to them by any part of any given musical culture or theory.<p>And because of the MIDI Tuning Standard, you cannot actually say a priori which notes (i.e frequency) a given note number corresponds to, although in practice most things will take the note number and map it to a a 12TET 440Hz standard.')
