Revenue in itself is just as meaningless as profitability, I agree. (That&#x27;s what aggregates like NPV [net present value] and other indicators are for.)<p>RedHat is big, it has a lot of revenue, but it also has a looot of expenses too. Hence it&#x27;s profitability is low. Whereas Amazon is a lot more profitable (even if it had no accounting profit), and that&#x27;s exactly how it grew this big.<p>If RH were this profitable it would have probably also grown bigger too.<p>Of course some business models, sectors are truly niches, and you can&#x27;t grow arbitrarily big. RH probably suffered from this to a degree. Selling Linux support is a niche market compared to selling almost everything that can be shipped in boxes. Of course both Amazon and RH are survivors of the early 2000s big boom-bust cycle, so probably there&#x27;s a big survival bias and chance&#x2F;luck at play here, so it&#x27;s probably not right to say that RH should have expanded to bigger markets. (How come &quot;AWS&quot; is not a RH thing? It&#x27;s likely that Amazon&#x27;s extreme &quot;black friday&quot; scaling challenge it not unique to them, yet they were the ones able to successfully capitalize on this.)')
