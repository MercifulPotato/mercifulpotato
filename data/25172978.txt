So, moving and listing files is faster, presumably due to a new metadata system you&#x27;ve built for tracking files. The trade off here, is that writes must be strictly slower now than they were previously because you&#x27;ve added a network hop. All read and write data now flows through these workers. Which adds a point of failure, if you steam too much data through these workers, you could potentially OOM them. Reads are potentially faster, but that also depends on the hit rate of the block cache. Would be nice to see a more transparent post listing the pros and cons, rather than what reads as a technical advertisement.')
