I think the world you are wishing for existed - it&#x27;s probably the hunter&#x2F;gatherer model; any more sophisticated organization of civilization requires some level of socialization. I think your &quot;darwinistic&quot; approach is a flawed philosophy upon which it build a nation or a global superpower.<p>It&#x27;s interesting because the article posits, and makes a very good case for, <i>systemic</i> issues that has caused the erosion of manufacturing base - however politically we are unable to move beyond simply understood talking points such as &quot;minimum wage&quot;.')
