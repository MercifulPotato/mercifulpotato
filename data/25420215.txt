I wanted to add to my skill set and learn a new language (react&#x2F;node) as I have been a PHP developer for roughly 10 years now. The more time I spent at Lambda things started to become apparent that the instructors are very ill prepared to teach other students. For example, whenever a problem was met that they could not solve they would just skip it and move on to the next problem...How is this supposed to help students learn to solve problems. That is just the tip of the iceberg. Once we got to the CS portion they force you to use Python and explain very little about it. When I was going through the CS course after 4 months they added the GCA (general coding assessment proctored by a third party) with a 2 day notice. &quot;Take the test for the first time by x day and you will have a chance to take it again in 2 weeks, if you do not achieve a 650 or higher (which is what the one instructor that attempted to take the GCA scored) you will be flexed back to CS again. I gave notice to Lambda that proctored test would hinder me as I have sever social anxiety and even need a service dog to go out in public. (proctored is recording your screen&#x2F;sound&#x2F;webcam) Lambda made 0 attempt to accommodate my medical issues. So I went ahead and took it anyways. While nearly passing out due to anxiety I ended up scoring a 606 (not bad right) but failed. I was then put in a hospital days before the second attempt of the GCA was allowed with a life threating bacterial infection. I contacted my TL (team lead) and asked if I need to do anything. I scored in the 90s for the CS assessment and I knew I still needed to take the GCA again but he said everything for now is okay. I was released from the hospital on that Friday, the GCA was apparently due on that Thursday. I contacted Student Success and nothing...Was flexed into CS again which is no NO ASSIGNMENTS, NO GRADING, NO TEAM LEADS, NO CODING TO PUT ON GITHUB, it was reduced to taking tests on code signal and that&#x27;s it. I finally got ahold of someone 4 days into the new CS cohort when I was told &quot;What would taking the GCA accomplish for you&quot;, I was willing to set aside all the changes that made Lambda into a glorified Udemy to continue and finish but I was met with rude incomitance and negativity when I just wanted the same chance as everyone else...Take the test and move on. Since then I have been removed from the Slack for speaking my mind. There is NO RIGHT to free speech within Lambda, if you don&#x27;t follow their ideology you have no voice. Your only choice is to shut up and comply. DO NOT be wronged by this &quot;school&quot;&#x2F;&quot;bootcamp&quot; that is nothing but a glorified Udemy that will force you into free labor in their new &quot;mentorship&quot; program that you will have to help other students for free on your own time, even if you are struggling.<p>Make a better choice and good luck future coders.')
