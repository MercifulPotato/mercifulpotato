When a build dependency is unavailable or broken, you cannot create production artifacts. You&#x27;ll lose money over this because broken builds lead to incidents, longer time-to-recovery during incidents, and slower development. All of these cost money.<p>Your exposure to defects in your build dependencies will depend on a lot of factors, but the exposure will always be there.')
