I was a kid during the 2004 surge and it was incredibly striking. Literally everywhere you looked outside, the ground was covered with dead cicadas, and it was even difficult to just walk outdoors without a cicada flying into you or landing on you. If you haven&#x27;t seen a cicada, imagine an insect about the size of a man&#x27;s thumb, with wings about as long.<p>As a kid it was novel, if gross, With people cooped up inside these days, I feel like it&#x27;ll be less of an issue.')
