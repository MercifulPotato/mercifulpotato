Item(by='kace91', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609639788, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616945, text='1) Fully remote<p>2) no change in distance from usual (I live in the same big city I work in, commute is about an hour).<p>3) it&#x27;s been awesome<p>4) pros: two hours more of life daily (no commute). Being able to stop 5 min totake a shower, switch were I sit, etc. Basically not having to look productive on top of  actually being so.<p>Cons: a bit more difficult to integrate new people on the team at first.<p>5) nothing in particular.<p>6) I absolutely would recommend it. The only caveat is that your experience might vary if you don&#x27;t have an adequate work environment at home due to lack of space, presence of children or similar. Some people who have been using work To fill their need for social interactions can feel a bit isolated, but I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s only uncovering an existing issue and that having a social life outside work should be a priority for everyone (otherwise what would happen if you&#x27;re fired, for example?).')
