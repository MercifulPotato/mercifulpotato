We are still thinking about ways to best demonstrate Filmbox. The best way is to use it, but we will try to come up with a way to show this.<p>This particular comparison raises some interesting philosophical questions, which is why we haven&#x27;t gotten to it yet. The comparison could be pretty misleading if done wrong.<p>Filmbox is designed to produce an accurate film look from scene-referred footage. But digital image data really <i>has no look</i> in any meaningful way.<p>We could, for example, show the video in a log color space as itâ€™s encoded, but that&#x27;s an arbitrary encoding that is not even intended for display. We could apply some &quot;video&quot; LUT or simulate how someone might &quot;typically&quot; color grade the footage, but that&#x27;s a creative choice - and one that can still be performed in addition to the Filmbox emulation pipeline.<p>The right way to think about it is perhaps that video can be prepared to look like anything, But modern motion picture film has a fairly defined look. Filmbox is designed to provide ways of processing video that are closest to processed film. So we feel the meatiest comparison is Filmbox to actual film.')
