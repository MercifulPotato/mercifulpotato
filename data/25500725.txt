Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=[25500772], score=None, time=1608591585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500151, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t mean to offend, but this level of magic behavior sounds terrifying to me. React&#x27;s original slogan was &quot;it&#x27;s just JavaScript&quot;. That made it easier to understand without special knowledge, easier to pair with whichever libraries you wanted to use, and easier to apply tooling to without special integration. But it seems to be getting further and further away from that goal with each passing year, turning into an opinionated, all-in-one framework like Angular.<p>I don’t know if <i>this</i> is that kind of magic (I certainly feel like hooks are, though they still don’t make React feel as much like a framework as Angular). When I saw Promise references in JSX, it looked a little confusing at first, but I thought about how it would probably be trivial to write a createElement wrapper that does the same thing on the client, just wrapping in a Suspense or similar until all of the promises resolve. I’m sure it’s more complicated than that, but it does still seem like “it’s just JavaScript”. Promises are widely used in JS already, after all.')
