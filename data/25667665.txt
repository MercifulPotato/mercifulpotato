They want to show 50% quarter-over-quarter active-user growth, and when that caps out, they need to squeeze the user bases for ever more interaction and engagement.  Quality is not on the radar.  So they&#x27;re incentivized first to load the site with bots, desperate virality and recruitment efforts, and low-quality content, and later more and more obnoxious algorithms and dark-pattern design.<p>A topic-driven forum tends to have different motivations.  The definition of success is to be a compelling community and content for a specific, and typically finite, audience. You&#x27;re not going to growth-hack Hacker News or Deskthority in quite the same toxic way as Facebook does.<p>A small, but tighter-knit community often can be self-funded via subscriptions or donations, and if you go ad supported, there&#x27;s a potential for a high-quality non-programmatic-nightmare ad experience, based on direct relations with advertisers directly relevant to the site theme and audience.<p>There&#x27;s also granularity and control created by it not being a single all-purpose systen.  Each new community is an opt-in choice rather than an algorithmic imposition, and you can punt the toxic ones without having to delete them all.')
