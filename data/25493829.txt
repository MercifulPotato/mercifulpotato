(But I guess so is the transition to mostly social learning?)<p>EDIT : Hmm, and since autism is &quot;anti-social&quot; (and also probably generally anti-survival and anti-reproduction), may it be that it was only once that large, stable, strong social groups were put in place starting with 300-200 kya, that the conditions for &quot;autistic specializations&quot; could emerge starting with 100-45 kya, and this is what in turn turbocharged inventions leading to the &quot;creativity explosion&quot; ? The autism article would make a lot of sense under this light !<p>Anyway, perhaps we can&#x27;t cleanly separate nature and nurture, see also recent discoveries somewhat rehabilitating Lamarckian inheritance.<p>Also, my author in a parallel article says :<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;loukeep.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;vagaries" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;loukeep.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;vagaries</a><p>&gt; The first modern human bones are in Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, 300 kya. H. rhodiensis - the African variant of heidelbergensis - disappears at around this same time. There are just-about-simultaneously collections found in the Rift Valley, Kenya, that <i>point to incredibly “modern” behavior</i>[1], including pigment production and obsidian distant enough to suggest trade networks. Once, I think, it could be maintained that some kind of “great leap forward” in human behavior took place some 60,000 years ago or so. I don’t particularly understand how one can keep that up now.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;360&#x2F;6384&#x2F;90" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;360&#x2F;6384&#x2F;90</a>')
