Applications should be single files or directories that can be moved or copied anywhere you want. Numerous OSs had applications work this way by convention and it is also how AppImage works.<p>I do like this. The only thing that concerns me is disk space (which isn&#x27;t really that big a deal at this point) and things like crypto libraries.
