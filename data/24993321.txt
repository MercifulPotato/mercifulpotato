Edison research or the AP.<p>Those two firms put in a lot of effort in collecting the latest data from the various state&#x2F;county&#x2F;city websites. All of which report there data differently, and is why everyone seems to have a slightly different total. Iâ€™m not sure if AP or Edison provide a free api nor not, but without using them as an aggregator collecting all that data independently is pretty much impossible.')
