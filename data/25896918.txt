You’re assuming every hack is a targeted one. And that simply isn’t the case.<p>Whenever a new vulnerability is discovered for WP (or any popular suite, be it a shop like Magento or message board like phpBB) you then get hordes of bots that trawl the internet looking for sites that run out of date versions of said software just for the purpose of hacking it. Even search engines become tools for bots to hunt out these insecure platforms.<p>I’m not someone who advocates security through obscurity however the vast majority of WP et al hacks are not targeted and thus a home grown CMS technically wouldn’t fall foul in the same way.<p>HOWEVER please don’t twist my words into saying that home grown CMSs are “more” secure. I’m making no such claim what-so-ever (and nor did I in my previous post when you want off on a soliloquy about how I apparently suggested that — I did no such thing!). My statement is and was only that any popular CMS will be a security nightmare. That point is very much true.<p>This is why I also brought up the point about WAF and additional policies on your admin path. The former buys you a little more time with updates (assuming you’re with a reputable WAF that supports the CMS platform you’re hiding against) because they can identify suspicious requests (ie ones that look like they’re triggering a known vulnerability) and simply block those requests from your site (technically the WAF is a reverse proxy with some firewalling, request heuristics, etc).<p>As for the point about admin policies: if you can IP whitelist who gets access to &#x2F;admin then that saves you a lot of pain early on. But that’s obviously not always practical. However there are plenty of other ways to harden access.<p>Disclaimer: in a former life I used to repair and harden hacked CMSs, shops like Magento, etc.')
