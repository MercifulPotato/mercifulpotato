Item(by='axiolite', descendants=None, kids=[24877511, 24877215], score=None, time=1603509655, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24875447, text='Downloading a Youtube video with youtube-dl IS NOT violating copyright in the USA.<p>Downloading videos may violate Youtube&#x27;s TOS, but that&#x27;s civil&#x2F;contract law and not criminal and so the DMCA can&#x27;t be used to enforce such TOS violations.<p>A person might <i>share</i> a video they don&#x27;t own the copyright to, after downloading it from youtube with youtube-dl, but youtube-dl has no functionality in it to do such illegal sharing.  It only has the time-shift functionality.<p>The only tenuous leg the RIAA has to stand on is claiming that allowing only streaming of content constitutes some form of digital rights management code, and by reverse engineering it, without imposing the same restrictions as Youtube&#x27;s website and apps, do, maybe that&#x27;s some form of circumvention which will be found not entirely legal.<p>They had to cite a German legal ruling which found YouTube’s “rolling cipher” was an anti-circumvention device.  But German court rulings have no bearing on US law, and Germany doesn&#x27;t have a DMCA statute, so it is a specious claim, and the RIAA is just hoping an open source project won&#x27;t be able to fund a legal defense.<p>It&#x27;s Betamax time-shifting plus macrovision&#x2F;video stabilizers all over again.')
