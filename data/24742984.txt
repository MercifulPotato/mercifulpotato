They have advantages in live reproduction, yet you still see tubes mic&#x27;d up in the studio.<p>And for a small band even if you have a FoH mix, it&#x27;s going to sound better out of a 40W combo than through whatever PA your vocalist dragged along. But that&#x27;s just my opinion.<p>Digital models do a good job in a vacuum (no pun intended). They do a very poor job of modeling how a guitar and FX chain load and drive the preamp of an real tube amplifier (which is really difficult to capture in either white or black box models). That&#x27;s also a key to getting lush and evocative ranges of tone from a single configuration.<p>Just speaking as a player, I don&#x27;t really fiddle with my tube amps all that much. The tone changes come from dynamics of my hands and controls over my pickup volume controls, and it&#x27;s accentuated by my drive and boost pedals. That kind of play doesn&#x27;t translate well to modeling amps which don&#x27;t have the low headroom, lower impedance inputs of a pure tube stage. I don&#x27;t need 300 different amp models, I need 1 amp model for 300 tones.')
