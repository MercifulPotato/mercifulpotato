It is not in its standard configuration. And it does not mention that hypervisor bugs allowing to escape from a VM are typically due to wrong logic, not memory safety.  Using memory-safe language does not protect from those. And that in turn is the reflection of complexity of hypervisor interfaces in modern CPU. And with VM one gets much greater exposure to hardware bugs as VM has access to more instructions.')
