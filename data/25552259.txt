I&#x27;ve opened &quot;thank you&quot; issues before, and wondered &quot;how much will this annoy the owner&#x2F;watchers?&quot; For anyone tasked with maintaining a repo, any email notification of new issues must come with a certain level of dread. At least that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s like for me, even if I sincerely appreciate and enjoy receiving issues!<p>I do, then, immediately close &quot;thank you&quot; issues so owners are not tasked with responding in any way, but still... And for any watcher, I imagine they are interested in notifications relevant to actual issues, not thank yous.<p>My opinion is the current best way to say thank you is probably a star. Beyond that, it would be nice if GitHub added a way to leave a thank you or testimonial or something like that. Or even a formal &quot;the repo is in use by such and such app&#x2F;company.&quot;')
