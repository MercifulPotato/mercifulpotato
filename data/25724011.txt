Very cheap to deploy and extremely dangerous.  The thing that stops this is human decency.  And yes, that safeguard does fail sometimes.  But fortunately, either situation isn&#x27;t permanent -- as soon as a cop (or any city employee or private citizen) drives by and sees it (especially the fake traffic light) they can call it in and have it removed in short order.')
