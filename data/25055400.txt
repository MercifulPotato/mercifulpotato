On election day, this year, he claimed victory before all the votes were counted. If you support that, you don&#x27;t support democracy. Nothing else compares.<p>Every time a right wing tries to say the &quot;media&quot; is unfair I  ask for a single example and they always fail. 100% of the time. All just a bunch of whiners IMO.<p>But sure, please take pride in your support of Trump, who peddled the racist conspiracy theory that Obama isn&#x27;t a citizen. Good for you champ.')
