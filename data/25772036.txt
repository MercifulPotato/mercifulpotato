Some are from the 90s. What do you mean 2-3 years?<p>&gt; I think they&#x27;re referring to each line as a new fab, rather than the complex of buildings they&#x27;re in, which is pretty fair.<p>Even so, wouldn&#x27;t the 2-3 year number only apply to CPUs?  Couldn&#x27;t they keep the lines running making things that don&#x27;t require top of the line processes, like USB controllers, etc.')
