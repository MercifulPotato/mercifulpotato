There is a STAGGERING amount of evidence.<p>There&#x27;s video of a large crowd of the rioters chanting &quot;hang Mike Pence!&quot; They erected a gallows with a noose outside the Capitol. There&#x27;s video of people yelling that they came to get Pence and Pelosi. Squads of milita wore tactical armor and helmets, and carried not just assault rifles and handguns, but also flexcuffs. You don&#x27;t get that stuff in the spur of the moment. They came prepared. Other rioters were carrying lead pipes and wooden rods. There was even one rioter caught on video carrying a literal pitchfork.<p>They beat one police officer to death with a fire extinguisher and injured more than 50 others. That is clearly a mob out for blood.<p>As for more evidence, for months in advance, Trump supporters filled Parler, Gab, Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, Facebook, and many other social media outlets with detailed detailed discussions of plans to commit violence and in many cases murder at this event. NYPD and the FBI received a ton of reports from concerned citizens who saw this social media chatter. The insurrectionists talked about what weapons to bring, which politicians to target in order of priority, and so much more. It was reported that they had maps with them of the tunnels under the Capitol building so that they could cut off escape routes.<p>Freshman lawmaker Lauren Boebert tweeted Speaker Pelosi&#x27;s whereabouts multiple times during the riot. She did not tweet anything which indicated any degree of surprise that the riot was occurring.<p>Jim Clyburn has two offices in the Capitol, one right next to the front doors and one way up on the third floor. It was reported that the rioters ignored Clyburn&#x27;s obvious office next to the doors and instead made a beeline for the more secluded office on the third floor.')
