Item(by='lumost', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605126497, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25060636, text='“Smarter” is a really vague term.  At least in CS&#x2F;Software  it’s incredibly common for people to sound much more knowledgeable than they are, or for promising junior engineers to get stuck in a hole.  Given the selection bias inherent to graduate school pathways* in the US, I wouldn’t presuppose any innate skill gap between Fresh Phds and baccalaureates.<p>* A top BSc candidate with a comp eco background would need to forgo ~800k in compensation  for a 4 year PhD. While in grad school, they must be able to survive on ~20k per year in direct income. Fresh from a BS they may have 100k in student debt, or have been fortunate to have wealthy family or studied internationally where the cost of education is lower.  People willing and able to go for grad school do not represent an unbiased sample of the top students.')
