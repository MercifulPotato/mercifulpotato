I&#x27;m not making any claim here.  Even in countries like the US, relative deaths from Coronavirus are small in comparison to overall deaths (ex. In US - an extremely hard hit country - between 3&#x2F;1 and 8&#x2F;1, 1.34M deaths occurred, only about 150K attributed to covid19).<p>My point was that one can&#x27;t draw any CV conclusion from the Sweden death graph in the month of September 2020.<p>As to the strategy and effectiveness, that is subjective - they had a higher mortality rate than their Nordic neighbors but not a catastrophic level, I guess.')
