Item(by='klmadfejno', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605616964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121213, text='The title says &quot;Banned&quot; which implies you are not allowed to read the book. What it actually means is &quot;Banned from curriculum&quot;, meaning teachers shouldn&#x27;t use it in the classroom. The latter seems far less controversial to me. You can still read the book. You just can&#x27;t be required to read it.<p>I don&#x27;t care about the racist &quot;incident&quot; they&#x27;re flaming up with some dumb kid. If educational leaders think To Kill a Mockingbird is a poor, white dominant perspective that does not realistically portray black perspectives, then by all means, let&#x27;s stop teaching it, and teach a more relevant book instead.<p>I liked that book. I read it in school and found it enjoyable and an interesting intro to racial issues beyond &quot;Slavery is bad&quot;. But it definitely makes things all about white people. There&#x27;s likely some much better source material out there for that conversation.<p>Saying you&#x27;re banning a book is a lot dumber than changing your required curriculum.')
