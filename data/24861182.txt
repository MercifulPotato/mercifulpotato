Does Target benefit more from some random hedge fund buying up $20 million of their shares?  Or from consumers buying $20 million in goods from them?  Once a company has gone public, unless they&#x27;re trying to do another round of funding, the share price is almost meaningless beyond the ghost of being taken over by another entity.<p>This belief that institutional investors mean more to the health of a business than ACTUAL SALES is baffling to me (not saying that&#x27;s your stance).')
