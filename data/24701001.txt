I noticed the majority of survey questions simply aren&#x27;t realistic. The questions are geared towards brand management metrics and not the actual product&#x2F;experience I&#x27;m trying to leave feedback on.<p>There&#x27;s no reason for me to give a 10&#x2F;10 recommendation to my friends and family about my local pizza hut. I don&#x27;t think about brand-trust in terms of a 5 point likert scale. I don&#x27;t expect the teenager making my chicken sandwich to go above and beyond my expectations for a $9 value meal. But I know if I leave her a 3&#x2F;5 that&#x27;ll be considered an unsatisfactory score.<p>I really wish these surveys were more casual and qualitative. It&#x27;s fine to just be satisfied and not have everything quantized on a scale detached from expectations.')
