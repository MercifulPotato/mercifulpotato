Silver Beach Pizza in St. Joseph, Wheatberry in Buchanan, Infusco Coffee Roasters in Bridgman (for coffee), and Bit of Swiss Bakery in Stevensville were the highlights for us.<p>Several good places just over the border in Michigan City or South Bend, though.<p>I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;re listing an Applebee&#x27;s. At least along Lake Michigan, there aren&#x27;t too many places that are mainstream chains, restaurants or stores. Can&#x27;t even find a Walgreens or CVS most places.')
