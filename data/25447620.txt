I&#x27;ve read it referred to as the madonna-whore complex, which is quite accurate. It&#x27;s hard to explain unless you&#x27;ve been on the side of faculty hiring, but it&#x27;s very much about looking like the next super-Einstein-Nobel Winner in a room full of people who will never attain anywhere near that much fame (but who think they have), in a scientific process that is really about incremental contributions anyway.</i><p>What a brilliant way to describe it. But I must add that industry has the same problems. I work in big tech and we have people who are brought into leadership coming from a hot startup because they are perceived to be John Galt figures, and they turn out to be unqualified status seekers.')
