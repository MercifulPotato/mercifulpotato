I would like my grandma to be able to issue a call for me.<p>&gt; and the participants then need to agree on some server&#x2F;software combo that provides the actual video conferencing.<p>Since the button is in a very convenient place, I would expect the integration to be a bit deeper than &quot;hope the client understands the invite&quot;; it&#x27;s tricky to make the clients without a spec.<p>It would have been nicer if this were documented better&#x2F;more obviously, so we know what to expect if we want video calls to work across different UIs.')
