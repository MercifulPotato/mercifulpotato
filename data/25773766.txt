Item(by='iuguy', descendants=None, kids=[25810572, 25776275], score=None, time=1610613577, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25773310, text='I regularly use the Web most days on an Amiga 4000, built in 1992. It&#x27;s not perfect for everything, but I can use things like search engines, visit web sites over HTTPS etc. I mostly visit Amiga-specific sites that tend to have lower overheads. I&#x27;ve also visited sites like like Twitter, Facebook, CNN etc. in the past.<p>It should be possible to use older machines to browse the web but it stops being about the machine and starts being more about availability of TLS libraries and rendering engines. In theory an Amiga 1000 (1985) should be able to connect to the Internet and may be able to run AmiSSL and IBrowse with the right upgrades. It might need custom hardware though. I think there&#x27;s some jiggery pokery that&#x27;ll allow older Macs dating back to 85 or maybe 84 (I&#x27;d be surprised to see an original 128kb Mac but the late 84 512kb model should work) to browse the web without modern TLS.')
