The lack of sideloading on iOS doesn&#x27;t just protect users from malware: it protects repressive governments from criticism and protects corrupt organizations with political power from reporting and attempts at organization or reform.<p>Furthermore, it&#x27;s reprehensible for Apple to tout their commitment to human rights, but also appoint themselves the decider that you&#x27;re not permitted to choose to see nudity in the apps on a device that you purchased.  Only assholes decide for other competent adults what they&#x27;re not allowed to watch, see, or read.<p>Inserting rent-seekers hellbent on surveillance into every single little purchase we engage in on a daily basis is the worst thing that&#x27;s happened to our society in a very long time.')
