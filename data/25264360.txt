I would disagree with how categorical that quoted statement was but not the general point.<p>Of course laptops with cellular exist but they are hard to find and it is anything but typical that you can just add that to some laptop you want to buy. You have to search them out.<p>Contrast that with the Apple Watch or iPads. Every Apple Watch except the lowest end model and every single iPad Apple sells offers the option to order it with cellular. For these kinds of devices it’s just obvious that this is possible. It’s a foundational, central feature, not just some add-on you can get with some models.<p>So, yeah. That is actually a difference that matters. PC makers have been much better at moving their PCs into this direction than Apple with their Macs, but they still suck at this (with it being relegated to a niche feature).')
