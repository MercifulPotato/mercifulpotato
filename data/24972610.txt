The point of citing the Time article was to show that they continue to have <i>imported</i> cases on a regular basis (fact), and that they prevent these from spreading by strict border controls (fact), not to provide commentary on the quality of their overall response.<p>Taiwan is a tiny island, with relatively little international travel (compared to the US, China, etc). If they have no cases internally, and they seal the borders before those cases are introduced, then almost nothing else matters. Small, isolated, island countries can do this -- but even then (i.e. New Zealand) one mistake will mean rapid endemic spread. So sure, as long as Taiwan continues to effectively isolate itself from the outside world, they can probably carry on. But they&#x27;re not going to: they&#x27;re already talking about re-establishing travel with the rest of Asia.<p>It&#x27;s virtually impossible for a country like the US to do the same thing Taiwan did. Even if we <i>could</i> seal the borders like Taiwan, our population is about <i>13 times</i> larger, we have large land borders with other countries, and a proportionally large number of expatriate residents with right-of-return. Even with our bans on international travelers, the US has had 6.6 million foreign arrivals in 2020 [1]. Effectively 25% of the <i>entire population of Taiwan</i> has arrived in the US in 2020. And that&#x27;s just non-citizens.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trade.gov&#x2F;visitor-arrivals-program-i-94-data" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trade.gov&#x2F;visitor-arrivals-program-i-94-data</a>')
