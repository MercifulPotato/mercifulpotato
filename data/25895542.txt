Gospel, jazz, blues, and rap are not descended from any Anglo-Saxon musical tradition, nor are our dances, or many of our foods.\n</i><p>I looked up the origin of Gospel on <i>Wikipedia</i>; it seems to stem from Gaelic sources and the first composers thereof were white.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gospel_music#History" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gospel_music#History</a><p>As for Jazz: “<i>Jazz originated in the late-19th to early-20th century as interpretations of American and European classical music entwined with African and slave folk songs and the influences of West African culture.[32] Its composition and style have changed many times throughout the years with each performer&#x27;s personal interpretation and improvisation, which is also one of the greatest appeals of the genre.</i>”<p>Perhaps there are some West-African elements to it, but I find the music to sound very European in terms of structure, also using mostly European instruments.<p>Jazz at the end of the day is played with the piano, the European drum kit characterized by the cymbal, the guitar, the cello, and the tuba. — whatever West-African elements it has seem to be played up, again for racial reasons.')
