My guess is that will change now.<p>The situation reminds me of research into serotonin&#x27;s role in depression. Like mRNA in its field, ideas about serotonin and a little bit of research were bouncing around for a few decades. The drug that was ultimately branded Prozac was developed in the early 70&#x27;s, but not brought to market until the mid 80&#x27;s. Then, it&#x27;s ground breaking efficacy compared to prior drugs &amp; for people not helped by those other drugs acted as a catalyst for research that now forms the foundation for modern treatment of mood disorders-- certainly far from perfect, but also far better than 30-40 years ago.<p>For example, Prozac&#x27;s minor role as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor sparked significant research into that neurotransmitter as well, leading to yet another generation of new drugs, SNRI&#x27;s like Cymbalta that which are not only a useful for depression &amp; anxiety, but also for the treatment of certain forms of chronic pain &amp; as an aid for quitting smoking.<p>It&#x27;s too early to tell for sure, but I see the potential for the moment in history to be a similarly catalyzing event for mRNA research &amp; subsequent treatments.<p>(Unless of course the vaccine produces a zombie apocalypse, the relatively small trials by chance not having anyone impacted by that potential &quot;side effect&quot; of zombie-ism, in which case I&#x27;ll feel pretty silly sitting here a few months from now having to eat my words. And brains, lots of brains.)')
