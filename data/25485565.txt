StackOverflow needs overhaul<p>Yet it&#x27;s hard for me to find a single decent question that hasn&#x27;t been answered any time I&#x27;m on StackOverflow looking to procrastinate by something work-adjacent.<p>It&#x27;s clearly working and it&#x27;s been working for years. In fact, it&#x27;s even harder to get karma now. I don&#x27;t know how I got to answer so many questions back when I used it 6 or so years ago because now any of those questions I answered would&#x27;ve been answered in minutes like they are now.')
