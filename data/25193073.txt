How do I retrieve certificates on my servers?  Do I have to use the Certera API for that?<p>What I&#x27;d like to have is an ACME compatible endpoint so I can change the ACME endpoint in my Traefik config to `<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acme.certera.example.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acme.certera.example.com</a>` and not have to make any other significant changes.<p>Basically I&#x27;d like to have an ACME proxy with a dashboard like Certera.')
