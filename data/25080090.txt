But I have two problems with it.<p>First, it seems to assume that the call-home server will always be available, which seems a bad assumption from an engineering standpoint. Even the mighty and holy Apple can suffer outages, for a myriad of possible reasons. Be it a fat-fingering of some parameter during an approved maintenance window, the criticality of of which was heretofore unappreciated, a cascade of on-their-own-innocuous failures transforming into a deadlocked hard-down situation, or the fact that the North-American Fiber-Seeking Backhoe is not and never will be an endangered species, the result is ultimately the same: the mother-may-I server is not available.<p>The second reason, giving Apple further capability of evil shenanigans is already well covered by other comments here.')
