We should have noticed at least a few instances by now, given that we have been trying explicitly to produce it.<p>So at the very least, we can say that the conditions for the apparition of life and the conditions for the proliferation of life seem to be quite different.<p>Also, given the amount of isolated biomes on earth, if abiogenesis had ever been a common occurrence, i think we should expect for there to still exist some survivors of those other events.')
