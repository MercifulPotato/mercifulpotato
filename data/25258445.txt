I do know a lot of smart people I respect made this decision, so it is more complicated than simply saying &quot;screw the millennial.&quot;<p>However: There is now a mess that is damaging our society.  When there is a fire going on, one does not stand around pointing fingers trying to figure out who started the fire. We put the fire out and figure the rest out afterwards. Millenial student debt is stifling their ability to build wealth, participate in the economy, and damaging their quality of life to the point they choose not to have children.
