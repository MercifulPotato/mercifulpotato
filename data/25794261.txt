You have to look at intent here to see whether the suppression will lead to a slippery slope. In this case, it&#x27;s not about suppressing speech it&#x27;s about removing people who act in bad faith.<p>On this forum we often suppress the speech of people we disagree with. And people get banned too. If we subscribe to the author&#x27;s point of view, then why do we have moderation or shadowbanning in the first place?')
