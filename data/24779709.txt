That&#x27;s still the virtual model.<p>I don&#x27;t quite remember my intro to electrical components, though it&#x27;s a quick read for the basics. The GP obviously knows about atom models and band gap.<p>The paradox bit is that, as far as I can tell pressure is roughly equivalent to heat, and heat equals decreased intrinsic conductivity. But if I imagine that high preasure restricts the absolute motion of particles, that would equal decreased resistance (like an idealized fixed suspension for your swing, that doesn&#x27;t take energy out of the system).<p>Since Hydrogen is involved, I suppose there&#x27;s a channel of Hydrogen rumps without any electrons, and the high preassure is needed to keep the hydrogen from moving apart and recombining outside the ensemble. Surely this involves some form of entanglement? Which I imagine as a kind of clockwork, all cores spinning in unison.<p>Haha, I have no idea what I&#x27;m talking about.')
