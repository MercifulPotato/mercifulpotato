That and many others. The electronic cash bitcoin not the currency bitcoin. The owners of the project will be able to construct an electronic company, and any value that a user gives, will be shared to the shareholders, in line of the shares any shareholder has to the project, i.e. how much he has contributed. A user wants a new feature or a fix of a bug? He gives coins to the open source company, and they will implement it. This will give incentive for programmers to increase the quality of the code, better documentation etc.')
