However, you get to live in it and that&#x27;s priceless. And like you said, it acts as a savings account over time and that generally works out as people will eventually downgrade after their kids have left.<p>Another nice thing about owning a home is you can improve it (additions, adding bathrooms, etc) and certain additions more or less pay for themselves in terms of &quot;getting your money back&quot; over enough time. Again, probably not going to outperform the market, but you get to live in it. So even if the market tanks for a few years, I still get the benefits of whatever I&#x27;ve invested in my home.<p>The trick is to not overspend on a home. Too many people use all their savings to make a downpayment and then use too much of their income to pay for it. This can not only get you in trouble but also puts you at a serious disadvantage in terms of accumulating wealth.')
