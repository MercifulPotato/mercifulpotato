Say you want to predict the weather on Tuesday, conditioned on the event that it rained on Sunday? Run a lot of simulations, and only keep the ones where it rained on Sunday.<p>Similarly: If you want to compute an expectation value? Run a lot of simulations and take the average.<p>If the event is unlikely? Say you want to condition on the fact that it rained on Sunday, and the high temperature was precisely 15 degrees C? Then you have a difficult problem on your hands.<p>(Sometimes the expectation value of the quantity you care about will depend a lot on a few rare events with outcomes many standard deviations away from the mean. Then you also have a difficult problem on your hands.)<p>Sometimes MCMC will work on this kind of problem, and sometimes it won&#x27;t. Even if it doesn&#x27;t, maybe other techniques will work.<p>To apply MCMC to a dynamical system, one method is write down all of the history of the system as a single object, say a single vector. You write down what your system is doing at t=1, at t=2, etc, and all that information goes into the vector. The rules governing the system determine a probability distribution over the vector space that the vector lives in. (Or more generally, the object in the object space. The vector axioms aren&#x27;t important here, it&#x27;s just a nice familiar example.)<p>Generally speaking, if you know how to describe your dynamical system, you know how to compute an non-normalized probability for any given vector. Usually you won&#x27;t be able to compute a normalized probability for that vector. That&#x27;s fine, since MCMC works with non-normalized probabilities.<p>The next step is simply to run MCMC. If you want to condition on some fact, cut out all the parts of the space where that fact doesn&#x27;t hold, and then run MCMC. If you want to compute an expectation value, there are other tweaks to MCMC that are possible (i.e. importance sampling).')
