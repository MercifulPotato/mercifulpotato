But it&#x27;s still a silly distinction. It&#x27;s utterly bizarre to me that something that a device that allows everything to be modified from the CPU is considered non-free if any of that code is non-free, but if that same non-free code is used on a chip that&#x27;s only flashable using a more difficult method, the device can be considered freedom respecting.')
