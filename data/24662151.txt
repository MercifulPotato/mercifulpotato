I dunno if I will ever afford that. Making friends? How? When? I am not in a foreign country yet I have two friends at most, and one of them moved to another country and I see him once every 5 years.<p>So it is not like people have a choice after they went to college, I still feel that going to college was the biggest mistake I ever did on my life, I should never have went, and never took that debt, it is paid now, but I am working with Marketing, instead of working with programming, and have little room for error, no debt, but no surplus either, if something goes wrong with the business I am screwed.')
