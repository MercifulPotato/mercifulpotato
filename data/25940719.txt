Item(by='jcun4128', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611834601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25940669, text='$100? hmm this price may not be that bad though, considering the display seems to be the most expensive aspect and I&#x27;m not finding a similar price&#x2F;size on Amazon.<p>One thing I want to learn&#x2F;address personally is a charging circuit so I&#x27;d rather build it myself. Still it is nice to know this is out there ready to go.<p>Also I have to use these ESP01&#x27;s I bought haha. The code itself I imagine wouldn&#x27;t be difficult eg. an http get request firing at whatever interval to your own local&#x2F;remote endpoint. Would have to see about the ESP driver part to display to eInk.')
