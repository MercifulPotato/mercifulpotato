Dollar cost averaging made simple. Before the various discount trading houses went zero-commission, this was impossible to do cost effectively, since you&#x27;d lose more in commissions than you&#x27;d gain from dollar-cost-averaging + diversification benefit.<p>Now with zero commissions, it is still hard to do because the process is manual. As an example, suppose you want to purchase $1000&#x2F;wk of {NVDA 23%, MSFT 27%, GOOG 10%, TSLA 40%}. It should be easy to do. It was with ShareBuilder. You buy less of the stock as it goes up, more as it goes down -- the ultimate buy low &quot;sell&quot; high.<p>M1 Finance is the only product I found which does the Dollar Cost Averaging well with your choice of stocks. There are other products (e.g., Betterment, but then they stick you with stock portfolios -- better in theory, ahem)')
