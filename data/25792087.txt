So if GCC was AGPL  and I made a web page where  you could upload source code and then download the binary, that would count as &quot;distributing&quot; GCC and thus I would have to make the changes I made available (because privately made change to GPL code do not have to be shared if the binaries aren&#x27;t shared).')
