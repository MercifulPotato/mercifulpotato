Item(by='Bqhatevwr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605563688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25115669, text='&gt; Seems the newest version determined that my quad core Xeon processors didn&#x27;t support SSE 4.2 or later. A LOT of people were fuming online that in order to run the latest version, they would have to get a new PC or laptop with a new processor that was now required for the newest version.<p>I was with you until I looked up when SSE 4.2 was introduced.<p>SSE 4.2 was introduced in the Nehalem architecture...<i></i>twelve<i></i> years ago for desktop processors, ten for xeons. I really don&#x27;t see anything wrong with Adobe requiring a processor newer than ten years old for software used by and large by creative professionals, people who make money with it.<p>If you&#x27;re a creative professional working off a twelve year old computer, you&#x27;re wasting money just from lost productivity waiting on that system - as well as flushing money down the drain on all the wasted energy running the system, unless you live somewhere electricity is insanely cheap.<p>A new computer would literally pay for itself in reduced power consumption alone, both idle and loaded wattage. A Ryzen 3600 uses less than half the power of a lot of xeon chips, has a single-core performance 50%+ higher than the very fastest second-gen quad core nehalem, and has two more cores.<p>Same goes for a modern GPU - everything is GPU accelerated these days, and you can get a several year old Nvidia card that is so power efficient the fans aren&#x27;t even spinning most of the time.<p>Then there&#x27;s the huge performance boost of NVMe.<p>The list goes on. Dude(tte). Buy a new computer. Or one at least made in the last 5-6 years?')
