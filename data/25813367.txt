You need lots of context: recent works of that university department, credability&#x2F;background of the last author post doc&#x2F;professor, state of the art and cornerstone works in that field.<p>You could probably gain an entry level background (except for highly mathematical or medical things) by spending 5-10 hours a week for a few months reading various papers&#x2F;online discussions. Assuming you have access to those forums. You should know thats the lower bound amount of literature reading full-time students have to do to keep up with their own field.')
