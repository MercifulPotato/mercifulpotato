It&#x27;s pretty obvious that a) it&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s walled garden so they can mostly do what they want, b) the vast majority of iOS apps are games and c) other game platforms are similarly restrictive.<p>On the other hand, Apple probably doesn&#x27;t want to kill Scriptable or Pythonista (and I don&#x27;t want them to either.) One of the nicest features of iOS (and macOS) is that you can use scripting apps and languages to construct workflows that use multiple apps, access the internet, etc.. Scriptable and Pythonista are also useful as personal programming and learning platforms.<p>Good luck I guess.')
