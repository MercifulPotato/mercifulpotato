Nowhere in the post are these terms rigorously defined!<p>And look!  The author accuses Graham of &quot;tantalizing the reader by reducing complex problems down to singular, nebulous concepts&quot; without mentioning principal component analysis!  &quot;Profoundly unserious&quot;, I say.<p>Anyway, pg himself has been clear about rejecting seriousness as a virtue multiple times.
