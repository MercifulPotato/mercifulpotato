Not sure why a lot of people seem to think that this is impossible to resolve through legal system.<p>Trump is leading the riot&#x2F;coup. He should be arrested immediately, no? (In some countries, that&#x27;s a death sentence.)<p>It&#x27;s either (1) Trump isn&#x27;t really leading the riot&#x2F;coup or (2) leading the riot&#x2F;coup isn&#x27;t unlawful.<p>I&#x27;m confused on this contradiction of reality.
