It tells me that your bar and mine are definitely not the same.<p>I&#x27;ll bet you also don&#x27;t think Trump encouraged the rioting the other day because he didn&#x27;t explicitly say &quot;hey everyone, riot now!&quot;<p>Which is of course what makes Trump so effective.  Decades of litigation have taught him the artform if plausible deniability.  Never say what you want.  Imply it and let folks put two and two together<p>Of course, in the case if Parler, there&#x27;s no shortage of folks who lack similar instincts and therefore say the quiet part loud...<p>&gt; I can easily cherry pick comments from Twitter, Facebook, etc that have the same or stronger lang around incitement to violence<p>The difference is the CEO of Parler has ruled out moderating that kind of content, including the examples I&#x27;ve cited here, whereas every other site removes it.<p>So the situation simply isn&#x27;t comparable.<p>&gt;  This level of aggressive enforcement does not seem to be present if the target of the incitement is unpopular<p>Okay, so where are your examples?  I&#x27;d be happy to provide my opinion if you&#x27;d like.')
