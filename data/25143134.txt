Fred is doing great too. Are you a former CHL&#x2F;TXR managed or sub-owned group or facility?<p>Unfortunately I see the opposite trend right now, more silos, more lip service to interoperability, more tolls. I think driven by the burden of regulatory overhead. Moving forward there could be a shift to a &quot;patient owned&quot; record where providers and facilities feed standardized formats into a patient owned&#x2F;managed &quot;personal cloud&quot;. I hope that continues to pick up steam.')
