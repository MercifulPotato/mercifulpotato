I know the intent is good, and I certainly don&#x27;t hold them against anyone, but someone (especially someone I don&#x27;t know well) telling me they&#x27;re sorry for my loss is just meaningless and unhelpful. Close friends calling&#x2F;texting&#x2F;helping out with things is a very different story, but the idea that I have to be subjected to these brief, awkward conversations about how it&#x27;s sad that someone I love has died (believe me I know already) just feels worse than useless. If you knew my grandpa well and you&#x27;re sorry he died, go give some money to the causes he was passionate about instead of reminding me of my grief.')
