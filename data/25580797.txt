Not only nurses and doctors, which I think you already won&#x27;t find in numbers high enough to be useful, indeed in most states they are not even  enough to cover normal hospitals functions in case of spikes, but also for example electricians&#x2F;plumbers&#x2F;gardeners&#x2F;etc only for them, people who have to go shopping for them, etc<p>- isolate the whole family group of ALL these professional above<p>- create a sparse amount of covid hospitals with yet another group of medic professionals just for them so to avoid cross contamination in hospitals which is the main sanitary risk at the moment')
