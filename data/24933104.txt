Item(by='Filligree', descendants=None, kids=[24933173], score=None, time=1603993800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24932676, text='There is a (common) theory which states: Memory isn&#x27;t like a disk drive. When you remember, the brain doesn&#x27;t just read something from disk.<p>Instead, when you remember, the information you&#x27;re remembering is re-summarized and written back, possibly at higher levels of &#x27;compression&#x27;. I put that in scare quotes, but when the brain uses references to other memories to reduce the space taken by any single one, compression is what it is.<p>The theory here, then, is that distraction at (forgive the computer-esque terms) the exact time it&#x27;s being recompressed and written back out, can disrupt that process and cause it to not be stored properly.<p>This checks out. Bringing up a memory, distracting yourself and then just... telling yourself it&#x27;s unimportant... is, indeed, one way to deliberately forget something you&#x27;d rather forget.<p>Used beneficially, you can forget spoilers for a novel. You could even attempt to forget trauma this way, though I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s nearly as likely to work.<p>If you just happen to get distracted for other reasons, though? You might forget something you&#x27;d rather not.')
