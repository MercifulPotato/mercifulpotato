As the article alludes to, when Acts of Parliament clash with semi-constitutional items like international treaties, human rights laws, or ancient traditions, the courts will attempt to construe the law as Parliament not deliberately intending to override the standard. However, if Parliament explicitly states their intention, they can override anything.<p>E.g.\nLord Hoffmann in ex parte Simms [2000] 2 AC 115, at p.131:<p><pre><code>    &quot;Parliamentary sovereignty means that Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. ... The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.&quot;</code></pre>')
