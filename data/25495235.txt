Item(by='p49k', descendants=None, kids=[25495626], score=None, time=1608561136, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25494947, text='Your comment reads like Apple removed the ability of Facebook to monetize apps with advertising (which they didn&#x27;t), and reads as if tracking users&#x27; every movement is the only way to advertise (which it isn&#x27;t).<p>Furthermore, there are plenty of unjust&#x2F;unethical systems in this world that - if dismantled - would cost the jobs of honest, hardworking people. That doesn&#x27;t seem like a valid argument against the question of whether or not tracking people without their consent is itself unethical.<p>Edit: I want to bring up another point: You mention that using FB ads can allow developers to avoid the &quot;Apple Tax.&quot; But not only does the Facebook Audience Network apply its own tax (via revenue share) to app developers, it also refuses to disclose that number! So if you monetize a free app with Facebook, you&#x27;re paying an undisclosed Facebook tax. Given the Google tax for AdSense is 32%, it&#x27;s likely that FB&#x27;s secret tax is higher.')
