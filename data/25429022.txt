The article made it sound like you were always waiting 15ms, but you were actually waiting 0ms when there was more work to do.<p>I still think the blocksize should&#x27;ve been larger for various reasons in this case (it&#x27;s a trade-off still, usually larger block sizes are mildly more CPU-efficient, besides preventing pathological scheduling cases like this one) but this explanation makes more sense.')
