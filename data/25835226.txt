Item(by='DyslexicAtheist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611074418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834843, text='&gt; It seems like what&#x27;s being described<p>yes this was exactly what I wanted to say. the local norms have over time become <i>illegal</i> and many regions still have a combination of both. \nSay ... if a local person was just arriving on the island, without any reference (would be an odd thing to do but for the sake of argument[1]) this person then (hypothetically) gets robbed at the pier, his next stop isn&#x27;t the police who might end up beating him or finding ways to extort him, but they would visit whoever ran the village. They would beg for work, and they&#x27;ll chat about who they might know in common, and find an arrangement (maybe even find the offender and get their stuff back). The police would be the last place they&#x27;d go to not only because they&#x27;re corrupt but because it would potentially make the village elder who is actually in power lose a little face.<p>[1] it&#x27;s risky traveling being both without reference AND poor. especially poor folk would do everything in their power to arrange with people at their destination about their visit. so a job seeker turning up at the police saying they&#x27;ve been robbed would raise a lot of questions. (the person might be a good shoe-in for case they have open since a while and are still looking for a suspect).')
