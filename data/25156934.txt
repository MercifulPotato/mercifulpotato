But would take it one step further. I argued in 2010 that Adobe should have (could have, would have) launched their own hardware platform.   This would have given them &amp; the thousands of loyal Flash devs a more permanent &#x27;final destination&#x27; for their apps &amp; games - despite Apple&#x27;s intentions.<p>Easier said than done, but fun to think about how things could have played out if Flash was given a dedicated hardware platform and follow on generational iterations ie- today maybe we&#x27;d have one more option other than iOS or Android.  In fact, an allegience with Microsoft probably would have been best and saved both companies&#x27; endevours in the dedicated phone&#x2F;tablet space but now I&#x27;m just spitballing.')
