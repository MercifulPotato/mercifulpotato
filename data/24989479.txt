When choices are limited and things are new, there&#x27;s that exciting factor in learning.   But it seems most of us have seen the same thing in different variation, and then drowning in choices which does reduce the motivation factor.   But this is more subjective than objective.   Nothing stopping you from creating your own OS for the pi.   Linus did it in 1990 for x86 with very little resource,  anyone motivated can do so today.')
