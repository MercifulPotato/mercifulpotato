Certainly not the users who are allegedly patronizing Apple only because they don&#x27;t want that.<p>&gt; and in the process you created a fragmentation hell.<p>I don&#x27;t understand what this is supposed to be about. Is it &quot;fragmentation&quot; that you can get books from a book store and a library and online and a thrift store? How is that a problem? If the books in the thrift store are torn up and written in, why not just buy from a different one?<p>&gt; Clearly its something the consumers want, hence Apple&#x27;s monstrous pile of cash.<p>People keep saying this, but the fact that you have no alternatives to Apple&#x27;s store on their devices is precisely why you can&#x27;t prove it that way. We have no data on how many people are buying their devices for the store vs. <i>despite</i> the store and for the hardware or the OS or iMessage etc.')
