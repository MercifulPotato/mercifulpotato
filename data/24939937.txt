I have never really understood licensing as a political movement.<p>In the past I have contributed to open source because I created tools that were useful to me and could be useful to other people.  By exposing such a tool other people report defects and the tool gets more sturdy.  I would normally just license things with CC0.<p>In my current project I am using the most restrictive open source license I can find: AGPLv3.  The idea is to expose the source code to encourage trust and allow other people to reproduce the work in a practical manner without sacrificing authorship or trust.  I considering turning the project into a business in the future would like to retain control of the idea and limit competition without sacrificing trust or integrity.<p>None of this reasoning is political.  It just about writing better software.')
