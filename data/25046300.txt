That&#x27;s unlikely to make a difference. The comments to that post also said it was likely a data-entry&#x2F;clerical error, which makes the story even worse.<p>&gt;Basic argument is the house sets the rules. Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court had not right to extend the deadline.<p>I find this argument unconvincing. Laws set by the state legislature is normally bound by the courts. If we go with the literal interpretation, it would also mean that the legislature can enact a law saying &quot;only white men can vote&quot; and the courts wouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything about it.')
