But desktop OpenGL has a strong sandbox too (by API design, process control, device memory paging protection, etc.), so I’m not sure why you’re thinking the threat models are any different, it’s just as bad if a game secretly hacks your computer as if a web site does. Desktop OpenGL development is dying anyway, so it doesn’t really matter how fast it is compared to WebGL in the future, but I don’t believe it is faster than WebGL due to any sandbox differences. Whatever speed differences exist are there due to features and design and speed of the host language.')
