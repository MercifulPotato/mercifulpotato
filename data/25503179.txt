SQL Is terrible bad at it in <i>some</i> contexts because it&#x27;s inherently made for a 2d table projection which is (more or less) only joined to larger 2d table projections of data which often in it&#x27;s nature is neither 2d nor maps well to 2d representations. And while you can extend SQL to support that or work around it with e.g. recursive queries it&#x27;s not very nice to do at all.')
