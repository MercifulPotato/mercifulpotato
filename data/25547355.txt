Coal got it in Germany, Spain, Rusia,Poland, Norway and of course England. Places like current Bangladesh supported coal mines in England.<p>Certainly oil got it later, but few places in Europe had it compared to coal. Refineries grew costing lots of billions.<p>Then natural gas got it with the investment of big gasoducts.<p>Then it was renewables. Hydrogen is just the next step, because it is the cornerstone of the chemical synthesis process, not just transportation.<p>Hydrogen and electricity are just &quot;vectors&quot;. They let you use coal,gas,nuclear, hydro or Eolic power to power your cars and trucks with much less dependency on US controlled oil for industry and transportation.')
