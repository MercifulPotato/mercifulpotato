Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=[25115851], score=None, time=1605553899, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25115534, text='The word &quot;appalling&quot; describes something that creates surprising distress or dismay (itself implying surprise).<p>To be surprised at a cryptographer advocating for deniable messaging is to suggest that you&#x27;re unacquainted with the field of messaging cryptography, in which deniable messaging has been a foundational goal for almost 2 decades, going back to Ian Goldberg and Nikita Borisov, who once yelled at me on Twitter for giving OTR short shrift and thus ensured I&#x27;d always associate his name with OTR and thus, I&#x27;m sure to his delight, his name being dropped on this thread.<p>I&#x27;d again like to point out how clear it is, the epistemic approach being taken in this thread. You can disagree with deniable messaging as a valid goal (it&#x27;d set you apart from cryptography engineers, but that&#x27;s fine). But you can&#x27;t be <i>appalled</i> by it in 2020, because the idea is old enough to drink in a bar in Canada, and motivated at least two of the most famous protocols in all of cryptography.<p>Instead, what people are doing here is skimming this post, digging no further, and then calling to mind their understanding of current events. Then, from that tiny thread of information and a bunch of axioms invented, I presume, in the span of just a minute or two, they&#x27;re deriving an entire first-principles explanation of how messaging security is supposed to work.<p>You can do that, but I think it&#x27;s more than fair to point out that there are people that have dedicated their entire career to studying this subject and publishing on it, and if commenters are going to make it clear that they haven&#x27;t even tried to engage with that material, it&#x27;s unclear why they should be taken seriously.<p>Also, Google should publish DKIM keys.')
