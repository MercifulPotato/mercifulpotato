However, when I read the descriptions I picked up only two:<p><pre><code>  - Arrogance: I know better than my team\n  - Insecurity: I need to fight for myself b&#x2F;c otherwise I&#x27;ll lose my job &#x2F; they&#x27;ll realize I&#x27;m a fake\n</code></pre>\nThose cause the leader to put themselves ahead of their team &#x2F; disregard the thoughts of their team.<p>I suspect this condition is probably only made worse by the way our industry emphasizes the headstrong&#x2F;autocratic facets of leaders (i.e. see how the media portrays Jobs, early Gates, Zuck, Dorsey, TK, Spiegel, etc.), convincing people to pursue positions of leadership for the wrong reasons: either that they finally will have final say or won&#x27;t be able to be criticized. That becomes a refuge for the arrogant (wow, I&#x27;ll finally have final say) and the insecure (wow, I&#x27;ll finally not be able to be criticized). However, from what I can tell, leadership is more about:<p><pre><code>  - Integrating other&#x27;s thoughts: your job is ultimately to integrate thoughts, not necessarily to just choose your own (failing to do so results in the autocratic failure mode)\n  - Requires vulnerability &#x2F; sense-of-security: because how you integrate information&#x2F;think--not just what you think--is a business asset, the business has more of a right to provide feedback there (failing to do so results in the deceptive failure mode)\n</code></pre>\nAnd something that should only be pursued &#x2F; gifted once those have been worked through?')
