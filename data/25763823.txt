Never really felt I used it to any extent but I also never canceled my subscription because I&#x27;m happy for what it is and I can&#x27;t bother to find alternatives.<p>However my computer recently crashed and when &quot;re-installing&quot; Dropbox I discovered that they have many more useful &quot;Apps&quot; included like backup and password-sync and a neat paper scanning app for the phone. All of which I was very happy to discover. So I see myself keeping my subscription for the foreseeable future. :)')
