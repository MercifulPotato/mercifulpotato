Fluorocarbons are basically magic when it comes to repelling water.<p>Nordic skiing (and to a lesser extent, downhill skiing) have been going through a bit of a reckoning trying to remove them from competitions. Fluorowaxes are very effective for gliding quickly in wet conditions. The fact that they are melted during application makes them particularly pernicious.<p>Fluorocarbons are also ubiquitous in water repelling in clothing. Some of the more expensive brands of outdoor wear have moved to shorter chain fluorocarbons, but they haven&#x27;t eliminated their use. From Arcteryx: &quot;... non-PFC [water repellant] treatments... have fallen short of the level of performance and durability we deem imperative&quot;. It&#x27;s likely less urgent with clothing, since these compounds are quite stable when left alone at normal temperatures.')
