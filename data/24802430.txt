Sex with these women and children was offered to paying men via ads in Backpage.<p>When some of these women escaped they noticed their images were still being used in these ads.  They tried to i) get Backpage to stop using these images of them being raped (sometimes of them as children being raped) and ii) get Backpage to take more corporate responsibility about taking adverts from traffickers.<p>For some reason people seem to think this is about people who chose to sex work.  It isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s about people who were forced into it.<p>Backpage declined to take down the images, and declined to stop taking ads.  They then made it easier for people to place those ads; they helped people evade law enforcement; they gave people advice about what language to use when placing those ads.<p>They got away with it because S230 means they&#x27;re not responsible for what their users do, even though they&#x27;re coaching their users about how to evade law enforcement.')
