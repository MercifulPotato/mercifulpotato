I forgot how much ahead of its time the Nokia 808 PureView was! Its sensor size still dwarfs the latest and greatest from Samsung - and especially Apple&#x27;s new 1&#x2F;1.7 on the 12 Pro Max.<p>Pixel 5 using the Snapdragon 765G also grosses over the fact image processing is no longer being handled by Google&#x27;s custom Visual Core (in Pixel 2 &amp; 3). Inevitable perhaps given performance parity, but shows how much of its photography lead Google has relinquished.')
