Item(by='eru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607596872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25371913, text='&gt; The provider is still a debate, between letting private entities do it (which, as anyone that has seen private entities deal with such important things, know is a terrible idea), or the state. As to who is violating their rights, it depends. Are you in a fully remote place where it is almost physically impossible to get you water ? Undefined. Otherwise, the provider is expected to perform what is expected of them and bring you water, by any means necessary.<p>Huh?  Why place such a burden on the provider?  Just let multiple providers compete on price and service as normal to determine how much effort is reasonable.<p>(That idea of competition doesn&#x27;t preclude having municipal water works.  As long as you don&#x27;t ban private suppliers.)')
