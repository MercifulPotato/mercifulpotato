Why would you compare against old rivals instead of the current market? They had 1660 Ti&#x27;s on the charts, too, which both obliterated the M1 &amp; are not at all the high-end of discreet mobile GPUs.<p>The &quot;discreet rival&quot; was because the M1 was competing favorably against the discreet 1650 &amp; 560(X). As in, entry-level discreet GPUs make increasingly less sense (they already weren&#x27;t making much sense with Intel&#x27;s new Xe and AMD&#x27;s Vega 8 &amp; 11 integrated, but more nails in that coffin with the M1)')
