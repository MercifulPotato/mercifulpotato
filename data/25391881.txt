In other words, by studying one (personality type or cultural phenomenon) can we draw <i>substantive</i> <i>conclusions</i> about the other in terms of genesis or remediation? We (as humans) love making such equivocations, but absent strong evidence they&#x27;re mostly just exercises in, e.g., the composition fallacy.')
