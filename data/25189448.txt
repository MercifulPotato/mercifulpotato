The brands don&#x27;t want all their sales from one distribution partner because that distribution partner will have enormous leverage.<p>Where MAP fails is if brands want to different prices globally. This is because items will just get re-imported if they are priced lower in other countries.  They want the benefits of globalization which is cheaper labor and materials but don&#x27;t want to negative aspects which is the same price globally for the product.')
