And then you dig in and discover it somehow also has keyboard &amp; mouse input handling, can play sounds (and can be used for live procedural music), simulate a piano keyboard, and probably a bunch of other stuff I&#x27;m forgetting. It was my go-to tool for visualizing any kind of math back during the university years.<p>In fact, I just took a look at it again (after not using it for years) and I discovered it has networking capability, IDE features, and - I kid you not - it seems to compile the scripts down to native code, offering a helpful x86 ASM output in the built-in debugger. It can dump executables, has bindings to OpenGL and support for old-school VR (colored stereoscopic, NVidia 3DVision).<p><i>All in an executable that weighs 746 KB.</i><p>It&#x27;s hands-down one of the most impressive pieces of software I have ever seen.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;advsys.net&#x2F;ken&#x2F;download.htm#evaldraw" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;advsys.net&#x2F;ken&#x2F;download.htm#evaldraw</a><p>EDIT: And if you give it a try, be sure to check some of the ridiculous amount of examples it comes bundled with, which include games, explorable explanations, infinite calendars, optical systems simulations, and a whole host of other stuff.')
