Maybe in the shielding, but that’s the least of your concerns.<p>The other problem is that low thrust to weight means an NTR spade ship can’t land on Mars, or on any body with a significant gravity well. So you need to bring chemical rocket landers, increasing your mass duplication and tech complications.<p>A multipurpose chemical rocket powered space ship Luke Star Ship is far more practical and  nearly as fast.')
