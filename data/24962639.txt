I know that even these can be difficult on pine at the moment...) and only run software I can trust to do what I want and nothing else. That last bit &quot;and nothing else&quot; is really key.<p>Personally, I have come to hate interacting with android and ios devices lately because it always feels like <i>they</i> are trying to make <i>me</i> do something and as if <i>they</i> are trying to extract information from <i>me</i>, not the other way around. Very similar for the web by the way, which I also use less and less.<p>Essentially, modern smartphones feel like they&#x27;re constantly working against me. They are powerful tools for sure, or at least they should be. But tools don&#x27;t work against you. You can misuse them and hurt yourself, but that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening with smartphones.<p>These devices are actively trying to harm me (my mental health and my concentration at the very least) because the business models that produced them are based on that. Yes, even for apple. Their OS is much, much less like that than android, but iOS is nothing without the apps, and those largely follow the same pattern.')
