(Once I got asked to write a test that was unnecessary and almost impossible to write a test for. Think timing issues. My options were to push back or spend a significant amount of time writing a test that was not needed. As a junior that already pushed back more than a typical junior I made the best choice I thought I could make at the time.)')
