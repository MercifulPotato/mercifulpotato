However, houses are on average twice as big as they were back then, and contain far fewer occupants on average, too. In 1970 the average household was 3.14 people, today it&#x27;s 2.5 people.<p>[edit] There&#x27;s a lot of reasons for the increase in the actual price of accommodation. They&#x27;re largely driven by local ordinances. Setback rules, minimum size rules, minimum number of bathrooms&#x2F;closets&#x2F;etc all - all sorts of code things.<p>Further, in major metros city councils refuse to increase supply to meet demand - to benefit existing landowners.<p>One solution to this is national zoning rules like Japan has.')
