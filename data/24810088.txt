Item(by='croissants', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602943855, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24809827, text='&gt; However its VERY hard to ignore the reality that essentially 100% of the US population has no difficulty, on average, kinda paying electric bills and property tax bills and phone bills.<p>&quot;essentially 100%&quot; is an overstatement. Federal Reserve data (see e.g. Figure 12 here [1]) consistently shows that quite a few Americans have difficulty paying bills. For example, ~25% of surveyed Americans with a high school degree or less said they couldn&#x27;t pay that month&#x27;s bills. That number gets smaller with more education but is always 50-100% larger for black and Hispanic people.<p>It seems reasonable to me that people juggling various overdue bills might not prioritize responding to a census that has 0 short-term positive impact. It also seems reasonable to me that we make an extra effort to count these people since the point of the census is to count <i>everybody</i>, not just people who are easy to count.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federalreserve.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;2019-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2018-dealing-with-unexpected-expenses.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.federalreserve.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;2019-economic-we...</a>')
