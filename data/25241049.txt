Why does it take someone&#x27;s death to start appreciating his body of work?  I think many skeptics believe they&#x27;re speaking truth to power and therefore making the world a better place.    There&#x27;s certainly an element of truth to this, but I think if you take the ten thousand foot view, you&#x27;ll find that we can be a more powerful agent of change by building good people up rather than tearing bad people down (or even worse, tearing net-good people down).<p>My condolences go out to Tony&#x27;s family and friends.  As a fellow founder who&#x27;s faced similar challenges as Tony, I remember tearing up in the airport reading Delivering Happiness.  Rest in peace.')
