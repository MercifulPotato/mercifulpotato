It&#x27;s not some theoretical formula for maintaining power that has never been tried before. Rigging and corruption is the rule not the exception, in human history.<p>We don&#x27;t have the federal courts, not in the least. It&#x27;s just fraud. The FBI would rather investigate Twitter shitposters than touch this. They&#x27;d rather get jobs at CNN as consultants to pitch their own actual conspiracy theory about Trump being a Russian stooge for three years despite having had exculpatory evidence the entire time. I don&#x27;t know how Americans are so naive when it comes to the depravity of our system.')
