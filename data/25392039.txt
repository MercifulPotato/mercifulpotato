The US did a great job at politicizing the virus such that I don&#x27;t really trust that pharma companies actually did their due diligence with regard to testing and safety measures. I accept that doctors and scientists will take it under the guise of them &quot;knowing it&#x27;s safe&quot;, and I accept that lots of people will say &quot;If they&#x27;re doing it, you should too&quot;, but I think this strategy just generally ignores common sense. Doctors use and prescribe drugs all the time with unintended adverse side effects, the difference here is that those side effects are known and well studied. A vaccine that showed up to save the world (and also start a culture war in some countries)? I do not accept that the powers at be have verified this drug&#x27;s safety.<p>I think that this vaccine is a choice, and once it&#x27;s readily available it is still a choice. If you choose not to get it, you are accepting the possibility that you might get COVID and die. Once the vaccine becomes available to my age group and health demographic, the people that actually need it will have been given the option to make their choice as well.')
