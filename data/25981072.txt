I&#x27;d just been looking at the top comments of a bunch of HN threads and thinking &quot;why does this place seem so unfriendly&quot;. Your comment isn&#x27;t anywhere close to being the worst, it just happened to be the one I responded to.<p>And being direct isn&#x27;t a bad thing either, my point here wasn&#x27;t &quot;don&#x27;t be direct or concise, you&#x27;ll offend people&quot; but &quot;assuming everyone here is reasonable, disagreements are likely due to differences in experience and you&#x27;ll have a more productive discussion by figuring out the differences than simply stating opinions&quot;.')
