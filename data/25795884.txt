But there&#x27;s still a long way to go. I wasn&#x27;t as focused on onboarding as I was on criticizing Element&#x27;s UI&#x2F;UX in general.<p>&gt; And we definitely don&#x27;t need phone numbers and SMS verification for usability: a username will do just fine<p>Phone number is just the <i>easiest</i> thing to do. No one is confused by the process and you immediately have access to all of your contacts, while with a username you somehow need to get all the usernames of all of your friends. Inviting new users to various channels kind of works, but it&#x27;s not as personal as your own contact list.<p>Mind you I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the <i>best</i> option. <i>Personally</i> I&#x27;d rather register with a username, not only because I currently have three different phone numbers in use.<p>&gt; we don&#x27;t have to spend 1.5 million USD from donations just on SMS codes in 2018 alone (source: tax filing)<p>Signal was paying that much?
