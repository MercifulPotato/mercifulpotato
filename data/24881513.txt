Item(by='abeppu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603569088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24877699, text='I find this deeply confusing.<p>- The distinction between integrating information in time vs in space is not clear to me. The author talks about how EM fields &quot;instantly computes&quot; solutions to physical equilibrium problems (how will iron filings be arranged, etc), but also how &quot;dynamic EM field information&quot; can do computations like AND. Doesn&#x27;t that mean we&#x27;re talking about computation&#x2F;information processing that unfolds in both time and space (like everything else?)<p>- But more fundamentally, I don&#x27;t see why consciousness is better explained by neurons influencing each other through their EM fields rather than just the normal, slower, ion gate &#x2F; axon &#x2F; synapse &#x2F; neurotransmitter &#x2F; etc way we already know they interact?<p>- And I don&#x27;t get the local vs global distinction the author tries to draw:<p>&gt; I estimated that the EM field electrical perturbation from the firing of a single neuron extends into a volume of only about 80 Âµm encompassing a maximum of about 200 neurons<p>&gt;  within the brain, the light cones of all the trillions of emitted photon will almost entirely overlap. Any charged particle in the brain (or outside, but with rapidly diminishing probability) can potentially be the receiver of any of the trillions of emitted 10 bit packages of information available in the entire field<p>... so it sounds like the author thinks both locality and global reach are important?<p>But I think mostly, I don&#x27;t get why the distance-weighted-sum way that EM field information gets integrated together would give you anything better than a noisy jumble. The complexity of our behavior and experience seems much more likely to be explained in the connection and interactions among neurons, where the &#x27;summation&#x27; is both complex and informed by the complicated way neurons have wired together. But I don&#x27;t see how any of this begins to approach the subjective side of things, even though he name-drops Nagel.')
