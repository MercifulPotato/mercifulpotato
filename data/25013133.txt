(And it&#x27;s easy to use the convenient `:=` in a way which faces problems exacerbated by this).<p>If I&#x27;m debugging through something, I might be adding packages or intermediate calculations to try and figure out what&#x27;s going wrong. But because the Go compiler enforces this proper style of &quot;nothing unused&quot;, there&#x27;s that much more friction when tinkering.')
