I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong - the most likely answer here is that I just haven&#x27;t been to the places that you&#x27;re talking about.<p>All of the midwestern cities that I&#x27;ve lived in have definitely lacked a lot of cultural diversity, even if you drive out to the outskirts of the city where the majority of minorities tend to live (again, in the cities I&#x27;ve been to).<p>Maybe because the majority of people in these cities aren&#x27;t as interested in the diversity, so the diverse populations can&#x27;t really start a business that succeeds since no one (outside of their tiny community) wants to go there?<p>Or, I&#x27;m just wrong and haven&#x27;t been to the right places')
