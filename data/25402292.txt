Much appreciated.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve also found that quantitative or hard-science thinkers are often very good at dealing with uncertainty. One reason being that they have the strongest sense of what true certainty is, and the ability to measure uncertainty relative to that.<p>That&#x27;s an excellent point and I agree with you. My statement about tech folks and certainty was a bit too broad, tbh, and maybe expresses some personal frustration as much as anything.<p>At the end of the day we&#x27;re all human and vulnerable to the same tricks of psychology and human foibles.<p>[EDIT: I want to share in a quote another poster shared that&#x27;s relevant to our discussion: &#x27;Math is hard because it is easy. The humanities are easy because they are hard.&#x27;<p>It&#x27;s not just about math being quantifiable, but that there&#x27;s a much lower barrier of entry to discuss &quot;the humanities&quot; - justice, ethics, the meaning of life, etc. Maybe a good analogy would be we can all discuss the weather, but that means sometimes we think meteorologists are just quacks? : )].<p>[EDIT EDIT: If interested in learning more about the humanities I highly recommend the Socratic dialogues as starting point. They&#x27;re still the foundation of all Western Philosophy, including the postmodern stuff people love to hate on. They&#x27;re pretty approachable and interesting and readable and short and don&#x27;t have any jargon, really. A course of some kind is ideal but you could read them on your own.]')
