In a large custom integration we read orders, they have unique order numbers, nice 5 digit things. So in the database, they became integer primary keys, with lots of child tables.<p>Fast forward 5 years, customer switches ERP system and they ask &quot;hey, the order numbers, you do support 10+ digits right?&quot;<p>Changing the database is relatively easy, changing the code is a chore, but worst part will be going over all the queries and their parameters, especially in the reports.<p>So yeah, lesson learned.')
