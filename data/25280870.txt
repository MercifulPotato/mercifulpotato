Big agriculture companies could provide food for the people and these animals, so they would still exist and be profitable.<p>The problem is that land is limited, and spreading out would just result in extremely inefficient fuel usage, with all the pollution that entails.<p>Plus, some would say it would be a pretty inefficient use of man hours, although I think it would be a better, more &quot;natural&quot; life for humans, as well.')
