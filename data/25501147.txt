Item(by='tracker1', descendants=None, kids=[25502148], score=None, time=1608594184, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500938, text='I think the biggest issue is that the &quot;Facts&quot; the fact checkers present, often isn&#x27;t factually based.  Not to mention, the fact checking orgs will cover factual, even if mixed with hyperbolic opinion articles in favor of their own news orgs articles (that are monetized to boot).<p>It&#x27;s also less than ideal that they body-check facts from right leaning news sources far more than left leaning. FTR, I&#x27;m Libertarian not typical left&#x2F;right.<p>I posted a humorous meme, and it was tagged with a couple different &quot;get the facts&quot; messages, which was just plain stupid and kind of funny, even drawing in comments to that effect.<p>In the end, it&#x27;s hard to trust most of the media sources without getting news&#x2F;pov from multiple left&#x2F;right&#x2F;foreign sources. I&#x27;m starting to think that anything that is opinion based over facts in news reporting should have a big red label of &quot;OPINION, NOT NEWS!&quot; on it in order to receive any protection from libel, including videos for a couple seconds.  I also think that any social media org that has more than 25% of a country as its&#x27; users should probably have to comply with the same free speech norms as a government agency would.<p>I work in the elections space, and while some things seem really fishy, it&#x27;s hard to take any of it without a grain of salt considering how many of the things I&#x27;ve seen being accused are purely BS from people who don&#x27;t know&#x2F;understand what&#x27;s happening.  I mean, I&#x27;m pretty sure there was some fishy stuff going on in at least some places, but I just don&#x27;t know what to believe anymore... and that&#x27;s almost worse than just picking a side.<p>I think having peer review opportunities would go a long way over some of the paid and algorithmic review options.  Even if you had a hidden Karma like here and other sites and was randomly chosen to &quot;review&quot; judge&#x2F;vote on content posts... maybe not private messages, but say public posts or group posts... just a general thumbs up&#x2F;down.. and the quorum is comprised of say 3-5 randomly selected each of left&#x2F;right&#x2F;other for a decent mix.  You get a 55% quorum for violation, the post then goes to FB for review&#x2F;action.<p>Reviews are done by those in the same locality of the person posting.  Private groups or message posts go directly to FB monitors... but there&#x27;s no reason not to have a community judge for itself if something is over the line.')
