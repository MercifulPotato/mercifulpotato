If you have legal concerns about being coerced into using a biometric system, you should disable it.<p>One of the problems &quot;biometrics shouldn&#x27;t be a password&quot; is meant to expose, is that you can&#x27;t reset a biometric if it leaks. By keeping the biometrics inside a device at all times, the T2 system substantially mitigates this risk. I&#x27;m fairly certain you can remove a device from your Apple account, and the ID system will no longer work, even if provided with your face or fingerprint.')
