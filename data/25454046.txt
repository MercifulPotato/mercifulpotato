In the authors view, Facebook is not trying to target younger, more diverse politicians, but rather older, conservative politicians, who happen to be mostly white.<p>And in my opinion, the author is right and race is an important factor in this issue: There have been many reports that advertisers use Facebook to discriminate according to race, and minorities have rightfully complained loudly about that.<p>It&#x27;s definitely telling that Facebook targets what we assume to be a very conservative, narrow audience, rather than using their own platforms to spread the message: if they showed the ad on Facebook itself, or on Instagram, it would reach a much wider and more diverse audience. But that&#x27;s not what they are doing.')
