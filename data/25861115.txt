Here was our rationale for the current pricing model.<p>1) We don&#x27;t want to charge an arm and a leg for pre-revenue&#x2F;early stage companies to have access to our software. We wanted to find a scalable way to discount our pricing so that when you&#x27;re early and cash strapped, you can still use us without price being a big factor.<p>2) As your revenue grows, then your company is going to be bigger, and you will have more people that will be collaborating in Finmark and more data that we will have to process. In essence, we think that revenue is linearly correlated with data and user usage across our app. Therefore, we don&#x27;t think we are giving the same thing. Instead, the company is using us more and therefore we are charging more.<p>Curious if that resonates?')
