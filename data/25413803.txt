Doesn&#x27;t that seem late?<p>Why would that be late? It might be too early!<p>There is not a good infrastructure for electric car charging. Right now it is a luxury for homeowners and people who rent high-end apartments.<p>Even in California, where I see electric cars literally every time I drive somewhere, the infrastructure is easily overwhelmed -- last year there were long lines outside of Tesla Supercharger stations on Thanksgiving and Christmas, and that was just for Tesla owners! Imagine how bad it will get when electric cars become available at prices that most people can afford!<p>Considering those challenges, it&#x27;s really very encouraging that mass-market automakers are willing to take the risk - especially since the government has not been willing to take the complementary risk of building charging stations on public streets to the extent that would be necessary for apartment-dwellers to be able to realistically consider owning electric cars.')
