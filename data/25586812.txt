I&#x27;d like to just reassure you with my 20 years of experience developing C (and the last 10 with C++) in network and system software: that any library -- any library -- that forces internal dynamic memory upon its user smells bad. It&#x27;s not a universal condemnation, but it begs the question, or rather the skepticism to ask <i>why</i>?<p>In the case of protobufs, there is no real answer. Protobufs is one of the few network libraries that doesn&#x27;t operate with zero-copy. That steps over a tangible line in the sand.<p>No zero-copy for networking? Forced internal heap allocations with only this arena feature after a decade? Sorry no. Protobufs isn&#x27;t useful for serious network applications.')
