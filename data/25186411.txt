But here we are, Apple really managed to make binary translation work well this time, and Intel applications are plenty snappy. Which is impressive. <i>(I also wonder how much of that is having a really fast SSD so the translation of the app is not as I&#x2F;O bound.)</i><p>And I don’t think legacy x86 apps will be as much of a thing this time around. Back in the PPC days, lots of applications were built using Metrowerks CodeWarrior toolchain, which didn’t come across the divide, so big applications had to scramble to get everything into Xcode. This time, if an application made it past the evolutionary bottleneck of needing to be 64-bit only for Catalina, it’s probably close to ready to go for ARM.')
