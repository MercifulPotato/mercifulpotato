Yes. Do you need to be able to write a compiler? No. (It&#x27;s useful, but unless it is your major, no, and you can learn it later.) I would trade off compiler design for a software configuration management course. Should you understand some crypto basics? Yes. But I&#x27;d rather employ someone who understands TLS and PKI than someone who has written a toy project to implement a cipher.')
