It is not a rights <i>grant</i>, it is a prohibition on the  legislature of the US Government, but the US Government is not the same as the State governments, and the State governments are not subordinate entities of the US Government, and the United States Constitution is a document that formulates and determines the powers of the United States government, with only a few words to spare on the States. You didnâ€™t mention your country, but most likely this is very different than your own country.<p>Most States have some sort of equivalent in their own Constitutions, although I have found most of them to be poorly written compared to the gold standard of the First Amendment.')
