That leaves very little room for the replacement for relativity to be different.<p>Newtonian physics is a special case of relativity when you keep relative speeds slow.<p>We don&#x27;t know how quantum mechanics fits in.  There is a known hole in current physics.  However the size of the hole is small.')
