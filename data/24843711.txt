More complaints that some users cannot access, but other than that no more complaints about spam.<p>Sure, if this worked.  But it&#x27;s not 2010 any more.  Simple stuff like this only stops the most technologically illiterate attacks.<p>If your site is being attacked by more than bubba the local &quot;computer guy&quot; - they will be using proxies indistinguishable from your normal traffic, assuming you do any volume at all.<p>It&#x27;s just a silly exercise in futility.  I put it up there with moving sshd from port 22 to a random port.  Yeah, you get less spam I suppose, but it sure as hell didn&#x27;t make you any more secure.  Probably the opposite.<p>Outright blocks of &quot;bad IPs&quot; are not that useful in my opinion.  However, developing reputation systems around IPs and using &quot;is tor&quot; as one metric certainly has shown it&#x27;s uses in my field of work.')
