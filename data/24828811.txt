How it is ad hominem to say that there are different levels of credibility?  It is not a binary in which every news organization is either &quot;CSPAN&quot; or &quot;Fox News&quot;.  Some organizations are more committed to real journalism than others.  The Post is not one of those organizations.  This story ended up there because of this fact.  Even Fox News turned it down over concerns about credibility.[1]  Refusing to ignore that aspect of this is not an ad hominem attack.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediaite.com&#x2F;tv&#x2F;exclusive-fox-news-passed-on-hunter-biden-laptop-story-over-credibility-concerns&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediaite.com&#x2F;tv&#x2F;exclusive-fox-news-passed-on-hun...</a>')
