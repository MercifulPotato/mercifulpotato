They previously did so by charging fees to IoT manufacturers which wished to allow their customers to connect their devices to IFTTT. They have raised those fees recently which led to some device manufacturers dropping IFTTT or charging their customers fees to use IFTTT with their devices. This along with IFTTT dropping some actions which resulted them incurring costs, sending SMS messages for example, has significantly reduced the usefulness of IFTTT for many. It will be interesting to see if the decision to monetize through consumers along with manufacturers will work out or alienate enough consumers that even more manufacturers decide that connecting to IFTTT is not worth the expense.')
