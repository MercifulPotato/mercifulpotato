If it&#x27;s a riddle, you could see if it&#x27;s made clear by the wording, interrogate the person asking the riddle, or state the assumption you&#x27;re making in your answer.<p>If you find yourself actually in the situation, you need to make your best guess from what information is available.<p>As for simulation, write a function that handles a single play through of the game and returns the outcome if you switch.  Make Monty&#x27;s strategy a parameter.  Remember that &quot;Monty revealed the car&quot; is a separate outcome from &quot;win&quot; or &quot;lose&quot;.  Run that function a whole bunch of times, counting the outcomes.  Compare the ratio between wins and losses, at various choices of strategy.<p>To really drive home the point that strategy can matter, consider another possibility: maybe this season the studio executives have decided that cutting costs is more important than having an interesting game show, and Monty&#x27;s strategy is now &quot;reveal the car if you haven&#x27;t already chosen it&quot;.  Monty has revealed a goat.  Is there still a 2&#x2F;3 chance that you didn&#x27;t pick the car?')
