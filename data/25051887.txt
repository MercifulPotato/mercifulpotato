Polls don&#x27;t do that.<p>I&#x27;m not just referring to inaccuracies that are introduced by non-representedness of the sample, although that&#x27;s clearly a factor as well.<p>Polls invite respondents to indicate how they would vote &quot;if an election were held today&quot;.  But the election isn&#x27;t being held today, and the respondents know it.  Polls are an invitation for respondents to send a message to politicians before the poll, to <i>influence</i> the politicians&#x27; offerings.  Respondents know that, and use the opportunity that way.<p>So what are polls?  Polls are their own little universe, with their own characteristics, dynamics, and effects.  What they aren&#x27;t is a crystal ball.')
