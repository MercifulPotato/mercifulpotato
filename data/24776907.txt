Viewers give a shit about quality<p>2. The article authors know more about whether a show is viable than Netfix (with its massively detailed viewership data)<p>In reality, Netflix only cares about subscriber count, and that incentive is both obvious and intuitive. A show winning an Emmy has nothing to do with whether or not it’s profitable.<p>I mean, see cable pre-Internet. The delusion that Netflix is something unique beyond what cable was has never been true. The only thing special about it is that there are no ads, which is not universal among the industry (do cheap Hulu, Tubi, and Pluto remind you of anything? Reminds me of cable!)<p>Critically acclaimed shows like Stranger Things might have been important to gain mindshare, but now everyone knows what Netflix is and those expensive efforts are probably not worth it. Personally, I spend most of my TV time watching House Hunters which (a) will never win critical acclaim and (b) is about the cheapest show to produce that someone can imagine.<p>But I don’t like watching one hour dramas that are there to be depressing and have expensive actors, sets, and special effects. I just want to veg out and watch some idiots buy the wrong house.')
