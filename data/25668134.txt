Item(by='YZF', descendants=None, kids=[25668702], score=None, time=1610003442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25667947, text='Well, if this guy makes your top N list, and I just sampled it randomly I think I have some justification of extrapolating to the rest of your list.  Like I was saying, this dude got more media coverage than I&#x27;d have given him.  CNN doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to report any random story of someone claiming something.  For sure they have a bias but they don&#x27;t have to give everyone a stage to air their grievance.<p>Where exactly is that &quot;well-documented&quot; documentation?  It&#x27;s <i>not</i> in the affidavit.  For all we know this guy voted in Arizona just so he could cry foul, or nobody really voted in Arizona using his name.  Even if we say that one of his friends or acquaintances (clearly a Biden supporter) knew that he moved and took advantage to fake a vote where does that exactly leave us?  How many people are in this situation?  Would it change the results?  Was this somehow systematically exploited?  And how exactly?<p>Why should I assign any credibility to what some seem to call &quot;Pro-Trump ‘voter integrity’ group that is calling Pennsylvania voters has ties to White House&quot;?  Does this group have any credibility?  Now I need to watch a video?  But sure, let&#x27;s see what they&#x27;re saying and I&#x27;ll get back to you.<p>We have plenty of credible sources, including from the current administration, who tell us that the elections was generally fair.<p>Not voting has an impact, so if the president that won starts a war, and you didn&#x27;t vote for the other guy (hypothetically) then you did actually effectively vote for the president.  You don&#x27;t get to walk away from democracy like that.<p>EDIT: So I went to the video.  I gotta say &quot;Trump Pence&quot; in the background inspires confidence in the message.  I&#x27;m not gonna spend an hour of my time listening to this so I jumped to the &quot;dead voters&quot; segment because that seemed interesting.  &quot;blah blah blah&quot;, &quot;no records&quot;, &quot;duplicate names make this difficult&quot;, &quot;very small numbers&quot;, &quot;small numbers&quot;, &quot;I can not say there was an effort to vote in the name of the deceased&quot;... &quot;Its very difficult to determine who is dead and who is not&quot;.  So great, it&#x27;s all good then?')
