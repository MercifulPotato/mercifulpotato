That it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> embody an authentic hacker spirit? Surely you jest?<p>Anyway, know your audience. There&#x27;s no shortage of corporate bootlickers who love their billionaire overlords and the antics their privacy&#x2F;competition&#x2F;small business&#x2F;ethics&#x2F;human rights crushing companies get up to posting on here all day every day. Some even feign giving a fuck about these things but unsurprisingly not enough to actually <i>do</i> something about it.<p>Then you&#x27;ve the statists who, well, love the state although it often has the caveat of which side of the coin is currently pretending to run the place.<p>Then you&#x27;ve got the union of the two who often rear their head and they&#x27;re... well... fucked, but what are you going to do?<p>Anyway, as I&#x27;ve said on here before as someone without skin in the game and who is at a safe distance, what seems like the final season of the hit reality TV show &quot;USA&quot; is most certainly an exciting one to be watching.')
