From what I&#x27;ve seen, I don&#x27;t even think self driving cars are remotely viable for another 10~15 years (honestly we&#x27;d probably need general purpose AI first, and if that&#x27;s even remotely possible, there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re going to get a thinking sentient machine to put in the effort to do something so mundane as driving your damn car).<p>There are still so many things machines cannot do. They can&#x27;t pick products of different sizes in an Amazon warehouse. They can&#x27;t make carbon fibre (most of that stuff is still shaped by hand) .. hell even a lot of space rocket shells are still bent into shape by hand.<p>Ideally we&#x27;d want to see the world move away from goods and more human beings living more sustainably producing content and art for one another. But who am I kidding, we&#x27;re totally going to run out of resources and&#x2F;or cover our planet in plastic slurry of sludge and pollution long before then.')
