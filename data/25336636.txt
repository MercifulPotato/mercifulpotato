I think a large part of it is all the stairs&#x2F;passageways into and out of train stations. Obviously some have escalators but some don&#x27;t or during rush hour it&#x27;s easier to just take the steps. In the Bay Area we don&#x27;t have a transportation system with that kind of infrastructure. New York City&#x27;s subways would be a bit similar, but most of the stations I&#x27;ve been to there have much fewer stairways.')
