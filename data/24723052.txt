Now try to ascertain if someone made a hiring&#x2F;promotion decision based on merit or on melanin without some kind of Star Trek era brain scan.<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that business owners should be the sole arbiters of who is hired and promoted anyway. The State should mind its own business. A good business owner will promote the best talent which will make their company grow. If they start filtering talent based on skin color, they&#x27;re hurting their own pocket.<p>You can&#x27;t ascertain whether individual hiring decisions are based on merit or not, but you can make a statistical guess at what percentage of each ethnicity would be promoted based on the demographics where the hiring is taking place. If the population is 10% black and 90% white, you&#x27;d expect an organization to be 10% black and 90% white on average, if no racial screening is occurring.<p>However, the common &quot;diversity quotas&quot; which are commonly employed now want a different outcome. They want to see at least 50% of hires from BAME, even if BAME are only 20% of the demographics. There&#x27;s a term for this. It&#x27;s called racism.')
