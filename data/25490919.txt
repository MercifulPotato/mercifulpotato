It must have a main ELF, that would then launch another ELF from the disk. (For example, the main menu would be one ELF, and then each demo game would be another elf). Create an iso, then replace one of the game ELFs with whatever executable you wanted. The resulting iso must have the same layout, with every file at the same location. Burn it to disk. Tear apart the PS2 and remove the top of the disk drive. There&#x27;s a little white plastic piece with a magnet that clamps down the disk, remove that from the lid of the disk drive. Put the original disk in the drive, clamp down the disk with the magnet, and boot it up to the menu screen of the demo disk. Without hitting the eject button, use your finger to stop the drive, lift out the original disk, set in your burned one, put the magnet on top, and choose to run the game that corresponds to the ELF you replaced. Voila.')
