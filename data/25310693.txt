Item(by='dirtyid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607131544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25306228, text='&gt;This comes from a devout Marxist whose family was in the comunist party ranks right from its inception.<p>And Xi was a princeling with a much stronger party pedigree, who survived work camps with ostensibly a renewed faith in the party. Wikileaks &#x2F; CIA dossier on him by former politburo member and family friend of Xi summarized Xi as basically not too smart, but a believer. Not too smart comports with lines in this article, but labelling Xi as not a believer reads more like purity test from disgruntled ideological rival with a bone to pick. Like any political system, there are factions, CCP reformist like Cai Xia and Ren Zhiqiang were understandingly upset over Xi&#x27;s direction for the country, but their analysis should be interpreted as partisan pieces like political writing elsewhere. Cai herself supported Rens essay denouncing Xi&#x27;s covid response early in the outbreak, they subscribed to the idea that democratically reforms would have been in a much better position to handle the the epidemic - they believed covid was China chernobyl. There are many pro-reformers who felt the same way at the time. They were spectacularly wrong.<p>Ren got purged, Cai&#x27;s in exile now, just another dissident writing for a new audience. Her words should be interpreted accordingly. This entire essays is basically, look CCP under Xi is full of theatre and politics... like politics everywhere, through all time. It&#x27;s entertaining but not particularly illuminating. I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of Xi, I knew he was a believer, he&#x27;s not charismatic, he didn&#x27;t seem very smart, certainly not paramount leader material, but in retrospect he has delivered much more than what I thought he was capable of. And now that inevitable great powers competition is heating up, I don&#x27;t think anyone else&#x27;s reforms and priorities would have postured China to address this rivalry as comprehensively as Xi. Particularly, Xi&#x27;s military restructuring and modernization would not have occurred under Bo Xilai who was good friends with the corrupt and ineffective military old guard, enough that there were rumors of a coup over his purging. That alone makes Xi the best timeline for long term Chinese interests considering US containment efforts against China predates Xi. He&#x27;s probably not the best man for the job, but out of all available options in the politburo, and there weren&#x27;t many, he was the right one.')
