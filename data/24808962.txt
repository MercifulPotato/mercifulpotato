They fitted out vans and drove past embassies to determine the frequencies different embassies were tuned into.  I think they also tested with fitting out aircraft, but itâ€™s a long time since I read the book.<p>Of course there is also the opinion that tv detector vans were a hoax and would never work, so ymmv :)')
