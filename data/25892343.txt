After working with languages with good inference, explicit nullability, and algebraic types, it feels extremely tedious to go back to un-typed or duck-typed languages.<p>With a language like python, you spend a tiny bit less time typing out types in the source code, but that savings is totally eclipsed by the extra time you need to spend reading through documentation and source files to make up for the information which is missing from function signatures, and the time you spend chasing down bugs at runtime.')
