Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606754844, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25255564, text='&gt; SOME lithium batteries are recyclable<p>I interpreted the original quote &quot;Batteries are mostly recyclable currently, full stop&quot; to mean &quot;all batteries are mostly (i.e., &gt;=80%) recyclable&quot; i.e., even lith-ion batteries are ~80% recyclable and 80% constitutes &quot;mostly&quot;. The original quote is confusing, and I think you might be interpreting it as &quot;most batteries are recyclable&quot; or perhaps &quot;most lith-ion batteries are recyclable&quot;. In whatever case, I wanted to jump in and clarify.')
