Where do you draw the line that manages to keep Facebooks app available, while still being able to defend the removal of Parler.<p>Parler was created because Facebook and Twitter wouldn&#x27;t allow certain types of speech. Fundamentally that same speech that was banned from Facebook is what got Parler kicked from pretty much everywhere.<p>Parler knowingly allowed threats of violence, murder, and rape on their platform. Facebook and Twitter grudgingly booted the groups and individuals who made that same sort of speech off.<p>I do agree that Facebook is given too much latitude, but there are pretty significant gaps. Facebook is <i>mostly</i> used for speech of a more mundane sort.')
