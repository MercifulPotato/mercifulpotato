I was ready to order the model that came out in May (with 32GB RAM) but then the rumour about ARM hit the internets so I kept waiting.<p>Now (I guess always?), it&#x27;s clear that Apple Silicon is not going to be a comfortable dev environment, at lest not for some and not for a while. JDK macos&#x2F;aarch64 port is still in dev and so is VS Code. Docker support is probably months away (looking at their roadmap no dev has even started) and when it arrives it&#x27;s almost certain to be limited to ARM linux images.<p>Still, hanging on to x86 on a Mac seems like a lost cause and I wonder if I should just change my approach. Rather than getting a beefy MBP, get the cheaper Air with M1 and a powerful MiniPC (NUC or similar) with native Linux. VS Code has a Remote Development (over SSH) feature, has anyone used it? Can it be combined with Docker (on Linux) in a seamless setup where the Air runs VS.Code and all devel happens on the MiniPC through remote coding? Is this setup going to work when VS Code macos&#x2F;aarch64 is out or is there something else one needs to wait for?')
