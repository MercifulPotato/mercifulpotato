If the largest problem was evaporation of some oils or something, the vacuum would likely exacerbate the problem (imagine someone vacuum sealing a carbonated drink thinking it would preserve the carbonation!).<p>In the end, though, I think most people discover that those pumps do help preserve the wine for significantly more time.')
