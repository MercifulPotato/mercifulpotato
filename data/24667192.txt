But I am curious what would the complete list be...<p>* heat (the most obvious one, not explicitly mentioned I guess?)<p>* even in healthy humans, some fatty acids are excreted with bile into the gut and subsequently removed via feces<p>* if you are fasting (or in ketosis, such as via keto diet) you will exhale &#x2F; sweat ketone bodies, which is a very ineffective way (energy balance wise) to use up fatty acids<p>* if you are a diabetic, you can excrete glucose in your urine; we have subsequently develop drugs that can help mimic this process as a diabetes treatment<p>* skin, hair and nails (very insignificant amounts)<p>* sperm &amp; menses<p>Anybody got anything else I am not currently thinking about?')
