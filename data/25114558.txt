I use the product regularly, but I hate doing so -- the experience is awful and the core information is rarely particularly helpful. But they still get me to come in because they have the most information about some places.<p>What really sets me off is how much &quot;moral&quot; crusading they do (eg- vs. Google) compared to how much shady stuff they do.
