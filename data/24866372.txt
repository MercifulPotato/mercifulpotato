I have a 150Mbit connection with a 1TB cap, but I can hardly touch 400GB at worst. I have a 4k TV that is definitely streaming 4k&#x2F;1080 content for 4-5 hours daily, our work laptops are always on, connected to VPN and almost always running a couple of RDPs. Phones are connected and syncing all pics and videos over to onedrive.<p>I&#x27;m out of ideas to increase my usage. The only way I can think of that would saturate a 1Gbit connection is if you are hosting websites and services from your home, which is definitely not the purpose for the Jio home connection.')
