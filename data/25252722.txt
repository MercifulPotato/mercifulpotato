Less educated people speak bad English, Swahili neutrally (everyone speaks it virtually all the time), and the native language very well.<p>Does being multilingual limit accentism? Not even a little.\nKenyans who know they can&#x27;t speak a word of Luhya&#x2F;Meru&#x2F;Kipsigis will think less of you if you speak English with a Luhya&#x2F;Meru or Kipsigis accent and actually will try to teach you how to speak in a less embarrassing way.')
