Item(by='ineedasername', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609464879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25598796, text='Technically yes, the same rules apply as if you were trading in any international currency. If you sell yen at a profit to convert to USD &amp; purchase something, you owe tax. What sort of tax can be complicated depending on how long the asset was held. I&#x27;m not an accountant, but I think assets held less than a year are taxed as personal income, so marginal rates apply. Assets held longer than a year are, I believe, taxed as regular capital gains.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what would&#x2F;should happen with extremely short term trades, i.e, you convert to Euros from USD for a vacation, the USD crashes, you convert back upon return from your vacation. I doubt the IRS worries too much about it, but I suppose technically you should file Form 8949 along with a Schedule D.')
