So switching to Navi would have alleviated the memory bandwidth bottleneck to some degree and improved performance.<p>It is a puzzling decision and perhaps the &quot;wasn&#x27;t ready when they taped out&quot; explanation is the correct one.  Cezanne seems to have been ready for a while now and just waiting for fab capacity - meaning it would have had to have been taped out in parallel with the RDNA2 architecture chips.  So a design flaw in RDNA2 might have blown the Cezanne launch.<p>They could have used RDNA1 though and it still would have improved compression over GCN&#x2F;Vega.  Or ported over just the delta compression.  I guess maybe they just wanted to port Zen3 over straight, use the memory controller they&#x27;d already proven with Renoir, and not take any risks?<p>It&#x27;s definitely puzzling and I haven&#x27;t heard an explanation I would consider 100% satisfactory.')
