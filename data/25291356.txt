Each new coin costs real money to mine, due to needing physical compute resource to do so, and it gets harder and harder overtime. That means as more and more people transact in Bitcoin, the demand for Bitcoins will go up, thus your Bitcoins are going to be worth more.<p>Similarly for Ethereum2, there&#x27;s not a fixed maximum, but there are set rates and limits that affect how much new Ether per year will be added. So there&#x27;s some guarantees that there&#x27;s a restricted supply. So again, if you believe that more and more people will rely on its network to transact, the demand for Ether will go up, thus its value.')
