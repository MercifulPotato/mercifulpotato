Examples include the Langda, the Malda and the Raspuri varieties. Quite different from one another and each with its own devoted following.<p>I found Mexican mangoes to be a pale imitation of the Indian varieties. Surprisingly, the best mangoes I have tasted in America were from two huge trees in the backyard of a place we were renting in Hawaii. The trees had shed hundreds of mangoes with hundreds more on the trees themselves, and then caretakers were only too happy to see us enjoy them. Made my Hawaii trip memorable!')
