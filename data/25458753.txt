Or is it caffeine (i.e. tea, etc.)?<p>I consume around 500-1000mg of caffeine a day (very carefully timed so as not to get jitters). I can&#x27;t handle a higher dose of Adderall XR, so I&#x27;ve embraced my higher caffeine intakes as a way to soothe the mind. That said, I don&#x27;t care for the flavor of coffee, so I typically consume it via Red Bull&#x2F;5hr&#x2F;tablet form.')
