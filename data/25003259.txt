Absentee and other mail ballots have always been allowed to arrive late in the majority of states. There just aren&#x27;t normally enough of them to make the difference in a close race like this one.<p>When I lived in California, it was common for military ballots to arrive up to two weeks after Election Day. That never mattered for the presidential race, but other races weren&#x27;t officially records until everything was counted.')
