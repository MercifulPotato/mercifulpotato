Most men, police officers, priests, white people, catholics, politicians, or Germans are actually nice people who wouldn&#x27;t harm anybody even if given the chance. A lot of the abuse that was done by these groups, be it towards women, ethnic minorities, children, or police brutality, was most likely done by somebody with strong dark personality traits. Not all crimes, but a surprisingly large amount. Exploring this condition, learning to recognize dark personality traits more reliably, knowing how to mitigate them, and maybe finding ways to help these suffering people is an important evolutionary step for us as a species. One way to see through their games and machinations is by looking at the facts.')
