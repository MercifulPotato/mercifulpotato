The more drug-tolerant cultures (such as the Netherlands and Portugal) have &quot;evolved&quot; an understanding of drugs culturally such that you don&#x27;t see a bunch of locals stoned out of their gourds in the coffeeshops all day. I hate the &quot;war on drugs&quot; and the terrible costs it has imposed, but I think that flipping the switch to <i>anything goes</i> is unlikely to end well.')
