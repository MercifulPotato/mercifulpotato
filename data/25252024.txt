(e.g. why did writing zeros to some magic register fixed the problem we observed? was it a hardware issue or a software issue in the kernel? without feedback from the vendor, such things are a lot harder to isolate and fix properly).<p>I agree about OSS thriving on major vendor hardware, it&#x27;s just that Apple is special in this case and intentionally makes it hard for the OSS community to provide support for their hardware.')
