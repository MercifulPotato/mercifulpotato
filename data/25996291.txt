Item(by='the_only_law', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612227699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25992782, text='I’m working on restoring a couple of old H.320 ISDN terminals and integrating them with something more modern. As part of this I’m building basically an entire ISDN stack including a software switch and H.320 multiplexer. Everything except the hardware (well, DAHDI is pissing me off rn, so I’m praying the non-Sangoma hardware I purchased is easier to set up). I have no idea how far I’ll get given the terminals are odd and mysterious in their own right and all the stuff is legacy and not really supported much anymore. Impossible to really monetize these days, but I plan on doing an extensive write up both of my analysis of the terminals hardware&#x2F;firmware as well as releasing my stack&#x2F;utilities under and open source license. I plan on it being extensive, but one step at a time. It’s starting to get difficult&#x2F;expensive to find some of the hardware I need and as I mentioned earlier these terminals are kinda odd and I’ve kinda sat on them for months with just a little reversing.<p>In the meantime since DAHDI is giving me so many issues and I’m waiting to receive some alternative hardware, I’ve been working on a very, very rough software simulation of  a.DS0&#x2F;DS1 interface so I can at least start developing the ISDN stack on something.')
