Instead of doing a view query in real-time it physically caches the results and has the same accessibility as a regular view.<p>They don&#x27;t solve all situations with expensive queries but they help a lot. The fact they behave like dynamic views means you can migrate a dynamic view to materialized if you run into performance issues without making changes to the client application. With views in general you can shuffle around tables and relationships without the client application knowing or caring.')
