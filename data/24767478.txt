Oddly enough, I have a friend in Clyde Hill (not Seattle, pretty good schools) who sends his daughter to private school in Queen Anne.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this is how people in South Seattle deal with living in South Seattle, or in downtown (e.g. capital hill), the schools really aren&#x27;t great there. The schools don&#x27;t get good until you hit Queen Anne, Magnolia, Ballard, Wallingford, Green Lake, north of UW (Roosevelt is where all the UW professors send their kids), but then they aren&#x27;t so great again in north (of 85th) Seattle (not as bad as South Seattle, however). I&#x27;m not sure how even the reputation of South Seattle is either; my cousins went to West Seattle high school and they had pretty good experiences.')
