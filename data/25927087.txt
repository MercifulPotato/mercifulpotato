That’s using a language that could hardly do anything 25 years ago. But it wasn’t OS-specific, so it beat its competitor,  VBScript, and later beat Applets and now Flash. I think the momentum that inspired V8 and development of great sandboxes, etc. was that JavaScript early on was fun for those that were creating their own webpages.<p>Tcl&#x2F;Tk wasn’t fun, and neither were Java’s AWT nor Swing. So, maybe that’s why they didn’t stay around.<p>However, JS isn’t that fun for me either, these days. Constantly learning to do it “correctly” takes a lot of effort.')
