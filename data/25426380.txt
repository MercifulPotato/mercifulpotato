Does looking on Stack Overflow for solutions to real life job problems count as cheating?<p>(That was a partly rhetorical question. My point is that what is considered cheating in the coding competition is pretty much normal in real life jobs. Somebody who knows to look for solutions on Stack Overflow, I call them &quot;resourceful&quot;, not cheater. Being resourceful is much more important in real life jobs.)')
