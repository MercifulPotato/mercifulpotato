Hospital collapse is the worst case scenario but isn’t the only goal. Other important goals include:<p>* keeping schools open (mostly a success)<p>* avoiding economic disruption (mixed, tending towards failure)<p>* avoiding unnecessary deaths and long run health issues (failure)<p>* Avoiding a second lockdown and the related uncertainty and stress (failure)<p>* returning to normal life (failure)<p>* avoiding dangerous mutations (failure)<p>The UK is an island and could have fairly easily done a NZ&#x2F;Australia strategy over the summer when seasonality made elimination easy. Jurisdictions that made that choice are doing better on all front.<p>I live in one such jurisdiction (atlantic canada) and we’ve spent less time in lockdown, had a good economy, and mostly avoided deaths and hospitalizations. Seems a clear winner.<p>Perhaps a country in the middle of europe couldn’t have done it but the Uk certainly could have.<p>And no, this pretty clearly shows govts had no long run or even medium run strategy. Europe will be in rolling lockdowns till april or so, because of a premature declaration of victory in the summer.')
