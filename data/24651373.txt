Pick a set of standards all cables&#x2F;monitors&#x2F;chargers&#x2F;etc. <i>must have</i> and a set of optional standards they <i>can have</i>. So any and all devices you get, all will be at least able to do A, B, and C, and if you need something to do X, Y, or Z, you can clearly see which devices and cables support those more niche needs.<p>Deciding what is a must have is the more tricky part. I personally think power is a must have. I think every charger and every cable should be able to charge every device. I think having a USB C charger, cable, and device, that it should not even be possible to plug it in and have it not charge because one of those three things does not support the other two.')
