I doubt it, people know what they want and don&#x27;t want when watching the video, and it would have been clear to the founder that people wanted it and he could&#x27;ve started building it after people expressed their demand. So in the end, even if he hadn&#x27;t made the full product, Dropbox would still be where it is today.')
