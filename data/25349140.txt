Place the laptop face down on a desk with the laptop&#x27;s screen hanging over the side of the desk.<p>3. Put a big heavy object on top of the laptop (I used a hug e book).<p>4. Plug in your peripherals and put them under your desk<p>5. lie down underneath your desk so you can see the monitor<p>6. rotate the display settings as necessary.<p>Advantages:<p>* lying on the floor is great for your back<p>Disadvantages:<p>* Make sure book is huge enough, otherwise laptop comes crashing down on your head.<p>* Monitor space is limited to a single laptop screen.<p>You may have fancier requirements that require a trip to the hardware store. OTOH, you might not.  the real trick here is I only need one small monitor to do my job.')
