In between, Pathan tribes on the then India side of the Durand Line kept the Brits out of their lands except for punitive expeditions. The Brits solved the problem of depredations  against ruled populations by garrisoning forts guarding against tribe X with recruits from tribe Y. In fact there was a dozen or so tribes. This policy also provided gainful employment for young men who otherwise would have resorted to brigandage against agricultural populations under the Raj.')
