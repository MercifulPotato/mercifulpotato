I am starting to feel it&#x27;s a burden, though, because I really feel that I have no life.<p>I can&#x27;t do multiple things... either focus on studying and studying alone (and get above average grades).. but basically end up like I am now -- friendless, with boring hobbies and interests and very lonely. Or focus on things that fill my life, and catastrophically mess up my education. And for the discipline I want to work in, I really need good grades (but also good social skills).<p>I also want to add that despite studying nearly 24&#x2F;7, and fully understanding every single concept (and much more!), I still manage to mess up in exams due to the lack of concentration (I.e. accidentally saw that plus as a minus, didn&#x27;t see that term, etc. Dumb things like that). (I need time to hyperfocus, and the exam durations don&#x27;t permit this)<p>I am still young, so this really worries me. I feel that I have basically wasted my teenage-hood, childhood, and now on the path of wasting my youth as well.')
