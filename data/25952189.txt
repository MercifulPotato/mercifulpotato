They&#x27;re targeting &quot;off-topic reviews&quot;.  ie. review bombing for topics outside of usual gameplay.<p>That might be inclusion of a pervasive anti-cheat, a poor comment made by a developer, or most recently a movie tie-in that included an offensive line.<p>These reviews are not removed but they stop contributing to the overall review score.')
