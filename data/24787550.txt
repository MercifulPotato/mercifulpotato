Clearly everybody wants to count Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. But some of the major incidents come from memetic circulation of fake news and racial hatred propaganda etc on Whatsapp. The Christchurch shooter (and others) were radicalised by 4&#x2F;8chan. Both he and Anders Breivik also cited racial hatred material produced by &quot;traditional&quot;, &quot;legitimate&quot; sources such as major newspapers.<p>(I wonder if anyone&#x27;s ever done an &quot;impact factor of evil&quot; analysis on the citation graphs of mass shooter manifestoes? Going all the way back to Kaczynski, T and beyond)<p>&gt; people should just pick up that phone and go out more<p>You&#x27;ve missed all the &quot;millenials NEVER answer the phone&quot; memes, then?<p>&gt; The opposite of social media today (election manipulation, divided societies, ethnic cleansing) is the state of affairs before social media, which wasn&#x27;t bad at all<p>My point is that <i>none of those are new</i>, it&#x27;s just that people struggle to recognise the warning patterns. Countries that were badly hit by SARS-COV were more attuned to the risks of SARS-COV-2. Countries that were badly hit by 20th century fascism are more attuned to the risks of 21st century fascism. Hence all the endless (somewhat fruitless) discussion about who counts as a Nazi and when it might be OK to punch them.<p>It&#x27;s not just the medium, we have to look at the messages. Can we ban certain messages without throwing out the medium?')
