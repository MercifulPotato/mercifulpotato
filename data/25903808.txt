I guess two comments on learn-anything -- is there an easy way for external users to add something? I get it&#x27;s open source but when you search for something, maybe a &quot;suggest resource&quot; would speed up curation of resources via human indexing.<p>The other big thing that would be helpful is a &quot;videos&quot; node where you could link to videos on the subject. A lot of people that I talk to struggle learning completely new topics just by reading. Some of the feedback I hear is that a few videos goes a long way to introducing something new, so a videos node could be useful in the overall graph.')
