I don&#x27;t care about tab size though or horizontal scrolling, for me the thing that bothers me about chrome is that it when middle clicking multiple tabs open, they just open somewhere in the tab list. and if I middle click to open another tab and then middle click a new link in that one, it gets pushed to a completely different spot entirely.<p>on FF, tabs open next to the current tab, unless you previously opened a tab in this one, then it&#x27;ll go to the end of the list of tabs you&#x27;ve opened from the current window. but as soon as you switch tabs once, it&#x27;ll start placing them next to the new tab you&#x27;re in again. chrome just does something entirely unpredictable, instead of &quot;resetting your spot&quot;.<p>but I&#x27;ve found that most people don&#x27;t really seem to browse the way I do&#x2F;don&#x27;t care about that')
