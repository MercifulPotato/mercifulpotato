These are people I know and work with on a daily basis. Part of knowing people is that you can tell when they&#x27;re not quite themselves.<p>I&#x27;ve also polled my team on a semi-regular basis throughout the last 8 months on their preferences going forward, which is how I know I have a range of preferences across the spectrum of WFH versus working from the office. We&#x27;ve always had a flexible approach in this area because of team has always been distributed, but one of the silver linings of the COVID cloud will, I hope, be a more general acceptance of increased flexibility in working conditions for jobs where that&#x27;s feasible.<p>Don&#x27;t you dare put words into my mouth.
