This would then indeed be sexism.<p>You can find the mirrored argument when it comes to male kindergarten teachers, for example. Ideally every male that wants to become one should be able to, but there won&#x27;t ever be 50% of the distribution because males (on average, as a population – not individually) don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to do this type of work.<p>My wife is a STEM scientist &#x2F; data-scientist with a background in economics. Much more of a numbers person than I am, better at calculation and numerical visualisation than I am. I&#x27;m a male who would much rather be a homemaker and take care of our kid and households.
