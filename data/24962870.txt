He&#x27;s not someone who&#x27;s written very little.<p>I think his fundamental problem is that he&#x27;s in a position that few writers end up in -- he became so popular that if he doesn&#x27;t end the book well he will be hated and reviled by thousands of people on the internet.  Most writers never end up in a position where if they let the public down, they will become hated figures.')
