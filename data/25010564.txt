Item(by='Jtsummers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604692445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25010322, text='&gt; In my (somewhat limited) experience the kind of value that you get from reducing technical debt is not easy to explain to the business side, because it doesn&#x27;t immediately translate into new features.<p>This is because, regardless of whether people agree on its definition, most of the things that fall under &quot;technical debt&quot; incur indirect or delayed costs for the business.<p>The managers have, at some point, a choice: We have $X. We can either spend some percentage on churning out products that directly and immediately make us money. Or we can divide it between that, and maintenance activities.<p>Choosing to neglect (or underfund) the maintenance activities doesn&#x27;t cost the business anything for some period of time (the delay). And performing them does not (within the period of that delay) bring in any revenue. It is <i>only</i> a cost to them, it has no visible upside within their time horizon. By the time the costs start catching up, it&#x27;s death by a thousand cuts. Usually they&#x27;ll go from 100&#x2F;0 dev&#x2F;maintenance to 99&#x2F;1, then 98&#x2F;2, and so on. Then one day it flips from 80&#x2F;20 to 20&#x2F;80 and they realized they fucked up. But by then they&#x27;ve been promoted, so who cares?<p>You have to convince them, and perhaps they&#x27;ll only learn by being burned (but I doubt it), that they should extend their time horizon by a month or a year so they can see the consequence of this decision. I&#x27;ve never succeeded in this.<p>At my previous job we were experiencing a <i>massive</i> number of retirements. Literally centuries of experience leaving every month (aggregated across all teams). No hiring process, without comprehensive training, could possibly keep up with this loss. But the retirements were always (for each team) just far enough over the horizon that they didn&#x27;t realize the issues until <i>after</i> the retirement and the new hire floundered (due to lack of training&#x2F;mentorship).')
