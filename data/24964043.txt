If it’s a matter of delivery capacity, R&amp;D, or something else.<p>At $60,000, it feels a little steep to me personally, but I would more than happily pay for the spectacle — like a movie theatre ticket price.<p>Besides that, I’ve always thought volumetric displays would be a good way to visualize information. If the display is large enough, it’s a much better way to view certain datasets. Combined with certain gesture recognition technologies, this really does feel like technology that could be welcome in conference rooms.<p>From a home entertainment, this reminds me of DVDs with multiple angles. Although it never was popular at the time, I think that it’d be awesome to watch a football game or play age of empires on such a display.')
