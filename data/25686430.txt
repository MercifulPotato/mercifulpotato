Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610123869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25685553, text='&gt; Please stop your unfounded ad hominem attacks<p>With an opening like this:<p>&gt; Can we just designate Russia as a rogue state and sanction the fuck out of them already?<p>I found my comment and question (which was as honest as possible) rather relevant and in no way an ad hominem attack. Based on <i>your comments</i> I highlighted the fact that it&#x27;s a biased opinion, thus on very shaky ground and open to be challenged. An opinion that follows people&#x2F;countries rather than actions&#x2F;facts is not worth the pixels it&#x27;s displayed with.<p>&gt; completely inpertinent to the question of holding Russia accountable for its actions on the world stage<p>You wave the &quot;whataboutism&quot; flag to get out of any pinch but refuse to accept it&#x27;s not whataboutism if it hits at your premise. The pertinent reason we can&#x27;t&#x2F;shouldn&#x27;t hold <i>one</i> country (as per your statement) accountable on the world stage is that we don&#x27;t plan on applying the same treatment fairly to everyone . This degrades the claimed intention of justice, and simply makes this look a blunt tool to be used by some countries against others in order to increase their power, legitimizing any attacks as &quot;defensive&quot; (&quot;They&#x27;re right to do it after being unfairly punished&quot;).<p>So it&#x27;s exactly what I said when you &quot;took it personally&quot;: we punish the country not the deeds, and this looks less like justice and more like something that justifies any response as defensive. Sure, you can punish selectively with the gun to everyone else&#x27;s head but it just further strengthens my point.<p>I stand by my challenge and if you feel that taking it personally or claiming whataboutism at every step helps your case feel free to do it.<p>And I&#x27;ll be clear on my position: all superpowers act the same to keep their power. Which is why none of them has to be allowed to get the upper hand over the others. With no checks and balances there&#x27;s no superpower that will act &quot;decently&quot;. At this point the US is the one on top of the pile trying to increase the distance. This makes me feel uneasy not because of the country (of the 3 I feel most comfortable with them there) but because of that &quot;too much power&quot; issue.')
