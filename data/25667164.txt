They never play the &quot;both sides are evil&quot; card when talking about cancel culture or Benghazi or Obama drone-strikes or BLM, both sides are only evil when Trump, Republicans or Conservatives are criticized (implying that any criticism of the right is simply hypocrisy or left-wing tribalism, and therefore invalid.)')
