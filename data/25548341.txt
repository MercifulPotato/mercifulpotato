Nothing stops you from having your cursors be implemented via a SQL offset under the hood.<p>2. You can have your cursors be base64 data, and embed a cursor version in the ID. You can use this to change how your pagination works without breaking clients during the transition period. (You&#x27;ll need to document+enforce a maximum validity for pagination tokens to do this successfully.)<p>3. You can encrypt your pagination tokens, so clients don&#x27;t get used to making assumptions about how your pagination works under the hood. (This isn&#x27;t security by obscurity, it&#x27;s just defending against Hyrum&#x27;s Law [1].)<p>It doesn&#x27;t cost you much to implement cursors early on, and unlike offsets they will grow with you across the evolution of your API.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hyrumslaw.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hyrumslaw.com&#x2F;</a>')
