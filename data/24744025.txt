It&#x27;s acoustic waves in a medium. Acoustic waves are adiobatic compression&#x2F;rarefaction waves.<p>All your examples are just sound. There&#x27;s no difference if the medium is all gas, all tennis balls, or a mixture of both along with some very confused corgis.<p>The medium, and whatever objects it exists as, are not sound itself. The notional particles of sound waves are called phonons.<p>Propagation of transverse waves in the electromagnetic field is what we call light, radio, and other electromagnetic radiation. There&#x27;s also constraints of symmetry for how the electric and magnetic portions of the field relate to each other. The notional particles of these waves are photons.<p>To address your last point, it would help to stop thinking of waves as platonic objects with their own independent existence as objects, and instead see them as patterns of activity&#x2F;interaction within ongoing dynamic systems.<p>All of your examples are simply sound. There&#x27;s no confusion in this. And yes the definition of sound still requires a medium.')
