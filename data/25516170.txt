People use it because everyone uses it - not because it&#x27;s especially good in any way.<p>Signal, Matrix etc are for idealists, who have a future vision of what the platform will develop into in mind.<p>My personal favourite is Telegram. It has a good mix of bots, API, native clients and channel management tools.')
