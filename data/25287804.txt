Consequently, the line from 0 to exp(ix) in the complex plane makes an angle of x radians with the real axis.<p>Any complex number can be written as an exponent like r<i></i><i>exp(ix), where x is the angle and r is the distance from the origin in the complex plane.  Using this understanding, we can interpret complex number multiplication as a rotation in the complex plane:<p><pre><code>    (a * exp(ix)) * (b * exp(iy)) = ab * exp(i (x+y))\n</code></pre>\nOk, the above was a digression, let&#x27;s get to the trig identities.  Let&#x27;s derive the double angle formula.  We can start with the point on the unit circle representing an angle of 2</i><i></i>x, and use Euler&#x27;s formula to simplify it one way:<p><pre><code>    exp(i*2x) = cos(2x) + i * sin(2x)\n</code></pre>\nOk, we can also use the fact that a^(bc) = (a^b)^c to write the same expression a different way, then FOIL it:<p><pre><code>    exp(i*2x) = [exp(i*x)]^2\n    = [cos(x) + i*sin(x)]^2\n    = [cos(x)]^2 + (i*i)*[sin(x)]^2 + 2i * cos(x) * sin(x)\n    = [cos(x)]^2 - [sin(x)]^2 + 2i * cos(x) * sin(x)\n</code></pre>\nNow, comparing the two expressions, we see that<p><pre><code>    cos(2x) + i * sin(2x) = [cos(x)]^2 - [sin(x)]^2 + 2i * cos(x) * sin(x)\n</code></pre>\nTaking real and imaginary parts of both sides, we find that:<p><pre><code>    cos(2x) = [cos(x)]^2 - [sin(x)]^2\n    sin(2x) = 2 * cos(x) * sin(x)\n</code></pre>\nThis works for most identities you want to derive, and there is a variation for things like cosh and sinh.  This trick came in handy on calc 3 exams whenever I couldn&#x27;t remember the silly trig identities that were required to perform integrals.')
