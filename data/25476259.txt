It never managed to get more than 10 meters from its lander though, I assume this was partly driven by the limitations on a human&#x27;s patience in operating a slow vehicle with 28 minute feedback loop.<p>One drawback of the remote A* approach is that you end up using more energy as the rover would have to be constantly communicating with its onboard antenna. Its relay satellites are only in range for a limited period each day. Fine grained maneuvers (like drive around that big rock to get to this small rock) would also prove difficult because of likely errors in the rover&#x27;s inertial-navigation system.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sojourner_(rover)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sojourner_(rover)</a>')
