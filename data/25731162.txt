I never heard of Bannon&#x27;s Twitter account being temporarily suspended in the past. Can&#x27;t find any source for it. It can&#x27;t be possible because this account was created post-pandemic (aka 2020). If you can point me to any source which confirms what you say I&#x27;ll be willing to change my stance that Twitter did give him a &quot;chance&quot; first. If you are talking about Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos account being banned then that is not the same as Bannon&#x27;s account (called War Room: Pandemic - Suspended account here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;WarRoomPandemic" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;WarRoomPandemic</a>).<p>The best part is that Bannon did not even put the video on Twitter but instead put it on Facebook. But still got suspended by Twitter. Whereas Kathy Griffin posted the photo and video of the photoshoot on Twitter and got a rap on her knuckles.<p><i>a) Twitter literally spent years fighting Daesh on their platform and you&#x27;re cluelessly trying to paint them as being in bed with them or something...</i><p>Yeah that is why they were sued for it right? Maybe you can tell the widow of the man who died because of an ISIS attack this logical reasoning. Let us see if she will be convinced with your reasoning.<p>That lawsuit was thrown out. You know why? Because of Section 230. Which surprisingly only applies to Big Tech. Not to small tech like Parler.<p><i>trying to paint them as being in bed with them or something...</i><p>Isn&#x27;t that what was done to Parler? Using the users posts to ban Parler from all platforms. <i>By trying to paint them as being in bed with them or something</i>. Section 230 was turned into a joke when it came to Parler. What is the use of Section 230 if a platform can be censored and banned nevertheless?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.business-humanrights.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest-news&#x2F;usa-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-against-twitter-for-allegedly-providing-material-support-to-islamic-state&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.business-humanrights.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest-news&#x2F;usa-judg...</a><p>&quot;A US judge...tossed out a lawsuit accusing Twitter of abetting terrorism by allowing Islamic State propaganda to be broadcast using the messaging platform.  District Court Judge William Orrick granted a motion by Twitter to dismiss the case, reasoning that providing a platform for speech is within the law and that the company did not create the content. The Communications Decency Act protects online platforms from being held responsible for what users post.&quot;')
