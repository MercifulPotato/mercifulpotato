The idea that someone <i>might</i> figure out a way to do a TLS downgrade attack and force someone over to the HTTP site is not justification for HTTPS only in those cases.<p>I love TLS. I think it&#x27;s the least worst system we have. But HTTPS <i>only</i> outside of it&#x27;s proper context does a lot of harm and it&#x27;s pointless. HTTP and HTTPS are two great tastes that go great together.')
