Item(by='oefrha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604129556, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24949581, text='TFA isn’t a big revelation, or a great angle.<p>But “Economic parity with whites” doesn’t mean sh﹡t when a racial group (edit: not even a racial group) is discriminated in college admissions, corporate leadership roles, etc., which are some of the most vital external decisions for upward mobility. (These are very widely documented so don’t ask me for citations. You can easily find hundred-comment-strong threads on these topics within this very site.) If anything it means the group has managed to “succeed” <i>despite</i> all the racial&#x2F;cultural roadblocks, and the efforts they put in are not proportionally repaid.<p>“Individuals who are in the process of achieving upward mobility” — that’s the actual myth. More like work as hard as you can, we’ll randomly select three out of ten to put into the pool of potential upward mobility with all fifty of that other group.<p>I know some people prefer equality of outcome and don’t feel the slightest shame about pushing down hardworking folks based on their ancestries if that’s what it takes to achieve a semblance of equality and diversity. I can’t have a productive conversation with those people. Actually, you know what, I’ve hardly ever seen anyone convincing anyone on this or any other divisive topic, so here’s my opinion, I don’t care what anyone thinks about it, and I’m not gonna further comment on this.')
