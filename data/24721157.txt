A sonic boom is a very temporary, very local, mechanical phenomenon. You cannot draw any conclusions from one to the other.<p>&gt; <i>tiny sonar noises a few hundred kilometers away</i><p>Sonar originates from within water, while sonic booms originate in the air. Most of the boom&#x27;s acoustic energy will probably be reflected by the transition from one medium to the other.<p>I think marine life will most likely be a lot less disturbed by sonic booms than by naturally occuring storms.')
