I&#x27;d add a few more: the wealthy invested more and more into the political system in the past 30-40 years, culiminating in the millions pouring in each year following Citizens United. They use their influence to co-opt government power, allowing them to use regulatory capture to fend off competitors, capture big government contracts from forever wars, and loosen regulations to benefit their own interests.<p>It&#x27;s a vicious cycle, and if we just use the benefits of a wealth tax to build a larger federal government, that apparatus will only be used against the poor&#x2F;middle class and for (most of) the wealthy. We have to redistribute this wealth back down to the individual and community level for it to have an effect, since it&#x27;s harder for ultra-wealthy to co-opt thousands of communities and millions of free-thinking individuals than to co-opt centralized gov power (although manufacturing consent can come into play here).')
