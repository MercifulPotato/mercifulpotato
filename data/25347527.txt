Item(by='mywittyname', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607445258, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334793, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true, and your information appears to be the result of doing Google searches on SEO&#x27;d tax and accounting law partnership pages.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely true.  You can give up to $15k a year to anyone.  If you gift more than that amount to certain people, you have to file Form 709 with the IRS.  Income taxes are due on the amounts after total lifetime gifts to a person exceed the lifetime exclusion limit, which is currently $11,700,000.  If married, these numbers are doubled, as each spouse may gift individually.<p>But even if none of this applied, you can find a list of exclusions right on the IRS website, which states:<p><pre><code>    Transfers Not Subject to the Gift Tax\n\n    Four types of transfers are not subject to the gift tax. These are:\n\n    Transfers to political organizations,\n\n    Transfers to certain exempt organizations,\n\n    ***Payments that qualify for the educational exclusion, and***\n\n    Payments that qualify for the medical exclusion.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not some &quot;temporarily embarrassed millionaire&quot; making shit up from a Google search.  I have family to whom I gift money, which means I file this form every year.  Congress is full of a bunch of wealthy elites looking out for their own interests.  Thus, gifting money tax-free is not difficult, at all.<p>Also, I&#x27;m pretty left leaning.  My shitting on the state for mismanagement of (and outright lies on the use of) lottery funds is because I want them to be held accountable and live up to their promise.')
