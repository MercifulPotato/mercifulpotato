Support for JS projects is pretty much best in class (Though jetbrains&#x2F;webstorm is decent too).<p>Support for other languages like go, rust, C# (.Net Core) are pretty decent.  The extensions&#x2F;marketplace is incredible in terms of the breadth and depth of support for almost anything you can think of.  I even have an enviornment setup with a settings file defaulting to CP437, where I use SSH remote extension in code to configure a remote telnet BBS.<p>Beyond all of this, it&#x27;s relatively quick to load and run, though there are faster editors, I haven&#x27;t seen a (much) faster IDE really.<p>The remote ssh extension is probably the third killer feature for me.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of mileage out of those three things alone.  I don&#x27;t use some of the other features nearly as much as I rely on the console a lot, and the integrated terminal just makes it in the box as an experience.')
