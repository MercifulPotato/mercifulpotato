An app to rate people&#x27;s attractiveness, laughing in chat logs that people would trust him with their personal information, etc. Combined with the externalities and immense power they now have, it&#x27;s not a great look.<p>However, I agree that he&#x27;s probably a better person than most give him credit for, and I think he&#x27;s really stuck between a rock and a hard place on a lot of these issues. Especially things relating to politics, mis&#x2F;disinformation, and free speech. I consider the proliferation of non-paid online services (who therefore can only survive by making money in other ways) the true bane of humanity; not any particular executive. (That said, I&#x27;m also not going to let anyone off the hook once they deliberately choose to create such a service.)<p>I had a high opinion of Bezos until the disclosure of Amazon&#x27;s poor working conditions. His making the minimum wage for workers $15&#x2F;hour is a good step, but I think they&#x27;re going to need to do a lot more before that reputation changes. Other than that, I admire him.<p>Dorsey seems to be the least hated of the bunch, and I like him, personally. He seems like he still has a kind of hacker mindset, and I believe he genuinely wants to make Twitter a force for good in the world. I&#x27;m not sure if he&#x27;ll be able to accomplish it, though.')
