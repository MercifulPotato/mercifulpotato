Yes, there are some managers and executives who are just jerks. And there are a few perverse incentives around that are worth keeping in mind. But if you go into a job with this level of bitterness, you&#x27;re likely to just create the same situation that you were complaining about.<p>If you assume starting out that all managers are corrupt fools who only care about promoting themselves and their executive golf buddies, that comes through in every interaction you have with them. They&#x27;re certainly not more likely to be your partner in advancing your own career and growing the business through delivering genuine value to customers when you&#x27;re carrying that big of a chip on your shoulder.')
