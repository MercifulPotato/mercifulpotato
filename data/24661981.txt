What would be your thoughts if you are consistently fined but your neighbor is simply ignored for the same offense.<p>&gt; I hope that, if nothing else, it leads to law and order becoming a major election issue<p>Ofcourse that is the entire story. There is no desire to change the system. For argument sake this will lead to the change in Government, what will change with that? Bringing back SP and Congress will improve the system? UP under SP was a horrible place. \nThese 2 parties have destroy UP over the years. Land of poets is now land of petty criminals.<p>And if this is the intention why spare Rajasthan and Kerala? Change their government also for the same reason. We will be changing Government every other day.<p>Once again I am not against outrage I am against using rape for political gain. But seems like you are ok with it.')
