When I run a rails new command, I can setup my postgres connection, nodejs and webpack libraries, rails core library in one command. Rails has database migrations with conventions i like - the timestamp and a file name that represents the action to be performed against the database (e.g. AddNameToBlogs) which that can also be rolled back.<p>I also really like the Rails restful router which is strongly tied to its controllers.<p>I could go on. I really like that Rails gives me strong, opinionated conventions but also allows me to configure things to be liking if needed.<p>I want to love .net core - I really like F#. Any other rails dev out there make the transition to .net core?')
