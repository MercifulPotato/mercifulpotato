You always had to read past it, if you chose to read at all.  Some very good content wrapped in editorial offal.  Made for a few good laughs if you were in on it.<p>It came out harder (to the point of abuse) on Trump because Trump is from NYC (big plus), major player in revitalization of Manhattan (big plus), big in pop media industry (umm, sort of plus) but was everything the UWS wasn’t (how <i>dare</i> that Republican Queens lowlife).  If there ever was a use case for the word “intersectionality”, it would be the NYT view of Donald.  And the NYT didn’t navigate those choppy seas well.')
