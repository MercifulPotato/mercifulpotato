Pateron has the worst UX of any platform I regularly use.<p>Sign up to be a pateron of some artist to download their works. Your only way to do this is to scroll through the list of all their posts one at a time in an endless scroll. And to add insult to injury the page will crash and you have to start over from the top of the scroll, there is no way to start 50 or 100 posts in.<p>For artists offering media via pateron a good UX might be something like Mega.')
