Shouldn&#x27;t you be ashamed with yourself for having used the word? What about all the people whose children&#x27;s lives have been destroyed by meth? Shouldn&#x27;t you delete your comment?<p>Also can you please link me to a study that shows a causal link between names of apps, and an increase in usage in that drug the app is named after?<p>And then one that shows an increase in usage in a different drug (because again, amphetamine is not meth)?<p>I&#x27;d really, really like to read that study.<p>Presumably you want to ban WINE too, because of all the people who know someone who was an alcoholic? Have you written to the WINE maintainers telling them how evil they are?')
