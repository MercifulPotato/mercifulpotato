Item(by='User23', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607610310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25370117, text='I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but thankfully the constitution is actually a pretty easy read from the originalist perspective that now has significant influence on the court and in this case I don&#x27;t need to worry about case law and so on, so I&#x27;m comfortable speculating a bit.<p>Here&#x27;s the relevant text: &quot;Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.&quot;<p>This means that the legislatures of the state have total and exclusive power over the manner in which their electors are chosen. Plainly read, no other body, including that state&#x27;s judiciary or executive, has the power to direct how electors are chosen. This power is so broad the state could select electors by lottery, or even a poll on hackernews and it wouldn&#x27;t be subject to any oversight other than a constitutional amendment.<p>So, you can see that this isn&#x27;t about a state following its own laws, it&#x27;s about a state following the constitution. Since the constitution is a pact between the fifty sovereign states, like any other binding pact when another party doesn&#x27;t follow the rules of the pact they can be sued in the appropriate venue which is the Supreme Court of the United States, or otherwise acted against. Let us hope it doesn&#x27;t come to the otherwise option anytime soon, because the last time was a real mess.<p>I think the best, if not necessarily the most likely outcome, is that the court orders the lawbreaking states to fix things, which is as simple as calling a special legislative section and passing a resolution selecting a slate of electors. Presumably states with Democratic legislatures will pick Biden and those with Republican legislatures will pick Trump, but no matter what it will be up to the democratically elected legislatures of the state in question, which in a sane world would be acceptable to both sides.')
