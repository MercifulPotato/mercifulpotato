The telemetry data is handled <i>extremely</i> carefully.  Any downstream use of that data is also carefully managed so that creating re-identifiable data is not possible.<p>Could Mozilla reidentify people with raw telemetry - sure.  Is it easy or done in practice - no.  Shut the hell up unless you know better than someone who has handled that data.<p>Seriously folks - Mozilla has problems - but proper handling of your private data is not one of them.')
