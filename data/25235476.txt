I’m sure it’s a great product too.  The thing that bothers me about e-bikes in the US specifically is that we seem to be rediscovering scooters but worse.<p>Among other things I am a motorcycle rider.  I took the class.  Before the pandemic I commuted on a 1970 Honda CB450.  I know the risks, and the rules.<p>These are mopeds at <i>best</i>.  Electric motorcycles at <i>worst</i>.  Europe and especially Asia already understand the benefits of scooters and traffic understands they exist.  Taiepi even has special striping at lights to make scooter filtering safe and easy!<p>I am optimistic that these kinds of devices will get more people on two-wheeled personal transportation but I’m concerned about the people going 30mph on bike paths or riding in the road with no education.<p>Tangentially I’m disappointed that electric drive has translated to “no rules” on roads and bike paths.  If I ride a 1980 Yamaha moped on a bike path people will look at me like I’m a maniac but I can go 50% faster on a bicycle and nobody seems to care.')
