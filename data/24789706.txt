So I can easily write a GUI for my script in a few lines, or draw some crap on screen, out of the box without the bureaucracy or FFI business you&#x27;d need to do these things in Python or some other high level language.<p>In other words I&#x27;d like there to be a concept of OS-level &quot;system features&quot; available to high level languages through something a little more friendly and robust than interfacing to a C library. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d implement it :) but its how I&#x27;d like things to be.')
