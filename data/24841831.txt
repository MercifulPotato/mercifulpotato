The &quot;join&quot; provides your synchronization point.<p>If you have a complicated set of highly-synchronous calculations, then you don&#x27;t fork at all. You simply use the &quot;Single Thread&quot; to perform all those calculations (and therefore negate the need of cross-thread synchronization).<p>Fork-join has low-utilization, but its very easy to program. In some cases, fork-join remains efficient (ex: spawn a thread per pixel on the screen), because all pixels do NOT need to synchronize with each other (or call mutexes).<p>-----<p>If a sync point within the children are needed, you usually make due with a barrier instead of a mutex.')
