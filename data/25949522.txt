The page layout options could use a bit more work:<p>1. It initially defaults to showing two facing pages per screen, but the selector shows &quot;Read a chapter as a long scrolled page&quot; as selected. &quot;Fit 2 page side by side in window&quot; is the same and is presumably the actual default. Switching back to &quot;long scrolled page&quot; from that does do what you&#x27;d expect. This is fullscreen on a 1920x1080 desktop display.<p>2. I personally dislike side-by-side views - I find them distracting - but at this size the line length for &quot;long scrolled page&quot; is too long for readability. I&#x27;d prefer a &quot;long scrolled page but with shorter lines and bigger margins&quot; option, like Firefox&#x27;s reader view.')
