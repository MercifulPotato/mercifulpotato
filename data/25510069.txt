Microsoft, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t require their paid service to use cloud saves, but they&#x27;re more tightly integrated into the system (likely because they&#x27;re available to all users).<p>It sucks because the X360&#x2F;PS3&#x2F;Wii generation of consoles supported saving &amp; loading games off of external commodity storage (the X360 supported any USB drive, the Wii SD cards, and the PS3 both, if you had one of the earlier units with a SD card slot), but that was disabled as it became clear that save games could be used to jailbreak the systems and install bootloaders&#x2F;firmware that disabled DRM.')
