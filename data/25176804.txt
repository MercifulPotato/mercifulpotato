But that doesn&#x27;t change my larger point - that human society has often (and continues to, in much of the world) stifle women&#x27;s sexuality does not significantly change my point that human libido is different from that of most mammals.<p>Most mammals don&#x27;t have the kind of social structures that could systematically suppress a natural desire. Even if they did, it remains true that the lack of libido affects both females and males in most mammals, it&#x27;s not limited to some individuals.<p>And promiscuity, at the very least for men, has been a constant throughout human history and around the world, with very few exceptions. The same is true of homosexuality by the way, another form of sexual enjoyment and bonding that is extremely rare among most mammals, while being relatively common in humans.<p>By the way, our closest extant cousin species, bonobos, also behave much more like humans in terms of sexuality than even other apes do. They obviously do have sex only for the sake of enjoyment, and the difference in sexual behavior is stark compared to something like wolves.')
