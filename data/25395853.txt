I plan to return to Zig when it matures a bit more. I get my dose of FP when I program in J or APL. I use them for very mathy and fun things, and I don&#x27;t even think about FP; they are FP. I am working my way through an 11-page paper that implements a CNN in APL in 10 functions that amounts to 10 lines of APL, 1 function per line [1]. Amazing and simpler than my stabs at Haskell and Idris or Scala and F#.<p>[1]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3315454.3329960?download=false" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3315454.3329960?download=...</a>')
