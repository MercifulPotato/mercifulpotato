We used the material provided by this course [1]. It worked out very well for us.<p>We took a little detour at one point and I taught her basic skills to navigate around Linux terminal. Files, directories, editors, basic operational stuff.<p>Then I took another little detour and showed her ropes on git and github.<p>Then we got back to the python course and now I encouraged her to push everything she practices on her github account which she has been doing since.<p>Now that the course is over, we have started working on a project that aims to manage personal income tax. I chose that project because it could start simple and can evolve to be as complex as you want it to be. However, ultimately it is all simple arithmetic. The project is going very well so far. We are discovering new things about taxation almost every single day.<p>We are at a stage where learning vim would really help her so we plan to take another detour next week and start with a vim tutorial until she gets comfortable.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.uis.cam.ac.uk&#x2F;service&#x2F;support&#x2F;training&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;course-files&#x2F;programming-student-files&#x2F;python-courses&#x2F;pythonab" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.uis.cam.ac.uk&#x2F;service&#x2F;support&#x2F;training&#x2F;download...</a>')
