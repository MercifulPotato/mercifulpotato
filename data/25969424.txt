There is no way one can tell from this set of information if the FAA is right or wrong, or if SpaceX is right or wrong.<p>That being said I have a problem with your comment. You are talking about that the rocket exploded as if it was of consequence. You even capitalise it. Why do you think it matters?<p>Safety of a test is about the process, not the outcome. You might have a bonkers unsafe test and come out lucky. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the test was a good idea or safe.<p>Or you might have the worst of luck, a complete explosive failure, and still everyone remains safe because the processes were right.<p>I don&#x27;t know if the FAA is right or wrong. I don&#x27;t know if the processes of SpaceX were safe or unsafe, but I know one thing. From the fact that it &quot;EXPLODED&quot; but hasn&#x27;t hurt anyone or caused any 3rd party property damage you can&#x27;t  draw any conclusions about the safety.')
