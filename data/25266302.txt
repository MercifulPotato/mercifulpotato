Welfare schemes don&#x27;t work, period. 99% money ends up in a politician&#x27;s bank. Disinvestment is a necessity. Government-owned institutions provide sub-par service and are a huge money drain of taxpayer money. I live in a tier 2 city and get daily power cuts for hours. And then the &quot;public  servants&quot; have the gall to screw up the power transformer for 30 hours after making thousands of millions of loss. Not acceptable anymore.<p>Idk the populist government is finally bringing on some unpopular policies to reduce tax wastage and the detractors are up in arms. Timing is horrible, I&#x27;ll give you that.')
