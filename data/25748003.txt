It&#x27;s barely more sensical than the one that Parler is a free speech zone.<p>The reason for the Amazon ban is not the simple fact that Parler had people making threats. Per Amazon&#x27;s email to Parler, it&#x27;s that they had seen an on-going escalation of credible (much more so than the two tweets you linked) incitements to violence, Parler had a history of dragging its feet about responding to specific complaints about infringing content, Parler failed to furnish a tenable plan for how to implement an effective content moderation policy, and public communication by executives indicated that they had no good-faith intent to do so.<p>Furthermore, while I agree that Twitter doesn&#x27;t do as great a job at stuff like this as one would like, either, this is just a really ill-chosen place for Parler&#x27;s supporters to try and make their stand. The cast iron pot does not help its case by calling the steel kettle black.')
