That helps in a lot of places in life (like the principles mentioned if you choose so might help someone while for others that&#x27;s not needed). Or writing down what I ate (sorry I really can&#x27;t keep track of how many grams of carbs are in each of the things I eat and since I no longer do keto, which is easy to keep track of in rour head but only try to minimize carbs I need the written help).<p>But I don&#x27;t see value in trying to measure how much better I did with not jumping to conclusions (which I see on the list he has in the article and I also keep an eye on this personally). But I don&#x27;t think you need an OKR and try to make it measurable. I just need to consciously decide that I will keep a more open mind and inquire a few more times on whether I understood correctly and that the other person probably meant it in a good way. However badly formulated it was and how it came across. Then every time &quot;something happens&quot; and I handle it better than last time I can recognize that and pat myself on the back. Or recognize after that it all fell apart and I &quot;judged back at them&quot; and it spiraled out of control. Try to do better next time. Do I need to graph this and look at it and get myself down because I didn&#x27;t do as well as I wanted to?<p>OKRs are meant to set goals that are somewhat unachievable. Like hitting 70% on your target is awesome. Sorry but I don&#x27;t work that way. I&#x27;m not deadline driven. I&#x27;m task driven. I know I&#x27;m in a minority in that but if you give me an unachievable deadline in order to try to get me to deliver at the date you secretly thought was the real goal post then it&#x27;s just gonna frustrate me and when I see you not using my results for another month or so because that was the real goal post then I&#x27;ll definitely not give it my best next time. I can be selective that way.<p>As a task oriented person I just do whatever needs doing and do it in priority order in the best and fastest fashion I can. If your deadline is in two weeks but I got nothing higher prio I&#x27;ll deliver early by a week instead of procrastinating and then doing an all nighter to get it to you when the deadline is. I really really detest these deadlines people put. I just recently purposefully didn&#x27;t push back on a stupid deadline and just gave way subpar results (I had 15 minutes with the team in between two other meetings for something where we should have spent about an hour to discuss properly. And I purposefully kept that time box very very well). You know what? They accepted and loved the results. Had they just put a reasonable deadline that took into account our sprint start and end times as well as the internal hackathon happening that week...<p>Did I mention I turned in my master thesis a week before the deadline?')
