Why did they simply follow the explicit procedures of the CoC rather than stopping to question if what they were doing was the right thing to do?<p>It&#x27;s good that they blindly applied their CoC in a case where it&#x27;s clear-cut that it&#x27;s bad, since it revealed the problems with the CoC. If they chose not to enforce it in this instance, then when a more political issue inevitably came up down the road, a similar bad result may have happened but without the backlash necessary to fix it.')
