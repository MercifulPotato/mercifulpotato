Item(by='emidln', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608574088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25497300, text='&gt; The real problem is the demand for college is enormous because it&#x27;s the only way to a semi-decent living these days.<p>There are well-paying jobs that don&#x27;t require a university degree. Skilled trade jobs exist and are in high demand. Tech careers with IT, networking, software, and hardware exist for those that put in the time, whether that time is on school grounds or at home.<p>I&#x27;ve known (and currently work with) professional programmers, sysadmins, network engineers, designers, and hardware engineers who don&#x27;t have formal credentials. All of these people are making six figures in US dollars outside the bay area. They&#x27;ve all put in the time in their domain and in speaking with any of them their expertise is evident.<p>A major factor in learning these skills is available dedicated time. Middle&#x2F;Upper-Middle&#x2F;Upper class kids who are interested in tech can often find available free time to read books, tinker, and acquire hardware&#x2F;resources (whether through their parents buying it or by tracking down cheap&#x2F;free hardware (more of a time cost)). The less financially stable a family is, the higher the likelihood that there won&#x27;t be free time available for academic endeavors and will instead be filled with finding a job to help pay for food&#x2F;shelter&#x2F;clothes for themselves and their family. Going to college provides a structured place where dedicated study is expected (and paid for via scholarship or loans). This is an escape hatch for students who didn&#x27;t have the same opportunities.')
