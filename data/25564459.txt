For my most recent project (sci.chat), it took me a total of three weeks from starting to get my first customer. They came through a reddit post. For other projects I&#x27;ve made, I&#x27;ve gotten zero customers after months of effort. In my experience, relying on organic growth instead of &quot;going viral&quot; attempts has worked out a lot better.')
