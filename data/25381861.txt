There&#x27;s a route that I and everyone else I&#x27;ve spoken to all run a certain way and improvements have not been incorporated into the route planning. On this particular route if you run the apartments when ORION wants you to then you&#x27;ll arrive there after Amazon and FedEx have filled the parcel lockers with their delivery volume, and you&#x27;ll spend an hour delivering your volume to each individual apartment door. On this route you need to deliver certain dense and volume-heavy areas before your pickups so that you&#x27;ll have enough room to fit the pickups into the vehicle. I would <i>love</i> to see ORION automatically learn about when streets and such are added, removed, or otherwise changed, but that&#x27;s a manual process. I can ask the dispatcher about what you&#x27;re talking about, but as a driver I have seen no such behavior.')
