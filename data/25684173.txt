This results in SymPy (and friends) demanding that users abandon hundreds of years of math notation, to conform to the whims of a programming language.<p>In SymPy you do M.diagonalize(), which makes no sense. The matrix M does not have a property diagonalize. Rather, you should apply a choosen diagonalization algorithm like Diagonalize(M) to produce a new matrix.<p>Mathematica wins, and will continue to win, because the language is functional and conforms to how Mathematicians think, rather than how (EDIT: certain) programmers like to code.')
