Nice try but you’re a bad actor and you know it. Actual instances of fraud that have been found have been dealt with and surprise, they didn’t change the outcome of this election. If you truly believe that there is massive voter fraud on an unprecedented scale you are quite literally refusing to live in reality and nobody can help you now.<p>My point is quite clearly that not only are the allegations being made about the election results being invalid are absurd but that even if you accept parts of it unless you accept all of it it doesn’t even have an impact on the outcome.')
