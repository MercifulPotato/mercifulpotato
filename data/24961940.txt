The proposed specification was strictly opposed by other browser vendors, with Safari stating that they will not ever consider implementing them in the current state [1].<p>Chrome not only shipped it enabled by default, but refused to bring it back under a flag because &quot;is used on about ~.8% of page loads in Chrome now&quot; [1] (safe to assume, all of them are Google users and users of Google-developed libraries).<p>It&#x27;s the most recent example (also backed up by numbers provided by Google themselves). I won&#x27;t even mention the plethora of standards that other browser vendors consider harmful, but are enabled by default in Google.<p>So yes, Google is only concerned by the cost to Chrome, never by the costs or benefits to other users of the web platform.<p>&gt;  it looks like the process of discussion does not exist at WhatWG anymore, and that Google basically dictates terms.<p>That is true. The standards process (both w3c&#x2F;whatwg <i>and</i> tc39) is hijacked by the same 3-4 people from Google, and decisions are rammed through irregardless of anyone.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WICG&#x2F;construct-stylesheets&#x2F;issues&#x2F;45#issuecomment-521096423" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WICG&#x2F;construct-stylesheets&#x2F;issues&#x2F;45#issu...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WICG&#x2F;construct-stylesheets&#x2F;issues&#x2F;45#issuecomment-577781329" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WICG&#x2F;construct-stylesheets&#x2F;issues&#x2F;45#issu...</a>')
