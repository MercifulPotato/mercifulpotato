I don&#x27;t recall how the site was transferred to the server, but I definitely had the capability of doing so directly via modem and a dial-up shell account.<p>The family cookbook was created in HyperCard on a Macintosh SE, and later an SE&#x2F;30.  Some additional code was added to generate HTML files, which were then uploaded to the server via FTP.<p>The academic sites were created using an HTML pre-processor, possibly on an iMac G3 running NetBSD (though I did have several vintage Macs running NetBSD at the time).<p>I made some interesting choices back then, including using a Mac IIci to access the Internet via a cable modem.  But the choices were either spend my money on an interesting hobby or spend it save up for a boring new computer.  Clearly, I choose the former and eventually ended up with the latter.')
