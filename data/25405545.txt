I&#x27;ve said a few times.<p>My father was on the DARPA side of the AlohaNet development and eventually moved out of network engineeing into software engineering within DoD.  I had a discussion with him (probably 15-20 years ago?) about switched ethernet (years after he moved out of the networking space, so was no longer an area he kept up with), and he was said something along the lines of &quot;what do you mean there are no collisions?  the whole point of ethernet is dealing with collisions!  if we didn&#x27;t have to deal with collisions, LANs would have been easy!&quot;.')
