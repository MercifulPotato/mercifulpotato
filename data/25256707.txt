This[0] was pretty fun to see. Not the best example of his instructional videos.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;chess&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k34chd&#x2F;exactly_just_like_i_said&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;chess&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k34chd&#x2F;exactly_just_...</a><p>GM Daniel Naroditsky&#x27;s channel[1] is the best instructional I have seen. His speedrun series is very good. He takes the time to stop and explain his thought process while playing the game. And then after few games he does a deeper analysis and answer any questions. The moment that sold me was when he showed how they use chess engine to do preparations at their rating level.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;DanielNaroditskyGM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;DanielNaroditskyGM</a><p>On a side note, I have been working on a bughouse[2] chess web app in my spare time[3]. It&#x27;s not ready for HN traffic yet though. Bughouse is not getting a Queen&#x27;s Gambit anytime soon. But I would love to see more steam behind online bughouse as well. It is my favorite variation. The need for team work and communication makes it very lively.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bughouse_chess" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bughouse_chess</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;utopia.buddychess.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;utopia.buddychess.com&#x2F;</a>')
