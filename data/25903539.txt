Ethiopian and Lion Air deserve a non-zero percentage of the blame for “mass murder.” That percentage is debatable. As a commercial pilot (who doesn’t fly 737s) and someone with close friends who are 737 captains for a major US carrier, my opinion is that the airplane itself was not the core problem. The design of the airplane was such that it enhanced the glaring deficiencies in pilot training and maintenance practices.')
