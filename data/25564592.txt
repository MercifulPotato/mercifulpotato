They are interested in it, so if it seems easy and fun you should do it, I’m sure there are jobs out there writing game testing bots.<p>That said, it would be wise to assume that if you have not heard much about this and wondered why, the answer is probably that it’s harder than you think.<p>Having been a game lead for a decade, I can safely say that getting game telemetry into the test bots is not the hardest part of the job, it’s one of the easiest things to do. One example of something much more difficult would be testing the game while it changes. Don’t forget that writing a cheat bot for a game that’s done is nothing like testing games that are in development and changing every day.')
