While these scripts explain your <i>intention</i> well, they are a bit of a hassle to work with <i>internally</i> since the language is so rich. We therefore wanted (what we&#x27;ve called) <i>an effect format</i>. The effect format would explain what actually happened when applying the transaction: &quot;Set karma to 183&quot;. Mendoza is what we ended up with. The Mendoza patches are much easier to work with from a decoder&#x27;s point of view.<p>As a side effect, we&#x27;ve also been able to use the Mendoza format for tracking changes in documents. The JavaScript implementation supports replaying the patches while maintaining information about where each part of the document was introduced. We use this in our Review Changes feature so that you&#x27;re able to see exactly who introduced a change (in a JSON document!): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sanity.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;review-changes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sanity.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;review-changes</a>')
