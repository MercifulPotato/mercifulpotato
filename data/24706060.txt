The challenge that this rule also creates is that there are people in this country who have a spot in the green card line based on the US government approving their petition who have to provide their H1B worthiness every 3 years. Those people now get weeded out. That green card queue is country based. So a Norwegian person who wasnt qualified for the H1B under the new rules already has a green card, but an Indian person is now going to get locked out. This is discrimination based on country of origin, which should be illegal but unfortunately isnt for immigration law.')
