If you are just looking at wealth at age 25, people working in fast food made better choices than doctors. Yet somehow, 10 years later, the doctors are ahead.<p>Clearly that is an extreme example, but it illustrates the point - getting a paying job quickly does not mean it is the best answer for long-term salary and career growth. Getting any old coding job just to get one is not the same thing as getting the full education that comes from a degree. That doesn&#x27;t make it the wrong answer... getting a job matters. But if you are comparing long-term outcomes, you need to look at it with more context.')
