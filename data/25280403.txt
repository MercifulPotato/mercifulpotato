It causes all sorts of headaches for them. They encourage using containerd for infrastructure projects (which is basically the core of original docker extracted out as a sperate project maintained by a large community). Docker is basically an opiononated wrapper around containerd, and they intend to move even more in that direction in the future.<p>TLDR: Docker Inc almost certainly is happy to see this change happen.')
