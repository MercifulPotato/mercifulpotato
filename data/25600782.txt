Or, at least the only one who can solve it a) in a reasonable time frame and b) without creating multiple other problems?<p>I&#x27;ve been in those situations before - not all the time, but it&#x27;s happened.  First time I sort of liked it - seemed like a bit of &#x27;prestige&#x27;.  But then ... I took a 3 day vacation.  Flew hours away.  Checked in to hotel.  Light on the phone in the room was beeping with a message to call the office, because there was a bug no one could figure out.  Even though I was at a &#x27;big company&#x27;, I was (literally) the only person on the project, and couldn&#x27;t have 6 hours away without the world crashing down.  Really poor management on everyone&#x27;s part.<p>I&#x27;ve been in a couple other situations since then where I&#x27;m the only person who can do X, and I recognize it, and lobby for someone else to be able to step in.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve also had a couple of situations with competent team mates who all started before me, and had a wide diverse set of skills, supported each other, and I was not expected to be some sort of &#x27;superhero&#x27;.  I appreciated those environments more as an older person who&#x27;s previously experienced the &#x27;superhero&#x27; environments.<p>These &quot;many other people can do what you do&quot; teams I&#x27;ve been a part of have been nice, but also comparatively rare.')
