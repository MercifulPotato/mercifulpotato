Low traction seemed to be a combination of the following related problems:<p>1) ROI for the platform&#x27;s premium was not worth it, due to...    \n2) lack of must-have apps, due to...   \n3) poor ratio of difficulty designing a great user experience vs low number of outfits trying to build that software, due to ...  \n4) fragmentation in technology (AR &amp; VR) which results in different user experience in each platform, and low rates of adoption especially given dispersion over different platforms, consequently there was far less financial motivation for a company to invest long term resources.<p>With VR&#x2F;AR, the obvious killer app is 3D model generation, because you could turn efficient workflows into money, but the amount of effort that has been thrown into desktop publishing is so much that the bar for a VR&#x2F;AR app to get over is very, very high. If your audience is professional 3d modelers. The mouse is such an excellent precision instrument, it&#x27;s going to be a long time before we have a 6 degree-of-freedom input device that can match it for precision and ease of long term use. The existing CAD companies with funds sit on large portfolios of software, and a fantastic VR&#x2F;AR experience would devalue them, so they don&#x27;t have a lot of motivation.<p>Long story short, it&#x27;s going to take longer than the PC revolution, because the adoption-conformity numbers are not as good. I&#x27;d guess another ten years?')
