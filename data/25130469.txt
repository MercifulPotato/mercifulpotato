The issue is that R&amp;W made their system powerful enough that it&#x27;s also incomplete, due to the fact that their system contains smartass statements like G that are hell-bent on creating paradoxes if given the chance.<p>Before Godel&#x27;s time, people just didn&#x27;t have enough experience with computers to realize that you have to deal with code injection attacks every time you try to build a powerful platform of any kind. In this case, Godel Numbering is the hack that allows code injection into a formal system that&#x27;s supposed to just be highly insightful about properties of the infinite world of natural numbers.')
