Source routing was possible for a while, but got strongly deprecated due to security.<p>DNS is a singular centralized namespace.<p>HTTP(s) bakes an authoritative server into the name of every object.<p>Sure there are counterexamples - TCP doesn&#x27;t require router state, UDP lets users skip the OS protocol stack, DNS could be even more centralized.<p>But the basic protocols weren&#x27;t really designed to resist much of anything. Their decentralization arose out of administrative concerns (site A should be able to administer its own names without coordinating with B and C) and engineering concerns (E2E principle) rather than power relations (powerful C can force its will onto the relationship between A and B). Designing to resist against the latter takes public key cryptography, which was nascent and too computationally expensive prior to the past few decades.')
