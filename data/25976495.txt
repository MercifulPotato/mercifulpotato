I doubt they care about anything (nation, economy, welfare).<p>The way it has been going on is that government announces something or passes some bill because they have to do something on a particular topic (say black money, taxes, Covid). However, they are incompetent or don&#x27;t have the willingness or interest in actually carrying it out. So, these changes turn out to be catastrophic. They take toll on economy as well as anyone impacted because of the decision making.<p>Agriculture reforms are much needed in India. However, the government did it in hurry by-passing rules and without consulting farmers. I guess, they just want to do something so that they can let the marketing take care of the rest (that the goverment has done something for farmers - doesn&#x27;t matter what or irrespective of whether it really helps them).<p>With these bills, the concern is that it will let private players take over and exploit farmers because of insufficient provisions to take care of farmers&#x27; interest. And then nobody will care (very much a risk because no one raises voice of oppressed which might show government in bad light because of the sold-out media). And the government will push narrative that they did the &quot;reforms&quot; (backed by fake data which is a hallmark of this government).')
