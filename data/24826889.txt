Print media as well.<p>As a dedicated listener to NPR, here&#x27;s my advice:<p>- The 6 minutes of headline news at the top of every hour covers all you might need to know.<p>- The more reporting-style programs (All Things Considered, Morning Edition) often have good interviews with figures directly involved in the news.  Of course, these are only worthwhile if the person hasn&#x27;t already been on a national platform.  Politicians and lawyers will just pretend to answer questions as they read prepared statements.<p>- Everything else is entertainment.<p>I like it, but I&#x27;m not deluded enough to look down on anyone (e.g. my wife) who finds it boring.')
