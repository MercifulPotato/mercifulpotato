Whenever there is a change in leader, there is some party convention and paying members of the party are asked to vote.  Anyone can pay to be a member, but it&#x27;s not a public vote like in the states.  I wonder if this produces better or worse candidates?  With our parlimentary system, we also don&#x27;t vote for our Prime Minister, we vote for our local representative.<p>I think it&#x27;s obvious if the US worked this way, the Republican party wouldn&#x27;t have selected Trump.  Perhaps you end up just electing the same old boring white guy time and time again.')
