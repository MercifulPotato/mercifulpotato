If it&#x27;s relocation costs, that&#x27;s an even worse offer than it sounds. The company will probably save that much money in the <i>first 2 months</i> of the employee leaving NYC and the Bay Area.<p>EDIT: I didn&#x27;t know about the 10% pay cut. That&#x27;s what I get for not reading the article.')
