Technically they&#x27;re operating machinery on-site. There&#x27;s probably a line somewhere that states that if you&#x27;re operating machinery on-site you need to be wearing the appropriate gear.<p>The concept of driving a vehicle while not being in the area wasn&#x27;t a possibility they considered while writing the regulations.<p>And yes, you could say that they should &quot;just use common sense&quot;, but that&#x27;s a fuzzy line. There&#x27;s often good sounding excuses as to why one should not follow the regulations to the letter &quot;this time&quot;. And those are the times bad stuff happens.')
