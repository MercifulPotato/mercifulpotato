He can lay in bed and write out an arrangement, whereas most of us mere mortals would need to reference a piano or a guitar.<p>Other than that, it&#x27;s mostly a cool parlor trick.  The best story I&#x27;ve heard of someone who had it is that of Woody Shaw, the great jazz trumpet player.  A piano player tried to test him on it once, and played a bunch of different chord voicings -- Woody correctly identified all the notes in each of them.  Then, to up the challenge, the piano player played a random cluster of notes.  Woody listed them all out, and the piano player replied, &quot;Wrong,&quot; thinking he had finally stumped him.  Then Woody replied, &quot;Now take every note I just said down by a half step.&quot;  Of course, Woody got them all right, and everybody&#x27;s mind was blown.')
