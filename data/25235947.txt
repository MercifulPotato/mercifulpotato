And if inflation goes up, interest rates will increase to try to control it (or even more government spending which will rack up even more debt).<p>&gt; CoE is not signaling for a return to austerity<p>How else will we repay the enormous debt? They won&#x27;t call it austerity just like they&#x27;re now using the euphemism &quot;Australia-style deal&quot; instead of &quot;no deal&quot;, but austerity is coming alright (that along with tax hikes).')
