That&#x27;s easily the world&#x27;s largest though: I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s another one over a gigawatt anywhere. And you need really special conditions for that kind of power - specifically really hot geological conditions.<p>The problem, as always, is that jerk Carnot and his limit. Most accessible geothermal fluid is &lt;150C except in very geologically active areas. That puts a pretty hard limit on plant efficiency.')
