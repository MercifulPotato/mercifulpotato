While trying it out, I wanted to use the backspace key, which in Vim moves to the last character on the previous line (when used on the beginning of a line, that is), but that didn&#x27;t work - backspace on the start of the line doesn&#x27;t seem to move the cursor at all.<p>I was pleasantly surprised that cw and D are implemented correctly though, so props on that!')
