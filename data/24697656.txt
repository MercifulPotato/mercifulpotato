It&#x27;s a spreadsheet.<p>It&#x27;s user&#x27;s faults for using it in ways that it was never designed for.<p>Excel has always been about sticking <i>numbers</i> in boxes and calculating with them.<p>If you want unmodified string input, input strings into a tool intended to handle them.<p>Project specifications can be hard.
