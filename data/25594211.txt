Item(by='adkadskhj', descendants=None, kids=[25594903, 25594496], score=None, time=1609432833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594109, text='Match has it&#x27;s place in unpacking common Enum types like Option and Result, but typically you&#x27;ll reach for functional patterns like `Result::map`, `Result::expect`, `Result::unwrap_or`, and of course `?` as they&#x27;re able to do the same thing but in far less code.<p>I think the downvotes are because both the example and the generalized statement that C# is &quot;noticeably faster&quot; is bait &#x2F; lazy.')
