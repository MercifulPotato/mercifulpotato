He was apparently the last line of defense between the mob and some of the politicians the mob was trying to attack.  Who knows what would have happened if they got through that door and he didn&#x27;t act.  There could have easily been a serious hostage situation.<p>&gt;And if it wasn&#x27;t 100 people spilling over a barrier (actually, the police pulled the barriers away and literally waved them in - explain that one to me) and entering a government building and disrupting an important session... then what was it?<p>Cops aren&#x27;t apolitical.  I guarantee there were plenty of people involved in security that sided with the insurrectionists.  And that is exactly what it was, insurrection.  They were trying to and were temporarily able to disrupt the function of the government recognizing the rightful next president.')
