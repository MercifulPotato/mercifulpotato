Or did you just decide on your own you needed to &quot;make him&quot; feel things to your satisfaction? Why would you feel like &quot;insisting&quot; on more contact from someone than they want is a healthy thing to do? Frankly your second paragraph sounds awful.<p>While I&#x27;m not intending to start a heated conversation here, I don&#x27;t know what you have gone through and I&#x27;m pretty sure I make mistakes, but I do feel your tone is accusatory and definitely inappropriate when you don&#x27;t know the full context of anything.<p>In hindsight, maybe asking someone on the internet about this was not the best thing to do. Thank you anyway, I appreciate your time.')
