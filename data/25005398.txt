For starting position you can expect 2-3k, then as you build towards seniority you can get to 4-5k range, but you can expect to work for 5-10 years before you get to that 5k&#x2F;mo (before taxes).<p>Now all kind of exceptions will come out the wood works telling me how they are &quot;easily&quot; making 10k&#x2F;mo by doing something and working for someone who they won&#x27;t admit. Yes even I know someone who is (or at least was) making 10k&#x2F;mo, but he was very specialized expert, actual 10x developer. Most people are making far less. 3k&#x2F;mo seems like the most common salary (again before taxes) for generic tech job.')
