The popular suspects are: A change in behavior of people. The decline in the amount of ultraviolet radiation (that damage or kills the virus). That drier air lowers the body defense against respiratory virus infections. That decomposition rate of viruses occur slower in lower temperatures. And finally the lover levels of vitamin D in colder climates.<p>Does this study provide any evidence in regard to any of those theories?')
