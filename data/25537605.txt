Item(by='aparsons', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608916239, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25536771, text='Tech in general - and Silicon Valley in particular - have an ageism problem.<p>Let me explain.<p>- If you entered the industry when you were young, you are fine. Myself and several colleagues&#x2F;friends who started our careers in the 80s and 90s, even early 2000s when we were in our 20s are fine. Perhaps even at an advantage. We can get hired at principal &#x2F; eng manager &#x2F; director level engineering roles without answering brain teasers and tongue twisters.<p>But there is another side to this story:<p>If you’re in your late 30s or 40s (even 50s, though that’s rarer) coming into these companies, there is a dirty tactic used to discriminate legally- the up-levelled interview.<p>Recruiters slot you into level beginner + 1 or 2, on the strength of you career experience. That is a trap, and an easy rejection for the company because obviously these candidates should be hired at a junior level.<p>However the wisdom at these companies is that junior engineers are expected to mostly spend their time learning - so there is a strong implicit bias there. 30 year olds generally aren’t comfortable with spending time mentoring people older than them. Of the junior roles, you have fresh college grads with algo &#x2F; data course they took last spring fresh in their mind, lots of free time to practice brain teasers (likely no job in college) taking up the bulk of the junior roles.<p>Congressional black causus forced companies to report certain “under represented” minority hiring numbers - but nobody bats an eye at the age dichotomy. I wonder if it’s because you can’t play identity politics and garner votes on the basis of age.<p>I know two women who decided to switch to developer roles in their 40s. One was asked a dynamic programming question and still looking for a job. The other worked in IT before (not software development) but was made to interview at junior level + 1 and unsurprisingly failed to get the job. Meanwhile her portfolio and projects are well made, responsive apps, following best practices, CI, tests etc. Very disheartening to see.')
