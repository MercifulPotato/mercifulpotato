Living on instant ramen would be very unhealthy. Rice and beans are a better source of food. Start by investing in a rice cooker, if you don&#x27;t have one.<p>Rice and Beans for 2n\n  olive oil or butter\n  n yellow onions\n  other fresh vegetables; experiment\n  3n cloves garlic\n  n 12-oz cans white, kidney, or black beans\n  n cubes Knorr beef or vegetable bouillon\n  n teaspoons freshly ground black pepper\n  3n teaspoons ground cumin\n  n cups dry rice, preferably brown\nPut rice in rice cooker. Add water as specified on rice package. (Default: 2 cups water per cup of rice.) Turn on rice cooker and forget about it.<p>Chop onions and other vegetables and fry in oil, over fairly low heat, till onions are glassy. Put in chopped garlic, pepper, cumin, and a little more fat, and stir. Keep heat low. Cook another 2 or 3 minutes, then add beans (don&#x27;t drain the beans), and stir. Throw in the bouillon cube(s), cover, and cook on lowish heat for at least 10 minutes more. Stir vigilantly to avoid sticking.<p>If you want to save money, buy beans in giant cans from discount stores. Spices are also much cheaper when bought in bulk. If there&#x27;s an Indian grocery store near you, they&#x27;ll have big bags of cumin for the same price as the little jars in supermarkets.')
