This is an issue near and dear to me here in Texas.  Feral hogs are, like many other wild animals, adapting to the ecosystem created by humans.  One downside though is that you cannot hunt&#x2F;kill them in city limits.  It&#x27;s very commonplace for feral hogs to bed down in suburbs and populate there, so no matter how many people go on hog &quot;hunts&quot; from helicopters with rifles, it won&#x27;t change the fact that in that neighborhood park you have hogs rutting in a no-kill zone.<p>There&#x27;s no nice, fully socially acceptable answer, because even in Texas the majority of city folks are not comfortable with the reality of killing another living creature, and they certainly aren&#x27;t comfortable with people using firearms inside the city.  Unlike deer issues, you can&#x27;t do crossbow hunts for feral hogs because they&#x27;re dangerous and travel in packs.  You need firearms with high magazine capacities to safely do feral hog abatement hunts.<p>In addition to all of the above, Texas is uniquely difficult to resolve this situation for because of the size of the state.  Texas is big, and feral hogs range across the entire state.  In many ways, there&#x27;s simply not enough people who are interested and able to spend their free time during the week shooting hogs.  Because of population centralization in cities, people do it as a weekend trip and usually with a company that charges them to handle the logistics, because it&#x27;s also not okay to just walk on random land here as every part of the state is private property unless otherwise designated.  Managing the feral hog problem here costs the state billions of dollars and is like trying to hold back the floodwaters by putting your finger in a collapsing dam.')
