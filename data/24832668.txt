Slack itself is the thing that&#x27;s disrupting my productivity and deterring deeper thinking by pinging me all the time. When I open Slack, the vast majority of the time, I&#x27;m looking to express my point as clearly AND concisely as possible so I can get back to doing whatever it was, which is 99% of time more important. As a result I use (or don&#x27;t use) grammatical conventions, capitalization, and emoji depending on the context of my message and what will allow me to get my entire message across the fastest, and hopefully correctly.<p>If I&#x27;m messaging the person I&#x27;ve pairing with all day, or if I&#x27;m coordinating with my team about who will pick up a story, I&#x27;m much less likely to give my message all the proper formatting. These people what I&#x27;m like and how I tend to communicate, and so I can rely on that prior knowledge to &quot;cut corners&quot; here and there. I&#x27;m also much, much more likely to use emoji because I can communicate my intentions and my &quot;intonation&quot; nearly instantly, without having to sit there and worry about wordsmithing my whole message.<p>That being said, if I&#x27;m message in a large public channel that perhaps has multiple teams or belongs to a team I don&#x27;t normally interact with, I&#x27;ll spend much more time wordsmithing and editing to make sure I&#x27;m following proper conventions - mostly for the sake of clarity.<p>It does make some very salient points (think about how others could misinterpret your message, expand acronyms&#x2F;use them sparingly, write to your audience, etc.) but I think they bought a little bit too much into the &quot;Slack has replaced email&quot; argument. For me, the main benefit of Slack over email is the lowered barrier to entry to starting a conversation and the ability to keeping it flowing, and part of achieving that is being okay with lowering the standards of communication.')
