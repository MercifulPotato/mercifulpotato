It doesn&#x27;t even really help to run your own proxy on a server somewhere, because although the target wouldn&#x27;t know for sure what the client&#x27;s IP address is, queries from just one IP are likely to be easily correlated (statistically or otherwise).<p>So you convince some neighbors to use your proxy... As the number of clients grows, so does the uncertainty that the person running the proxy isn&#x27;t colluding with the target, so you&#x27;re back to the same trust issue that you were trying to solve in the first place.')
