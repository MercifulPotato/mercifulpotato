It’s an outlet for youth to explore edgy memes and dark humour in the confines of the internet.<p>You’d find transphobia and crude racist remarks all the way back on 90s Internet, and you wouldn’t have to go looking for it. Gamers were never the soft bunch and online communities of younger guys were known to be competitive and ruthless. I hope this is still the case.<p>I would rather have an Internet where a bit of thicker skin is required but freedom to say anything is maintained, than one where we are shielding and coddling people from uncomfortable thoughts - whether or not they are morally or factually right&#x2F;wrong is an exercise left to the reader. You choose your own level of involvement.<p>Again, just my opinion.<p>PS. I’m not justifying the raiding they did on your community. Merely saying it’s par for the course of an unhinged internet. This stuff happened across the Internet. 4chan made it out alive for us to heckle and deride.')
