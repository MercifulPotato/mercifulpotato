So what if a person gets a little privilege just because they belong in a minority? What bothers me is the more common case of privileged person taking advantage of their privilege.<p>&gt; <i>Why do we scare to say &#x27;all lives matter&#x27;?</i><p>Because I always hear “all lives matter” said in response to “black lives matter”. To me that sounds like you are discounting my previous statement, as if it’s not entirely sufficient, that black lives matter.<p>“All lives matter” is something that people also say. e.g. I hear animal rights activists say that all the time. Even the very same people that say “black lives matter” in an anti-racist rally are likely to say “all lives matter” in an pro-immigration rally, pointing to the fact that many immigrants suffer preventable deaths on the migratory routes.<p>&gt; <i>In this well connected world, the price of being politcally incorrect could be huge</i><p>Good. If I say something that insults a lot of people I would like to know about it, so that I can know better in the future. I hate to be the one that speaks like an idiot and never gets corrected.')
