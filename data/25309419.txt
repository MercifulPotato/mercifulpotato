A highly legible ruleset with less &quot;sort of&quot; might lower the barrier for new contributors but come with its own tradeoffs. Rigidity, for example.<p>Is getting more contributors involved a limiting factor for wikipedia? Wikipedia&#x27;s goal isn&#x27;t necessarily to maximize the number of contributors, or articles. They aren&#x27;t facebook.<p>Ultimately, wikipedia is still pioneering its space. There isn&#x27;t really anything else like it, and all considered, it works remarkably well. I don&#x27;t see how any version of wikipedia could really avoid adversersarial dynamics. It&#x27;s those adversarial dynamics that make decisions, even though clear policies or authorities don&#x27;t really exist. Sure, many will find it alienating. Most people don&#x27;t need to edit wikipedia for it to work though.<p>I think what we need is other wikipedia-like things. The ideal solution to a lot of deletionists problem would be more highly active sites that work in different ways.')
