Item(by='bnralt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611606328, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25907933, text='&gt; The marketplace of ideas can&#x27;t function if major factions reject truth-seeking in favor of blatant lies that are appealing for various other reasons (e.g. emotional satisfaction, ability to manipulate others, etc.).<p>The problem always becomes that few think their faction has this problem. Most people think that they and their side believe in the truth, and that the other side is peddling false information. In such an environment, &quot;combating misinformation&quot; inevitably becomes &quot;trying to get everyone to agree with me.&quot;<p>In order to combat misinformation we&#x27;d probably have to start by combating the emotional commitment we hold to a certain narrative before we even examine all of the facts. That&#x27;s not easy to do, but I imagine a good first step would be to cut out the constant 24&#x2F;7 news cycle that a lot of people are addicted to and that seems to feed into these emotions. Twitter, of course, is a large source of this stuff.<p>Getting away from the news is an excellent way to start thinking more clearly.')
