From what I&#x27;ve seen, many products we&#x27;ve seen fall into one of several categories:<p>- People thinking if Jupyter notebooks had just the right CSS and animations, it&#x27;d make machine learning unstuck.<p>- People coming from web dev and thinking that ML folks are somehow unaware of Docker&#x2F;CICD&#x2F;Kubernetes&#x2F;Git and if they could just be enlightened, they&#x27;d be much more productive.<p>- People coming from a background of publishing blog posts&#x2F;Youtube videos <i>about</i> machine learning, or who&#x27;ve worked with cute datasets who think that the actual workflow is someone giving you a CSV and a metric to optimize for Ã  la Kaggle and building something around that workflow. This is for ML what Aikido is for fighting: it only works if your opponent knows the script and agrees to fall when you go Hayaaa!<p>Disclosure: we&#x27;re working on our machine learning platform[0] because we <i>desperately need it</i>. We do not come from a web dev or blogging background, and it shows. We&#x27;re building it because we spent seven years actually <i>delivering</i> machine learning products to <i>paying</i> enterprise in the mid six figures contracts with actual money, trust, and careers on the line. We&#x27;ve done it OK enough to have companies trust us and become repeat customers, <i>but</i>, anyone we faced the problems that anyone who has worked on <i>actual</i> projects has faced. Just getting to formulate the problem is akin to extracting Ramses II&#x27;s brain through his nostrils. Agreeing on the data to use and then getting the data to a usable form takes a long time. Defining the real world <i>metric</i> is not obvious [if only it just boiled down to F1&#x2F;AUC&#x2F;ROC&#x2F;ETC]. Most things that matter are done by a team, and tools work great for one individual, but break for teams. Just getting results to the client makes the work an endangered specie in an &quot;only one result out of 100 makes it to the client&quot;.<p>It is unbelievable how much these problems impact the team. People can <i>quit</i> over this and we&#x27;ve suffered a lot.<p>So we&#x27;re building around our workflow that has generated actual revenues with very large organizations that were satisfied enough to come back for more projects. It is not a perfect workflow, but it is from the real world on real projects and real clients that paid real money to solve real problems.<p>And we&#x27;re building it for ourselves to use on actual projects. We aim for 10x improvement.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai</a>')
