But: he&#x27;s using RAID0 of two SSDs and only getting a little more than half the throughput of one of those SSDs. As currently written, this program might not be giving the SSDs a high enough queue depth to hit their full read throughput. I&#x27;d like to see what throughput is like with an explicit attempt to prefetch data into RAM (either with a thread manually touching all the necessary pages, or maybe with a madvise call). That could drastically reduce the number of page faults and context switches affecting the OpenMP worker threads, and yield much better CPU utilization.')
