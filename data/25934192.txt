The original idea to use heuristics for preview cost reduction came out of a Hack Week project. This led to an initial brainstorm meeting between the ML team and the Previews team about what this might look like as a full-fledged ML product.<p>From the beginning the ML team&#x27;s focus was on providing measurable impact to our Previews stakeholders. One thing that helped us collaborate effectively was being transparent about the process and unknowns of ML (which are different from the constraints of non-ML software engineering). We openly shared our process and results, including experimental outcomes that did not work as well as planned and that we did not roll into production. We also worked closely with Previews to define rollout, monitoring, and maintenance processes that would reduce ops load on their side and provide clear escalation paths should something unexpected happen. Consistent and clear communication helps build trust.<p>On their side, the Previews team has been an amazing ML partner, and it was a joy to work with them.')
