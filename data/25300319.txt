Both are about 11km and the most expensive one is 142 million usd. Even if you were to double the cost it&#x27;s still fairly cheap. I wonder if it&#x27;s paid for by the people living there or if it&#x27;s paid for by the Danish mainland? Probably both. This will provide a good boost to their economy in the longer run.')
