Or Chicago in the 1960s than Chicago of today.  Or Boston in the 1920s vs. Boston today.<p>The problem with this explanation - even though it <i>sounds</i> reasonable - is that it lacks predictive power.  There&#x27;s <i>always</i> crime, corruption, and decay, because whenever large groups of people come together there&#x27;s crime, corruption, and decay, and cities are defined by large groups of people coming together.  But for this to be the <i>cause</i> of collapse, you need to explain how cities can have high levels of crime, corruption, and decaying buildings and then recover back to lower levels of crime, corrupion, and decaying buildings.<p>I&#x27;ll posit a simpler explanation that sounds a lot less sexy.  Cities rise when the industry they specialize in becomes a regional or global powerhouse.  (Here, I use &quot;industry&quot; broadly - it can also refer to power &amp; governance, like with Rome or Washington DC, or to culture, like LA.)  They fall when that industry becomes relatively less important.<p>So Detroit fell because the American auto industry is no longer competitive vs. the Japanese &amp; Koreans.  New Orleans fell because the Mississippi river trade lost its importance when steamships &amp; containerization happened. \n Boston fell when the textile industry moved south, and then renewed when it was replaced by the education, minicomputer, and biotech industries.  There is very little cities can do about this other than refocus on another industry, like Boston did.')
