Tether has never demonstrated a single USDT redemption. All of the trading on an exchange doesn&#x27;t matter because on USDT exchanges, you never actually have USD. If you trade USDT&#x2F;USD on Binance, your profits are still actually USDT denominated! There is no proven way to convert USDT to USD except via another crypto (i.e. Binance USDT -&gt; BTC and then Coinbase BTC -&gt; USD) hence this entire topic...<p>The peg would break down if there was any real convergence mechanism. But there isn&#x27;t. This isn&#x27;t a problem until people actually try to exchange these supposedly fungible assets.')
