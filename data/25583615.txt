I order from Amazon all the time and everything I get is generally fine. Occasionally something breaks after a while or is missing a part but that can happen anywhere and Amazon has extremely generous return policies. If anything I&#x27;ve come to trust AmazonBasics as a reliable brand if I&#x27;m deciding between products.')
