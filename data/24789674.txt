It isn&#x27;t enough for it to just be random.<p>So while the UUID could be leveraged to provide a distribution space for random sampling, it doesn&#x27;t help much with the requirement that the records be time distributed.<p>In the article I used a 2 week span as an example, but in actual use this could be a 1 hour span or a 4 month span, too, with an arbitrary number of data points being collected, and I need a technique that works efficiently for all of those things.<p>To the core of your thought, though, about using the UUID as a source of randomness for gathering a random sample, I think the challenge there is going to be indexing the UUID in a way that is amenable to that purpose.')
