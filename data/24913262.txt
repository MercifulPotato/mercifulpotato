As if wireless phone charging or bitcoin mining or X are the last unturned stones in the pursuit of zero waste.

I have to admit I felt a little bit of ecosuperiority over him as I hung my clothes. Perhaps briefly pondering how much better the world would be if everyone gave up a luxury I personally could do without (while retaining all of my preferred luxuries for myself, of course).<p>It&#x27;s even funny just to think of all the apparatuses involved in me leaving this snooty comment on the internet, a pleasure you&#x27;ll have to pry from my corpse!')
