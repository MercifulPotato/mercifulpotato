This includes scripts that automate keystrokes or clicks, especially to perform automatic sign-ins.<p>If a web developer knows what they are doing they are using the standard web APIs supplied by the browser in an efficient way, designed to be invisible to accessibility for accessibility test automation, and thus this control from Google is largely unenforceable.  As such I believe this is just a block against incompetent forms of automation that probably shouldn&#x27;t be there in the first place.')
