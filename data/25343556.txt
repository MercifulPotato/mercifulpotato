Am I doing these joins because there is maybe a higher level domain that goes across these two services?<p>Should I re-scope my services? Or should I build an Aggregator-View service that holds a JOINED copy of the data.<p>These aggregator-view services often make sense as Backend-For-Frontends. They must be restricted to a read-only API since they mirror data from other microservices.<p>GraphQL is a dead end when you are doing joins in code.')
