Item(by='nl', descendants=None, kids=[25369531, 25369588], score=None, time=1607571737, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25368098, text='&gt; One of the people they&#x27;ve surveyed was Nahshon Garrett<p>Yeah so here&#x27;s the affidavit he has signed[1]. There&#x27;s no evidence at all that he voted in AZ, only that his voter registration record was active, and his affidavit <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> claim he voted or that he found that he voted, only that Braynard&#x27;s organisation claims he did.<p>If you listen carefully to the interview, the story is the same there. When she asks what kind of vote it was he says &quot;oh I don&#x27;t know - I think it was an early vote or a provisional vote or something&quot;. He hasn&#x27;t checked!<p>Braynard claims that he voted. But there is nothing verifying that at all that this is the case, and <i>Braynard couldn&#x27;t verify this independently.</i> (I just checked - you need your Voter ID and&#x2F;or SSN).<p>&gt; As much as I&#x27;d love to have the actual data myself, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s going to just post it publicly. He started the project to verify whether the lists of supposedly dead voters that were floating around the web were real. The thing is that people who were posting them were all almost immediately banned for doxxing.<p>This is a BS excuse. He hasn&#x27;t lodged it in any court cases, his page says he <i>will</i> post it but he hasn&#x27;t.<p>One of the reasons everyone is so annoyed about this is because of this shitty grifter wrecking democracy to make a few bucks for themselves.<p>&gt; What would confirm whether it&#x27;s true or not is the state or the feds doing an investigation, but they don&#x27;t seem to be interested in doing anything.<p>This of course is complete nonsense. There have been vast numbers of state and federal investigations into every alleged piece of fraud. But there is nothing there, especially not on the scale claimed.<p>&gt; But one way or another, removing his fundraiser was a complete bullshit.<p>It really wasn&#x27;t. He was raising money by alleging fraud occurred and he was going to blow the lid on it all.<p>Carefully trying to work around their restrictions by pretending it was &quot;just in case&quot; - when the President of the United States is making these claims - is clearly bad faith.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov&#x2F;Home&#x2F;ShowDocument?id=1896" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov&#x2F;Home&#x2F;ShowDocument?id=1...</a>')
