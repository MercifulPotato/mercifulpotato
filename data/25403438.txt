(handheld)<p>I have an old GRE PSR-500 which isn&#x27;t terrible, but I&#x27;m looking to replace it as it has next to zero software support for programming it and doing it by hand is a real pain.<p>You&#x27;d think in this day and age someone would make a scanner with a companion app connected to Radio Reference for programming.  Would be nice to have bluetooth audio too.<p>FWIW, GRE stopped making scanners in 2012, and later closed down and sold off their scanner business to Whistler.  Supposedly Whister were going to release a new scanner, the TRX-100, but cancelled it.  Seems like handheld scanner technology is still stuck in the &#x27;80s.')
