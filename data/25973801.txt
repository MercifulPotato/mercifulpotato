The engine in the Volt only runs in the rare cases where the battery charge is low. When it does run, it generally runs at a constant, low stress RPM while supplying power to the electric motor with buffering from the battery. This is generally acting like a series hybrid. (The parallel hybrid mode is only activated in some rare cases).  The result is that the EV motor is used for most miles and the gas engine lives a rather pampered life.<p>The car also keeps track of gas miles and gives you an estimate for remaining oil life. Under typical usage, that results in an oil change every couple of years. I think that the spark plugs are 100K plugs so they will eventually need replacing but not often.')
