However truly loving her, he would rather die than live without her, and would choose the door opposite to the one she indicated intending to die.<p>On the other hand if he truly understood the depth of the Princess&#x27;s jealousy and expected her to indicate the door with the Tiger, he would realise her cruelty and choose the door opposite to that she indicated, in order to forsake her and enjoy a happy life.<p>So either way he should choose the other door.')
