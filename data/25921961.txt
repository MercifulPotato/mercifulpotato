That problem can broadly be summarized as follows:<p>1) What happens when all forms of money&#x2F;payment become electronic;<p>2) What happens when, for whatever reason, the underlying electronic system (which includes but is not limited to Computers, Software, Internet, etc.) -- fails?<p>Use another electronic system, right?<p>Well then what about:<p>3) What happens when one or more crucial components in ALL electronic payment systems (Internet, Electricity, Software, ?) -- fail simultaneously, at the same time?<p>?<p>It could never happen?<p>?<p>If you truly believe that, then please read the following:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2002&#x2F;11&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-law-of-leaky-abstractions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2002&#x2F;11&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-law-of-leaky-a...</a><p>Perhaps having equal parts Gold, Silver, Currency, and a stock of easily tradeable items (Coffee, Sugar, Flour, Soup Cans, Noodles, Water Filtration Devices, Batteries, etc.) would be a good hedge against that possibility...<p>Also, the right survival skills -- would be as valuable as Gold...')
