As far as I recall the Netflix search engine has never found the exact title I&#x27;ve been searching for. Even the recommendations it then shows me are so far off piste that they&#x27;re not really even close to what I&#x27;m looking for.<p>At least with Amazon Prime there&#x27;s a high chance they&#x27;ll at least find the title one searches for and if I am really motivated I can pay a few bucks to watch it.<p>Netflix just draws a blank.<p>That&#x27;s not to say I haven&#x27;t watched some entertaining things on Netflix, but they seem much better suited to TV series than movies, and I almost feel like I found decent things to watch inspite of their recommendation system, not because of it.<p>An ML tool from Netflix? It feels like the last thing I&#x27;m likely to use.')
