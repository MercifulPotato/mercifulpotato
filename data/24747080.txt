Just because you can come up with a few exceptions doesn&#x27;t prove most cops need such things: It more proves that cops might need a special force that can come in if things get bad.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced any situation you bring up would have been helped by the immediate availability of gear. Some of these could be better with better training: Some things could be somewhat prevented if we did things like make sure there was mental and physical health care, a safety net so folks didn&#x27;t get so far down, and had reasonable gun laws.<p>oh, and not have cops posing as oppressors with military equipment. We are the picture of oppression right now, and if it were happening in one of &quot;America&#x27;s Enemies&quot;, we&#x27;d bemoan them for not being free enough or use it as the ills of socialism or communism.')
