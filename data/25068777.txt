It&#x27;s how I avoid bit rot and media obsolescence.<p>My files have survived magtapes, DECtapes, 8&quot; floppies, 5.25&quot; floppies, 3.5&quot; floppies, zip drives, CDs, DVDs, blurays, 6 Mb hard disks (yes, 6 megabytes!), many no-longer-readable hard drives, and that about covers it.<p>Just keep copying them forward, and rotate among more than one drive.<p>My experience is that every media device and every media format becomes unreadable after a few years.<p>I learned programming on punch cards. I wish I&#x27;d kept my punch card decks, but they&#x27;d be unreadable by now. Unreadable by machine, that is, I could decode them by hand.')
