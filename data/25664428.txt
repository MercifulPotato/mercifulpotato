It is the same size (usually 16 bytes) as GUID&#x2F;UUID in binary but has lots of drawbacks and no real upside other than they are easier to type in when they are still small.<p>1) The ids are clustered around the starting point so an invalid join will return data when it shouldn&#x27;t.  MIN_ID exists for almost every table&#x2F;object type.  With a well designed ID this shouldn&#x27;t return any data.<p>2) BigInts are different sizes on different platforms. I&#x27;ve worked at a place 1 order of magnitude (base2) from overflowing JS Number and breaking most client code. This was due to bug that consuming a Seq ids quickly but there was no going back smaller.<p>3) Will often be coded client side as a Int and no one will notice until you grow large enough to overflow INT<p>Really, just avoid any sequential, numeric IDs and you will be good, IMO.')
