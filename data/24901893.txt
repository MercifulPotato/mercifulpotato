Contacts on the right, navigation bar at the top, Groups, friends and so on on the left, feed in the middle, all visually separated.<p>&gt;<i>Of the 5 main giant buttons (navigation icons) at the top of the page, none of them are notifications — arguably the single most-used button and the one I need most.</i><p>This I don&#x27;t understand at all because for me the second button from the right in the top bar literally is the notification button.<p>I also absolutely don&#x27;t mind that things take up more space or are larger because it improves readability. I don&#x27;t think scrolling is bad in any way, packing more things on the same space is not good design just because you make things denser, if that was the case we wouldn&#x27;t use paragraphs in text, and scrolling on the web is free. I&#x27;m actually glad that pages move away from stuffing everything onto one page like the early web, as if we only had one sheet of paper.')
