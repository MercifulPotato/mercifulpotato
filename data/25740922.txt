To evaluate whether an observation is anomalous, you typically define a threshold for what&#x27;s considered not-normal, e.g. an observation 2 or 3 standard deviations above the mean.<p>This may leave you with some false positives (like any system of this nature would). Of course, you could go the route of actually defining an anomaly yourself and building a more sophisticated model (i.e. one not using z-scores as the measure of anomaly), but that&#x27;s obviously a different scope.')
