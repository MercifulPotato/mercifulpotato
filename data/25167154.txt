I was doing this around 1980-1981, when the LISP options were much fewer, the Mackintosh did not exist, Windows did not exist, and Symbolics machines were just becoming available. Franz Lisp was a good option. Common LISP came later, with many features from the Symbolics refrigerator, including their rather clunky object system.<p>Among other things, I ported the Boyer-Moore theorem prover to Franz Lisp. That started life on Interlisp on a PDP-10. I later ported it to Common LISP, and I have a currently working version today on Github, for nostalgia reasons.  It&#x27;s fun seeing it run 1000x faster than it did back then.')
