I feel like there was significantly greater creativity enabled by it than we see today in the HTML5 era. Flash is also much easier to develop for. Yes the security issues were not great. But those can be addressed. Building some of Flash&#x27;s capabilities into browsers is just shifting where the complexity sits. But the experience of building on web standards is still terrible, and I don&#x27;t think these standards are as open as people think, since they seem to be primarily controlled&#x2F;steered by Google. As as for Steve Job&#x27;s anti-Flash missive - obviously that was to justify proprietary Apple native technologies (specific to their hardware) displacing what Flash provided. I&#x27;m sad the HN crowd ate it all up.')
