I mean, I love that movie, but I love it especially because it&#x27;s not &quot;deep&quot;. (It doesn&#x27;t mean there are no interesting questions&#x2F;plotlines, of course there is the whole who-was-really-the-killer question. Of course there&#x27;s the whole personal drama of the main character.) But compared to Seven - I think - there&#x27;s a lot less abstract&#x2F;social commentary and symbolism. (Even though it&#x27;s full of the killer&#x27;s code symbols.)')
