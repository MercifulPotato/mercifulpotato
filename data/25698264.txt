I&#x27;ve never had a package stolen from my home in the 22 years I&#x27;ve been ordering online. About once a year I do have one go missing during the delivery process. On tracking the package will get closer and closer and then suddenly go off to some random city and seemingly get stuck there. Amazon is terrible about handling these. Eventually they&#x27;ll admit the package is missing and send out a replacement. About half the time the original package will show up sometime over the next month, which may be why they&#x27;re reluctant to send out a replacement in the first place.')
