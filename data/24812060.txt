The original source is Peter Norvig&#x27;s speech to Berkeley&#x27;s graduating CS students in 2006.<p>&gt; Before I answer that, let me return for the moment to Dewey Decimal 663: beverage technology. It turns out that in my very first professional job, as an intern thirty years ago, I had a colleague, a chemist, who had worked in beverage technology. The summer before he had been an intern and was given the task of figuring out if there was a particular chemical that gave whisky the distinctive taste of being aged in an oak cask. The company figured if they could isolate the chemical maybe they could just mix it in, and skip five or ten years of aging. So my friend went into the lab and isolated what he thought might be the right compound. He ordered a small vial from a chemical supply company (remember, this was before online shopping and email, so they had to actually write words on paper) and mixed up a batch. It tasted pretty good. (Why can&#x27;t we computer scientists get research projects that involve consuming alcohol?) My friend was duly congratulated, and he wrote to the chemical supply company and asked for a 55 gallon drum of the stuff. They wrote back, saying &quot;we regret that we can not fill your order because we are currently low on stock and, as I&#x27;m sure you know, to produce this chemical we need to age it in oak casks for five years.&quot;<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.norvig.com&#x2F;speech.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.norvig.com&#x2F;speech.html</a>')
