I know they were dreaming up a lot of fanciful things when they were setting the requirements though.<p>I think the actual shuttle had a life support capability for like 7 people. Not sure of the actual flight crew requirement, there&#x27;s probably room for like 3-4 other guys. It can land on a runway, but it&#x27;s gotta be really long, and there&#x27;s only one shot, and it&#x27;ll be really obvious and has no ability to evade defenses. No chance of it landing in Moscow unless the Russians let it. And then you&#x27;d be in the middle of a huge military base or something, and what are 4 guys going to do except be killed or captured immediately.<p>Maybe they could get there in an hour. From a specific launch pad in Florida, and if the shuttle is all set up to launch, which takes months. And it&#x27;ll be blindingly obvious to everyone in the world that something just launched heading straight at Moscow.')
