Makes sense.<p>People who care do put in more of their effort and get better results, but you have to give them an incentive for them to care. If your company fails, they get fired. But if your company grows and becomes 10x more profitable, their wages don&#x27;t move. That&#x27;s a great recipe for people doing the absolute minimum to not get fired.<p>This guy wants people who care more about him and his company than for themselves. &quot;Ask not what your company can do for you â€“ ask what you can do for your company&quot;')
