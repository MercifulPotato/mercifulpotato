I would understand officers busting in guns drawn if they considered denizens dangerous. I would understand an arrest without guns drawn. But casually walking in with a gun (in case there&#x27;s something to kill) makes this look like a psycho checking in.<p>From my non-US perspective all these gun first arrests look crazy, especially for handling car speeding or non-violent offenders.')
