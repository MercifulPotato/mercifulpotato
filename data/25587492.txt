Item(by='gerdesj', descendants=None, kids=[25587693, 25587983, 25587855], score=None, time=1609370298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25587105, text='&quot;analysts&quot; - lol!<p>I know a HR director at a multi-national.  He&#x27;d had enough of Excel and liked the look of this Python thing.  I showed him R as well for balance but he wanted Python.  I showed him how to install a Python distro and MS Code on his Windows machine, wired them up and off he went a few months back.<p>The board are in awe of his presentations.  He is not an IT bod at all but a Uni. degree in Psycho. involves a fair amount of stats so a fair grounding there.  He grabs huge data dumps from  payroll etc and performs analyses that are complex but just work.<p>I think one of the benefits of using Python is that you instantly divorce input data, calcs and reporting. Fire up Excel and the first thing you often do is write a title.  Using Excel properly requires a lot of discipline - I wrote a Finite Capacity Planner, with forecast and labour planner for a pie factory in Excel with quite a lot of VBA.  It ran my P60 hard but did the job iteratively in about 2 to 5 minutes.  Easter and Chrimbo needed a fair bit of tweaking by a Planner but most of the time my model told several supermarkets what they would be ordering back in the mid 1990s and they mostly faxed or EDId our forecast back as an order.<p>My brother (<i>cough</i>) is absolutely not an analyst in the normal sense.  That a non programmer can bolt together enough Python to perform analyses useful to his job is testament to the power of the libraries and examples and documentation available.  I&#x27;ve seen his code: suck in data, process it, spit out results, report results.  That&#x27;s all he needs and not a OO abstraction in sight.<p>My two examples (me and my FC Planner with Excel and an HR bod thrashing some data to a report with Python) are different things and each uses the opposite &quot;tool for the job&quot; discussed in the OP.  However, it is how you use a tool that is important.')
