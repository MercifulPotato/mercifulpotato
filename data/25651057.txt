I usually read in English so I often notice how much vocabulary certain writer uses. Most of them use the same vocabulary I am familiar with and I read the whole book without looking up a word, but there are some writers where I get a new word every few pages and it is not a word that was forced in there. It made sense to use it.<p>I never read Gene Wolfe after I started reading in English, I&#x27;ve read him in my native language. I&#x27;ll need to bump him up in my reading list to see how it reads in English.')
