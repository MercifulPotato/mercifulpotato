In the UK (in finance at least) you&#x27;re there till the job is done and your bonus nreflect that. In Germany, your there for set hours and being great or terrible won&#x27;t make much difference so why bother?<p>If people made the arguement that London is good at finance because londoners (and it is londoners, not brits overall) want it more, I&#x27;d agree. When people say it&#x27;s the language or the timezone I&#x27;m very unconvinced. Otherwise, why hasn&#x27;t Ireland eaten our lunch?')
