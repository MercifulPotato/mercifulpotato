Which is too bad because it clearly has a lot of potential. At this point, I think Rust will end up eating a lot of Ocaml’s potential market—Rust’s weakness is that memory management is harder than OCaml, but even that has become significantly easier between non-lexical lifetimes and rust-analyzer, and the pace of development of the Rust language is very fast while Ocaml moves like a glacier (still waiting on multicore!).')
