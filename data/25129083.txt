Sure we may be burning three times more coal than we&#x27;d have to if we could perfectly convert it to energy. That has literally never factored into an argument I&#x27;ve seen about renewables - it&#x27;s always &quot;we currently produce X GigaWatts 24x7, and renewables don&#x27;t let us do that&quot;.<p>Saying we burn coal at 30% efficiency isn&#x27;t addressing anything useful. And it&#x27;s one of those articles where many won&#x27;t completely follow it, but they&#x27;ll come out with an impression that the premise is true because of some &quot;sciency bits&quot;, when with some more content they could&#x27;ve actually been educated in something useful.<p>Or you could say, &quot;nuclear power would solve this quicker than anything&quot; and you&#x27;d be right :-)')
