It&#x27;s not like earrings are sold exclusively at jewellery stores. You can find them at drug stores, grocery stores, gas stations, random street vendors, and all sorts of other places. You can easily buy earrings for less than $10, and less than $5, too.<p>That&#x27;s also true with lots of other fashion accessories.<p>It&#x27;s definitely true with headphones as well. Aesthetics were an enormous part of the Beats brand, and a bunch of other headphone companies.
