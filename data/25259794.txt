Basically, you are asking them to really have two sets of cores on a single die and switch back and forth.<p>I think the more realistic point of view is that x86 has likely run its course, and now it is time to move on.<p>The long answer is look up Transmeta and do some reading. Basically they designed a RISC CPU core with an external microcode engine, that was able to run x86 instructions. It was a valiant effort, but it didn&#x27;t work as well as hoped.<p>Here is a fun history read that mentions Transmeta as well as P.A.Semi. P.A.Semi is the core team that designed the A1 (and following Apple cores) after being bought by Apple in 2008. Prior to that, the team had designed the DEC Alpha (awesome processor) and StrongARM cores. Later, they developed PowerPC cores. A team with really deep CPU talent, and in particular, prior ARM ISA experience, when they were acquired in 2008.<p>Sorry, I forgot the link on the first post....<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linleygroup.com&#x2F;newsletters&#x2F;newsletter_detail.php?num=4139" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linleygroup.com&#x2F;newsletters&#x2F;newsletter_detail.ph...</a>')
