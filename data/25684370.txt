I was also playing around with javafx so I decided to give it a try and create something others can use as well. \nThe biggest difference for me is that I can work with one project in given instance, and if I want second project, it opens another instance. This is how eg InteliJ Idea is working and I&#x27;m heavy Idea user. If someone else likes to organize his work like that, he&#x2F;she may find HammerUI useful. And of course there are other features...\nPS. GraphQL support is coming, just until now I was focusing on getting first release out.')
