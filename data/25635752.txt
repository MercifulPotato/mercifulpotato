I said “a few weeks” because for the teachers I know scheduling a vacation ends up being a couple of weeks where they have a contiguous free stretch between the end of school in June (usually a week after students), staff meetings and trainings, professional development, and planning for the school year which begins in August. No, they aren’t working every day of that period but it’s nowhere near as generous as people tend to describe it sounding like June 1st to September 1st.')
