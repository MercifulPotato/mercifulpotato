It does feel inevitable. On the other hand, if it&#x27;s not inevitable I wouldn&#x27;t know because that platform is staying small.<p>One thing I&#x27;ll say is that there are a number of business that I use (both B2B and B2C) that are highly specialized but manage to be successful because they are not interested in growth. I suspect there&#x27;s lots of these out there that are maintaining their own platform or using an out of the box solution, but that most of us never know about them because we don&#x27;t need to interact.')
