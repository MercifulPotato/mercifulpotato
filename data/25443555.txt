Tether is meant to be designed such that you can buy 1 &quot;tether&quot; (USDT) for $1 and sell for $1, initially the suggestion was that every tether in existence was backed by $1 in a bank account owned by the issuer. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be true. So how do you manipulate BTC using USDT? You just print USDT and use them to buy BTC. Everyone <i>thinks</i> that 1 USDT = $1, so they&#x27;re willing to receive it. As long as no one actually tries to cash out the USDT, it&#x27;s fine. And why would you cash out? Bitcoin is going to the moon!<p>So as long as there&#x27;s a net inflow of cash into tether, the issuer of tether can just pump the market up using unbacked USDT.')
