It&#x27;s true that AML statutes tend to be hyperspecific, because it&#x27;s a difficult area to regulate.  So areas like crytocurrency mixing are gray and uncertain even among law enforcement lawyers.  It&#x27;s not true, however, that there is an inherent right to unrestricted private transfer of money.<p>Bascially, the statement you&#x27;re reading is not saying &quot;Mixing is probably illegal because the money must have been illegal to begin with&quot;.  It&#x27;s saying that &quot;Mixing is probably money laundering on its face, no matter where the money came from.&quot;<p>At some point governments are going to need to step in and clarify this with laws.  But don&#x27;t fool yourself: Crypto mixers are going to end up being subject to effectively the same reporting requirements that banks are.  What you want (perfect financial privacy) you can&#x27;t have, sorry.  That ship sailed decades ago.')
