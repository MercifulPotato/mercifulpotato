The number of ill-conceived pre-print &quot;studies&quot; I&#x27;ve seen get released this year is disappointing. Tons of studies with either a tiny sample size and questionable methods (medicines given very late in the progression of the disease, control groups whose demographics don&#x27;t remotely match the test group, etc.). And of course those studies get reported on with no indication they were poorly done.')
