I&#x27;m really surprised in how bad it isn&#x27;t here: the residents are mostly well behaved and don&#x27;t leave needles or anything like that hanging around (and they don&#x27;t poop on the streets since the city installed a bunch of portable toilets). It is still kind of a bummer, but it is far from a deal breaking nuisance.')
