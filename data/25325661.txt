I purchased a Kardia EKG device for my spouse&#x27;s smart watch (before smart watches had them built in). The web page clearly stated that you could use the product without having an account. (My spouse and I are pretty vehement about not using any device that requires an account for no reason. Getting data from a device I own to my own watch should <i>not</i> require an account.)<p>They pointed out that their web page clearly states you will need an account. I was shocked because I always make sure to very carefully research this. So I went to the wayback machine on archive.org and looked at their page on the day I purchased, and sure enough, the language was not in there. They had added it a few weeks later.<p>I sent them screenshots and receipts, and they still pushed back. Finally I issued them an ultimatum. Refund us the money or I&#x27;ll do a chargeback and present my evidence to the credit card company. They immediately backed down and refunded us.<p>It is utterly insane that consumers need to take screenshots of every product page for products they buy in this day and age to not be screwed over.')
