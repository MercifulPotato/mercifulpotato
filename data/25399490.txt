It&#x27;s incomplete, and it has its own secondary understanding of history that can get you into trouble when it interacts poorly with VSCode&#x27;s own history. Anyway, that was my experience for my short time using it.<p>I&#x27;m curious if there are any longtime vim users using VSCode with the Vim plugin, and if so, what are their experiences, and why do they use VSCode with a Vim plugin instead of just using vim itself?')
