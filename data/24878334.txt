I would much rather have to re-like a song again on YTM than have random videos show up on YTM. I don&#x27;t want any of my Youtube content to be transfered.<p>If you think of it, before when I was on GPM, I didn&#x27;t have any of my Youtube content and I was perfectly fine. So I&#x27;m not sure why I need any of it now.')
