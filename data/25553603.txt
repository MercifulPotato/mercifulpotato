Item(by='nitrogen', descendants=None, kids=[25553786], score=None, time=1609097691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25553288, text='<i>The guy is just making stuff up from intuition and experience, there is no formal science here. He is much closer to an &quot;artist&quot; then he is to a &quot;mathematician&quot;, physicist&quot; or &quot;scientist&quot; and should not command the same respect as the latter titles.</i><p>Perhaps some artists should command greater respect among scientists than they do, and perhaps science and engineering are closer to art than they want to admit.<p>I too used to believe that knowledge was only real if it was formalized, and that intuition is fake and inferior.  Now, while formalized knowledge is easier to record and convey, I realize that it is intuition that does the vast majority of the work in most settings.  The ability to convey and gradually formalize intuition is indeed a mark of intelligence, but it is not necessary, sufficient or even desirable to wait until all intuition is converted to formalism before acting.<p>I think you are missing the facts that everything we do is implemented by humans, and that we are working with enough complexity and emergent behavior that we <i>have</i> to rely on intuitive pattern matching.  All the formalism in the world means nothing if it doesn&#x27;t change the way humans implement something, or if the problem has completely changed by the time a formal solution has been created.  In my own professional work, as acknowledged by coursework I have had in the past, the bulk of real value has not come from, say, learning the math governing circuits, or learning new programming languages, but from building and applying intuition about systems of interconnected parts.<p>So if using semi-intuitive, semi-amorphous pattern matching to describe things helps humans deal with complexity sooner and faster than waiting for absolute mathematical formalism, then that is incredibly valuable to society and to the people who develop and apply improved intuitions.')
