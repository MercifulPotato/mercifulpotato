Or the episode featuring the town fire department and they teach fire safety. They also had an episode where they adopted a puppy. Not a mer-puppy, just a regular dog that would drown shown next to the clearly-just-a-fish teacher Mr. Grouper. Or the episode about _air_planes. Nevermind that the show is clearly tries for an ocean theme most of the time and guppies are a freshwater fish.<p>I&#x27;m glad my kids are aging out of this nonsense.  At least Mr. Rogers spoke to kids like real people with emotions and intelligence instead of just assuming they&#x27;re too stupid to recognize massive internal-inconsistencies.')
