When the UK was in the EU it had a much more pro-market, pro-EU expansion agenda. France was at the other extreme and Germany was in the middle. This afforded Germany some flexibility as it could &quot;choose&quot; between these different axes as needed.<p>With the UK gone that means that voice is much weakened and to some extent countries like Germany will have to make more concessions to France as there&#x27;s less of a counterweight in the other direction.<p>Whether this is &quot;beneficial for the EU&quot; depends on if you think increased integration is a good thing or not. If you are fully signed up lover of the European project then it is probably good, but if you&#x27;re leery of further integration then it is probably bad.')
