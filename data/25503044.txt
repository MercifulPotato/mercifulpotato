Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608613291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502651, text='<i>&gt; It&#x27;s about time we think outside the box</i><p>Another way of looking at it, to add to my previous post: dark matter and MOND <i>are</i> thinking outside the box. They cover both possibilities for how to expand on our current theories: either (a) there&#x27;s more &quot;stuff&quot; out there than our current theories of particle physics know about; or (b) there&#x27;s more aspects to gravity than our current theory of gravity knows about. Consider whatever &quot;unknown effects&quot; you like: they will end up coming down to one of those two possibilities.<p>Thinking &quot;inside the box&quot; would be something like: it&#x27;s far more likely that either <i>the data is wrong</i> or <i>we haven&#x27;t calculated the predictions of our current theories correctly</i> than that our current theories, which have tons of experimental confirmation, are wrong. Historically, most of the time in science, when there&#x27;s been a discrepancy between theories and data, <i>that</i> is how the discrepancy has ended up being resolved: either we&#x27;ve figured out something was wrong with the data, or we&#x27;ve figured out that something was wrong with how we calculated the predictions of our current theories.<p>The reason <i>why</i> cosmologists are driven to consider models like dark matter and MOND is that <i>they have checked and double checked and triple checked both the data and our predictions from our current theories</i>, and the mismatch <i>hasn&#x27;t gone away</i>. So they are driven to consider &quot;out of the box&quot; ideas, and, as above, dark matter and MOND cover the possibilities.')
