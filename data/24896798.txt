Impeding the transfer of fiat (infra which should be a utility) is a violation of constitutional rights (arguably) if you&#x27;re not breaking the law. Even if I disagree with the speech (I do! Vehemently!), rights must be inalienable.<p>Maybe this should be patched in Section 230 legislation versus 18 USC ยง 1960, would have to read more statute to provide a proper opinion on which statute should protect money as speech transmittal (IANAL, would like to hear a JD&#x27;s legal opinion).')
