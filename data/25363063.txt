Nobody attempted to overturn any state&#x27;s electors. The sitting Democratic president didn&#x27;t directly lobby state governors and state house speakers to decertify results. For that matter: Democrats didn&#x27;t deliberately fuck up tabulation processes to sow chaos to exploit later in the month.')
