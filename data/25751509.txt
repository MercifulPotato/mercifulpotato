All Handshake names are registered with HNS through the auction process. Say you bid 1000 HNS on a name and I bid 900 HNS. You&#x27;d win that name and pay 900 HNS (the second highest bid price. Importantly, that fee doesn&#x27;t go to Namebase or any other entity â€” the coins are burned on-chain so they go to no one.')
