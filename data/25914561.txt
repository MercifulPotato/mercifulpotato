Open world semantics and sophisticated theories may have been a vision for the semantic web of heterogenous data, but in reality RDF and co are only used in certain closed-world niches IME.<p>Pascal Hitzler is one of the more prolific authors (especially with the EU-funded identification of description logic fragments of OWL2 which are some of the better results in the field IMO), but beginning this whole discussion with W3C&#x27;s RDF is wrong IMO when description logic as more or less variable-free fragments of first-order logic with desirable complexities was a thing in 1991 or earlier already.<p>Nit: careful with datomic. It&#x27;s clearly not Datalog, but an ad-hoc syntax whereas Datalog is a proper syntactic subset of Prolog. And while I don&#x27;t like SPARQL, it still gives quite good compat for querying large graph databases.')
