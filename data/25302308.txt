So I don&#x27;t think those limited use cases are a good explanation for gold&#x27;s value.<p>Also, Bitcoin was not necessarily designed to replace every fiat currency for every single everyday spending use case and it&#x27;s a strawman to imply that if it can&#x27;t do then it&#x27;s &quot;dead on arrival&quot;. There are plenty of important possible use cases which don&#x27;t presuppose the collapse of all fiat currencies.<p>Finally we don&#x27;t really know the volatility of Bitcoin in the long term. It hasn&#x27;t existed long enough. Looking at the price behavior in the first decade of its existence is not likely to give you a promising picture of any new asset class.')
