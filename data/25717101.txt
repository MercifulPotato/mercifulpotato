This obviously changed when the pandemic started, so I had to adjust to working from home (which is a small apartment with no dedicated work space).<p>I tried multiple technics over the past months to create a healthy work-life balance, and a here&#x27;re a few things that helped me: \n- Building routines for meaningful breaks: a short walk, quick workout, calling your family&#x2F;friends - something to pull you aside from the screen (scrolling twitter is not a meaningful break for me)\n- Blocking time for those routines by adding them to the calendar\n- Making the most of my work hours: stop all distractions and create triggers for deep work. My trigger is putting on noise cancelling earphones. And my family knows that I shouldn&#x27;t be distracted during that time.\n- When possible, scheduling calls in batches, almost back to back\n- Bonus: external accountability. My wife and I agree on a time when we go for a walk, have dinner, etc.<p>Generally, I feel good about my day when I have 2-3 hours of deep meaningful work and I followed through on my scheduled routines. Currently I&#x27;m trying to schedule pretty much my whole day, though it&#x27;s tough because often times I get unexpected meetings and things to work on. Another thing I struggle with is time estimations for certain tasks, because a lot of the work I do is open ended and doesn&#x27;t have clear boundaries (I can always do more).')
