I wonder, how many have actually worked in corporate IT security for a non-tech company with older employees?  Because things like this definitely happen on a daily basis.<p>Case in point: Pelosi&#x27;s screen was unlocked when that guy sat down, which was at least 20 minutes after she left.  That means that not only does she not lock her screen when she gets up, but the screen saver doesn&#x27;t even auto-lock after 20 minutes.')
