Then, lay several instruments out on screen and use your fingers to loop sequences of notes live on stage. The demo video ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Qk85IrgXRj0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Qk85IrgXRj0</a> ) shows how that part works (I&#x27;m not a musician).<p>I showed it on some music production forums and to friends who dabble... but I had made a terrible mistake from the beginning. Since my audio engine was custom, I didn&#x27;t have compatibility with existing VST plugins. No producer would use a synth app that didn&#x27;t support their favorite plugins, and no plugin developers would switch to a new system that had no users (my engine was also extensible). I looked into adding support, but VST&#x27;s architecture is too different from my mine... One suggestion was to remove the audio engine entirely and just make the app a MIDI front-end&#x2F;sequencer for other synths. This is something I might do in the future, though the limitations of the MIDI protocol would mean removing a lot of functionality. I&#x27;ll probably open-source the project some day, but I need to clean up some things in the code first.<p>I created a custom UI manager for the app and decided to split that off into a separate open-source Windows UI framework. I still work on it and have used it for other small utility apps: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;upbeatui" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;upbeatui</a>')
