Fast forward six years and I&#x27;m a club cyclist, where I learned a lot about teamwork that I think most programmers never really learn. When you understand something but have no shared context, there can be a lot of resistance to change.<p>Peculiar to cycling, hiking, rowing, and only a handful of other team activities is how concretely they demonstrate both failing or succeeding together, and how our strengths and weaknesses complement each other. A person having a good day can bolster the person having a bad one, via literal load shedding, and that feedback is immediate and obvious to all. With basketball, football, or many other sports, this can be pretty subtle, and may be lost entirely on spectators.')
