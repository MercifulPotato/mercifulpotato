But you have to prioritize.<p>Basically, barring “external” forces like cost overflow, customer unhappiness, or similar...stuff like that gets fixed at an equilibrium point between how much the problem hurts the dev, how adjacent to the codebase the devs current work is, and how interesting&#x2F;irritating the dev finds the problem.')
