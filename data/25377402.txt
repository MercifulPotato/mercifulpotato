Item(by='dap', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607628290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376438, text='&gt; I think the election of Trump may have made it possible for these cultural problems to come to light, the same way that (for example) women speaking up about sexual assault can empower others to do the same.<p>&gt; I personally think many companies have issues focusing on non-technical problems...This is not unique to Uber in any way, these problems show up to various degrees across companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others.<p>I agree with all that.  To me, this is about taking responsibility.  Our industry has shown a pattern of thinking poorly about non-technical problems while rolling out changes that affect millions of people.  That&#x27;s part of why so many people are angry at the tech industry -- and for good reason.<p>The thread is thoughtful in a lot of ways, but I get a whiff of not-taking-responsibility through some of it.  The first example struck me for whatever reason.  I get that people in 2016 didn&#x27;t necessarily know what was going on or how bad it was.  But I would expect that in 2020, we&#x27;d look back at 2016 as the time when serious issues beneath the surface were about to explode as a result of choices made at Uber, not some golden time before external forces made life hard for Uber.  I don&#x27;t mean to be too hard on the author or even Uber (and after all, this was a casual tweet thread).  I think it&#x27;s a widespread challenge for our culture in the tech industry.')
