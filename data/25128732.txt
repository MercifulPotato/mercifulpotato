Having used a touchscreen laptop for the last 6+ years, I assure you there&#x27;s a place for touch in laptops.  The arguments against touch on a laptop are much like arguing against any other peripheral used.<p>&gt; Try reaching your hand up to touch your monitor and hold it there for a minute. Now try pretending youâ€™ll do this for an 8 hour workday.<p>This is asinine and you know it.  That&#x27;s akin to arguing that we shouldn&#x27;t use mice or touchpads by saying &quot;just try typing with an onscreen keyboard all day using point and click.&quot;')
