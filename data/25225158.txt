I wish the platform (http&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;css) could support this natively without any need for javascript or tricks of any sort. Some of it looks like irreducible complexity: particularly “choosing a fallback font that closely matches the size and style of the eventual font”. The platform can’t do that for you. But surely a “sufficiently advanced” HTML&#x2F;css will be just a little wiser and let you say, with one well placed keyword, “this is the font I want to use, but don’t wait for it, use it once it’s available and use this one in the meantime.”<p>(And I’m thinking that inlining the fonts as base64 encoded stuff might be more optimum and prevent stuff moving around. It’s such a tiny point, I don’t think engineers everywhere in the world should all have to spend effort on this.)')
