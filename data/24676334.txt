I have done the same thing, gone off-and-on my RX I think 3 times now.<p>Whenever I wanted to get back on, I just found a random psychiatrist or clinic and said &quot;Can you please renew my ADHD Rx? It&#x27;s starting to really negatively impact my work performance.&quot; and then they&#x27;d say okay, sure.<p>This was in Colorado though, Boulder&#x2F;Denver area. Half the university students and tech workers had prescriptions so it might be a biased area. Not sure what it might be like other places in the US.<p>Sorry you&#x27;re going through that nonsense, if you want to shell out the money you can google &quot;ADHD specialist&quot; and pick a psychiatrist from the list that pops up. Will cost you ~$300-500 (IME) out of pocket for consultation and re-diagnosis.')
