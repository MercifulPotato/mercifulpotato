The norm is corporate programmers taking whatever code they can and using it.<p>The norm is a cleanroom implementation of open source software written because companies would rather pay for that implementation rather than muck around in open source licensed code (I watched Oracle do this with several MySQL feature&#x2F;bug fix patches).<p>And so here we are.
