Markets are the one place we’re talking can make it happen. And even though you should assume this, CNBC and Ackman perform the legal dance of warning that he may have long or short positions in any or all things discussed etc.<p>As to Robinhood, IB and TD, the Bloomberg reporting that DTCC (clearinghouse for trades) was demanding more collateral for the high volatility names and the retail brokers were facing a heard time coming up with it is pretty compelling.
