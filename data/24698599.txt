Hospitals like TMC managed by making &quot;surge&quot; ICU beds and bringing in resources from out of state. We don&#x27;t know the impact of these surges on quality of care, but Texas was losing a 7-day average of 325 lives per day at its peak in August. These happen to be the states with a combination of high population density cities and some of the fewest COVID countermeasures; more rural states and states with stronger countermeasures didn&#x27;t approach capacity.')
