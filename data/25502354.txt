It is likely fairly widespread. I also disagree with the other comment on the thread saying it is your family&#x27;s fault â€“ it&#x27;s not.<p>If Facebook somehow disappeared overnight, would Fox, OANN and the like throw up their hands and stop? Or would your family just find them on YouTube or Twitter some other platform instead? Or does your family already watch those news sources on TV? Facebook&#x27;s news feed is certainly a part of the problem here, but it is not the underlying cause for polarization. I haven&#x27;t studied in depth where the distrust in our institutions is coming from, but as long as there are people seeking to capitalize on it, they _will_ capitalize on it.<p>The reason I am bringing this up and getting a bunch of downvotes is not because I like Facebook. It is because I want to make sure we focus on the right solutions to solve the actual problem at hand. So, if the problem is radicalization specifically, algorithmic news feeds (plural) are an important piece to focus on. But it&#x27;s not the entire story: the rest of the news media and other platforms also have things to fix.<p>If the problem is a concentration of monopoly power, or blatant abuses of privacy, then those bring different problems that warrant different solutions. People like to combine all of these concerns into a single bucket and say &quot;Facebook is bad&quot; but when we do that we lose sight of the other trouble makers: the news networks, the other tech monopolies, and credit card companies who actually sell user data.<p>Despite all of this, I still think a global network of people connected with real identity has a lot of benefits for society. Maybe a better way of phrasing it: if you haven&#x27;t deleted your Facebook account yet, then why not?')
