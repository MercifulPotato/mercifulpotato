Global warming, if\nIt played a part in those fires, played a small one. The biggest issues are failed forest management practices combined with expansion and development into previously undeveloped land.<p>As part of 4+ Year process to get my timberland thinned to reduce fire danger (through the state approval process which is terrible, but finally happened), it came up that historically - based on archeological data - fires used to happen in this area every 10 to 15 years. It has been 115 years since a fire happened on the property.<p>Massive buildup of fuel (due to suppressing small\nFires and not allowing cutting or timber harvesting), combined with many people living and using power equipment in an area that historically was thinly populated means massive fires when they do happen. Which is what you saw.')
