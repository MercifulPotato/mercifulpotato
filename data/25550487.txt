Tang were the first two people to earn a doctorate in computer science in the United States&#x27;.. &#x27;After finishing her doctorate in 1965, Keller founded the computer science department at Clarke College (now Clarke University), a Catholic women&#x27;s college founded by Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Dubuque, Iowa. That same year, that National Science Foundation awarded her a grant of $25,000 payable over two years for &quot;instructional equipment for undergraduate education.. &#x27;in 1975, Keller declared &quot;we have not fully used a computer as the greatest interdisciplinary tool that has been invented to date&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;d agree with her assessment even today. How much in the last year of working online with students have we even broken a single barrier of real change that won&#x27;t be rolled back once we open classrooms again? What a lost opportunity to have built a generation of students who understand computers above video chat and Twitch. We could have put our collective energy into using this opportunity of remote learning to develop long-term educational programs that teach about the very tool they rely on. We failed them. When I was young you needed some awareness of how computers worked to use them. Is it fair that we don&#x27;t teach computer science as a core curriculum?')
