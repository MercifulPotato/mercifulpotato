Had a company like GM been allowed to fail suddenly then entire major cities would have seen unemployment go up 3x or 4x, and that&#x27;s a lot of people who don&#x27;t have jobs in a city that just lost it&#x27;s primary industry. Most of those people are not white collar professionals who can hop over to SV - there are very limited jobs building cars.<p>As a country where we do sometimes engage in non-capitalist behavior (FDIC insurance, jobs programs, so on) it&#x27;s sometimes more efficient to prop up a bad business and let it fail slowly then to entirely take a hands off approach.')
