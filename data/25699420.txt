Certainly no Bluetooth headset though, sound quality is bad on linux as of now.<p>If you don&#x27;t have meetings all day I can recommend the Logitech H800. Build quality and comfort are meh, but: It&#x27;s small, you can use a wireless dongle with linux, switch easily between computer and phone by turning it to bluetooth on the headset and sound is decent.')
