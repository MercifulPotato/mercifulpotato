I&#x27;m a Pascal programmer. I create objects when a program starts, delete them at the end.<p>Then I guess you should instead say you’re a ‘single-shot, compiler-like batch job executable’ programmer. I imagine that colours your perception more than the choice of programming language itself. If you were to write a program that has to manipulate deeply nested data structures, or a long-running service that has to acquire and dispose of an unbounded number of various kinds of resources over the course of its runtime in a deterministic manner, you’d start longing for an ownership system very quickly.')
