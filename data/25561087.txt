It makes vacancy &amp; speculation a money-losing endeavor (the same way that inflation makes holding cash a money-losing endeavor), and creates political pressure to repeal zoning laws and create <i>smart</i> public improvements, ones that will increase the value of the land more than their cost.  Its value as a revenue source is secondary, and many proponents (of the geolibertarian sort) actually support <i>lower</i> tax receipts and <i>smaller</i> government.')
