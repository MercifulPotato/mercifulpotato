That very question shows how weak your argument is. That you have to clutch at straws to prove he is an autocrat.<p>Now let me ask you this: Is Putin an autocrat? You can give countless examples of why he is. Is Xi an autocrat? You can give countless examples of why he is. Is Kim Jong-un an autocrat? You can give countless examples of why he is. From targeted assassinations of opposition leaders to detention&#x2F;containment&#x2F;concentration&#x2F;re-education camps you have every single reason to label them autocratic. Can you give examples of Trump being an autocrat? The literal definition of &quot;autocrat&quot; is &quot;someone who has absolute power&quot;. Trump doesn&#x27;t have absolute power. So how does it make him an autocrat?<p>There are literally many autocrats in this World you can compare against. Trump is definitely a loud mouth. No doubt about it. And he is crass in the way he speaks. He doesn&#x27;t have a likeable personality. He is a narcissist.<p>His entire tenure was literally crying about how media treats him, how many in his own party don&#x27;t support him (RINOs) and how investigations against him vis-a-vis Russian collusion was based on a hoax. Can you name one autocrat who cried about how powerless he is? Have you seen Putin talk this way? Xi talk this way? What about Hitler? Name one autocrat who comes to your mind who has exhibited this behaviour. You can&#x27;t. This in no way sounds like an autocrat. An autocrat is never this weak and defeatist.<p>The first thing an autocrat would do is muscle the media. Media thrived under the Trump regime. Constantly berating and attacking him. If this had happened in China or Russia that media house would be non-existent the very next second with all journalists mysteriously missing. If Jack Ma isn&#x27;t safe you think journalists would be? No ways. This is autocracy for you.<p>Heck, Trump ran his entire 2016 campaign on the slogan of &quot;Lock her up&quot;. Did he do it? On the contrary, the entire scandal was hushed up and the investigative agencies instead focused on Trump&#x27;s supposed collusion with Russia and Ukraine. I can bet my right limb no investigative agency will investigate Biden on his ties with Ukraine. Why? Because things are back to how it always was. Trump was just an aberration. History will be kinder to him because right now emotions are high and no one wants to see things without filters.')
