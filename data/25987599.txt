Item(by='esperent', descendants=None, kids=[25995862], score=None, time=1612177486, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25984425, text='&gt;  I can see that some companies regularly behave better than others, and I&#x27;m happy to act on that reputation<p>This is a bogus line of thinking. For example, Apple have a very strong stance on privacy compared to FB and Google.<p>Does this mean they are more moral or trustworthy when it comes to privacy, or that you should trust them to remain focussed on privacy in the future?<p>Not at all! Their focus on privacy is a smart business model that they use to differentiate themselves from the competition. As soon as it stops being a smart model, or a better model presents itself, under the bus their focus on privacy will go. Apple being focussed on privacy right now should not be taken as them having a good reputation. They do not care about your privacy. They care about you buying their products. The same applies to all apparent &quot;good&quot; or &quot;moral&quot;  behavior of any large company. It&#x27;s not genuine morality, they don&#x27;t care about the benefits to you or society at large. They just want you to generate money for them.<p>By all means, choose products from a company whose presented morality currently aligns with yours. But don&#x27;t believe that morality is genuine, and don&#x27;t get hooked on that company. Instead use them, just as they are using you, for as long as it benefits you, then dump them in a second when they inevitably change... Just as they would do to you.')
