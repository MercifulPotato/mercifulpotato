When in reality I was just dreading going home. A coworker that I barely new dropped by my desk and said &quot;Things aren&#x27;t going well at home, are they? Me either.&quot;  We proceeded to head across the street to a bar to share stories. It helped immensely at that time.<p>I make an effort to pay it forward. If you see someone in the office at all hours, especially when wfh is an option, odds are good things aren&#x27;t going great for them. Even just a simple &quot;How are things going with you?&quot; over the water cooler can go a long ways.')
