In particular, there is no cross-reactivity of antibodies against other coronaviruses. This is the exact opposite of what was observed with cellular responses, which IMO means that cell-based immunity plays a larger role with coronaviruses. It&#x27;s a pity the discussion section of the paper doesn&#x27;t mention this.')
