But you don&#x27;t mention what those differences are. What are they?<p>I also don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;d use a CI pipeline for simple projects where you are typically the only developer. Run tests locally, if everything is fine push to prod.<p>I use git with a small script to roll out to production. When I execute the script on the server, it stops all services, pulls the latest code from Git, applies Django migrations, and starts everything up again. I use desk [1] to make this as simple as a single `release` command in my local shell.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jamesob&#x2F;desk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jamesob&#x2F;desk</a>')
