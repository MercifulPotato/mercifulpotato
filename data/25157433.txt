The expected value is therefore $130 x 1&#x2F;290m = $0.44 , for an investment of about $10 - very small indeed.<p>The small chance at escaping poverty is great, but the money is not well spent. if that&#x27;s how they really think, then they will find that escaping is even harder.<p>Investing is not gambling - investing generates equity&#x2F;capital growth. You only &quot;lost&quot; in investing if the asset crumbles. By investing in QQQ, it&#x27;s concentrated, but it&#x27;s unlikely everything in the ETF crumbles at the same time. So the chance of loss is much lower than lottery.')
