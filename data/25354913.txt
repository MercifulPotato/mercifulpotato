I don&#x27;t think this is a strawman.<p>Word allows you to adjust the indentation on numbered lists so that the text in a paragraph is flush with the left margin. In Word 365 there are at least two ways to do this:<p>1. View -&gt; Show -&gt; [check Ruler] -&gt; [Adjust the indentation on the ruler]<p>2. Layout -&gt; Paragraph -&gt; [click lower right arrow] Paragraph Settings -&gt; Indentation -&gt; change Special from (hanging) to (none), or change the &quot;By:&quot; value to 0<p>So the author&#x27;s motivating example doesn&#x27;t seem to be a particularly fair criticism of Word.')
