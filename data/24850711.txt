That&#x27;s a technical debt ROI discussion, the kind that we always have, and sometimes the business value just doesn&#x27;t support the rewrite.<p>However, even in an ideal data model, I don&#x27;t always agree that multiple applications accessing the application&#x27;s database is bad. That&#x27;s a matter of being thoughtful and communicative, instead of just wantonly running &quot;rails g migration&quot; every time you need to implement a feature (that&#x27;s true of Monorails even). FWIW, we&#x27;ve never had any real issues with multiple applications accessing our single database.')
