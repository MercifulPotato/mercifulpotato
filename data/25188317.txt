Things like microk8s, Rancher or GKE&#x2F;EKS make it a lot easier to set up than it used to be. Deploying your app is then just a simple Helm chart, or another way of getting deployments out. If I was running any kind of business that was making more than zero dollars I would absolutely go with Kubernetes. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as complicated as people think at any rate, and it lets you use premade Helm charts which can simplify the deployment of things like Clickhouse.')
