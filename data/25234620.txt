Item(by='rytor718', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606530268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25232994, text='This is an almost ironic response to the article for a couple of reasons that caught my attention (read: not a bad response, just somewhat ironic).<p>The first was mentioned by someone else in the thread whose response i can&#x27;t find again due to opening this in a different device: why is it more valuable to hear advice from winners than, say, a failure from their mother&#x27;s basement as you put it? In relation to the article&#x27;s key point, that&#x27;s very conventional (hence the irony) :)<p>The second thing I noticed was the assumption that a successful person knows their success or could explain it to anyone -- I haven&#x27;t found this to be true and can personally attest that I can rarely explain my own to someone else. But there are definitely other reasons I can&#x27;t, not least I&#x27;m just a poor explainer.<p>I found the article intriguing for a lot of reasons, not least of which is I always see a bit of myself in nerd content like it. I found myself thinking of all the conventions I absorb and recall when I realized I&#x27;d absorbed them. On the other hand, I&#x27;m renown in my family and among friends as completely unconventional and am generally The Weirdo. The resolution of that tension is intensely interesting to me. How I see all the conventions in myself, but near no one else seems to see it that way at all.<p>More to the point: given the option, I&#x27;ll read the advice of a failure in a heartbeat and ponder it for days. I&#x27;ve never found advice from &quot;pros&quot; or success stories to be nearly as interesting. If you can, explain why opinions from winners is more interesting to you. Genuinely intrigued and curious to hear a different perspective.')
