I can tell you that manufacturers (BMW, VW,...) found out that it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to manufacture the same physical engine and just limit it in software for different &#x27;levels&#x27;.<p>BMW E90 series for example, from around 2008 onwards the 116d and 118d have exactly the same engine (per BMW part numbers mind you) but a different power output, even 120d only has one part difference (the ones with N47 engine that is). On VW part, new-er VW Caddy and VW Transporter with diesel engine option(s) have the same physical engine (in the model year) with widely different power outputs -&gt; because they differentiate it for different segments via software.<p>And even moving from that, because of regional rules in NL for example, the cars with up to 140HP are prelevant and ofcourse VAG is not making a new engine just for NL, they limit one of their exsisting ones.<p>So yes, I believe that cars like this can be safely tuned without _any_ significant unwanted consequences for the longeviety of the engine&#x2F;car. Mostly because the maps&#x2F;factors can be adapted from their siblings with more factory power.<p>Regarding the black smoke&#x2F;soot - no I believe that this is a (very) bad tune or something physicaly wrong with the car. It could be that they removed the DPF&#x2F;EGR for some reason or something like that. But this is a whole other can of worms.')
