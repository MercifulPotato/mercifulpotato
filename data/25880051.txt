You get enough free premium currency to get a 100% chance of getting at least one top-tier character (on average you&#x27;ll get two or three) (and obviously many excellent but not top-tier ones besides) as long as you spend it carefully, and every month or two there&#x27;s a free really good character too.<p>It&#x27;s definitely much more PC-oriented than mobile oriented, though.<p>For a mainly single player game the monetization is not bad.<p>That said it still isn&#x27;t optimal, and the issue of power-creep is not even taken into account yet')
