That might be true for most people (and for the researchers), but I&#x27;m aphantasic and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a visual dream. My visual cortex seems to work perfectly fine on waking (though I do find a sunrise alarm clock useful in winter). If this is typical among aphantasics then I don&#x27;t see how the theory can possibly be correct.')
