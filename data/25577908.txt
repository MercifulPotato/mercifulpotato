No system of direct democracy has worked in the history of the world.  Even here on HN, it is moderated, and some people have more voice than others.<p>&gt; Your claim is that they are too unintelligent to understand the long term ramifications of their choices.<p>It&#x27;s not that they aren&#x27;t intelligent enough, it&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t have the background to make an informed decision.  A politician specializes in understanding the ramifications of law (at least in theory).  You as a voter do not have time to learn everything necessary to understand what you are voting for.  It&#x27;s a full time job and then some.<p>Just like you are perfectly capable of fixing your own car, but you don&#x27;t have the time to spend learning how to do it properly.  Politicians focus on policy and their long term affects, and you do whatever it is that you do.<p>&gt; Why is one person one vote a bad rule, and how many votes should you get as opposed to mine?<p>One person one vote is fine for selecting representation, but we select representation specifically because we expect them to be experts in policy.')
