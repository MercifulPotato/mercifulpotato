While certainly these can (and often are) ties together in religion, values can exist without any eschatology.<p>&gt; did you just make up &quot;factual belief&quot;?<p>No.<p>&gt; I mean it is a tautology on many levels.<p>It can&#x27;t be a tautology because it&#x27;s not a proposition, much less one that is true by definition. You might mean to say it&#x27;s redundant, but it&#x27;s not that. A factual belief is a belief on a question of fact, as opposed, e.g., to a question of values.')
