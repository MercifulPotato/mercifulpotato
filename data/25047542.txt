Item(by='Aachen', descendants=None, kids=[25048116], score=None, time=1605024630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25046977, text='The definition of personally identifiable information, as I recall it, is info for which there exists a party that can trace it back to a person. Just because I can&#x27;t find your name using your social security number doesn&#x27;t mean that your SSN is not PII, because there exists a party that knows whom this SSN belongs to.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s not as if CGNAT is an anonymisation technology. Crooks would love it: download and upload whatever you want and nobody can ever tell it was you! No, ISPs log who used which IP and port at which time.<p>Processing the IP address and port number is essential for TCP to work, and even if you don&#x27;t store it and filter it on your network&#x27;s edge, it&#x27;s still covered by privacy lawâ€“technically. A judge might not award you damages, but technically the processing (not storage) of personal data is also covered by privacy laws.<p>Of course, if they don&#x27;t store it then I would consider it anonymous. The question to me is what they do with the data. But it&#x27;s not correct to assume that it&#x27;s anonymous just because you share an IP address with others, or to assume that everyone has CGNAT. Where I live a personal address is the default.')
