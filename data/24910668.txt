When crime occurs, we review the CCTV footage. We often capture footage of people behaving badly and even breaking the law. We curse under our breaths at the terrible acts these people have committed. Next we try to identify the people. This is the hard part. Normally, we have no way of identifying the people captured on film. Perhaps if our company permitted us, we could upload this footage to say, Youtube and let the hive algorithm attack and identify. Until then, our film will end up on a hard drive until forgotten about and deleted. When the cameras are all doing facial recognition we should worry. Until then, I think, there is a certain degree of anonomity when captured by CCTV surveillance cameras.')
