So you were in detention&#x2F;arrest (insert lawyer debate here) as in you were physically stopped.  At that point the cop can search your car.  He probably did.  He almost certainly looked in the back seat and counted the number of passengers&#x2F;objects there, something he could not do as you sped by.  He then examined your life in that he looked to see if you had outstanding warrants and whether your insurance&#x2F;license&#x2F;registration was all in order.  Had he wanted to, he could remove you from the vehicle and pat you down for weapons.  Speeding, being a crime, allowed him to do these things that parking tickets do not.')
