As the models are becoming more sophisticated and adapting machine learning, heavier scrutiny is coming from regulators.<p>For good reasons, guardrails are required to not only protect against discrimination, but also so proxies can&#x27;t be used either. For example, we can&#x27;t include race in health and life underwriting decisions. But since zip code is highly predictive of race, that attribute must also be excluded.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with banking regulations, but imagine similar policies are applied. In these cases, being able to demonstrate that a model isn&#x27;t discriminating is not only ethically important, but in many cases is legally required.')
