(Several countries with major hunger issues sit towards the very low end, I wouldn&#x27;t use as a picture of health.)<p>HFCS may be a uniquely US problem, but foods with it are also exported, which explains why countries like Canada sit relatively high as well.<p>It was a life-changing experience for me to visit EU countries, where orange Fanta contains 11% orange juice (and vaguely looks like orange juice), compared to the dark orange nearly-pure-sugar soda we drink here. Even McDonald&#x27;s food was leaner, less greasy, and closer to what you&#x27;d get at a quality restaurant.')
