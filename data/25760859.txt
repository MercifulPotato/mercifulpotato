( Also not serving in the IDF is a plus for most cynical people since you get to go to university immediately (which they do, in Tel-Aviv)). And what you linked is not relevant since all of it is public law - not targeting any population and not &quot;subtle&quot; ways to hide &quot;the apartheid&quot; as suggested by the government. Are there racist people using any tool to discriminate? Yes.')
