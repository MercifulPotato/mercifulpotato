Anyone writing articles about it is uninformed and you should ignore them. (However, it&#x27;s also not true that all ISAs perform the same. x86-64 actually performs pretty well though and has good memory density - see Linus&#x27;s old rants about this.)<p>ARM64 is a good ISA but not because it&#x27;s RISC, some of the good parts are actually moving away from RISCness like complex address operands.')
