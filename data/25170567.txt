I personally would quit my job if I had to return to the office and the reasons have all been repeated by others already. Mainly, the office environment is just worse than what you can setup at home. I personally don&#x27;t like sitting in an open space around others. I can communicate to whoever I wish by slack or video chat from home. Anyway I&#x27;m hopeful this goes on for another year and until I have to find another job if managers get their ill way.')
