Website says it works with M1 macs, but you only get one screen. It delivers power (87W), network, and has a bunch of ports, including allowing thunderbolt daisy-chaining. It has a 10Gb&#x2F;s usb-c port, and five 5Gb&#x2F;s usb ports. That uses a single port. So if you had, e.g. two TB3 external drives, you could plug one into the dock, and one into the other port on the Mac. This dock might be overkill for you (its $250), but I used it to get dual external screens on my MBP before I said &quot;fuck it&quot; and bought an eGPU.')
