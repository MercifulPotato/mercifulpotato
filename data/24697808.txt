I&#x27;m a programmer, my wife is a (proffessionnal) vegetable grower.<p>At first glance I can tell the site is really helpful, but here are things I&#x27;d like to see too, in addition to other comments : \n- where does the data come from ?\n- more specific about different cultivars\n- i18n. I think most permaculture websites are very focused on english-speaking people at the moment. Being open to other language would definetly be an edge. (Related : you can refer to the latin name of the plant which is usually common accross language)<p>About the planting &amp; planning software, there is a very good open source one [1] used by proffessionals here in France. So maybe you could partner with it instead of trying to reinvent the wheel !<p>That said, congratulation for your work so far, all the best for the rest !<p>[1] : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;framagit.org&#x2F;ah&#x2F;qrop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;framagit.org&#x2F;ah&#x2F;qrop</a>')
