Or more that it’s hard to have motivation or purpose without goals. Also I realize that this is a fairly simple topic that may be obvious to others, I’ve just started realizing that this may be the core of some personal issues that I’ve been dealing with for the whole of my life.<p>For the longest time I’ve felt burned out or depressed and I thought it was from doing too much of my job (swe). Instead I’ve realized that I haven’t had goals pulling me, or motivating me to do the things I do on the daily. Instead I’ve been running from the fear of failure; be that in making it through college, or somehow losing my job. It turns out that fear is an effective, but terrible “motivator”. It also turns out that it’s hard to be happy when you’re running away from something instead of towards something.<p>This thread first started for me when I saw the hn discussion here:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23932795" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23932795</a> and then further became more clear to me after some deep discussions with my friend and his showing me this video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=E7RgtMGL7CA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=E7RgtMGL7CA</a>.<p>The thing is I’ve had goals, but nothing that I could use as a means for helping to pull me through life. Goals like staying fit, or reaching FIRE are good goals, but in themselves it’s hard to derive a sense of meaning.<p>Making goals for yourself that allow you to tell a story about the things you’re doing can help with motivation; at least I think that’s the trick as I haven’t been doing that. This is the part I’m learning about right now and need to figure out to change the way I’m going through life.')
