The state I moved to has an income tax. However after adjusting for lower income tax, cost of living [0], and my RSU&#x27;s being unaffected, I ended up slightly ahead.<p>After a couple years, the company did start adjusting RSU refreshes to reduce grants to people outside of top cities. Even with that though, I&#x27;m still breaking even or ahead.<p>Just another voice saying that you need to do the math and think about your company&#x27;s policies. You can only account for changing policies so much.<p>I got in at a time when the deal was very good. Today, my salary reduction would be much higher (2-3x the reduction) and all other comp has caught up to being location adjusted. But, the deal at my company can still be good as long as you check the math.<p>Another gotcha to watch out for is benefits. Make sure the company health care plan(s) have doctors in-network where you are moving. Since health care networks are very regional, this is not always the case. I had to switch plans.<p>Also, you won&#x27;t be able to use a lot of the other tech company perks that people don&#x27;t price in a lot: free food&#x2F;snacks&#x2F;drinks, gym, spa, health center, daycare, etc. Though some company&#x27;s will give you money to get a gym membership, but probably not the other things.<p>[0] The cost of living savings mostly came from housing. But nearly everything local (grocery&#x27;s, restaurants, gas, etc) is 30% to 50% cheaper where I&#x27;m at, which adds up quick too.')
