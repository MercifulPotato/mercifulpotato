My use-cases don’t align to that.<p>My whole photo-taking process tends to be:<p>* take a bunch of pictures<p>* find the best ones<p>* further refine the best ones until it’s a reasonable number<p>* photoshop those to how I want them<p>* share the narrow list<p>And most of my photos come from events, so they’re in folders based on events.<p>If your goal is virtual galleries and avoiding duplication, this is sufficiently different I don’t think I can give suggestions there, I’m sorry')
