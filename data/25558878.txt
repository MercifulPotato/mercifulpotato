My issue with the public forum and ritual applause is that it becomes mechanical. In my experience, people are often left out or events are forgotten. I was sometimes baffled at the items that were being expressed, it felt a bit political even. Not saying a public forum like this can&#x27;t work, just that it seems easy for it to go awry.<p>I&#x27;ve been publicly recognized and appreciated it, I&#x27;ve also received quiet thank you notes. I know I like the latter more.')
