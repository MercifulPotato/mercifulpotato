You were lucky to get a position out of your first batch of applications.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; My first jobs were low paying roles in non-tech companies.<p>Strong hint that a major factor in you getting the job was that you were cheap and that the companies were struggling to fill the position. Expect the next jobs to be get exponentially harder to get as you try to find a job that pays more and companies have much higher expectations.<p>P.S. The poster was applying to remote jobs which are orders of magnitude more competitive to get. It&#x27;s almost a miracle he even got an offer as a new graduate.')
