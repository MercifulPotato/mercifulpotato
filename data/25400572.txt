I still have a hard drive with the original Red Hat 6 based on System V init, not the later v6 based on Upstart.<p>There was a great feeling of abandonment then that is nostalgic in the death of CentOS now.<p>In the years that have passed, I saw a few licenses purchased in my workplace, then support suddenly stopped by corporate sources who instructed all license holders to convert our installs to Oracle Linux support.<p>I remembered my feeling of abandonment by Red Hat, ran the script without complaint, and all was well.<p>In later years, focus returned to Red Hat licensing, and I was strongly encouraged to reinstall my Oracle Linux systems (which had grown greatly, as they were free). I resisted vehemently, objecting to an inferior kernel (compared to the UEK), reduced hardware support, and the pointless inconvenience of license keys, activation, and renewals for a product of generally lower quality.<p>Fortunately, I have avoided this inconvenience.<p>In light of the decades of Red Hat&#x27;s behavior, I will say one thing: you reap what you sow.')
