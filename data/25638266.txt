I&#x27;ve never been healthier because most of last year I had time to go for daily exercise instead of sitting in a car commuting.  I took my young daughter out with me a lot of the time.  My wife also took advantage of the daily outings.  Our mental health is probably better than it has ever been because we get to spend more time with each other rather than with a bunch of guys in the office.<p>Education wise, my wife has used the opportunity to dip her toes into teaching - which is something she always wanted to try.  I realise not everyone wants to be a teacher, but you never know.<p>The situation is what you make of it.')
