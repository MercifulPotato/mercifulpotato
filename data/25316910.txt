Just pure and simple what the QM equations say.<p>There is another interpretation that can also be considered as close as possible to no-added sugars, the &quot;ensemble interpretation&quot;. In &quot;ensemble interpretation&quot; the formulation of QM is understood to be applicable to ensembles of similarly prepared systems. In this interpretation QM is not really applicable to a single system by construction.<p>In MWI you accept it can be applied to a single system but you have to pay as a price that the system can branch into many different ones simultaneously (the &quot;many worlds&quot;).<p>It&#x27;s a kind of pick your own poison situation.')
