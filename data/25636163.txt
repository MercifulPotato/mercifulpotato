Item(by='jacobr1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609786643, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25635796, text='&gt; They aren&#x27;t a UK company, they&#x27;re an Italian company. Per the article it was sold in 2002.<p>That isn&#x27;t clear. I suspect they still are a UK company, with 100% ownership from the parent Italian company. The distinction is relevant (if true) in exactly cases just like this. The alternative would be a sale of assets of the former child company and filing a dissolution of the same company. They likely didn&#x27;t do that, but might have. This means that probably can restructure their business so that UK orders stay within the UK subsidiary.')
