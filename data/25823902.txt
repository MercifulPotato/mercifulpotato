She would not open the door for over an hour so they eventually went into her home with more aggressive force.  Her entire story for 2020 has been driven by her original termination due to her conflict with the data science team.  She was making updates to the dashboard without their permission or approval and was terminated.  Then when this happened she made a claim that is not substantiated that her conflict with the data science team was driven by a desire to hide data from the public on the part of the state.  This was in May.  The figures she claims were being hidden never materialized because it was never actually true.  she had claimed tens of thousands more people had died than the state was reporting which was completely untrue.<p>The reality is that the partisan press and numerous partisan actors used her as a useful idiot to attack their political enemy Governor DeSantis.  All of this was around this narrative that Florida must have far more deaths and infections because they were opening up more aggressively than other states with high death counts and infection rates.  The reality is that the data is pretty clear and states like California aren&#x27;t doing better than Florida in any metrics.<p>The most problematic element to all of this has been her shameless self-promotion that appeals to conspiracy theorist and others.  And let&#x27;s be clear: the media started calling her a data scientist to bolster credibility for their partisan attacks against DeSantis and that&#x27;s the primary reason.<p>I would welcome any HN reader to look at the state statistics on covid especially per capita and wonder why the media treatment of certain states has been completely different than other states that have identical statistics.  I have done so and the biggest driver I have found has been the political party of the governor.  Illinois has not done well.  California is not doing well.  Florida has done far better than it should given its elderly population.  Georgia is not markedly worse than other states, but media called their decision to open in the spring &quot;an experiment in human sacrifice.&quot;')
