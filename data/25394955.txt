YouTube was a medium of expression. In that sense your question is like &quot;Why should the paper company allow ideas to be written on their paper that they disagree with?&quot;<p>Of course YouTube does also take a editorial role. As both a platform and a publisher, we should allow them to stop giving recommendations for things that don&#x27;t align politically.<p>By taking the more extreme step of taking down videos, they are balking on their self expressed purpose of being a platform for digital expression.<p>There are several people in my life who I completely disagree with politically. At the same time, I&#x27;m grateful that I can hear their perspective. YouTube is no longer supporting this dynamic.<p>I&#x27;m already seeing folks signing up for social networks that have less censorship, I think alternative video hosting platforms may increase too.')
