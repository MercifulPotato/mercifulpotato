Before, they were essentially the way you publish video on the web. From their app description: &quot;upload original content, and share it all with friends, family, and the world on YouTube.&quot; YouTube was a medium of expression, not just a publisher. In that sense your question is like &quot;Why should the paper company allow ideas to be written on their paper that they disagree with?&quot; Of course YouTube does also take a editorial role. As both a platform and a publisher, we should allow them to stop giving recommendations for things that don&#x27;t align politically. But by taking the more extreme step of taking down videos and refusing to host, they are balking on their self expressed purpose of being a platform for digital expression. It&#x27;s their right, but it&#x27;s starting to become pretty one sided. I know several people who I completely disagree with politically but at the same time, I&#x27;m grateful that I can hear their perspective. YouTube is no longer supporting this dynamic. I&#x27;m already seeing folks signing up for social networks that have less censorship, I think alternative video hosting platforms may increase too.')
