They don&#x27;t seem scared about biting off complexity today when they know they&#x27;ll need it eventually.<p>The other side of this is that we&#x27;re now in a window where performance-sensitive developers are motivated to start looking at NEON and adding NEON support to existing SIMD code. Which is fine... but if SVE is the long-term answer and SVE will (as its goal) support better performance scaling of SIMD code with future processors, it seems like there&#x27;s a real motivation for Apple to push developers into doing things &quot;the right way&quot; as early as possible.<p>Assuming (!) that SVE is indeed the future, missing it for the first few generations is shades of 32-bit-Intel-for-Apple -- a stop-gap with some remarkably long-tailed support costs, compared to jumping straight to x64.')
