The all-staff group address goes in the BCC and the person usually puts themself in the To address. This cuts down on the useless Reply All &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;me too&quot; messages going back to all staff. There are other ways to prevent that, but this has been one of the few legitimate and above-board uses of BCC that I have come across.')
