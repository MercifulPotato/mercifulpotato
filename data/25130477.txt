Item(by='LiquidSky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605650249, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25129108, text='&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t know how to reconcile being told that voter fraud is exceedingly rare when I see articles like this where individuals and teams of people are caught falsifying information on this scale.<p>Why? These articles are incidents of exceedingly rare voter fraud. And it&#x27;s worth noting that this wasn&#x27;t an example of what, say, the Trump campaign is alleging (i.e., that ballots have been falsified), but rather an fraudulent attempt at registration (and also nomination as a candidate). No one argues that voting irregularities never happen anywhere, just that the system is fine and these incidents are, indeed rare and caught when they happen.<p>&gt;If the process for identifying fraud isn&#x27;t particularly robust or thorough, how can you legitimately say fraud is extremely rare?<p>This question makes the assumption that the process for identifying fraud &quot;isn&#x27;t particularly robust or thorough&quot;, which in turn seems to be begging the question.')
