The customer is the insurance companies like Aetna (&quot;payers&quot;)<p>This sounds frighteningly like the &quot;overmind&quot; theory of AI, wherein a system (perhaps the internet) becomes to higher order brain functions what they themselves became to the brain stem. The higher order systems pass currency (data, money) between themselves, over the heads of the lower order entities, making decisions that may or may not be in the latter&#x27;s best interests (even though there is a clear hierarchy of existence that relies on the latter). Essentially, we&#x27;ve created a system where massive systems negotiate our life and death outside the public&#x27;s purview and influence. Musk et al. warn about the dangers of AI, but with our existing systems, it seems that we&#x27;re already there.')
