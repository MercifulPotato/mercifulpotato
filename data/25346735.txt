I kind of new this day was coming. I work in engineering &#x2F; science (not comp. sci or developing) and all our software vendors are Windows or RHEL support only. Although if you know your way around linux any flavor will do, but RHEL is the &quot;standard&quot; for support. It&#x27;s kind of like &quot;insurance.&quot; We expect this to compile &#x2F; work for RHEL and NOTHING else, because RHEL is stable, predictable, and boring.<p>I&#x27;ve run most all the flavors of linux and am on the Ubuntu train. Actually, I flirted with the RHEL &#x2F; Fedora &#x2F; CentOS workflows as current as last year for a few months. I love the predictability and stability of RHEL on workstations and the thought of something new on a laptop or what not. While I respect the hell out of RH and their products, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. Fedora is WAY too experimental, lacks supports, and is prone to your system breaking. I know, I know, it is pretty stable and has a lot of support behind it. But after updating via yum and having my WIFI stop working on my 6 year old Thinkpad, that is a deal breaker. I think there is way too much disconnect between their projects. RHEL is super stable, but the packages are severely outdated. Fedora is too experimental, and is pretty much a home operating system and a playground. I know CentOS is free, but depending on your business is paying $300 &#x2F; year &#x2F; machine for legitimate support and ticketing really an issue? That&#x27;s for everyone to decide on their own. I think Ubuntu LTS is the best middle ground for stability and new packages. And if you need paid support and professional help, you can pay Canonical as well.<p>I could see this coming. CentOS didn&#x27;t really show a value proposition for RH picking up the tab and supporting it. CentOS was recompiling RHEL and shipping it off; RH needs to keep their PR and image inline and HAD to help, since the whole point of CentOS was &quot;this is RHEL without RH graphics and copyrighted material.&quot; IMO, RH felt like they were doing the same thing twice; producing RHEL, then removing RHEL branding and helping package up and compiling CentOS. Due to this, I think the biz folks scratched their on why they needed money, and now we have Centos Stream. I have no doubt another project will spin up taking up the slack of just recompiling RHEL.<p>Different tools for different jobs. Maybe Centos Stream will be awesome! Maybe it can fill the gap between Fedora and RHEL.')
