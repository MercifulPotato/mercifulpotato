Being able to see not only how, but _why_ a system works the way it does, from not only a technical but business perspective is incredibly valuable.<p>I have the most difficulty with the &#x27;learn to see what others see&#x27; point.  It can take me a long time to see why non-technical people have some of views they do (regarding tech, requirements, etc.)  Usually this comes in the form of them ascribing more value to something then I do. For instance, uber - to me its an unlicensed taxi service. To others I know, its the best thing since sliced bread.  Many of the &#x27;Unicorns&#x27; spark this reaction from me.  Which is probably why I&#x27;m not retired on a private island somewhere :-P')
