This is because overnight sleep quality and sleep cycles can vary from day to day, so I find a bit of a &quot;reset&quot; nap in a more controlled environment (my office) can provide additional mood and executive support.<p>It seems a bit ridiculous now to consider how much of a daily energy bet I was making on the outcome of a single 6-10 hour overnight period, which could be affected&#x2F;moderated by all kinds of factors.')
