Most of the contractor code worked, but had poor maintenance characteristics. Which makes sense: they weren&#x27;t going to be maintaining it. Their job was to generate a lot of code quickly.<p>So, a future where that happens will require either very tight managerial oversight (pipe dream), or will lead to a bunch of stuff that is brittle as hell.<p>Doesn&#x27;t mean it <i>won&#x27;t</i> happen. But God helps us if it does.<p>I suspect that would lead to just subcontracting whole business functions to more stable vendors.')
