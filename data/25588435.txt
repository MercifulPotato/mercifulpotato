This is particularly a problem with static images, text, opacity IIRC. Literally every tip you see on MDN for Canvas performance you will not get in that Animate Canvas output.<p>Jus as an example, Flash is able to redraw only whats needed on the screen whereas Canvas doesn&#x27;t do this and works like a game where it blows away the whole screen every frame (assuming you&#x27;re calling clearRect), hence why its best practice to use multiple Canvas elements, off-screen Canvas elements, etc but again, Animate doesn&#x27;t do that work for you.<p>And up until the EOL of IE11 next summer you have to manually alter the output to make use of blend modes, which people use a lot of in Flash, if you want full browser support, which is pertinent in domains like healthcare.')
