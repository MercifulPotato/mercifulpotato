It will increase Tesla&#x27;s footprint on earth 100 fold, and realise Musk&#x27;s ambition to impact society as much as Henry Ford did 100 years earlier.<p>But your point about branding strategy is a different one.<p>It used to be the case that brands would try to isolate and hone their identities to specific niches, particularly in the luxury class.  In the case of automobiles, Mercedes Benz moved on from there to become a very large car maker, whilst retaining its luxury mark.  It had to, because sustaining a lead in an expensive manufacturing and design product category requires scale that is commensurate with the capital requirements of the industry.<p>In the case of EV, that capital requirement is huge, and Tesla already has it.  But to achieve ROI on all of that capital, Tesla needs scale to monetise its technical leadership.  If Tesla doesn&#x27;t produce the mass market affordable EV of the future asap, one of its competitors will leapfrog it one way or another.')
