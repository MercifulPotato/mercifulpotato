For one thing, the same person is probably not going to be able to technical edit a book on Linux internals and Javascript. More typical is they&#x27;ll reach out to people in their Rolodex and offer them a few hundred dollars to do a technical edit on a book in their area of expertise.<p>ADDED: Of course, larger vendors do have documentation departments and there are people in those departments who manage technical writers, review docs, etc. But that may or may not be what&#x27;s of interest.')
