There are 10,000 little problems that you don&#x27;t have time to think through and delegate it down to the people day-by-day to figure out how to fit into your symbol of clean order.  (and often don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t, leading to anger at the top when details don&#x27;t cooperate)<p>Versus when people work out their patchwork of little agreements with each other to their temporary satisfaction to get on with life every day, it works but has no coherent direction to it.  Like a coral reef figuring out how to grow -- somehow every little piece figured out how to live, but no one exactly told it how to do so.<p>It is to be marveled at in the rare cases when someone from the top designs something with the reality of the bottoms-up in mind, and can make it work.')
