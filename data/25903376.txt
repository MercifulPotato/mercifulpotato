I remember because I had to go to some extra lengths for the process as a non-UK citizen.<p>I&#x27;m not surprised that Companies House is lagging behind right now. Basically everything is broken because of Covid, I can&#x27;t imagine non-profit paperwork is at the top of the priority list. I will also say, as someone who has worked most of my professional life in non-profits, government paperwork is the bane of everyone&#x27;s existence and having some sort of screw up (whether it is your fault or not) is practically a rite of passage.<p>As Arathorn mentioned in a sibling, we&#x27;re chasing down our accountants to see if we can get this sorted out, but this isn&#x27;t a sign of any larger trouble than a paperwork mixup.')
