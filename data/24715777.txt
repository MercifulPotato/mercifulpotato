Looking briefly online, a mid-tier pre built PCs with similar specs (this GPU, 8-core CPU, 16GB RAM, fast NVME drive) like this Dell XPS costs $1350 [0]. Granted the CPU on the PS5 is probably worse than on that machine, but it&#x27;s still pretty solid at a 3.5Ghz Zen2.<p>Not to mention if you you wanted a Mac with similar specs, you really can&#x27;t compare directly because they don&#x27;t sell a consumer desktop machine, but you could easily pay $3000 for an iMac with similar specs (plus the screen obviously).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dell.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;shop&#x2F;desktop-computers&#x2F;xps-desktop&#x2F;spd&#x2F;xps-8940-desktop&#x2F;xd8940ms06s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dell.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;shop&#x2F;desktop-computers&#x2F;xps-deskto...</a>')
