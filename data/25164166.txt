Makes it harder to miss without losing the &quot;reads like text&quot; property that&#x27;s lost when using  == false.<p>if ( ! isLast(e) ) reads perfectly, especially since my native language doesn&#x27;t insert the &quot;not&quot; im the middle like english does and my brain is used to that. if (isLast(e) == false) just jolts me out of that state where code reads as fluently as text. YMMV, of course, and I have a suspicion that your native language might play a role in that...')
