Item(by='Manfredo_1', descendants=None, kids=[24742981], score=None, time=1602375218, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24742864, text='Then what <i>did</i> you mean by, &quot;The equipment required for storing either is similar&quot; and &quot;there is already a great deal of equipment for manipulating hydrogen&quot;? Interpreting this as saying that natural gas infrastructure can be repurposed to work with hydrogen makes sense even if it is based on a false assumption that this is feasible. This claim that we have a great deal of equipment for manipulating hydrogen would be true if natural gas and hydrogen infrastructure were interchangeable.<p>But if you do understand that hydrogen and natural gas infrastructure are different, then this statement is just totally unsubstantiated. You knew that our hydrogen infrastructure is several orders of magnitude smaller, but you just say the complete opposite?')
