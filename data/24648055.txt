All else is never equal.<p>&gt; &gt; western society has a problem of &quot;safety at any cost&quot;<p>&gt; No, I think just America. Europe isn&#x27;t so safety crazed.<p>I would say that is a gross oversimplification. It depends a lot on country, on safety &quot;area&quot; etc.. For instance most European countries have much stricter laws around car safety (e.g. in Germany you have to get an extensive safety check every couple of years) and driver licences.<p>Regarding bicycle helmets I think this is much more a function of when the cycling culture developed in the country, e.g. in the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark biking has been a common way of commuting for a long time (way before helmets came about) and helmets are not that common, while in Sweden for instance most cyclists were helmets.')
