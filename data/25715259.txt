The things people will believe :) The idea that the two premiere newspapers carried in full, with great fanfare, the manifesto because of a few letter bombs is laughable.<p>(&quot;We don&#x27;t negotiate with terrorists&quot; was oddly a running theme back then, but no one ever accused the American public of being incapable of tolerationg gross cognitive dissonance. We&#x27;re exceptionally good at it.)<p>The manifesto articulates a principalist position against technology that ultimately suggests complete deindustrialization as &quot;solution&quot; to unchecked integration of technology in human societies.
