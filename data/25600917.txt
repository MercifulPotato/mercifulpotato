You have 1 ticket at slot 0 that you work on and if someone wants you to work on something urgent out of order they’ll insert it at slot 1, otherwise you just keep popping off the queue. Managers and scrum priests could add more complexity to the metadata and the ordering as much as they want but the developer view would stay the same')
