Plex and it brother KODI have a nice skinning&#x2F;metadata system.  That metadata looks very nice.  They are one of the better players out there.  Even if you have to rotate.  You could use something like VLC or mediacenter but the user exp is just not as good.  For my setup I could get away with a VLC and a folder of stuff and just drag and drop it.  But that 10ft aggregated view is why I use it.  If you just want to watch stuff and then blow it away then it would not be worth the hassle of setup.')
