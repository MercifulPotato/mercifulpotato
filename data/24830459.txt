Couldn&#x27;t be express it better myself. Just recently I tried to access reddit from my phone while being logged out, and got a &quot;community preview, view this in app&quot; kind of screen. Terrible. On a similar note, Github is slowly auth-walling off parts of its website.

Currently it is still in a phase where there is lots of development and technological improvements, but I hope that eventually there will be an ecosystem of compliant clients as well as a large user base. Another good alternative to matrix is zulip, although it&#x27;s hard to maintain which discussions one wants to stay up to date with vs which discussions to ignore.')
