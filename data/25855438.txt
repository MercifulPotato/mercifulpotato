I use that to avoid hosting images from particular servers that specialize in stuff with a high &quot;ick factor&quot;. If a use really wants to follow users on those servers, they can, but then that server is the one serving images to my user, not me. I like that setup.<p>I wasn&#x27;t aware of this feature; can you point me to a source for how to set that up?')
