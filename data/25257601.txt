We have a pattern of ice ages, and if you think global warming is bad imagine an ice age. We grow most of our food at latitudes in the northern hemisphere that would no longer have a long enough growing season. We might one day find ourselves in a position of having to burn coal or release methane on purpose to ward off an ice age.<p>However, there&#x27;s no question it&#x27;s going to be horrific to adapt to meanwhile. There&#x27;s also a question of how much warming do we need to prevent an ice age, because ideally we&#x27;d want to stop there. Nobody asks these questions seriously though, and it could likely end ones career as a scientist to talk about it.')
