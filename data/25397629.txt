Whatever. There is always balances to be made, and sometimes it&#x27;s not worth to spend 20% of time increasing the usability by 2%. Sometimes it is, sometimes it&#x27;s not.<p>The apps I build for myself, that will never be published, has about 5% of my time thinking about the UI, because it simply doesn&#x27;t matter and thinking more about it, won&#x27;t make my life better in any way. Sometimes internal apps have to be treated the same way, if the constraints force you to treat them that way.')
