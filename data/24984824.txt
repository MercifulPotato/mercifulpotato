I believe it is a common pattern in all CI servers.<p>The issue here doesn’t seem to be parsing the output, but what the parsed commands can do.<p>In Octopus there is no way to use them to run commands or set environment variables though. I can’t speak for TeamCity.<p>Update: TeamCity&#x27;s documentation page about service messages:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetbrains.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;teamcity&#x2F;service-messages.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetbrains.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;teamcity&#x2F;service-messages.htm...</a><p>The commands are quite specific though: test results, build numbers, etc. no generic commands like running commands or setting environment variables.')
