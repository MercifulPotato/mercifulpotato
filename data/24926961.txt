However in general this is a horrible idea, because someone with outsized influence can bully in ways that the victim will simply have to take if the imbalance is too large.<p>Imagine Elon Musk gives a talk and absolutely drags someone with awful criticism, the person couldn&#x27;t stand up against his twitter mob if they tried and would probably defer to keep their sanity even if they&#x27;re right. Even in literal bullying this is kind of how the victim responds, just pretending it wasn&#x27;t an issue as to not get bullied even more. So one has to be careful on this one.')
