LeCun stood still doing the same thing for decades. But when wave after wave of faster hardware arrived he was finally declared successful.<p>So if you want to credit success to dumb luck, or to stubbornness, or insanity (as Einstein said: &quot;doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&quot; then LeCon is your man. I don&#x27;t know of any quote where LeCun says something to the effect of: &quot;Well, I knew the hardware would speed up and then my neural net software would work exactly as I designed it to and manifest AI. So I waited twenty years.&quot;<p>IOW It wasn&#x27;t the LeCunn&#x27;s surfboard(his software) that handed him success, it was the wave(advancing hardware speeds):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;race-make-ai-chips-everything-heating-fast&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;race-make-ai-chips-everything-...</a>')
