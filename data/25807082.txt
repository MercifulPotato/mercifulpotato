Top Western climbers are either well-off or funded by the well-off (patrons, companies, or even governments sometimes).<p>This funding has historically not been available directly to Sherpas. That is partially because they did not have platforms to influence the purchasing decisions of a large audience (the main reason companies fund full-time climbers). And it’s partially because Western cultures tended not to value indigenous people the same way it valued their own citizens.<p>Both of those have been changing a lot in the past decade, and it’s nice to see younger Sherpas able to take advantage of that.')
