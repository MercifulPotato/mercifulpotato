Dwelling on the fact that <i>Nature</i> and <i>Nature Communications</i> are two different journals obstinately misses the point that <i>Nature Comms</i> explicitly &quot;rides on the coattails&quot; of <i>Nature</i>, in that they are inextricably part of the <i>Nature</i> brand.<p>They can&#x27;t have it both ways. If being a journal parallel to and under the same org as the journal <i>Nature</i> is supposed to make <i>Nature Communications</i> look better, then low-quality content in <i>Nature Communications</i> necessarily erodes the <i>Nature</i> brand of which they are a very deliberate part.<p>Again, Andrew Gelman put it succinctly:<p>&gt; The paper is published at nature.com.

The converse is that if the new journal published a paper with serious flaws, the Nature brand loses.')
