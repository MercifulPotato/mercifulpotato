When my last phone stopped getting updates while being perfectly usable, apart from at Linux phones I searched for a repairable phone that was supported by Lineage, and found it very hard to see what is available. There are other (some very nice) Lineage device finders, but nothing I saw linked that data to iFixit guides.<p>Repairable for now means &quot;battery swappable or easy to change&quot;. Lineage is only one of two Roms listed, MoKee is the other one.')
