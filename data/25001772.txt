There also seems to be more respect of the people&#x27;s money from these gov&#x27;ts regarding how they spend taxpayer money is spent and with a clear aim to help the people NOT partisan goals, wars etc.  I may be incorrect here (open to correction) but it seems like US politicians (federally at least) seem entitled to taxpayer dollars.  Most forget that until WW2 the idea of federal witholding simply wasn&#x27;t a thing and many middle class families were flushed with savings.<p>Unfortunately, both sides are at fault in the US.  The only way this is going to change for the better is to cease the cycle of one political party only pandering to it&#x27;s base instead of motivated and able americans.')
