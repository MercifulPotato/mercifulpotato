But I&#x27;m still skeptical.<p>The growing divide and threat of civil war ( not going to happen btw ) are nothing compared to what will happen in the next 50 years of we do not have a green new deal.<p>Climate change, and its little brother over fishing and unchecked exploitation of our environment,  is an existential threat to the human race. Bernie took it seriously. Warren took it seriously. I&#x27;m not convinced the new establishment takes it seriously. We need radical action YESTERDAY. More business as usual is not going to cut it.<p>Furthermore, the new administration doesn&#x27;t believe in Medicare for all. They plan to do nothing about the currently broken system which causes 40% of people who are diagnosed with cancer to spend their entire life savings and often go bankrupt as a result of something that is not at all their fault.<p>Democrats down ballot got massacred, well progressive policies like decriminalization of drugs, and raising the minimum wage passed with large margins.<p>I&#x27;m glad we won but this was a mess and we&#x27;re still not getting towards where we actually need to be: preventing the apocalypse')
