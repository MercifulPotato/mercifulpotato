They are on very different categories.<p>That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m trying to do (to compare them), but people who like to write things from scratch often blame frameworks e.g. they think they are leaky or don&#x27;t solve problems perfectly anyway.<p>My question is why they think they can rely on interpreters or compilers, because they also have limitations, bugs, CVEs, leaky abstractions and other known problems. They also form an unknown variable, because most haven&#x27;t read the source of the compiler or interpreter they use.')
