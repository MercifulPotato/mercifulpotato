A company incentivizing pull requests against your repo should require your consent. A maintainer needs to affirmatively sign up for this sort of work; they can&#x27;t have it thrust upon them. As a maintainer, all the other half-measures people have suggested (e.g., accepted PRs only; account age measurements; filtering out README changes) do not actually reduce the unasked-for burden on me.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not sure this year can be salvaged. It&#x27;s not clear whether all the existing spammers will get the message. I hope DigitalOcean emails all folks signed up to notify them of this change. (They haven&#x27;t communicated any of their changes so far in such a way.) Notably, a day ago, the DigitalOcean staff thought this wouldn&#x27;t make a difference. [1] And it&#x27;s even possible this will just result in issue spam begging maintainers to add the Hacktoberfest topic.<p>But it&#x27;s also possible that this will work out. The best version of this is that low-quality contributors looking for a t-shirt get directed toward honeypot repositories, and folks interested in making substantial contributions will continue using issue labels like GitHub&#x27;s own &quot;good first issue&quot;, or the Hacktoberfest repository topic, to find places to contribute.<p>We&#x27;ll see in a day or two whether this is enough.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24648285" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24648285</a>')
