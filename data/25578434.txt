Unless public knowledge would truly pose more harm to the convicted than the sentence itself and stigma that any conceited criminal bears, then it should be public. If sealed under the &quot;additional harm&quot; principal, the public should be provided with at least the broad strokes of that potential harm so that public scrutiny of our justice system is possible. The more such scrutiny is lacking, the more room for abuse.')
