But, critically, I&#x27;d prefer it to be about <i>knowledge</i>, rather than net worth or social connections. This is still much easier said than done (and as we saw from cryptocurrency IPOs, there are disastrous consequences from just letting people invest in anything they want to with zero laws or accountability, but that is obviously one extreme end), but I think there&#x27;s still <i>some</i> room for easy improvement.')
