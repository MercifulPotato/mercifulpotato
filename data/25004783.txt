And it&#x27;s amplified by the use of atomics (shared_ptr, etc.). What we did was simply to disable one core (it was two CPU sockets).\nI guess for servers, executing many (mostly) single threaded jobs (a.k.a &quot;borg&quot;, &quot;kubernetes&quot;, &quot;docker&quot;) is okay, but when you have app using all threads (TBB-style) then it becomes bottlenecked.<p>SysInternal&#x27;s <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;sysinternals&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;coreinfo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;sysinternals&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;core...</a> actually captures this detail (probably there are better apps, but it was nice to inspect machines quickly). The tool measure some relative slowdown.')
