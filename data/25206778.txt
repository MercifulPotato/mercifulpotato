Are you saying that by not supporting communism one supports imperialism, slave trade and wars? And every time I write communism is bad, do I also have to put a disclaimer that a bunch of other ideologies are also bad? All the things you have enumerated have nothing to do with capitalism. Norway (or almost any other capitalistic country) is capitalistic and as far as I know it hasn&#x27;t invaded or enslaved anyone for instance. You should also remember that the capitalistic north has defeated the feudalistic south (slave owners) in the civil war.')
