Paid once for the pi&#x2F;drive&#x2F;case 4 years ago and been a happy user ever since.<p>It&#x27;s been so worry free that when I had to move house I had to read the docs again to make sure I do things right. And that&#x27;s on top of me studying the project well enough the first time I set it up that I ended up contributing some patches.<p>P.S. There are hosted offerings for nextcloud but for a household with 2-5 users I think nextcloudpi has the best value proposition.')
