I am talking about confidence in the process. GOP workers were thrown out of polls in PA and NV. There are due process violations. There are 6,000 votes that went the wrong way in one MI county due to software &quot;glitchs&quot; and that software is used in 45 counties. At least 7,000 dead people have voted in Michigan and officials are finding more all the time.<p>I am concerned with the integrity of the process. I have never believe US elections were fair. I would prefer they were. The irregularities here are massive. PA literally violated an order from Justice Alito going into this election, and that cause will very likely go back to the Supreme Court.<p>I know you want your side to win, but do you want it at this cost? The integrity of the system is in jeopardy. The media doesn&#x27;t decide elections. There is a process, starting with certifying the results, electors being selected, those electors voting in the capitol and the House voting based on those electors. None of that has happened yet, and we&#x27;ve never had the news media &quot;call&quot; an election with this much up in the air.')
