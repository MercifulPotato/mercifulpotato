I just think the humans most severely vulnerable to the flu died off during the first few waves. Consider small pox. It was a novel virus for the Native Americans, who had no &quot;natural herd immunity&quot; and they got eviscerated by small pox. Colonists, despite not having vaccines, and despite still being able to get small pox, were not eviscerated since the virus wasn&#x27;t able to spread and&#x2F;or kill as well due to their natural immune systems.<p>What do you call this if not &quot;natural herd immunity&quot;? If you kill off all the weak and vulnerable, leaving only survivors and survivors&#x27; offspring who are virus-resistant... then you now have &quot;natural herd immunity&quot;.')
