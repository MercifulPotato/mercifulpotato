Humans have agency. The comment I&#x27;m responding to explicitly recommends forced reduction in fertility rates, removing agency, something you don&#x27;t do to human beings unless you think of them like sheep or cattle. Equating a one or no child policy with &quot;family planning&quot; is extremely disingenuous.<p>Any law that tells human beings how many children they are allowed to have is fascism, yes. Any directive telling human beings how they have to reproduce is eugenics by definition.')
