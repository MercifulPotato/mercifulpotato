Impure parts of the program is fenced off from the pure parts. Pure functions cannot call impure functions.<p>The important part here is keeping portions of your code that has side-effects separate â€” and minimizing the amount of such code. If code that has side-effects is spread all over your program then you are not really using functional style.<p>More on that here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;weekly-webtips&#x2F;dysfunctional-programming-in-javascript-cae5c085a76e" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;weekly-webtips&#x2F;dysfunctional-programming-...</a>')
