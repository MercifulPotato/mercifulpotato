I&#x27;ve never used beepbox, so I can&#x27;t compare but this has some neat features. It&#x27;s got a decent selection of samples, a filter, a few effects and ways to shape the waveform, it&#x27;s surprisingly not too bad to use on mobile.<p>I have to say too, I really like the way you can grab a note then drag it up or down for slides.<p>This is definitely something i&#x27;m going to spend some time playing with. Thanks for making and sharing.')
