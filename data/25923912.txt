Is that using as input something like an array where each occurrence represents a frequency and the value represents the loudness at that frequency? When I first tried to use WebAudio for my little app I tried using input like that and simply looking for which frequency bucket had the highest number. That didn&#x27;t work well at all. Is this function, though, using the same kind of input but using more complicated math to get a better answer?<p>Then I switched to very simple autocorrelation and then I switched to a fancier autocorrelation-based method called &quot;Yin&quot;.<p>Also, There&#x27;s also a comment &quot;The logarithmically binned spectrum has a resolution of one cent&quot;. Does that mean that there is a bucket for each 1 cent? When I was using WebAudio I think the the buckets were something like 14 units of frequency apart (hz?), and I didn&#x27;t discover a way to get finer resolution.')
