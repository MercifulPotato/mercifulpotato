Your board will get the legal blame if it goes seriously wrong and you&#x27;ve kept them sufficiently informed and involved in key decisions.<p>But you can still have a majority ownership stake while appointing a board.  In doing so, you keep ultimate control (as shareholders) but you won&#x27;t often exercise it.<p>Having ultimate control might change the social dynamics, but shareholders are not responsible for the company, the board of directors is and they should know it.  Shareholders have the power to pass resolutions which effectively override directors, but most of the time they don&#x27;t.  Even if they do, it&#x27;s up to the directors to figure out how to do what the shareholders want in a responsible and defensible way.')
