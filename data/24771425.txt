Item(by='centimeter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602630993, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24770063, text='&gt; but fewer than you might think.<p>I run into them all the time. Only really boring photography with no stressors looks OK on a cell phone camera.<p>&gt; The new iPhone 12 will capture RAW photos even when applying Deep Fusion and other advanced techniques<p>Then it&#x27;s not a raw image; it&#x27;s just called that for marketing.<p>Unless you mean &quot;MILCs won&#x27;t give you RAWs when using HDRs&quot;, which is wrong.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m fairly sure no common mirrorless camera is going to be able to do HDR video at the level that the iPhone 12 will do it<p>I&#x27;m quite confident log-format video e.g. from an X-T3 will be much better (modulo the fact that you have to postprocess it manually).')
