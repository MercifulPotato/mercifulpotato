The European Medicines Agency&#x27;s criticism is entirely legitimate; they&#x27;re criticising the emergency approval procedure to rush a vaccine into widespread application rather than not rush it.<p>Given Johnson and his government&#x27;s inconsistent, perhaps even lackadaisical, response to the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic, it&#x27;s not unusual that this emergency rushing be treated with skepticism — is it a good faith move to help immunise Britain or a way to save face for failing to properly implement lockdown quickly and early?<p>Any agency from around the world, not just in the EU, might hold the same skepticism and provide such criticism. It&#x27;s only due to Brexit and modern Britain&#x27;s tenuous relationship with the EU that such a knee-jerk rejection of such criticism might occur — but, given the actual topic of discussion should not be world politics but world <i>health</i>, it does seem inappropriately off-topic.')
