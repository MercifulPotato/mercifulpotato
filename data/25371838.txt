Dev studios pop up for one project, and often close at launch, and some other legal entity gets all the subs after that.  And so on.  Game dev financing is infamously horrid.<p>Unreal, though, is in a different negotiating position with the game publishers than, say, an open-source software with a new pay-us-if-you-make-money clause.  Its the distinction between source-available (like Unreal Engine) and open-source which the article tries to make?<p>Timescale&#x27;s new license is an interesting move in this direction.')
