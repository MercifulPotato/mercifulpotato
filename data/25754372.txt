As a free speech advocate, surely you must accept that that extends to a company of people, be that 1, 1000 or 10000 people, otherwise you&#x27;re advocating for double-standards (see above). Forcibly compelling businesses (which include sole-traders or individuals) to conduct business with anyone that wants to avail themselves of their product, which is what the EC is advocating, if far more worrisome for free speech.<p>Moreover, there is nothing stopping the &quot;silenced&quot; organisations and people from creating their own platform. Blocking organisations and individuals from accessing the internet is problematic, but in this situation somewhat ironic. The side cheering the bans (no, not leftist, America doesn&#x27;t really have left-wing politics) were pushing net neutrality and the internet as a public service while those being de-platforming were adamant that this would be a bad thing.')
