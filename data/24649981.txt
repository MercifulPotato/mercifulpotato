Luke McKernan, lead curator of news and moving images at the British Library, was particularly scathing about Peter Jackson’s 2018 World War One documentary They Shall Not Grow Old, which upscaled and colourised footage from the Western Front. Making the footage look more modern, he argued, undermined it. “It is a nonsense,” he wrote. “Colourisation does not bring us closer to the past; it increases the gap between now and then. It does not enable immediacy; it creates difference.”<p>But on the flipside, this argument does bring to light why it <i>may</i> be bad, but still - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good enough to be up in arms about someone upscaling archive footage.<p>&quot;For Mark-FitzGerald and other historians of photography tools like DeOldify and Neural Love might make pictures look amazing, but they risk obscuring the past rather than illuminating it. “Even as a photo historian, I look at them and think, oh, wow, that&#x27;s quite an arresting image,” she says. “But always then my next impulse is to say, &#x27;Well, why am I having that response? And what is the person who&#x27;s made this intervention on the restoration actually doing? What information has this person added? What have they taken away?”')
