Item(by='TheDong', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603391601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24861429, text='&gt; I have $1,000,000,000 in my checking account. This is my wealth. I am not going to be taxed a single penny on this<p>That&#x27;s the point of a wealth tax, to in fact tax that checking account too. You seem to misunderstand how it would work and what the intent is. It doesn&#x27;t treat your checking account differently from company ownership; both are wealth, a wealth tax suggests taxing both.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t have IRS breathing down my neck to sell them, why should Bezos have them breathing down his?<p>You shouldn&#x27;t if you&#x27;re not wealthy (as in you have under 20 mil net worth). If you&#x27;re wealthy, you can afford to pay a wealth tax, and your money will help those poorer.<p>Why shouldn&#x27;t we be taking money from the rich and helping the entire country? Why should our country continue to have a wider and wider economic divide?<p>Anyway, the IRS absolutely would breath down your neck to give them money if you owed them taxes. If all your assets were stock, and you somehow triggered a large tax liability, you&#x27;d have to sell some stock to pay the IRS. That&#x27;s already true. It&#x27;s perfectly possible to trigger a tax liability larger than your liquid assets now, and have to sell stock to cover it.<p>But that&#x27;s rare now. And with a wealth tax that would still be rare. Most people with 20MM+ net worth have liquid assets, or the ability to easily liquidate assets.<p>You&#x27;re arguing about an edge case that almost certainly doesn&#x27;t effect you in any way.')
