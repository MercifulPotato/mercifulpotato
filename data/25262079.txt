If so, dang that sounds like a huge time investment to create and grade for the prof and TAs.<p>WRT legal consequences for cheating: I mean, you can get kicked out of university. That’s a loss of thousands of dollars invested. And as a TA, if I knew I could be called in to testify in court every time I caught a student cheating... I’d never call it out. I don’t have time for that! And that still wouldn’t change that we’d have to be on the lookout for cheating.')
