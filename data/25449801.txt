The same people that spend thousands on a Peloton are the ones that previously were spending comparative amounts at “spin classes”, which are nothing more than riding a bike while someone yells at you. At best, it forces them to do the workout so they don’t feel like their money is being wasted.<p>I’ve long proposed a fitness program where you pay some exorbitant fee, say $500&#x2F;month, to work out alone and you get a rebate for each workout. I bet it’d have incredible results.')
