Tiger Lake&#x27;s IPC gains are right in line with Zen 3&#x27;s IPC gains over Zen 2. And Xe looks to be a great iGPU.<p>Which means Intel is more or less on equal design footing with AMD, they&#x27;re just having trouble getting it built.<p>And Intel has multiple huge revenue streams that are not in question at all. All their networking stuff, for example (everyone, even on AMD, <i>still</i> goes for motherboards with Intel LAN instead of anyone else&#x27;s, and same with wifi). And things like Optane. And all their tooling &amp; software suites. Intel&#x27;s CPU division is struggling to get wins, but Intel overall as a company isn&#x27;t.')
