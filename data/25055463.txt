Ooooh, the wisdom words flowed out of this rich business man, carried his lies and false claims so naturally.<p>The things are more clear if you knew that few days ago, the CEO of Ant Finance Xiaoming Hu comes out and said &quot;Everybody, even beggars should be given loans. Everyone should be respected&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;36kr.com&#x2F;newsflashes&#x2F;895377271796488" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;36kr.com&#x2F;newsflashes&#x2F;895377271796488</a>).<p>You know, banks don&#x27;t want to give loans to beggars, and it&#x27;s for a very good reason: Because banks don&#x27;t want to lose any money, money that the banks don&#x27;t actually own.<p>Now, Ant Finance claims that they have buzzword BiGdATA to prove somebody&#x27;s ability to payback, and so they can safely doing their ABS business (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.ifeng.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;8189yYOdKfw" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.ifeng.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;8189yYOdKfw</a>) without cause bubbles.

So don&#x27;t just listen to what people says, think what the speaker wants.')
