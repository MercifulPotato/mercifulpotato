She probably can offer way better food than a trucked in catering can provide which is probably the alternative. The catering company probably suffers a lot as well from covid, so let both have their venues open, and make the people decide whose food they like best. As a benefit, the people would distribute between the two venues and would thus be further apart than if they used one venue.<p>This situation is incredibly unfair to her. She has to pay the rent but can&#x27;t open. She has to pay no rent and gets customers.')
