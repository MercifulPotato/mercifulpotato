We also recognize that there are different kinds of CentOS Linux users, and we are working with the CentOS Project Governing Board to tailor programs that meet the needs of different user groups.<p>In the first half of 2021, we will be introducing low- or no-cost programs for a variety of use cases, including options for open source projects and communities, partner ecosystems and an expansion of the use cases of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer subscription to better serve the needs of systems administrators and partner developers. We’ll share more details on these initiatives as they become available. For those converting to RHEL, there is guidance available today for converting from CentOS Linux to RHEL.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redhat.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;faq-centos-stream-updates#Q10" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redhat.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;faq-centos-stream-updates#Q10</a>')
