When your drive&#x27;s flash is mostly worn-out, you will see latency affected as the drive has to retry reads and use more complex error correction schemes to recover your data. But there are several other mechanisms by which a SSD&#x27;s performance will degrade early in its lifetime depending on the workload. Those performance degradations are avoidable to some extent, and are not permanent.')
