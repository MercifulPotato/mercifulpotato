Our environment was basically tailored to us. Moving away from that, and losing stability to boot adds costs.<p>Itâ€™s another short run vs long run tradeoff. Fossil fuels brought and bring us immense short term benefits. But increasingly the benefits now will lead to larger costs in the future, both in adaptation and also in attempting to reverse the costs by taking co2 out of the air.<p>The best solution would be to bring future costs into the present and charge for co2 emissions. That way the truly valuable uses could still happen and the more optional uses of co2 would be discouraged.<p>This article is talking about building for the next few decades, but the non-stationarity problem will only grow if we keep emitting.')
