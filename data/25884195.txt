I targeted you as someone who&#x27;s using the extreme technicality of a definition to serve your agenda. It appears to be an intelligent maneuver but it is not.<p>&gt;Btw, name calling is also against the rules, and invoking the rules is against the rules.<p>Name calling? You mean Savant? You know a savant is a genius right? It&#x27;s a compliment..<p>&gt;Most species on earth have a habitat, a well defined reproduction rate and population capacity, and relationship to other species. And when you take them out of their habitat, they may cause harm to other species and their relationship to other species.<p>Yeah and it&#x27;s not that hard to understand that global human expansion already occurred millions of years ago. The harm as an &quot;invasive&quot; species was already done because ecosystems have already evolved features and qualities designed to fend off humans. My example of all wild animals basically having an instinctual &quot;fear of humans&quot; is evidence for this. Predators actively avoid hunting humans even though many hikers are vulnerable due 100% to this instinct.<p>The harm to the environment we&#x27;re seeing today is not the result of &quot;invasion&quot; which already occurred eons ago, but the result of technological change.')
