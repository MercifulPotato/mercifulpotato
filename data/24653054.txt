Right now, we&#x27;re helping job seekers attend 3-14 week classes to become certified nursing assistants (CNAs), financing their tuition and placing them with employers immediately upon completion. For many, Ladder represents a new lifeline to economic stability and a better chance at a fulfilling career.<p>This is engineering role #3 at a 10+ person company with some phenomenal talent and great culture. We&#x27;re hiring for both front-end and back-end roles, with a focus on the front-end role and someone who has had 2+ years of experience working in React, TypeScript, and front-end JavaScript frameworks. We are optionally WFH thru the end of 2020.<p>In my time in tech I have never come across a company that is as mission-oriented as ours â€” while still very much focused on building a successful business. We are backed by USV and some of the best VCs&#x2F;angels in the business. It&#x27;s a great opportunity to join an early-stage company.<p>You can apply here and mention HN, or email me directly (brandon@ the below domain name):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withladder.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4057701003" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withladder.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4057701003</a>')
