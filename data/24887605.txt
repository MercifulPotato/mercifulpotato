The exterminator I hired used a powder on the entry to our attic and the Yellowjackets carried it into the nest and it wiped out the whole thing brilliantly (and we sealed the hole).  A targeted application would require very little product.  With a powder, it would also kill any insects that got away, and it could trace&#x2F;damage other nests if the hornet moved to another colony.  It seems to me a vacuum would be less thorough, and I would think they&#x27;d want to be very thorough in this instance, maybe even to the point of doing both.')
