Highlighting mine:<p>&gt; <i>Whoever falsely</i> assumes or <i>pretends to be</i> an officer or employee <i>acting under the authority of</i> the United States or <i>any</i> department, <i>agency</i> or officer <i>thereof, and acts as such</i><p>If the twitter account operator(s) claims that a document is an official FBI document, when it is not, then they have falsely exercised the exclusive authority <i>of</i> the FBI to issue statements <i>as</i> the FBI, an agency of the United States. The available evidence meets the criteria highlighted above.<p>(This centers around the definition of the verb &quot;forge&quot;; to forge a document, you must <i>falsely</i> pretend to be acting with authority to produce that document, or else it wouldn&#x27;t be forging.)<p>If the twitter account operator(s) was provided the document by someone else and was misled by the provider, then the operators did not falsely pretend to be FBI, and so the operators would be protected from prosecution. The operators would need to make this claim to the court; they do not appear to have done so at this time.<p>(Standard disclaimer applies.
