The tax system is <i>designed around the assumption</i> that taxable entities will min-max their taxes. If you&#x27;re not doing it, you&#x27;re not <i>just</i> leaving free money on the table; you&#x27;re also being sub-optimally pro-social in the state&#x27;s (society&#x27;s?) opinion. &quot;Tax avoidance&quot; is to Western states, as &quot;social credit score&quot; is to China: a score of how well you&#x27;re living up to the government&#x27;s expectations for you. <i>Of course</i> they want you to aim for the best score you can!<p>(I can understand people refusing to minimize their tax burden for ideological reasons — i.e. refusing to be manipulated into certain behaviors by the state. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard <i>anyone</i> espouse this stance. Most people don&#x27;t even <i>understand</i> that taxes are the state attempting to manipulate you.)')
