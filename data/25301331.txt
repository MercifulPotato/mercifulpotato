It is clear they tried to poach students.<p>I understand the objection though and other departments constantly berated this closeness and they certainly had a point because the generality of education was endangered.<p>With big-tech in software there are some additional risks in my opinion.<p>That said, there is merit of feedback from industry to university. It is especially helpful to not let students learn about outdated approaches and tech and keep academia in the know.<p>But that has to be a transparent forum without some maybe not so moral gifts from industries.')
