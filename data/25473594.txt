Item(by='justnotworthit', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608335995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25470867, text='&gt; The short answer is that they gambled and they lost.<p>I think that answers my question, which was:<p>Has anyone said why they didnt delay just the ps4&#x2F;xbone versions? I assume some kind of contracts, but would have been cheaper to break the contract than to release a broken game. Probably would have been cheaper to delay all versions(smaller stock hit + salaries) if reports of losses are true.<p>---<p>So did they see their game (that was so broken that friendly outlets went out of their way to say &quot;DO NOT BUY&quot;) and think &quot;we can take this gamble&quot;?')
