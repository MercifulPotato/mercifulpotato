Interest rates would have spiked, investment would have ground to a halt as companies collapsed. House prices would plummet as no one could get a mortgage, leading to people defaulting on their mortgages leading to falling prices etc.<p>But we&#x27;d have don&#x27;t the right thing. What&#x27;s 30m unemployed and a decade of economic stagnation?<p>I&#x27;m not saying there is nothing wrong. I agree about rating agencies, they should at least have been killed off.<p>I&#x27;m just saying, 98% of the things people call conspiracies are actually just good practical decisions that they don&#x27;t like. The bank bailouts are a perfect example of that. Even your own line contains one such glaring misconception:<p>&gt;Same with investment banks who knew the mortgage bubble was about to collapse but nonetheless sold those securities to their clients.<p>The clients are hedge funds so whose the bad guy here? Plus if the bank is selling and you&#x27;re buying, you&#x27;re not their client, you&#x27;re their counterparty: they want to sneak as much shit into the portfolio as possible and you have to catch them and refuse the deal. If you don&#x27;t do your job, you can&#x27;t complain your opponent didn&#x27;t do it for you!? And where did all these toxic loans come from? From requirements put in place by people we elected who decided that just because a customer has on income or assets they should still get a 110% mortgage on a house they don&#x27;t actually need. Banks had to sell that to someone...<p>My worry here is that we&#x27;re doomed to repeat these mistakes:<p>* politicians will deregulate finance because doing so spurs the economy (like it or not)<p>* finance will do its thing and spur the economy and get nice fat bonus cheques (like it or not)<p>* some other product will be all the rage<p>* that product will balloon in size, the assets underlying it will turn to shit as regulators push more of it and customers decline to check the contents before they buy<p>* the whole thing will crash and people will blame bankers who will say &quot;we&#x27;re turds, but so is everyone else, we just don&#x27;t bother acting like we&#x27;re not a part of the problem.&quot;.<p>* ill come back here and make this comment again.')
