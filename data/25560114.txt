The old editor is much easier to use.<p>You add new paragraphs by just pressing enter, and you make it a heading by typing (part of) &quot;&#x2F;heading&quot;. It&#x27;s less work than in the old editor, and it even produces reasonable markup (entirely unlike the old editor). If you don&#x27;t want to design a new web page, just... don&#x27;t? You don&#x27;t need to press every button available.')
