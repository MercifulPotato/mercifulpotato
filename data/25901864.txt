You can never predict what will happen if you mess with nature on a genetic level.<p>This was already proven to be true when they released some GMO mosquitos which were not being able to reproduce.<p>BUT WAIT!<p>They were able to reproduce sooner or later again!<p>How shocking! Who would have thought!<p>And those scientists then said &quot;this was not supposed to happen&quot;.<p>These scientists got the problem completely wrong, up-side-down: they believed that they &quot;studied&quot; the problem enough. The believed that they &quot;knew enough&quot; that this &quot;should not have happened&quot;.<p>But they won&#x27;t ever learn that complex system (which is pretty much everything in nature) cannot be &quot;studied and come to a conclusion with a high degree of confidence&quot;.<p>&quot;High degree of confidence&quot; and &quot;complex system&quot; are opposites that cannot appear in the same sentence.')
