To have predicted the success of Twitch is to say with a straight face that in the mid 2000s you thought that people who absolutely did not play games then (or even consider it) would regularly watch other people play games; Twitch probably has more concurrent users right now than there are people who had heard of a Let&#x27;s Play before 2008[0]. To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying that you didn&#x27;t predict it: I&#x27;m saying that realizing that Twitch would be as successful as it is today is uncommon.<p>&gt; The Wright brothers were the first to succeed of a large group of people attempting to build working airplanes.<p>Agreed. However, at the time the Washington Post famously opined on the Wright brothers that &quot;It is a fact that man can&#x27;t fly&quot;. A lot of the mockery they faced is probably apocryphal at this point, but certainly many people thought that powered flight was unlikely&#x2F;impossible. Similarly, many of the early adopters of transistors were laughed at because vacuum tubes were the clearly superior choice [1].<p>My point here isn&#x27;t that no one believed; some people have done a great job of reliably picking the right horse. My point is that for many innovative ideas, more people doubt than believe. And that (with the benefit of hindsight) it&#x27;s easy to imagine you knew the right horse from the beginning.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kotaku.com&#x2F;who-invented-lets-play-videos-1702390484" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kotaku.com&#x2F;who-invented-lets-play-videos-1702390484</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=U4XknGqr3Bo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=U4XknGqr3Bo</a>')
