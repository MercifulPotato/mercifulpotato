Also doesn’t hurt to add some of the GOATS such as the works of Plato or perhaps even the Harvard Classics<p>2) Sorting on site is frustrating<p>3) I would be willing to commission high quality epubs and I’m sure others would too for my own benefit and humanity. For example I can get copies of the works for Plato on Gutenberg but it merits a Standard Ebooks edition and I wouldn’t blink at donating $250 or some number toward that cause. Knowing kids across the globe would have access to high quality digital editions is worth it to me. Worth exploring setting up a program for this.')
