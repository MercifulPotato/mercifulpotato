And with all of that effort which involves changing software distribution models, jettisoning energy efficient flexible heterogenous architectures, and abandoning SMT, you might be able to get something close to performing as well as… what we already have today without VLIW.<p>Not sure why anyone thinks that’s an argument for doing it.')
