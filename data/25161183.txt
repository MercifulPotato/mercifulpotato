And I&#x27;ll be going with the adenoviral route which has been used for more than fifty years, rather than the brand new, first time ever mRNA product.<p>Interesting, I feel the exact opposite. I can&#x27;t wait to take a mRNA vaccine, but the adenovirus ones seem sketchy given that Sinovac, J&amp;J, and AstraZeneca have all seen serious adverse events in their trials, while Pfizer and Moderna have seen none, along with much higher efficacy.<p>I wasn&#x27;t aware there were any adenoviral vaccinations approved for human use? What are you referring to?')
