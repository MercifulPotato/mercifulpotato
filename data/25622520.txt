I get most of my tech news from YCombinator and like the comments. I want to start a scalable company. I have little domain knowledge other than registering a company in my state, freelancing , and paying taxes as a business.<p>it looks like YCombinator is for seed funding, and its a turnkey solution that may or may not work, but its a major dependency, and so is moving to San Francisco.<p>Bootstrapping my company would make an efficient small POC&#x2F;MVP of a business, but scaling is harder without investors.<p>I&#x27;m just scouting at this point. \nSuggestions&#x2F;beneficial critiques would be helpful. \nThank you.')
