According to this quick and purely speculative math, the short answer is, with current reserves, not just no, but hell no.&quot;<p>&gt;&quot;Even this little sketch of the issue highlights the obvious conclusion: we need to do our best to get away from single passenger cars -- even EVs -- and rely more on smart city design, walking, biking, carpooling, trains, shuttles, etc.&quot;<p>As for the relative prices of electricity sources - I&#x27;ll just say it again, the energy returned on energy invested for renewable sources mean that an all-renewable grid would have a higher cost per unit of electricity. The only reason it&#x27;s cheap now is because most of the manufacturing is done by countries that are happy to burn oil, coal, and whatever else they can find, to do so.')
