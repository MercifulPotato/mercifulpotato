In this talk, Knuth explains why he finds this unfortunate and what value practitioners can get from history. (He also ends with examples of this kind of history waiting to be written.) In his reply, Haigh points out that if computer scientists want such history they&#x27;ll have to write and fund such writing; historians as a field won&#x27;t do it.<p>(Someone in the YouTube comments points out that military history is like this: there exist military historians writing technical history about things like the &quot;terrain, weapon systems, tactics, strategy, etc&quot;, funded by the military, because members of the profession do care about this. Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be much the case in computer science.)<p>BTW, here are a couple of papers that Knuth wrote himself, which I would guess is the kind of historical writing he&#x27;d like to read (rich in technical detail):<p>- Von Neumann&#x27;s First Computer Program (1970): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fermatslibrary.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;von-neumanns-first-computer-program" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fermatslibrary.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;von-neumanns-first-computer-pro...</a><p>- Ancient Babylonian algorithms (1972): <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realtechsupport.org&#x2F;UB&#x2F;NP&#x2F;Numeracy_BabylonianAlgorithms_1977.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realtechsupport.org&#x2F;UB&#x2F;NP&#x2F;Numeracy_BabylonianAlgo...</a><p>- The Early Development of Programming Languages (1976): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25717306" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25717306</a>')
