It&#x27;s not 1975 anymore and even the ancient VT100 from 1978 had a 132-column mode. It&#x27;s just an indefensible relic that held developers hostage for way too long.<p>Still want 80 columns on your 4k 27&quot; 10bpp HDR monitor? Fine, but don&#x27;t insist on others bending over backwards just not anger the grey beards on top of Mount Teletype... Text editors are perfectly capable of introducing proper line breaks even at word boundaries if need be.<p>It&#x27;s really just become l&#x27;art pour l&#x27;art to force this arbitrary (by today&#x27;s [and by today I mean the past 30 years!] standards) restriction on developers with no benefit to readability.')
