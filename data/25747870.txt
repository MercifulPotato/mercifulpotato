Item(by='Gollapalli', descendants=None, kids=[25748440, 25748462], score=None, time=1610464286, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25747645, text='&gt;I reckon electoral maps are fundamentally useless when most districts are gerrymandered to the wazoo.<p>Littlestymear linked a map in another reply to my comment that seems to break it down purely by population in clusters of 250,000: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2399&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2399&#x2F;</a><p>That map still suggests that clusters of blue in highly urban areas are surrounded by clusters of red in &quot;less urban&quot; areas, and never the opposite. Rural, or less urban environments have different cultures than highly urban environments, and this is readily observable.<p>&gt;They also do not reflect movements that are fundamentally leninist in organization, where a small cohesive nucleus of activists defines the agenda and directs action.<p>I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by this. Please be more explicit.<p>&gt;Without a Fox News stoking and directing anger, there is no &quot;red rage&quot;, and Fox people are urban people.<p>This is a misconception. One blames the media for the information purveyed rather than the sorts of people amenable to Fox&#x27;s viewpoint in their news. If there was prima facie no distinction between those who adore Pres. Trump, and those who despise him, prior to their exposure to Fox News, then this might be a tenable position, but given that there are two different demographics, both of which have access to Fox News and yet react distinctly differently to it, tells us that there are other factors at play.<p>&gt;What is true is that nowadays people can live in socially-isolated bubbles that do not communicate with other bubbles. This is not a function of geographical location, though, but hyper-personalized media consumption.<p>And yet geography seems to be at play in which media bubble you end up in, as do a number of other factors. Perhaps the media bubbles are as much a function of existing divisions as the exacerbated divisions are of the bubbles?')
