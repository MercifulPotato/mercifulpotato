When dealing with a Result&#x2F;Either&#x2F;Maybe or some other functor, you <i>have</i> to acknowledge the context of the value, i.e. that the value could possibly be an error. This way the error handling is baked into the type system in a way that&#x27;s hard to replicate in languages that just return error codes or exceptions.')
