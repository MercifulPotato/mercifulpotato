Or start over from a non-flawed base?&quot; - those would both be ways to avoid the presumed local optima, yes.<p>&quot;Which is what? Still to be created, or does it exist?&quot; - several different &#x27;initial stakes&#x27;&#x2F;bases in the space of programming languages exist&#x2F;were made&#x2F;can be created than the family of languages mentioned in OP. Exploration from those might yield better optima. The widespread adoption of the current industry &#x27;standard&#x27; languages seems an accident of history, not guided by quality of language.<p>&quot;Are the bases flawed because they are low level?&quot; - yes. A significant part of the computing field is about abstractions. Improving the level of the technology is one of the arguments the article here makes too. Besides, it&#x27;s the implicit admission of everyone who doesn&#x27;t advocate&#x2F;write assembly.')
