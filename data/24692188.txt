Both have excellent support for Python.<p>Sure you can make those things run natively but people using them are used to Python, lot of code is written in Python for it and there is little to no performance penalty of running the code in Python (everything perf. critical is running natively anyway, Python is only used to &quot;glue&quot; those bits seamlessly together).<p>And once you have RAM in gigabytes even the extra memory overhead of Python becomes a moot point.')
