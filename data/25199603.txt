If someone synced a new keyfob or phone to their Tesla, it would show up on the owner&#x27;s phone as a new car key added + it would also show up in the car menu.<p>2. They could&#x27;ve taken it for joyrides, but there is no way the owner wouldn&#x27;t notice. The current car position is always updated in the app, the range it was driven is updated in the car, and the charge consumption is easy to display. It would be weird to see that the car is driving miles and miles without me operating it. And that&#x27;s not even mentioning all the other &quot;normal&quot; things that would be noticeable, like charge levels being off, car positioning, etc.')
