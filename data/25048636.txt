Some pundits even argued that &quot;Shy Trump Supporters&quot; are a myth.<p>I personally received something that <i>looked</i> like it was from a pollster in an unsolicited text message. Did I answer it? Of course not. I get inundated with spam calls and texts constantly. I&#x27;m also weary of answering any pollster because I have no clue how my responses are recorded and if such responses are being used in an advertising profile.<p>I wonder if pollsters have some way of compensating for that in their model? Because it looks like their methods are just to try and adjust sampling rates for other demographics rather than changing their questions and outreach methods.')
