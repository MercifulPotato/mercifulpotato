I don’t have a guide on hand, maybe another commenter will see this and have some resources :) Honestly my experience is just collected from 10 years working with and around other web applications, and as such is a bit ephemeral. I’d say any guides out there on the topic will arm with you enough knowledge to get started, or even working with services like the subject of this post. You’ll see the pieces at play in action, and can learn from them.')
