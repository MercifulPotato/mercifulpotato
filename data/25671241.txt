I don&#x27;t think the games are really comparable at all, about the only similarity is the blocky look of the characters, and even that is changing soon, as skeletal animation was just launched.<p>If I had to compare to something, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s like Unity, except with their own app store from which you can instantly launch games&#x2F;experiences, and with cross-platform multiplayer taken for granted.<p>What I love most about Roblox is how the community is leaving behind a lot of the old game tropes and coming up with completely new things, as a lot of the game makers are kids. Turns out most games don&#x27;t have to involve shooting anything.')
