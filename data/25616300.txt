How did they capitalize?<p>That they violated international Law and got to illegally occupy and then annex a major financial Hub, isn&#x27;t that alone enough? I mean I go into detail about how it all took place.<p>They then got to quell dissenters and hunted them down in order to re-affirm Pooh&#x27;s (Xi) stance as the tough man of the CCP. 3 high profile activists have been jailed for nothing more than being involved in a protest, a previously Civil Right in HK, 10 of 12 Hongkoners were captured for non-crimes and sent to be tried on the mainland, essentially bypassing the need for the extradition bill that got rejected due to the protests as was intended, but worked anyway due to the perverse nature of the National Security Law.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what more to say to the rest of your response, and I&#x27;m wondering if you even bothered to read any of it; are you not familiar with amount of money that flows through Hong Kong&#x27;s Capital Markets at all? The value of the real estate in the most expensive place on Earth?<p>Also, I properly used paragraphs: so it&#x27;s hardly a wall of text. Lengthy perhaps, but not a wall of text as its properly structured.')
