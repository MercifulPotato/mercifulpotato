The classic Mac mentioned in the linked article even knew when you had a floppy inserted and could show (and open) an icon on the desktop once you did.<p>But you could also say the same for Windows 95 though, after you inserted the CD and had the window open then what? You still had to read a manual or whatever to figure out how the application worked.<p>Or even Windows 95 itself. Which isn&#x27;t something that modern PCs have solved either - people who haven&#x27;t used computers before to this day treat them as (black) magic boxes that they might break if they do something slightly odd because of how complex things are. And a modern Windows 10 computer has a <i>ton</i> more stuff on screen than a Windows 95 computer ever had.')
