You can also imagine some real-world microservices-based program with a good architecture and a lot of code that handles all the exception cases of incoming data,  all easily understandable.<p>And now imagine an optimizing compiler for prolog programs. It may have much less code but the algorithm will be so complex that it might be impossible to fully understand its behaviour. E.g. fast-downward is a great example of such a program.<p>So I&#x27;m wondering what does Kolmogorov complexity actually tell? Or does it tell anything useful in &quot;real&quot;-world?')
