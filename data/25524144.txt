Basic JVM IO would be fairly easy to get going, and the POSIX APIs could be tested by having Jepsen call (maybe via IPC?) a small C&#x2F;whatever binary. I don&#x27;t know what fault injection would look like though: presumably you&#x27;d want to do something down in the kernel&#x2F;device drivers&#x2F;hw, and that land is largely a mystery to me.<p>Tangentially, I would <i>love</i> to have a FUSE filesystem with a.) minimal build dependencies, b.) some sort of CLI interface, and c.) the ability to, say, forget to flush un-fsynced data to &quot;disk&quot;, allowing us to simulate a power failure. There have been a bunch of research projects on this front, and they find bugs spectacularly. I bet this approach would <i>also</i> find errors in distributed systems, but I&#x27;ve yet to find one that really has the right shape for use with Jepsen.')
