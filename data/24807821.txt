Item(by='mjevans', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602915524, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24788753, text='The Digital Divide, is a symptom of a few larger issues.<p>* Wealth and funding divide, caused by lack of a (fully funding) national budget and distribution system.<p>* An access to the Information Superhighway divide, mostly enabled by failing to classify the underlying structure as a utility, which all (taxpayers) pay to pave out (like roads) and then maybe have services on top of (like power, water, sewer; things that the very poor might have discounted rates on, but still first class access to).<p>* A resource allocation issue; because having these research tools at home and a way of using them with the collective knowledge of our species (the Internet) wasn&#x27;t even on the horizon before, and efforts to remotely approach it were hampered by the budget issues mentioned above.  Yet even in the very affluent districts I suspect a computer lab at school or in a very nice library is the best current state of affairs.<p>* As CGP Grey correctly noted (I can&#x27;t remember if this was in a video, podcast, or just on a forum somewhere): schools are really warehouses for mass babysitting kids during the day and also places of training them to be humans, rather than animals.  Surely I&#x27;m not the only person that, by the end of highschool, viewed schools as &#x27;day prison for minors, with access to limited training&#x27;.')
