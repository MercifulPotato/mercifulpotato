Whatever the reason is, even outside of US. So I&#x27;m pretty sure this is legal.<p>As European (we don&#x27;t have this racial segregation fetish so please excuse my lack of knowledge on the subject) I&#x27;m more interested how they define black and brown companies?\nWhat if the company is owned by 3 people, 2 black, 1 white? Will they invest 33% less because the company is partially owned by a person of wrong race? What if it&#x27;s 50&#x2F;50? What about muslims? Women? LGBTQ? What if the company is owned by white people, but upper management is fully black? Where do they draw the line?')
