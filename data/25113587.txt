We&#x27;ll then see a heavy third wave challenging the immune systems of those who didn&#x27;t qualify for early vaccination.<p>Currently we don&#x27;t even know wether the vaccines can cause herd immunity effects or not. It&#x27;s perfectly possible that they just reduce heavy sickness infections into symptomless spreader infections. The tests didn&#x27;t check for that (you can&#x27;t do daily PCR on a test population of ten thousands). If that was the case the vaccines would still be a great improvement, but the third wave during partial vaccination would be particularly nasty if the vaccinated are not firewalls but stopovers.')
