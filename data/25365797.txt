They&#x27;ve bullied and victimized dozens of Tesla customers in their quest to smear Tesla and Musk. Just my perspective on what I&#x27;ve seen following these people for a few years. They also failed to mention that Cristina already lost the lawsuit once. Now she is appealing, which she has the right to do. I wish her the best of luck in resolving this in a way that allows her to move on from what happened.')
