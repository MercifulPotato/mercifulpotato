Basically you have to set the explosives off just right.  An accidental detonation of the conventional parts of the bomb can&#x27;t do that (short of like space re-entry speeds or some other thing that could provide the force needed even without an explosion).  The fear has always been around the detonation systems since those are the only thing realistically capable of setting off a nuclear explosion.  Since the 1950s as detonation systems have gotten more reliable they&#x27;ve added more and more redundancy so those have all sorts of interlocks to prevent them from going off if not armed and fired.  It&#x27;s not like an airbag where if you hook up 12v to the right pins it goes bang.  They actually need to be armed and then fired which requires a whole bunch of systems doing their thing in a specific order.  The systems that arm weapons (like the aircraft and rocket side hardware) are relatively sophisticated and robust and a hell of a lot of man hours have been put into them over the years because the last thing you need is a risk of ordinance going off when you&#x27;re already trying to fight a fire.')
