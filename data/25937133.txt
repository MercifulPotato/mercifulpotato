At least in the short term, yes. My previous Smart TV experience was a Sony from 2014. The &quot;smart&quot; experience was barely usable let alone ideal. I just plugged in other things - PS3 and then various Roku devices.<p>But a year ago I got a TCL Roku TV, and it&#x27;s a pretty good experience. The one downside now is that it seems just a tiny bit slower than, say, a Roku 3. And of course no way to upgrade that. Down the line, that could be annoying. But it was also a 65&quot; 4K TV with a pretty good picture all for $500. <i>shrug</i> In five years, I&#x27;ll get a nicer screen and maybe a separate device, depending on the state of things. As a side note, I got a sound bar with wireless subwoofer and surround that uses HDMI ARC. So I never need a second remote, or a universal remote, or anything like that. It all... just works.<p>Anyway, built a small TV room for my spouse this fall, and we picked up a 40&quot; TCL Roku TV. Just perfect for the situation. Easier to install, fewer wires, one remote. No complaints really. Perhaps if Roku goes the way of the dodo, and I want that TV screen to last longer, it could be annoying, assuming the &quot;screen&quot; part and the UI that lets me pick the inputs stopped working, I&#x27;d be out of luck, but that could be true of any TV. Of course, if updates were malicious and blocked those features, that would be nasty!')
