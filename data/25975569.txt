Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25977196], score=None, time=1612063638, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25973161, text='One way to do income tax would be that if you get paid $60,000 then your employer gives you $60,000 and at the end of the year you have to cut a check to the IRS for e.g. $18,000. The problem with this is that if you give people $60,000 then a lot of them spend all $60,000 and come tax time they don&#x27;t have the tax money and you need to start having tax debtors prisons or something. The analogous thing for a UBI would be that you get all the money on one day of the year, whether it&#x27;s January 1st or December 31st or July 4th, and then some people spend all the money immediately and starve to death six months later.<p>What we do instead is withholding. Your employer is to pay you $60,000&#x2F;year, i.e. $5000&#x2F;month, but instead of actually giving you $5000&#x2F;month, they give you $3500&#x2F;month and give the rest directly to the IRS. Then you don&#x27;t owe anything at the end of the year and a lot of people actually get some back because they took out more than they needed to.<p>The reconciliation period for this is in the law somewhere but in principle it can be whatever you want. It could be instantaneous. As soon as you get your paycheck, the employer cuts one to the IRS at the same time.<p>With a negative income tax, some people would have a negative withholding amount. So the IRS would cut a check to the employer and then the employer would include that money in your paycheck.<p>So what happens if there is no employer? Well, then you&#x27;re the employer. You&#x27;re a sole proprietor making $0. So you fill out the paperwork with the IRS to reconcile your withholding, which would be in a negative amount, and they send you a check (or direct deposit the money in your bank account). There is no reason in principle that they couldn&#x27;t do this as soon as you fill out the paperwork, i.e. on March 1st the instant you lose your other job and become a sole proprietor with no income.')
