But ideally with better execution. They&#x27;ve got a great stats page. But you can see a pretty sharp decline in their contributions since ~2016. They&#x27;ve changed management a few times, and I wonder if that&#x27;s contributed to the the decline.<p>&gt; addressing a need gap\nImmediately, no. But rysolv is ~2 months old right now. And I&#x27;m still building every day.<p>A few things I&#x27;d like to add: \n- First time only: accepted bounties only if it&#x27;s the users first PR\n- Projects: Kickstarter approach for new projects. Pitch an idea and have people crowdfund it. \n- Gitlab support<p>&gt; mention Rysolv\nSure! Go ahead. And feel free to give me a ping if you want any additional info on the site. \n(tyler@rysolv.com)')
