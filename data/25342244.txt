Even if she were guilty, she wouldn&#x27;t be looking at jail time where it makes any sense for a regular person with family to try running.<p>Soeaking of idiots ruining their life: Assange might be a good example that people know. He was allowed to surrender on his own&#x2F;with his lawyers (first time around). Not sure about his latest arrest, but IIRC he was resisting and all they did was humiliate him by carrying him out like a petulant child.')
