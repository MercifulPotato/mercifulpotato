Yikes!<p>Is this a joke? The 30 year mortgage is possibly the single most powerful financial tool available to an average person. It allows you to leverage hundreds of thousands of dollars for just a few percent down. Imagine going to your stock brokerage and asking for 1000% margin on a $10,000 account. You would be laughed at. Yet that&#x27;s precisely what a mortgage allows you to do. In the US at least, home ownership is also incredibly tax advantaged as well, to the point that it is almost impossible to build wealth otherwise for a normal working class person.')
