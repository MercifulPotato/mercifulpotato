I have a C in my address and sometimes it&#x27;s fine and sometimes it&#x27;s a whole thing explaining that it&#x27;s not 4, it&#x27;s C.<p>That said, two-number adresses are pretty common, I&#x27;m surprised you run into trouble with that. I live near Tokyo Tower, and even in the heart of Tokyo Minato-ku is only 99.XX% three-digit addresses. Azabu Nagasaka and Azabu Mamiana are tiny neighborhoods that are both still two digits (and Mamiana&#x27;s name is another weird story...).')
