The only viable way to generate them produces a lot of carbon, and the runoff has its own ecological toll.<p>Since we&#x27;re comparing industrial ag with human-scale stuff it&#x27;s only fair to point out that simple human-scale means of achieving this is to literally pee in a container, let it sit for a few months, dilute it 10-20x with water, and apply to garden beds. This fertilizer has an NPK of 11-1-2. If you compost, peeing directly onto it will have a similar effect.<p>Also &#x27;letting it sit fallow&#x27; is not really stating the option fairly. Nitrogen-fixing cover crops are an option and these can be cohabit with or grow in rotation with a main crop.<p>I think it&#x27;s a mistake here to assert that small-scale gardening should mimic industral ag practice. Of course that would produce a fragmented solution that is less efficient and offers little to no benefit.<p>&gt;A 40% tax on fertiliser (or whatever) would have enormous shockwaves on industrial agriculture; steps would be taken rapidly to reduce useage. A hobbyist growing tomatoes for his own use might not even notice, and thus, would not reduce usage.<p>I don&#x27;t buy that argument. Not only is a small-scale farmer less likely to be heavily reliant on buying in fertilizer, a 40% increase in cost will be equally impactful as to a large scale operator, because their means are proportionally smaller.<p>&gt;But the small hobbyist gardener has no reason not too either. The same incentives apply at every level.<p>Not true. Bob the farmer has a much closer societal link to joe the fisherman. If bob&#x27;s practices impact on Joe&#x27;s means of sustenance, not only are they on an equal footing to discuss the matter but they can do by leaning over the fence. Big Ag talking to fisheries, by comparison, looks quite different and more abstracted, less neighbourly if you will. Likewise if the polluter is a large industry and the impacted parties are individuals, all the same problems of abstraction and drastically lowered leverage to boot.<p>There are many examples where this is not true, of course e.g. Damages done at a great distance between source and impact.')
