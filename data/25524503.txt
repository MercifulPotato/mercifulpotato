Steeping minutes: Green at 3, black at 4, herbal at 5. Good tea is that simple!<p>That just sounds incredibly bitter. I highly recommend using more tea to less water, and much, much, much lower steep times. Especially for greens as they&#x27;re more delicate.<p>If your tea is bitter or astringent, its a combination of water that might be too hot, and long steep times.<p>80-90C for most green teas. The hotter you go the lower your steep times should be.\n90C+ for blacks.<p>At the extreme you could try gong fu brewing if you&#x27;re really into your tea :) steep times as short as ~10 seconds are not uncommon.')
