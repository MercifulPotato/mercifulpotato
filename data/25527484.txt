While I&#x27;m not a fan of BMW&#x27;s new design language (think the 4-series, or the iX), nor their move to subscription-based features, it&#x27;s still my go-to brand. Other (non-exotic) brands are either downsizing (2.0 engine in the new C63 AMG for gods sake) or going fully electric â€“ and I like my v8 rumble in the morning.')
