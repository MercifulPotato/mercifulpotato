I learned pretty early on that we don&#x27;t give names to the animals.<p>That said I&#x27;ve no qualms about doing the &quot;dirty work&quot; myself, if necessary.  I can&#x27;t imagine how it ever would be, but I&#x27;m kinda grateful I got to see where meat, and to a lesser extent crops, come from.  As well as appreciating exactly how much work it is.<p>Nowadays I have a small allotment for growing food, but I know damn well farming life is not for me.  For fun at a tiny scale is interesting and rewarding.  Doing it commercially is a hell of a lot of work.   (Though I know nothing of the American-styled &quot;super-farms&quot; with all the automation.)')
