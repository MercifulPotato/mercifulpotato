A bad manager anywhere can cause a workgroup to turn toxic. I&#x27;ve seen it happen literally everywhere I&#x27;ve ever worked, though luckily only 1st hand at one location. (Actually there was one exception: working at a Barnes &amp; Noble during college. I&#x27;d heard horror stories about other locations while I was there, but the store I worked at was run by an extremely good manager who cared for her employees and fostered that attitude in her assistant managers as well. It was also the most profitable store in the region, probably not a coincidence)')
