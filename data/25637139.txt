We’ve built machine learning software that enlightens the world’s enterprises by enabling them to truly know what’s in their contracts and documents. We’re bold in our decision making, clear on our mission and – most importantly – passionate about pairing the power of human know-how with a powerful product. \nWe are hiring developers for Senior Golang and Intermediate Developer roles to join our cross-functional teams of high performing Developers, Quality Engineers, Product Manager and Designer. In the senior Golang role you would join a team working on our new greenfield SaaS project to expose our core ML as a service, competing directly with AWS ML and Google ML. You would be working on serverless architecture, event driven design, distributed microservices, all supported and built on tools such as Kubernetes, Knative, Istio, Prometheus, Thanos, Jaeger, Keycloak, Github Actions and other cutting edge tools and services. In the intermediate role, you would be working in a pod focusing on our analysis capabilities. You will work in all areas of our stack, which includes working on Clojure web server, backend data processing services, web front-end and our platform API. We use PostgreSQL to store our data and don’t hide SQL behind big frameworks. The application (SaaS) is offered in AWS as well as on premises and you will be involved in developing the architecture. We also use many other popular technologies such as RabbitMQ, Zookeeper, ElasticSearch and Docker. \nSince our establishment we have gone far and have built a powerful tool relied upon by thousands of users every day. We are now ready to scale, innovate and take the application to the next level. You will make serious software and have fun doing it. We strive to constantly learn, question the crowd, push the boundaries of existing technology, and solve difficult problems.\nFor more information, visit our careers page <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kirasystems.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kirasystems.com&#x2F;careers</a> or email me at sarka.urbankova@kirasystems.com.')
