I don&#x27;t consider myself much of a wine connoisseur (I rarely drink at all).<p>I do like to pay attention to it a little from a business perspective. It&#x27;s one of so many interesting case studies of the differences between the perception of how it works and is owned and how it actually is.<p>It doesn&#x27;t hurt that I actually spent a bunch of my teenage years picking grapes in a wine region in Australia. The fact that I can follow them from how their grown and fill in the ownership of the wine companies and the marketing.<p>Case in point, I&#x27;m in Estonia at the moment and among the Australian Wines on sale here is Yellow Tail. In Australia however it doesn&#x27;t have much of a reputation. IMO It&#x27;s not what you would pick if you were looking for a &#x27;nice&#x27; local Australian wine.
