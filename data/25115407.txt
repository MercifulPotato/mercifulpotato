However, EMail was never designed to do this. Eg if you order products over the internet, how do you know that your opposing party keeps their DKIM key safe?<p>I get that email and DKIM was never designed for this, it&#x27;s a side effect. Fingers were not designed for finger print evidence, but it&#x27;s still nice to have evidence from finger prints, as a side effect from touching things.
