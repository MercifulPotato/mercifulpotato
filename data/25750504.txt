Anywhere I&#x27;ve lived in the US, someone would know (well, maybe not if they were young enough) what you meant by &quot;telephone directory&quot; but almost everyone would say &quot;phonebook&quot; at least in casual conversation. It&#x27;s also true that when you would dial 411 for a number, that was called directory assistance. (And a listing of phone numbers for the staff in an organization would probably be called a staff directory or a telephone directory or something along those lines.)')
