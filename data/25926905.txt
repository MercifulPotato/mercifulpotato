We are a silver member with about a dozen developers but 3x as non-developers who need to participate on issues.<p>Although most issues are open, there are occasionally confidential issues that staff need to be able to view and comment on. The <i>entire</i> annual seat license is required for every member, to work on only a handful of tickets. It&#x27;s very poor value for money.<p>For the devs the license is reasonable value for money (we use CI, git, docker repos etc).<p>But for the majority of staff, and therefore the whole org, value for money is <i>very bad</i>. The GitLab pricing model gives us no option.<p>It&#x27;s made it a more difficult sell in the organisation. Boasting about dev features leaves a bad taste in the mouth when only the minority of seat licenses actually need to use them.')
