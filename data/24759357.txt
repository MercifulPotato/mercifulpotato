When the lockdown happened, three months of nearly 100% occupancy evaporated in about three days. After a couple of weeks, local bookings trickled in - 20-somethings who wanted to get high outside of their parents house and take any extra toilet paper they could find. One or two even tried to sneak a party in, but were apologetic and understanding when we asked them to wrap it up and send their friends home. And we finally had our first domestic violence incident, which was traumatic but ultimately resulted in better things for our guest. It bears repeating: 2020 has been rough.<p>When Airbnb put out guidelines - sanitize, don&#x27;t allow gatherings, 24-hour cooldown between bookings, etc., we bumped up our rate and started communicating that up front before accepting bookings - and everything got much better. For the last few months, our weekends have been booked solid - mostly for weddings and anniversaries. A couple of remote workers who wanted a change of scenery. Was it the 100% occupancy we&#x27;ve had during summer months in year past? No. But it feels like a better balance.<p>I think the lockdown flushed out the people misusing the system. Were those people and those setups part of Airbnb&#x27;s valuation? Probably. But it feels like it&#x27;s brought things closer to the original purpose of Airbnb. I hope they pull through, but even in the event they don&#x27;t, someone will swoop in to take over that market.')
