On the one hand, they advertise the lack of charger in an iPhone box by their environmental consciousness. On the other hand, they advertise the &quot;full experience&quot;, in order to get which you need to buy a new charger and a new cable. The author isn&#x27;t asking Apple to change their packaging strategy; the author wants Apple to <i>make the marketing consistent</i>.<p>(Personally, I think the two messages only lend credence to the cynical view: that Apple&#x27;s environmental concern is bullshit, and it&#x27;s all a way to hide a price increase behind &quot;optional&quot; dongles, hoping the buyers are too dumb or too committed to the brand to notice.)')
