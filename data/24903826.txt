I have a litany of reasons for moving including soul-crushing endless winters, lack of reasonable summer, depressed economy, and a political landscape without an identity and with an extremely short memory (shorter than average in my view). I also spent my summers in Northern Michigan camping and have extremely fond memories of that. For the beauty that Michigan offers, you have to really, really enjoy the winter months and do OK with a lack of sun to make it there. I struggled something awful with Seasonal Affective Disorder [1] as an adult along with Vitamin D deficiency [2]. It&#x27;s also worthwhile to look at things like insurance rates, vehicle registration, and cost of utilities for the municipalities listed. Take into account school systems if you have little ones - Michigan is not widely considered to have the best around, and routinely ranks in the bottom 1&#x2F;3 of the States [3].<p>I clearly have a lot of bias against Michigan, so please take this for what it&#x27;s worth. I did try to provide some backing for my bias, but I spent a long time saving to escape and if there&#x27;s anyone aligned with my concerns, I hope I saved them a trip they&#x27;d regret.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;seasonal-affective-disorder&#x2F;symptoms-causes&#x2F;syc-20364651" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;seasonal-affe...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.currentresults.com&#x2F;Weather&#x2F;Michigan&#x2F;annual-days-of-sunshine.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.currentresults.com&#x2F;Weather&#x2F;Michigan&#x2F;annual-days-...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;best-states&#x2F;rankings&#x2F;education" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;best-states&#x2F;rankings&#x2F;education</a>')
