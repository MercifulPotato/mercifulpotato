Dooling simply ignores the science[0] (slide 23) and gives equal &quot;maximize benefits and minimize harms&quot; merit (3 pluses) to vaccinating 65+ and vaccinating essential workers, despite recognizing on slide 21 that with a disease-blocking vaccine, &quot;Initially vaccinating age ≥65 in Phase 1b averts approximately 2–6.5% more deaths, compared to targeting high-risk adults or essential workers&quot;.<p>The tipping point then comes from the equal-weighted (why?) metric of &quot;Mitigate health inequities&quot;, where she gives  essential workers three pluses but 65+ only one plus.  This gives &quot;essential workers&quot; 9 pluses total, greater than the 6 pluses for 65+.<p>It is frankly shocking that a person can recognize one course of action will clearly save the most lives, then assign an arbitrary score that puts that course of action as equally beneficial as the &quot;woke&quot; course of action--for no reason--and then invent another arbitrary category of equal importance that gives more weight to the &quot;woke&quot; course of action because there aren&#x27;t enough brown people in the 65+ bucket.<p>It&#x27;s even more shocking that this fundamentally irrational and (poorly) racially-motivated reasoning was <i>unanimously approved[1] by the committee</i>.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;acip&#x2F;meetings&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;slides-2020-11&#x2F;COVID-04-Dooling.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;acip&#x2F;meetings&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;slides-...</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;mm6950e2-H.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;mm6950e2-H.pdf</a>')
