You can shift your sleep schedule by several hours and have it still be &quot;natural&quot; if you choose to. I&#x27;m not talking about massive 12-hour changes or anything, but in college I would routinely sleep from about 2am-10am if left to my own devices. That&#x27;s what felt best for me at the time, and it continued for a year or two after. The problem was that I was always tired because I would have to wake up around 7 for work, then I would get a &quot;second wind&quot; around 9pm and not be able to sleep until 1 or 2.<p>After a few week of forcing myself to go to bed earlier, even if it meant staring at the ceiling, it went away and getting up early was not an issue anymore. It also got easier as I got older, and there is some evidence that <i>some people&#x27;s</i> circadian rhythms will shift earlier as they age but over the course of decades, not months or even a few years.<p>If you&#x27;re physically unable to shift your sleep schedule even a couple hours, you have a sleep disorder and should see a physician. 8 or 9am is not all that early.')
