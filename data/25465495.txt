One issue is that linking through cgo is <i>really</i> slow, due to the fact that the runtime has no idea anything about types.  Probably OK if you&#x27;re just doing basic queries at a reasonable rate; but if you implement a custom callback,  suddenly all the marshaling back and forth takes a huge amount of time.<p>Not a deal-breaker; but a native implementation of sqlite in golang would be a lot nicer.')
