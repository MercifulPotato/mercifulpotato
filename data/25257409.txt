The first sentence stands alone, while the second sentence introduces an additive point. I think hard work is valuable <i>both</i> intrinsically (the point being made in the first sentence), and in service to future outcomes (the point being made in the second sentence). If in other comments I made it seem like I think it is <i>only</i> intrinsically valuable, that was a lack of clarity.')
