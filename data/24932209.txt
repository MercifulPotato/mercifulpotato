But unlike a proper ruleset, the defense cannot do the same, because there&#x27;s no actual definition of rude specified that I could say &quot;In fact, I did none of those things, your honor&quot;... and the accuser must iteratively prove his case. Instead I have to say &quot;Im not being rude&quot;, and then it becomes a he said, she said, but with the accuser weilding &quot;formal rules&quot;.<p>These are rules in the form of &quot;don&#x27;t be someone I don&#x27;t like&quot;, and at best follows the fashion &quot;the accused is presumed guilty until shown otherwise&quot;')
