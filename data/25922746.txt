Shoot low scores week after week, win tournaments, receive a ranking. Pretty straightforward.<p>Golf is unique among mass-market sports in that your performance is not subject to the effects of your opponents&#x27; play (other than psychologically). Nobody&#x27;s blocking you or hitting shots at you that you must return. It&#x27;s just your decisions, your ability, and the course in front of you.')
