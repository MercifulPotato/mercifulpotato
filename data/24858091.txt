When business software is compatible. When you don&#x27;t have to search through obscure forums or jump on FreeNode to figure out why your wireless card doesn&#x27;t work. When your filesystem corrupts and won&#x27;t boot because you didn&#x27;t shut it down correctly. When your font anti-aliasing and resolution scaling doesn&#x27;t look like shit. When you have several hours a day to set things up, rather than getting work done.')
