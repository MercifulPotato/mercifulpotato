You pretty much have to either:\n1. allow blanket access to all executables\n2. perform some sort of validation&#x2F;verification<p><i>Most</i> people are not as technical as the people on this site, and we <i>know</i> that blanket access to all executables is not a great idea. MacOS is not immune to malware.<p>Having executables be signed means the signature has to be checked and the certificate has to be checked to see if it hasn&#x27;t been revoked. I don&#x27;t see how to do that without &quot;phoning home&quot; and checking, tbh.<p>I mean yes Apple <i>could</i> enable some expert setting or something for developer&#x2F;expert types where you can say &quot;trust me I know what I&#x27;m doing&quot; but a lot of people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing will enable that and then malware will run  rampant again.<p>It&#x27;s a shitty situation. But I&#x27;m not going to go down the paranoia rabbit-hole of assuming this is done to <i>spy</i> on me. At least not yet.')
