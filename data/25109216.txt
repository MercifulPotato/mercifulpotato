Someone asks a simple question and I start thinking, “oh god, what is gonna happen if I start mouthing off right now?”<p>Over the past few weeks I’ve had people tell me that thanks to my advice, they have either decided to continue trying to work on a problem (that they were going to give up on), or the reverse. I think this happens by accident when you are a subject matter expert in a field—no matter how narrow that field is, no matter how little of an expert you are, you know that 1) you can push someone new to the field in almost any direction you want, and 2) if you don’t push someone in a direction on purpose, you or someone else will just push them in a direction by accident.<p>That, and when you want advice you are rarely able to formulate the question correctly. Like if someone asks, “Can I do this?” the literal answer is, far too often, “Yes, but let’s have a discussion about whether you want to do that.”')
