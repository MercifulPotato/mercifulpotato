Transmission generally might not be so greatly reduced either - there are jobs which <i>have</i> to go to work (like my wife who is a doctor) so whole household is exposed, there are schools&#x2F;kindergardens still open in many countries (so our baby can easily bring covid from it while I haven&#x27;t been sitting in the office since mid march).<p>Using face masks and washing hands might be helping more with spread, something that was ridiculous and laughed at in western culture still 1 year ago. I was a fan of it even for regular flu as done in south east asia for a long time, but no way you could have done it here.')
