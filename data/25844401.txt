At current prices it would be a disaster and Ryan Cohen and his 2 other mates on the board would likely block that. If share price hits $100 would make more sense. In effect GameStop would save the shorts who wanted the company to die in the first place.<p>Also, for this to stop the short squeeze the company would need to issue 30% of their float and then the shorts would still need to find another 100% of float to cover fully. The shorting emperors are left without clothes any way you cut it.')
