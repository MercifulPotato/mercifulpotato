Without a ritual, the drudgery creeps closer and the vision of the monastery recedes.<p>This really hit me. I&#x27;ve been thinking for a few years now that it&#x27;s insane that something I liked as a kid that no one cared about now runs the world. The work can seem so detached from the things I&#x27;m actually good at, things that actually create value. Corporate culture seems to be designed to squash my ritual and my morale. The thing I loved has been corrupted in a way that doesn&#x27;t even serve the host in the best way. It tries to make sure I&#x27;m replaceable.... but inventors rarely are. All they ensure is scope creep and an increase in my desire to say fuck it to all of this and become a farmer.')
