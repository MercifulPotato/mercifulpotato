Probably not difficult to achieve with Postgres on Heroku, but why waste a couple of hours on something when I don&#x27;t need to?<p>2) My golden rule is to avoid anything that doesn&#x27;t get you closer to a customer in the next 14-28 days. For some use cases, Postgres on Heroku might help you do that. For me (see next point), it&#x27;s just adding <i>another</i> platform&#x2F;service for no reason. That will only slow me down.<p>3) I disagree that &quot;Firebase is slower to iterate because the schema is implicit&quot; (at least, as a hard-and-fast rule). It depends on how complex the schema is. You iterate on implicit schemas by rewriting code, and you iterate on explicit schemas by rewriting code and the schema itself. This is faster for complex data models with strong integrity requirements, but for basic data models (think mobile game leaderboards, etc) it&#x27;s just unnecessary.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that any of this is a huge amount of extra work. I&#x27;m sure a lot of people are reading this and \nthinking &quot;Postgres will just take an afternoon to hook up, why not?&quot;.<p>The reason is that spending that afternoon with a user is <i>infinitely</i> more valuable than spending it hooking up Postgres.<p>You have to be <i>ruthlessly</i> focused on what moves you forward, which at an early stage is simple - features, customers, users. On any given day, there are literally hundreds of things you could do that &quot;will just take an afternoon&quot;. If you allow them to distract you, you&#x27;ll probably end up like OP - 2 years in with a well-architected system that doesn&#x27;t have any customers.')
