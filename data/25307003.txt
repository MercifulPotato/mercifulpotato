It&#x27;s not like anyone is itching to allow Americans into their country considering just how astonishingly poorly we&#x27;ve handled it).<p>I&#x27;d really love for the pressure against public transportation in the United States to abate - from auto industry lobbyists to the public view that owning a car is a status symbol and that only &quot;poor&quot; people take public transit. My parents spent many years living just outside the SF Bay Area and their town can&#x27;t get mass transit access because Livermore refuses to have a BART stop in their town because of the &quot;bad actors&quot; (read: poor people) it could bring in. Livermore even went so far as to design all of their new bridges to get in the way of the center-of-highway BART tracks. Anyone further down I-580 Eastbound be damned.<p>I traveled across Japan and Germany completely on mass transit (buses, subways, high speed rail, walking), there were only a few places I would&#x27;ve preferred to have a car for. If I were using it for work travel, I&#x27;d much rather take a train and pull out a laptop and do something than have to drive, maybe even just enjoy the view.')
