The distribution now being called &quot;CentOS&quot; is almost at the opposite ends of the scale in terms of stability. The fact they&#x27;ve called this other thing the same name is purely marketing.<p>If you destroy something then create something entirely different with the same name then the fact remains that you still destroyed the original thing. That&#x27;s not dramatising or hyperbole.')
