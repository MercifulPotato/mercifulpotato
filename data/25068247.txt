It uses natural resources, causes waste, needs transport, and above all, needs manufacturing, by craftsman and women.<p>My wife repairs (upholstery) furniture and car interiors; with european wages, refurbishing, say, your designer-office chair or sofa easily costs upwards of â‚¬2000<p>(the answer, I&#x27;m afraid, is that &quot;manufacturing&quot; is cheap because of defacto slavery (sweatshops) of state subsidy (China), that &quot;waste&quot; and ecological footprint is not included in the price, and transport also subsidised by both the far-too-cheap &quot;overseas&quot; labor, and often even direct from states.)')
