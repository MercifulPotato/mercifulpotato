He clearly made some good hires pre-1990s (I can&#x27;t remember but the data guy clearly seemed to give them a huge edge over the competition, they clearly had data that no-one had) but it was that sequence of hires after this point that really elevated things: Peter Brown, Nick Patterson, Robert Mercer, etc. Very humbling. Of course, everyone will continue to think the strategies are the secret sauce.<p>Also, I think it highlights that quant investing starts out being very scalable but stops scaling quite quickly (and most similar firms hire people that, on paper, are very smart and get nowhere...so RenTech is the best example of scalability). At the top end, fundamental investing is still more scalable (which is what common sense would indicate).<p>As an aside, the article is totally pointless. Finance professors are engaged in an argument with themselves. They know they believe things that make no sense, and so spend all their time grappling with facts to fit them into their model. Humans do not reason perfectly, when you put a trade on you move the market, effects can last for ages (you have pure arbs that take years to close)...the whole discussion is just non-sensical, and any academic examination of finance should start from reality, not what theories are fun to teach. It is kind of tragic to see intelligent people do this to themselves...but some people just prefer Haskell to Python.')
