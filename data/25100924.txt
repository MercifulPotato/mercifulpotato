My side of the engineering department has taken a hard stance on what our definitions of Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer and Applied Scientist are.

The ones who have taken these offers have been some of our best hires.<p>On the other hand the analytics&#x2F;sales teams have many DS and MLEs, a DA is basically a “junior” for them, but they routinely have to reach over to an engineering team to do pretty basic SWE skills that they are supposed to cover themselves')
