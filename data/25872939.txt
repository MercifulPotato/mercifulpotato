Item(by='sneak', descendants=None, kids=[25873724, 25873490, 25873548, 25874073], score=None, time=1611332226, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25872848, text='iOS applications aren&#x27;t allowed to stay awake constantly talking to a bunch of different network services.<p>For iOS IM to work, a centralized server (and corresponding developer ID) has to send a notification to you, sent first to Apple to be proxied via Apple&#x27;s push notification service (APNS) to which each iOS device maintains a persistent connection.<p>This means that some third party service has to know when you get a message (and thus needs to proxy your connections to the IM services, and know your credentials and see your message contents) to be able to know when to send that notification.<p>This (and Signal now replacing the cryptographically shattered iMessage) is probably the main reason I&#x27;m switching to Android; truly decentralized&#x2F;private notifications aren&#x27;t really possible on iOS.  They have to come from the app developer&#x27;s own 24&#x2F;7 online servers, sent from them to you via Apple servers, which means that federated stuff is basically out without providing your login details to the developer (which of course lets them see all your messages).  This is also why almost no ActivityPub&#x2F;fediverse clients can notify you of DMs on iOS either if you run your own instance.<p>I know there&#x27;s Background App Refresh now that lets apps wake up periodically to download stuff; I&#x27;m not sure if such polling can fire off notifications from the local app.  It&#x27;s probably too much latency for IM, however, due to the fact that Background App Refresh isn&#x27;t (last I looked) allowed to run continuously (for battery reasons).')
