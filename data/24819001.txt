The goal of those investments were for very specific projects that assisted the military (short and long term) and the Internet and SV were a side effect.<p>Trying to build a “Rival Cloud” immediately sets off red flags for me because of how vague it is. What are the concrete goals? To replicate AWS? How much would you want to replicate? Which services? Which features in the services? Why would customers choose this over AWS?
