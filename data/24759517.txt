Choose a tech stack and start building a Reddit clone, and you&#x27;ll quickly hit roadblocks and get ideas.<p>Started a new side-project on the weekend (after a long long hiatus of just focusing on day job). Phase 1 was simply getting the stack up and running (PostgreSQL-backed, Python gRPC service taking gRPC-web through Envoy to a React front-end). Took some fighting through the setup to get a full-stack existence proof, ideas that arose during the working session:<p>side-project TODO #1 - Write a blog post about getting this all setup using current versions and push a public github repo with the setup to help other out.<p>side-project idea #2 - Build a micro-PaaS where a customer can define a gRPC interface, Python module implementing that, and with a single command, push this to a live serving endpoint.<p>side-project idea #3 - I need a state machine as part of my application logic, TODO: write a Python non-ephemeral state machine library that, with a simple Python internal DSL, backs state machine persistence onto a PostgreSQL table, handle automatic schema updates as the state machine is changed &#x2F; versioned.<p>Literally not enough time to do any of these things though :)')
