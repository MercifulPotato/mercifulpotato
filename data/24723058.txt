It&#x27;s really the switches, knobs and levers of a machine that you use to make it do something. I get it that an API being textual throws non-technical people off. But for a programmer functionally there&#x27;s not much difference between a physical object, like a steering wheel, and some API call to invoke. They are both just something you use to interact with the underlying system. Hence the term.<p>It&#x27;s sort of perplexing that Google would send someone who can&#x27;t explain this point of view well.')
