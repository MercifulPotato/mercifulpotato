Your program is doing something that you didn’t correctly plan for, or build tolerances to handle gracefully.<p>And if you’re using a debugger to fiddle with variable manipulation at that level, then you’ll probably just make your program even more unstable.<p>But granted, sometimes you do need a debugger, when you’re using someone else’s library.')
