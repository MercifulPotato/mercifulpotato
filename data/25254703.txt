States <i>maybe</i> could but only because of very old case law that might well not stand up today. Of course, private workplaces, schools, government offices, airlines, etc. could to the degree that it might be quite difficult at some point to refuse.<p>To your broader point, if a roll the dice strategy backfired, you could not only have had dead people but you&#x27;d basically make vaccine development untenable both for this and probably other diseases.')
