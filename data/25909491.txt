If they&#x27;re not protected, how would it even be possible to evaluate the &quot;truth&quot; of the content.<p>There is no universal truth. That&#x27;s why everyone&#x27;s speech should be protected. Even lies.<p>Consider: Every civil rights achievement made in the last 100 years. If the minority opinion was squelched without a chance to be considered, what progress would have been made?<p>Would a &quot;Ministry of Truth&quot; in whatever form it might take, have even allowed statements questioning racial or gender equality?<p>Any system that enforces such censorship becomes a theocracy dictating dogma.<p>A statement as simple as &quot;There is no god&quot; would become blasphemous again.')
