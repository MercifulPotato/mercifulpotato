In fact, that&#x27;s ultimately the problem; that we constantly bend due to &quot;corporate interests&quot; that are subject to the whims of an incredibly small fraction of society that is, in general, massively disconnected from the norms of society.<p>Add on to that, generally having a large amount of money and privilege means that most of the things that are in the &quot;public interest&quot; aren&#x27;t really of significant concern to you because you can simply buy your way into a completely different system (see public vs private education)')
