The honest answer (at least at the university level) -- probably we don&#x27;t.<p>From what I can tell, there&#x27;s very little enthusiasm for online education, on the part of either professors or students. Pretty much everyone is eager to get back to normal, and I&#x27;m fairly confident that this is exactly what is going to happen.<p>For a dissenting perpsective, read Joshua Kim&#x27;s columns at Inside Higher Ed:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidehighered.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;joshua-kim" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidehighered.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;joshua-kim</a><p>He is a big cheerleader for online education and for major changes to university education. Personally, I don&#x27;t really buy his arguments -- but his posts are extremely well written and he does work full-time at a university, so you might find him more persuasive than I do.<p>If remote university education becomes widespread, then I expect innovations to largely come from outside the existing system. Universities are weird workplaces, and the incentive system does not really encourage large-scale innovation.<p>That said, it seems that startups like edX, Coursera, etc. have not really been successes. So I&#x27;m skeptical that big changes are coming soon.')
