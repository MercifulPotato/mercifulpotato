So?<p>So its faster then the last Mac book air, that was old, thermal constrained, and had a chip from Intel that has been overtaken by AMD.<p>Every test is single core, but guess what, modern computers have multi cores and and hyper threading and that matters.<p>Apples presentation was full of weasel words like &quot;in its class&quot; &quot;compared to previous models&quot;. Fine thats marketing, but can we please get some real, fair benchmarks, against the best the competition has to offer before we conclude that apples new silicon is gift from god to computing?<p>If you are going to convince me, show me how the CPU stacks up to a top of the line Ryzen&#x2F;threadripper and run Cinebench. If you want to convince me about the graphics&#x2F;ML capabilities, compare it to a 3090 RTX using running Vulkan&#x2F;Cuda.')
