These are not stream ciphers.  Good seeding remains important always, and that&#x27;s part of the crypto protocol, not the RNG.  This is not a problem for using MT responsibly in things like key generation, etc...<p>Again: don&#x27;t sweat this.  If you are competent to write your own crypto code and have a good argument for xorshiro or whatever, then use that.  If you just need a random number for whatever reason, use your library and don&#x27;t bother with the advice in the linked article.')
