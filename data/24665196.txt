It&#x27;s sending a message and waiting to receive a confirmation back before sending more. It&#x27;s control logic to control the flow in a pair of pipes, that&#x27;s affected by the latency back and forth.<p>UDP doesn&#x27;t do that. The Ethernet link doesn&#x27;t do that. The HDMI link to a TV doesn&#x27;t do that.')
