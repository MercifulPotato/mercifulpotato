But this is not a real requirement, and many aren&#x27;t. And even those that we elected, we elected for national jobs, not for the EU, and I do think that that makes a difference. This is what I mean by indirect legitimation.<p>&gt; Parliament is directly elected<p>Yes.<p>And that leaves the Commission, which is mostly former-ministers-who-need-a-job and are appointed based on negotiations between the governments.')
