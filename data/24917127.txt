Item(by='baybal2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603880221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24916111, text='&gt; several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitler&#x27;s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers<p>I wrote on this point:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24881824" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24881824</a><p>Yes, Hitler Adolf was not a compulsive paranoiac, and been noted by contemporaries as a shrewd political strategist. He committed his crimes in cold blood, and sane mind.<p>But.... his anti-Semitism not being a product of a mental illness, or irrational hate doesn&#x27;t make it less terrible. Were they rational from any viewpoint, serious, or not, it were these anti-Semitic policies which opened the road to the crime of genocide later in his reign.<p>This also doesn&#x27;t absolve the habitual anti-Semitism practiced by virtually every other political establishment in Europe prior to WWII from sins, or make it less bad as genocidal anti-Semitism of the late third reich.<p>The persecution, whether is based on political rationale, or a maniacal tendency, is still persecution. I would say a crime like this becomes even more grave if it is done with some behind the curtain political rationale.')
