I also think its very unlikely that any of them would have happened, though the Gab case provides some evidence to the contrary.<p>Instead, Parler followed the unfortunate dumbification of online presence over the last 20-30 years, and instead of doing the above, contracted with a large corporation to take care of things for them. The large corporation decided they didn&#x27;t want to do that anymore, and Parler lost its online presence.<p>Parler is not exactly unique in having made this choice. But perhaps the consequence of the choice they made might convince more people&#x2F;organizations&#x2F;corporations to think a bit more clearly about the type of hosting infrastructure they really want&#x2F;need. If Parler had followed the self-hosted pathway, I think it is extremely unlikely (though sure, not impossible) that they would be offline at this point.')
