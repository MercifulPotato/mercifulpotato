Quite simply, it&#x27;s a method of introspection via three simple questions from Buddhist philosophy:<p><pre><code>    What have I received from ____?\n    What have I given to ____?\n    What troubles or difficulties have I caused ____?\n</code></pre>\nThe &quot;____&quot; part can be a person, place or thing. Basically, I&#x27;d love to know if Naikan journaling increases your gratitude, happiness or mental health in any way. It does for me.<p>Please, check out my app here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.dailynaikan.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.dailynaikan.com&#x2F;</a><p>Note, if you want to know about Naikan, I translated the &quot;About Naikan&quot; section from the Japan Naikan Association&#x27;s website: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpnaikan.jp&#x2F;for" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpnaikan.jp&#x2F;for</a> everyone&#x2F;index.html<p>Naikan is a method of self-observation&#x2F;introspection developed my Yoshimoto Ishin, and is based on the mind&#x2F;spirit self-improvement practice called Mishirabe. As a mind-body therapy in the medical field, it&#x27;s generally used for self-enlightenment and resolving troubles or worries, as well as being used more broadly across enterprise and business training, school education and corrective education. The Mishirabe practice of mind&#x2F;spirit self-improvement was originally handed down from the Pure Land school of Buddhism, however Yoshimoto Ishin set out to exclude any religious parts of the practice, simplify it, and make it widely available to anyone. Later, in 1968, Ishin established the three current questions central to Naikan (&quot;What has been done for me?&quot;, &quot;What have I done in return?&quot;, &quot;What troubles have I caused?&quot;). In Naikan, there is &quot;Intensive Naikan&quot; that lasts a week and focuses on a fixed scope, and there is &quot;Daily Naikan&quot; which is occurs for short periods within daily life. Although Naikan is used practically for various purposes, as a treatment for illness and disease especially, it&#x27;s referred to as &quot;Naikan Therapy&quot;.<p>Finally, a helpful article about Naikan can be read here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tricycle.org&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;naikan-therapy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tricycle.org&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;naikan-therapy&#x2F;</a><p>Thank you')
