The second you use pandas with a custom data type (let alone any other library you&#x27;d want to use) it can randomly auto convert it to a float.  Furthermore identifying when it randomly converts the type on you is a pain.<p>&gt;so floating point basically must be used.<p>Quants tend to use fixed precision types.  It is like a float in every way, except base 10 instead of base 2 so there is no floating point error.')
