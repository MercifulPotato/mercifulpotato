Consequently, a company must either have large starting capital <i>or</i> the ability to grab a large enough portion of the market to pay for the costs of the initial infrastructure outlay.<p>The barrier to entry for the short form messaging market? Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Any programmer can recreate the functional parts of Twitter in under a day, scaling aside. And there are already several Twitter competitors. They&#x27;re simply not very popular because they&#x27;re difficult to use.')
