Item(by='jhedwards', descendants=None, kids=[25917345], score=None, time=1611675857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25915219, text='What I am reading is: &quot;the [universe] is so large and complex, and I feel that it is beautiful, therefore there must be some entity that created it&quot;<p>How does that logically follow? To me that is clearly just a projection of the human concept of a &quot;creator&quot;, a person who makes things (like a house, a fire, or a website), onto the universe. I see no reason to project my human experiences and ideas onto something as vast as the universe. Whatever is &quot;out there&quot; or &quot;beyond&quot; is by definition something that far exceeds our comprehension, our human concepts. If you want to call that &quot;god&quot;, so be it, but I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s anything more than just a placeholder for something we can&#x27;t reach.<p>We can, on the other hand, gradually understand more and more of the laws and properties of the universe itself, and how those work together to create the phenomena we find in the universe. All those gaps in the subset of phenomena that we can observe, I am confident that we are at least theoretically capable of understanding.')
