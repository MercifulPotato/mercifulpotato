That said, I think the quality did improve between season 1 and 5.<p>And I vehemently disagree with the notion that &quot;almost all shows get significantly worse&quot;. There are definitely many shows that do jump the shark at some point and significantly drop in quality. On the flip side, there are many examples of shows that needed a couple of seasons to find their tone and really hit their stride which they most likely never would have had the chance to do at Netflix. E.g: Parks and Recreation, Community, Justified, even Breaking Bad imho.')
