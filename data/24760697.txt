It&#x27;s independent of wear and tear. It&#x27;s a financial concept, not an engineering&#x2F;mechanical concept. Jeep Wranglers, for example, hold a better value compared to the average even if they have higher mileage and age, especially if its in a mountainous local market.<p>Wear and tear is mechanical repairs and maintenance. Oil changes, tire changes, spark plugs, etc.<p>A good amount of people buy a certain car and maintain it, intending to run the vehicle into the ground completely.<p>If you really want to do the &quot;simple math&quot;, don&#x27;t forget about the opportunity costs associated with the wait times, scheduling around someone else&#x27;s schedule and delays due to public transit and rideshares. That&#x27;s where you realize just how much a car actually saves you. I used to live in Seattle and Portland for a few years (each). I bit that poisonous apple of, &quot;I don&#x27;t need a car since I&#x27;m going to live in the city&quot;. 15-20 minute car commutes would be about an hour on average on public transit (that&#x27;s if they ran on time). Never. The. Fuck. Again.')
