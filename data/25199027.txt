That&#x27;s why some papers printed it squished down to a smaller size.<p>It sure seems like he should have taken his work online. No format restrictions, publish on your own schedule. He was popular enough to blaze a trail for the new generation but he threw it away instead. That&#x27;s his choice but seems like a missed opportunity.<p>FWIW if they printed comics as half page color prints weekly (and not just gag strips) I&#x27;d subscribe to that. As newspapers were dying they seemed to cut back on that sort of thing though.')
