It seems to me that change is a subject to a kind of no-free-lunch, if everything is easy to change in your system, then it doesn&#x27;t do anything useful. IMHO you always have to be opinionated and predict what change is more likely and adapt to that.<p>Speaking of change, regarding #1. I am not clear how to reconcile (Agile&#x27;s?) &quot;embrace change&quot; with the well-known observation that fixing a problem in a SW system seems to be more difficult later in the design-implement-test cycle. Commonly, this is addressed by making that cycle smaller, but it seems to only constrain the design space (large and consistent designs are ruled out).<p>Finally, I would add a rule - Don&#x27;t change what works.')
