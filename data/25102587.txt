This isn’t possible because you live in an interconnected world.<p>Unless you’re a hermit who disconnects entirely from the web, you can’t drop them.<p>You may cancel all your accounts, but you’ll still visit sites that use google analytics, interact with hosts that use Google’s registrars for their domain names, be profiled by google and included in targeted advertising by web sites that you don’t even know.<p>You’ll also be impacted by the incentives google puts on content creators through their de facto standards of chrome, web video, drm, etc.<p>I’d say it’s easier to drop the EU than Google.
