Born and raised in Malaysia and living in Australia. With USD2K in Malaysia you can easily live a comfortable, with free healthcare, safe and decent life if you can ignore the institutionalized racism towards dark skinned people. Plus an environment very conducive to running a business. In Australia USD2K is peanuts. You will struggle to  survive on that amount BUT on the other hand there is good social security and decency still means something(for how long more I have no idea).')
