We can&#x27;t simply ignore any observations that are not scientifically rigid, otherwise the whole edifice of philosophy or even some natural sciences should simply perish.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can just omit that. I&#x27;m a fan of Lakatos here, if I have some observation, I think one need at least as convincing evidence or more rigid one to prove otherwise.<p>&gt; because of carefully thought out and researched decisions<p>I think it&#x27;s a better evidence exactly because it&#x27;s what language users are asking about, and what large chunk of language users choose to use when they got a choice. This shows that quite a big share if not majority of programmers value type annotations.')
