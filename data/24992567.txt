The risk calculus just never panned out in their favor because of maintenance and availability of talent concerns. The Rust libraries for Raft and Paxos are much more approachable than my past experience with other implementations and the language itself provides a higher level of confidence. Jepsen, likewise, makes testing distributed systems an approachable problem.<p>Case in point: I&#x27;m currently experimenting with Raft and Paxos with the intent of putting it into production for a service that streams live updates to subscribers over websockets with time sensitive business logic that must only be executed once per object on a timer. Before Rust, I would have just slung the whole problem over to whichever infrastructure team was a glutton for punishment so that they could set up Consol&#x2F;kafka&#x2F;debezium&#x2F;whatever and set a reminder three months from now to revisit the issue.')
