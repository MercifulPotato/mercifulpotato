This must end. Real expressiveness demands that every entity in the interface is inherently programmable - a table of data shouldn&#x27;t just be a rendered picture of a table of data - it should be a table. Programming shouldn&#x27;t be separate at all.</i><p>Almost every attempt at such an environment has failed for a reason. The problem with programming is not the syntax and other particularities, but inherent complexity of explaining the task to a computer.<p>Natural interfaces like modern voice assistants have a lot more chances to succeed than programming, because <i>a)</i> they imitate normal human communication and <i>b)</i> they are less dependent on unambiguous programming. And they are still limited because their fuzzy nature makes them unreliable and unpredictable.')
