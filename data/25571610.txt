As open source has proven difficult to monetize, we may be seeing a return to proprietary closed source software.<p>Whether this is a good or a bad thing depends on how it plays out.  If software like Flow conforms to standards and offers a better experience, battery life, privacy, etc then it might work out well.  An open infrastructure with a marketplace to pay for desired features will benefit us all.<p>The bad scenario is that the web continues to fracture into proprietary components.  While a web not dominated by Chrome seems almost unimaginable today, it wasn&#x27;t that long ago that sites that only worked in Internet Explorer were commonplace.  If Flow actually becomes the dominant web browser and Flow-only websites ever become the norm, we&#x27;ll all be worse off for it.  That really is a far off scenario, so for now, having Flow as an extra player on the web is probably a good thing.')
