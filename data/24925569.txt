And neither Maslow had mice in mind when he developed his theory of motivation.<p>EDIT: Okay, apparently I need to clarify the statement. Humans have so much more possibilities to learn and motivate themselves than a mouse that it really makes no sense to draw conclusions about human behavior from the experiment. You probably remember that already a few brain researchers have dared the balancing act from basic research to show business with a few colored pictures of brain activity, and even got entangled in legal philosophical debates. Sure, you can win an audience and impress your sponsors, but this is not the actual scientific work.')
