Self correction spans the spectrum of manageable to disastrous. Carry capacity &#x2F; resource availability has temporal element and is not stable, allocation today may not be sustainable or available tomorrow. Mismanaged environmental cycles means feast or famine i.e. fisheries &#x2F; soil poorly managed and becomes increasingly unproductive or oil &#x2F; water reserves tapped faster than new discoveries or replenishment. Disaster when you cannot efficiently distribute what&#x27;s no longer there due to poor planning and foresight. Self correction could be preemptive population management or feast or famine cycles. One is more preferable than other for stable society. IMO free market is not capable of planning on such long timelines. Some problems become sufficiently large and long spanning that only state can handle, i.e. national defense is state directed, even if frequently poorly optimized in terms of resource allocation. Private military &#x2F; industry could exist under free market but works within superstructure set by state.')
