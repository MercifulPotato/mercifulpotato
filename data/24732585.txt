If you do a study, and conclude based on that study that a treatment works, you&#x27;re supposed to remain &quot;neutral&quot;?<p>Let me put it this way, I wouldn&#x27;t want to receive treatment from a healthcare provider who is &quot;neutral&quot; about the surgery they are about to give me, I want them to have a positive informed opinion based on experience, studies, etc.')
