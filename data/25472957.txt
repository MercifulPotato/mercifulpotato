I often work with these &quot;flawed&quot; characters, and early in the process there&#x27;s this question of &quot;do I really want to tell the story about this person?&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve got only limited patience for people being stupid and&#x2F;or mean. Can&#x27;t we tell stories about good and smart people? Those stories exist, but they&#x27;re depressingly rare.<p>I have ways of turning Shakespeare&#x27;s text into a story that I think you will want to hear. Or at least, trying to. It&#x27;s the hard part of my job as an artist.')
