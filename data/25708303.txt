Place a few where you know the carrier will drive over by sub, carrier sunk. Or just use the sub directly, modern small electric subs are undetectable in exercises, the sub will only be sunk when firing torpedoes. By then it is too late for the carrier.<p>Saturation by long-range antiship missiles is also possible to work, if the Falkland War is any indication.<p>And then there are the &quot;deorbit a tungsten telephone pole&quot; kind of ideas that just might work on a carrier, have no defense and are within the realm of possibility for both China, Russia and basically every state with the capability to get a few tons into some low orbit.<p>Against sophisticated enemies, carriers are giant billboards with &quot;shoot me&quot; written on them.')
