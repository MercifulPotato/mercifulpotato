On a tangent, when I was a teenager I would sometimes fall asleep on the couch with the TV on. Mostly because I don&#x27;t like falling asleep in the dark, esp. when alone. I would set a timer on the TV so it doesn&#x27;t run all night but inevitably the TV shutting off would wake me up. More recently I would put on a documentary on YouTube, and I would queue a few different ones so I get into deep sleep before they end, otherwise it would wake me up.')
