I dealt with Jonathan in the past, and I could only say good things about him - not just his business acumen, but his integrity and generosity.<p>Years ago Jonathan was in a position where we needed to buy back his shares in a company in which he invested early. He could have asked for a much higher price, and instead he graciously agreed to a different outcome - he understood the situation and did the right thing.<p>Glad to see that General Catalyst did the same in relation to Baremetrics, writing off their investment. These things don&#x27;t go unnoticed. Sometimes reputation is way more important than a few more bucks for your LPs.')
