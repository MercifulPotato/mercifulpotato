Apparently you&#x27;re expected to click NEXT every hundred words. But I did get this far:<p><i>According to reports, the mansion is owned by an unnamed wealthy property owner who regularly buys large mansions and leaves them to deteriorate. The owner has apparently purchased a number of lavish homes and left them all to rot.</i><p>That&#x27;s strange. How about a link to the &quot;reports&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d love to see the NYC tax records where they record ownership by <i>&quot;an unnamed wealthy property owner&quot;</i>. The property tax on six acres in NYC is high enough that people who can afford that are smart enough to manage their money more prudently. But I suppose it could be money from Chinese or Russians moving their wealth overseas.<p>There&#x27;s just enough strange phraseology that I&#x27;d venture that the article was written by a non-US person.')
