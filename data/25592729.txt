(Yes, I know you&#x27;re being hyperbolic.) In part, because if you have a non-compete, you may well also have NDAs, non-solicitation clauses, etc. which are enforceable in CA. If a company wants to make your life difficult you&#x27;re probably going to be out thousands of dollars in legal fees, lack of non-compete enforceability in CA notwithstanding.')
