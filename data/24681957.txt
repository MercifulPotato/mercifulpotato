Because the software is so cool (creating an infinite jukebox out of all your music sources and subscriptions, both local and online), you are inclined to buy their boxes.<p>Sonos doesn&#x27;t charge anyone for using the software and there are no ads introduced into your listening experience by Sonos. Their idea (and I think it&#x27;s a great one) is to make the listening experience so great and so unique on their hardware that you are simply compelled to buy more of it and to recommend it.<p>I started out with a Play:5 and upgraded a year later to a second one to make a stereo pair. I&#x27;ve also used these units in business with 5-7 Play:3s and multiple employees controlling them from their phones. There is simply nothing like this in the Bluetooth or other &quot;smart speaker&quot; worlds.<p>My house could support two Play:5s in four rooms + outside. Sonos setups offer &quot;Disney-like&quot; sound control where you decide what music plays in what room(s) and at what volume.  Were they to convince me to part with that much money, they could sell me $5K worth of speakers just based on the software experience (and the great sound quality, which no one disputes).')
