It was marketed as the fastest microcomputer in the world at the time so I think Acorn knew they&#x27;d hit on something special. I was 14 and used to write games on the BBC Micro Model B and so upgrading to the Archimedes with it&#x27;s speed, Sprite system and millions of colours was like suddenly being let loose in a huge unbounded creative arena. Good times.')
