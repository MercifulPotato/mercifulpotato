I don’t want React, but I want (a subset of) its API. I’m building a site with Next.js which in theory should be 99+% static and it should be able to ship with a very small JS footprint. But by default all that static junk gets bundled up anyway. And stripping it out would require a lot of manual work, or building yet another layer of build tooling that would be wonderful to have but is pretty daunting to think about.')
