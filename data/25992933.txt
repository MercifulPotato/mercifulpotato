It&#x27;s not about not conferring immunity, it&#x27;s about what kind of immunity a vaccine or an actual infection incurs and if those responses are complementary. And not all antibodies confer the same protection. One response from one agent is not another one alike, and there is variability between people. The adaptive immune system is activated in two main ways in response to a pathogen: a B cell antibody memory like you mentioner, and an often equally important T cell memory. B cell and T cell responses show heterogeneity. The B cell response to the vaccine is just against the spike protein (cause it&#x27;s an mRNA vaccine against the spike protein), while a B cell antibody response against an actual infection would show affinity to a greater diversity of proteins. If the body produces antibodies that targets the wrong antigens the response could end up being ineffective. And for T cells there is some early indications that the vaccine and virus give completely different responses. And there&#x27;s also the aspect the body being able to quicker and more effectively detect a pathogen with antibodies&#x2F;T cells the more times it&#x27;s exposed.')
