I&#x27;m leaving out Acid Rain because I never really was part of that discourse (too young) and didn&#x27;t read about it after the fact either.<p>These four (IMHO) do actually pose clear and present dangers to human health &amp; wellbeing <i>at scale</i>:<p>* Nuclear Weapons<p>* Smog<p>* Ozone<p>* Global Warming &#x2F; Climate Change<p>They were identified as risks and (except for Ozone, which was actually tackled and is improving to my knowlege) continue to be shown as risks. Or rather, by now, as actually doing harm.<p>On the other hand, these two here were never the big catastrophes that they were made out to be, yet were (and are!) continually overblown.<p>* Drugs &amp; Crime<p>* Terrorism<p>Neither of them ever had the existential threat potential that the other group had. Not-so-incidentally, the proposed &quot;solutions&quot; to these problems were always...<p>* highly profitable for certain industries<p>* useful for conservative re-elections<p>* based in little to no fact<p>* often (predictably) counter-productive.<p>Bottom line: if we had actually put time and money into existing, working solutions to measurable, actual problems, we would have been perfectly capable to do so. We did it for Ozone, we could have done it again. We didn&#x27;t.<p>Instead, we put countless dollars <i>and lives</i> into &quot;solving&quot; problems that were pretty much caused by their &quot;solutions&quot;, and mostly because that was in the best interest of very few people.<p>If people are tired of anything, I hope&#x2F;suspect that they are tired of a political&#x2F;economic system that predictably ended up producing this mess.')
