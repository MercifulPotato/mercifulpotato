Or perhaps &quot;analyst reports&quot; that can make or break a stock because one person believes something and we give them a megaphone. We switched focuse from present earnings to forward looking revenue. We have stock buybacks.

It seems the system has been has always had these holes and it was &quot;ok&quot; until regular folks began to identify and act on these opportunities.<p>We likely wouldn&#x27;t be having this conversation if another large hedge fund was making the play retail investors are today.
