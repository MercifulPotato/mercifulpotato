This is in the title, and in the article already the goal posts are moved to &quot;same value&quot; and &quot;same duties&quot;.<p>And the actual argument has nothing to do with equal value, work or duties even, and it is a crappy argument, because the price of labour has to do with the market for labour. If the market is the whole of US instead of SV, then you will get market rate for the whole of US, which is lower than SV.<p>You think someone in Poland will get SV rates just because they are insufferable enough? No. They won&#x27;t.<p>And you know what, if you don&#x27;t like what your employer pays you, go to another one. If you can&#x27;t find one that pays you what you think you are entitled to, what is the basis for this entitlement?')
