This is when this turns into an engineering problem.  If you have redundant top of rack switches, redundant power supplies, redundant network paths, you&#x27;re not going to end up with a split brain.<p>An example I like to use is integrated circuits, like your CPU, sure, it can fail in a mode where you lose the internal connectivity between the transistors, and then your CPU is dead.  It&#x27;s a very complex distributed system where engineers have basically taken out any practical possibility of an internal failure.  So just because CAP says that if you lose connectivity to some portion of transistors you can&#x27;t maintain consistency or availability (which is true) doesn&#x27;t mean a thing in practice.  Nobody even worries about how to keep a CPU going if you lose one core.')
