I found the feature useful when it came down to crunch time in my university studies.  Just as people today talk about disconnecting from the Internet when they need a distraction free work environment, I disabled multitasking.<p>As for System 6 being the pinnacle, I have a hard time deciding between System 6 and System 7.1.  The early versions of System 7 added a few quality-of-life improvements while maintaining most of the simplicity of System 6.  System 7.5 (or maybe System 7.1 Pro) is when the Macintosh System Software went off the rails in my opinion.')
