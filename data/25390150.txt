They define managerialism as &quot;what occurs when a special group, called management, ensconces itself systemically in an organization and deprives owners and employees of their decision-making power (including the distribution of emoluments) and justifies that takeover on the grounds of the managing group&#x27;s education and exclusive possession of the codified bodies of knowledge and know-how necessary to the efficient running of the organization.&quot;<p>It had a lot of resonance for me because engineers think of optimization fundamentally differently than MBAs do. When I want to make something better, I tend to optimize for increasing value and&#x2F;or lowering cost. MBAs tend tend to optimize for profit and things that drive profit.
