The &quot;detained journalists&quot; include journalists caught in a group of protestors being &quot;kettled&quot; and were later released once the group of people were safely under control.  It wasn&#x27;t like the cops were targeting all the &quot;detained journalists&quot;.  It also seemed they included anyone calling themselves a journalist.  I couldn&#x27;t even find any sort of presence of some of them.')
