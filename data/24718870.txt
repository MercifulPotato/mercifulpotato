In fact I specifically practiced prototyping with it -- my github is littered with repo&#x27;s for each of my prototypes -- I call them the <i>Laundromat Demos.</i> I would use the 70-80 minutes I had at the laundromat to write a prototype for a game in JS.<p>However I&#x27;ve tried something similar with Haskell. I think I prefer Haskell for prototyping these days. It turns out you can get a long way playing with the types. Often I spend more time prototyping the types and they guide me to the implementation which is often quite small.<p>It takes some training and work to get there but I think Haskell, for me, is a better prototyping language -- I don&#x27;t have to deal with <i>undefined</i>, accidental prototype overloading, etc.')
