This is plenty fast and definetely above typical commuting speeds. Even the electric support is more about better range&#x2F;less sweat than making the bike fast, speeds appproaching 50km&#x2F;h are close to the legal limits anyway<p>- with straight handlebars it’s comfortable to ride, no matter the level of personal fitness. Drop bars make you bend more - this isn’t very inviting and could drive off the customers that are accustomed to relaxed positions (that they know from riding in their SUVs daily). And with speeds mostly well below 40km&#x2F;h there is no need to curl into the aero postion. Just put on some trendy glasses and the electric support will deal with the extra drag.<p>It really goes hand in hand and I’d be suprised if such bike would be released in other config.')
