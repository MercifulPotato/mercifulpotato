Meanings evolve over time. Or are understood to mean different things to different people (an example I like is the almost opposing meanings of &quot;implies&quot; between mathematicians and mainstream English speakers).

My understanding of the word &quot;concurrency&quot;, the Wikipedia definition that someone quoted, and the meaning in the article all align, and are all different from the meaning you gave (if I haven&#x27;t misunderstood it, which admittedly is very possible). So it seems very unlikely to me that we all hold the minority understanding while yours is the mainstream.')
