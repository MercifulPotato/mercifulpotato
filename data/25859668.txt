For example it can only be used in &quot;channels&quot; and needs to be added to each &quot;server&quot; by an admin. This means that it is hard to use in servers where you are a guest and you can&#x27;t use it in DMs and non-channel group chats.<p>I assume they are offering a &quot;puppeting bridge&quot; which means it acts as you, however this means that it is using unsupported APIs and Discord has been known to ban accounts for this.<p>I think it is pretty disingenuous to put the Discord logo on the homepage without pointing out those caveats.')
