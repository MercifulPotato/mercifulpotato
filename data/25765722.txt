The whole reason you have TAs is so you can ask questions constantly and get instant feedback. Stuck on something during a lab? Flag down the TA and they will set you right. Drop your test tube full of precurser during organic chemistry lab on the floor? No worries, the TA appears moments later with an aliquot of precurser to give you so you can proceed with the lab exercise. Motion detector not working during physics lab? The TA gives you a new one out of the equipment closet or helps you troubleshoot the lab software.<p>I actually taught a remote version of a lab class this semester and it was horrible. You can&#x27;t learn lab techniques by watching videos and slideshows or using various virtual lab simulation programs; you gotta get your hands on these things. You wouldn&#x27;t know how finicky a western blot is until you&#x27;ve accidentally ripped your gel cracking it out of the precast case trying to transfer it to your membrane; all you get on the virtual format is &#x27;be careful,&#x27; rather than training sufficient to start work in a research lab immediately.')
