Example of &quot;other means&quot; -- I personally think this is the model that Kubernetes and some other large single-company-backed F&#x2F;OSS projects is doing, they&#x27;ve essentially built bureaucracy which replicates the internal politics you&#x27;d find at a large company, and I think it&#x27;d be quite difficult for a regular contributor, no matter how ardent, to get a &quot;board seat&quot; if not backed by some large company. Kubernetes was a better tool than others, but Google also spent a <i>lot</i> of money to propel it forward.')
