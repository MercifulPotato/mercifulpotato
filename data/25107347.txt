Linux has been my main OS for the past few years in part because I agree with the principles behind it, but also simply because I _feel_ better using it than using Windows. I&#x27;m not at ease with the user experience and the behaviour of Windows. So I&#x27;m using Linux and I don&#x27;t really run into any meaningful issues day-to-day. The biggest issues I had to solve lately were on my VPS, not even my desktop.<p>But as the GP said : you can always use both, and there are a lot of ways to do so. A few games and softwares I use can&#x27;t run on Linux so I keep a windows on dual-boot. WLS 2 is a great experience for a lot of folks, etc.')
