I don&#x27;t think there is enough control authority in starship&#x27;s fins to create much centripetal acceleration the way a fighter jet&#x27;s wings can. If the rocket is capable of it, it would do the same whether it was belly-flopping or dropping straight down the whole way. Any passengers will certainly get an inner-ear workout, but I can&#x27;t imagine how the flip, more or less around the rocket&#x27;s own axis, could contribute significantly to G-loading.')
