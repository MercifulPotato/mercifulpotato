I&#x27;m waiting for IVP but due to COVID19 and the various visa bans, the London Embassy is apparently only scheduling interviews based on National Interest Exception grounds. I&#x27;m co-founder of a new startup in my research field (same basis as NIW, cloud computing), looking to move to the US to register the company, raise a seed round and hire. Do you think that NIW could provide grounds for a National Interest Exception?<p>Thank you!')
