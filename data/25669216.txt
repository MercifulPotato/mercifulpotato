Signal for example has open source which allows to verify that it does not use the message texts for commercial purposes so we can with good reason assume that the messages are at least E2E encrypted properly within the app and at least Signal servers.<p>Yes, of course if you have root access to the device itself, or otherwise hack it, you can compromise any messenger. But that&#x27;s not even in the same league as having basically a message spying built-in, turned on, always on, inside your damn messenger app itself.<p>Whatsapp calling their app &quot;E2E&quot; in their marketing is a spit in the direction of the users that have the technical knowledge to understand how it really works. It is inaccurate in all the ways that matter. It is accurate only in one technical way that is completely irrelevant in the real world, just put there so they could use the phrase in the marketing while not caring about the true intent behind E2E.')
