(And I know writers who use iPads on the go; I&#x27;ve never been able to make it work for me that way.)<p>It <i>can</i> be used by them, sure. But the matter is whether they are the intended audience, and whether their needs are a target for the iPad teams at Apple.<p>For a comparison, I can use my typical-sized Nikon camera to record videos, but I shouldn&#x27;t expect Nikon to make a headband mount for it so I can record while I&#x27;m biking. I&#x27;d buy a GoPro for that. And similarly, I won&#x27;t expect GoPro to include the same levels of customization and settings as a traditional camera.')
