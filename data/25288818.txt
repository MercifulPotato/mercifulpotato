I don&#x27;t doubt for a second that Apple creating both the CPU and Software together are why the X86 emulation is as good as it is.<p>I&#x27;m actually thinking about getting one of these as I&#x27;ve been without a personal laptop for a while now.  That said, I&#x27;m waiting for Docker support to get flushed out a bit more as I wouldn&#x27;t mind getting work done.  I am interested on how the really high performance ram effects my workflows, as I&#x27;ve often gone over 16gb as a sticking point, got my work laptop upgraded to 32gb earlier in the year and my personal desktop is at 64gb.<p>I&#x27;m not sure it will replace my r9-3950X desktop for getting things done, but it&#x27;s absolutely compelling for its&#x27; space.
