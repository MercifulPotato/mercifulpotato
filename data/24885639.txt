Item(by='littlecranky67', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603627379, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24881666, text='There exists a dedicated timestamping RFC: RFC3161. And yes, there is a vast number of publicly available (for a fee) service providers that offer this as a service. Even before blockchain, these were in use.\nIn Germany, there was a law that would require you to store you bookkeeping transactions only with those timestamps applied to avoid retroactive tampering. I.e. if you had received an Invoice as a PDF, you were required to timestamp it in a &quot;secure, tamper proof manner&quot; to be legally compliant. I personally used the free RFC3161 service provided and run for free by DFN (&quot;Deutsches ForschungsNetzwerk&quot;, an organization of universities and higher education institutions). The law was abandoned, and it is okay now to store digital invoices without timestamps. If I would have been audited, I am not sure that those timestamps would qualify to met the requirements by law, but I took my chances.\nTo this day there are still various providers of RFC3161 timestamps, and interfacing is rather easy (you send an HTTP post request by cURL and receive a signed fingerprint by the trusted party).')
