Or not I guess as it means I won&#x27;t be buying anything today<p>M1 looks impressive, hopefully it scales as well to higher TDPs.<p>Pretty much what I expected today with all the low power models getting updated.<p>With no fan I expect the Air will throttle the CPU quickly when using the high performance cores. Calling it an &quot;8-core CPU&quot; is a little cheeky IMHO but I guess everyone does it.<p>Looking at the config options it seems the CPU&#x2F;SoC is literally the &quot;M1&quot; and that&#x27;s it. No different speeds like before so apparently the <i>same</i> CPU&#x2F;SoC in the Pro and the Air? I guess the fans in the Pro will allow the high performance more headroom but still kinda odd. I wonder if that will carry over to the 16&quot; MBP next year?<p>I am <i>disappointed</i> to see the design is <i>identical</i> to what we currently have. I was hoping we would see a little refinement with thinner screen bezels, perhaps a slightly thicker lid to fit in a better web cam (rather than just better &quot;image processing&quot;) and FaceID.<p>Overall I am disappointed due to 16GB max RAM and the same old design. I guess we will see the bigger machines get updates sometimes between March and July 2021.<p>Also are we calling it the M1 CPU or the M1 SoC?')
