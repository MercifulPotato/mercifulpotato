It is only when passing to more specific algebras (symmetric, exterior, GA, ...) that the subject really becomes interesting.<p>And yet you can still go a level further, with objects like those in Moon &amp; Spencer&#x27;s holor theory that include generalizations for transformation rules beyond covariant or contravariant, generalized connections similar --for example-- to universal Christoffel symbols, and effectively creating rules for tensors, pseudotensors and stranger array-like objects.')
