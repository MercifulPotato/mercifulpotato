Item(by='wutbrodo', descendants=None, kids=[25211600], score=None, time=1606322585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25204234, text='&gt; My personal bias is wanting to fix healthcare by fixing its price signals, so this surprised me.<p>The problem is that we&#x27;re very far from market signals, and &quot;quality of the healthcare system&quot; is not a monotonic function of market-orientation.  If we were to go all the way to a fully market-oriented system, a lot of the obscene inefficiencies and horrors of the healthcare system would be addressed.  There may even be people by whose chosen measure, our healthcare system functions better than it does today. But we&#x27;d have new horrors around access that we as a society have chosen not to accept, which means we&#x27;re in this grotesque inefficient middle-ground where we have neither the advantages of a centralized system nor the advantages of a system where market signals aren&#x27;t choked off at every turn.  It&#x27;s completely plausible that we&#x27;re at the part of the curve where more centralization moves us up the U-shaped curve instead of down')
