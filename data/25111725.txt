The &quot;full report&quot; from RSA is available here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rsa.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;en&#x2F;misc&#x2F;rsa-data-privacy-and-security-survey-2019.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rsa.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;en&#x2F;misc&#x2F;rsa-data-privacy-and...</a>.<p>The majority of the 16 pages are just business &quot;takeaways&quot; and &quot;insights&quot; based on the headline results. The only information about statistical methodology I can see is that roughly 6,000 adults were surveyed in America and Europe by YouGov for 9 days in December 2018. There is no breakdown of raw response data by age, country, region, income, education or other demographics. Moreover, there is no discussion of techniques used to reduce sampling bias (for example, by broadening the survey time over a longer period and by specifically targeting more demographics).<p>Don&#x27;t draw any conclusions based on this report. This is content marketing for RSA services with a thin veneer of academic polish.')
