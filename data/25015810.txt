I watched the entire SGA series, and SG-1 did not live up to the entertainment SGA provided for me. Make no mistake, I like SG-1 too, but I love SGA the most for its entertainment value (I laughed a lot), and I love SGU for its drama, not so much laughter, I did not actually laugh I think but I was immersed into the plot. SGA for fun&#x2F;survival&#x2F;exploration, SGU for drama&#x2F;survival&#x2F;exploration. SG-1 was kind of everything in all fairness, but I missed Rodney McKay and John Sheppard from it. They made SGA amazing for me, along with the occasional Zelenka. :D<p>SG-1 aired when I was a kid, I hated Stargate when I was a kid, but as an adult, I fucking love it. I still get nostalgic over it sometimes. The actors are so old and different now. :(')
