This makes metro very slow. But the number of RER lines is very low. Both are not very reliable - I mean the number of nines in 99.[here]%. I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s above 99% in Paris. Other than the strikes, I&#x27;ve had more problems with metro&#x2F;subways in a year here than over 17 years in Moscow. Random unannounced station closures, someone forgets things on a station and a line stops for an hour, etc. And the strikes are a bad joke, why are they legal!? With the strikes, average reliability is &lt; 95%.<p>I really like how NYC has local&#x2F;express sharing the same infrastructure. Manhattan has near the same height as Paris (Peripherique), yet it&#x27;s possible to travel all the distance with 5 or so stops.')
