The plugins are at the moment open source, or at least source available. I think the long term goal is to build on a rich plugin-ecosystem with a sleak core.<p>Also closed source doesn&#x27;t really matter in this case, because it&#x27;s build on open data-formats and running local. There is no vendor lockin. If the app disappears some day, you can still continue to use it or use a different markdown-editor (which are already existing today).')
