The second makes the system in TFTA not good for me, and given the first, I didn&#x27;t mind my implementation being editor specific - but the principal is dead simple, as to not really matter.<p>I have a small custom function stored in Sublimes user package folder which, when called using the [cmd]+[shift]+p command palette will insert a small template in the top of the current file (my `daily.txt`).<p>This is just a headline with the date, and name of day of week and\nTwo lines called start and end (with datetime filled in in start) let&#x27;s me keep loose track of my hours.<p>I also have a sub-heading that says to-do, with two `[ ] ...` txt checkboxes already added, another headline called did and a line that separates it from the previous day.<p>&quot;To-do&quot; is for things I plan on doing, &quot;did&quot; is for ad-hoc things I ended up doing. This helps me keep track of how much work I actually did, which is nice for days where everything is meetings and firefighting and I don&#x27;t close issues in the tracker or PRs in git.<p>I can use go-to symbol to jump to a date, or just search the document for key words. Like I said, I like scrolling, and enjoy being able to just scroll down to see the previous day.<p>The system is like I said dead simple, easy to operate, easy for anyone to implement and customize to their liking. I&#x27;ve used mine for a few months and it has been great!')
