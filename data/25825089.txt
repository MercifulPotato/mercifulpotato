We have different car brands, grocery stores, non-health insurance companies, package delivery companies, retailers, and housing options. Some people want fast and cheap. Others want to drive an hour to save a few bucks.<p>This isn&#x27;t some technical academic point. Without a range of choices, you actually <i>can&#x27;t know</i> what people truly want. So things don&#x27;t get better. People can&#x27;t signal what&#x27;s <i>truly</i> important by voting with their wallet.<p>&gt; If we want to benefit from market forces here, it&#x27;s probably much more effective to have large (or single) payers who understand what the standard of care should be, and can encourage price competition from providers.<p>I don&#x27;t get this at all. There are so many markets where complex, highly-paid specialists do work customers might not understand: estate&#x2F;trust lawyers, auto repair, even dental care. We don&#x27;t have nearly the same problems as in medicine due to this culture of treating doctors like God. They aren&#x27;t. They&#x27;re just a person doing a service, just like a chef or a guy painting a house.<p>What actually bothers me most about this whole thing is that nobody is willing to get serious about the tradeoffs their system entails. Health care in the US is <i>failing</i> right now. Companies are trying to stay beneath ACA limits because health insurance would crush them. My premiums are $380&#x2F;month as a healthy, 36-year old nonsmoker with no rare conditions. That is INSANE. There&#x27;s ever-more incentive to keep people off of W2 employment because premiums have gotten so out of control. If you take the current system, where bankruptcies are the norm, this monster is devouring almost 20% of our GDP, and every time I go to the doctor it&#x27;s a major hassle, I&#x27;ll come out and say that yes, maybe I&#x27;d prefer to fix that even if someone can&#x27;t get a $150,000 drug anymore.<p>&gt;aside: Singapore is a weird case and probably not a good comparitor for most healthcare systems.<p>Umm...why not? You can&#x27;t just hand-wave that away.')
