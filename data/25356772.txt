Item(by='amosbatto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607505483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25340220, text='The people doing the final assembly of the Librem 5 USA are working in Purism&#x27;s Fulfillment Center in Carlsbad, California, which is a suburb of San Diego. Housing is very expensive in the San Diego area, so we are talking about wages for assembly workers that are much higher than $13 or $14 per hour. It sounds like the company making the PCB&#x27;s is also located in the San Diego area (based on what Purism said about its Librem 5 DevKit), which means that Purism is paying a company that likely makes prototype boards, which means that Purism is paying a lot more for its boards than Chinese mass production prices. I doubt that Purism has more than a couple hundred orders for the Librem 5 USA, but it says that it will store the parts for the phone and do the final assembly itself. It also is doing just-in-time manufacturing of the phone in very small quantities. All of this has very high unit costs.<p>Frankly, ThatGeoGuy&#x27;s assessment of the Librem 5 USA is ridiculous. First of all, he doesn&#x27;t evaluate what it costs to set up a facility in a San Diego suburb that stores parts with supply chain security, orders small-scale PCBA production, and does small-scale final assembly. Second, he ignores the fact that the Librem 5 USA is a niche product for corporate and government clients who need supply chain security. It is competing with products like the Silent Circle&#x27;s Silent Phone, Motorola Solutions&#x27; LEX L11 and Bittium&#x27;s Tough Mobile 2. The only one of those phones which publicly lists its price is the Bittium Tough Mobile 2, which costs â‚¬1550 (US$1816), so the Librem 5 USA is in the same price range. Third, he totally ignores the cost of paying roughly a dozen developers to work for 3.3 years to develop a Linux phone. How does a company recover those high development costs that have gone way over budget? One way is to develop a side product with high profit margins that caters to niche customers with specialized needs.')
