It could send uLaw companded audio in a 8,000 samples per second, to cover the 3 KHz bandwidth of human speech, with almost no latency. You could even hook circuits directly up to the end user equipment to avoid any need to share the audio channel. Because the bandwidth was dedicated on a switched channel, there would be no drop-outs or packet loss!<p>What an amazing improvement over cellphones and Bluetooth that would be.<p>&lt;&#x2F;sarcasm&gt;')
