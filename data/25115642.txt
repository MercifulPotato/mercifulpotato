The fact that this works means that only well funded companies can succeed by bleeding money at the alter of page rank.<p>In the old days we had paid search engines. Google promised to replace that by surfacing what you really want. But now we have a search engine that ranks results based on how much money you can spend on silly SEO rituals. Is that really any better?')
