Thing is, with winter tires even a Prius has enough mechanical grip to put the extra torque from the MG&#x27;s down and many AWD vehicles won&#x27;t be able to max theirs out with all season tires.<p>When it comes to winter driving the entire perceived benefit of AWD vehicles for commuter use goes out the window as soon as you need seasonal tires, basically. Yes, it will still better help put the power down given equal tires - but at that point the extra cost of the AWD system isn&#x27;t giving you too much benefit if you are only buying it for winter driving.')
