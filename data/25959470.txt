Item(by='BrendanLong', descendants=None, kids=[25961846, 25968305], score=None, time=1611939504, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25950741, text='Investment info sites seem to be skeptical that there&#x27;s anything wrong with naked shorts. They became illegal after the 2008 crisis, but they&#x27;re bad in the sense of being extremely risky, not that they&#x27;re fraudulent.<p>It&#x27;s also unclear if naked shorting is actually happening here. It&#x27;s entirely possible for the short interest to be far above 100%. Consider this setup:<p>- WidgetCo floats exactly one stock\n- Alice buys the one stock (short interest = 0%)\n- Alice lends the stock to Bob\n- Bob sells the stock to Carol (short interest = 100%)\n- Carol lends the stock to Dave\n- Dave sells the stock to Eve (short interest = 200%)\n- Repeat until short interest reaches the moon<p>Bob and Dave both legitimately borrowed a shared and sold it, so there&#x27;s no naked shorting going on.<p>I suspect what&#x27;s happening with GameStop is that the stock price is just so absurdly overvalued that short interest has reached a level that people previously thought was impossible.')
