Been chewing on how to respond.<p>I still buy into the rational choice theories. Despite the growing evidence to the contrary. Democracy for Realists, folk theory of democracy, and all that.<p>As I said upthread, I focus on process and feedback loops. Blame my tour of duty as a SQA manager.<p>I empowered my teams thru delegation. They owned the product. Not me. It was their success. Not mine.<p>I built trust over time by honoring their decisions. And probably more importantly, fending off attacks on their efforts. Like the helpful SVP PHB giving &quot;suggestions&quot; and shaking the ant farm.<p>I&#x27;m currently totally on board with Stacy Abrams&#x27; view of democracy. People buy-in when they see their actions have impact, consequences. They check out when they&#x27;re ignored.<p>My own former teammates told me as much. Next manager comes in, asks for input, does their own thing. Completely alienated the team. They never leaned in again.<p>It takes time, real effort, commitment. Trust is so hard to earn, so easily lost.<p>YMMV.')
