They are acting as a cartel to prevent competitors. So, yeah perhaps it would be best to add Microsoft and Apple to the list of offenders, along with the MPA, and heck even Congress (which criminalized breaking DRM even for otherwise legal purposes). But I&#x27;d hardly call the title very misleading.<p>Regarding your second point, it&#x27;s understandable that he focused on the functionality before the licensing, because Widevine would probably have been even less supportive if he had a working product. Honestly I don&#x27;t understand your complaint; someone had to make a browser and get screwed over, otherwise the defenders of Google et. al would argue that Widevine could be licensed by competing browsers.<p>And anyways, these minute arguments completely ignore the overarching point that DRM subverts the premise of the web and prevents disruption and competitive.')
