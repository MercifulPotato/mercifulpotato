If they didn&#x27;t, Youtube would be bankrupt, since statutory damages for copyright violations are $750&#x2F;violation and there&#x27;s no legal defense once they show the violation occurred.<p>(And as someone who has dealt with the music licensing agencies, you always just pay for the license. Paying the big 3 licensing agencies annually for millions of streams cost less than the statutory damages for a single violation.)')
