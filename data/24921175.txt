I think the frameworks like sqlalchemy and NHibernate seem to do things a bit better by tracking “dirty” models, hiding the “ORM-ness”, and letting the higher levels control when to flush&#x2F;write to the DB. But the more you abstract this stuff, the more you lose the auto generated sugar that makes frameworks like Django so productive.')
