I would still want U2F but allow mail recovery and maybe even U2F _only_ login (or FIDO login without PIN).<p>Given that people have different opinions about what is important I guess this should be an option for fallback recovery, maybe with some warning around it.<p>The &quot;workaround&quot; to have no fallback for U2F is to generate recovery keys and then not store them anywhere ;=).
