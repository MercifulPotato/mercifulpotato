In general I&#x27;m a a little skeptical that &quot;intent&quot; matters at all; what matters is practical political power no matter how you label it - but even if we were to constrain ourselves to the notion of representing states, not people: they can represent their states just fine even if the number of senators varies by state.  The idea that all states are equal should be dropped.')
