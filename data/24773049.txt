If everyone cheats, then the incentive will be to cheat also. If everyone violates privacy, then there will be little to no benefit in not also violating privacy. Certainly not if consumers simply won&#x27;t believe you.<p>It&#x27;s the same logic as: &quot;Every politician is corrupt, so why should I vote for you Mr Honest Guy? You must be corrupt also! I&#x27;d rather vote for Mr Clearly On the Take, I like the way he smiles&quot;.')
