They&#x27;re told something crazy like &quot;well yeah you just don&#x27;t have enough money, too bad&quot;<p>The guy I&#x27;m talking about has windfalls - and when they come he&#x27;ll feel so bad he goes out with friends and blows $30 on a meal. If he changed his celebrations to $15 meals using a coupon clipped from the paper (I know he can, I&#x27;ve been with him I know his world and options) and saved the other $15, the next time he got an unexpected bill he would have the savings to cover it. (The definition of unexpected here is very loose - because for him it is very loose. Everything is &quot;unexpected&quot; and &quot;unplanned&quot; - but YES - a flat tire) He does this and before long his credit score starts to improve, before long he has balance free transfer offers, before long he is no longer throwing money at credit card interest but instead paying down the balance because he has 18 months 0 interest<p>My OTHER friend, who is now a millionaire, was earning the same super low income. But he was already investing based on this income by making hard compromises on day-to-day living. He is Asian, so has a completely different cultural background based on his immigrate parents believing one needs to save no matter how low their income. Yeah if he didn&#x27;t get a better job he probably wouldn&#x27;t have made it to the millions, but, on a poor salary he was already well on his way to home ownership and all the domino effect line of decisions that lead to lower and lower cost of living (once you&#x27;re in a home equity is building instead of disappearing on rent) etc. even on the same low salary.<p>If I didn&#x27;t know the Asian guy, I&#x27;d probably still be using your same line of argumentation - pretending that there is some lower limit where you &quot;just don&#x27;t have enough&quot; but it is just such hogwash &amp; excuses that got the poor where they are in 9 of 10 cases of poverty in the US at least. Clearly there is a huge difference with the 1 case or with cases in another country where the political system&#x27;s own evils may cause it')
