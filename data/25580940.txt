This means it will be possible to vaccinate in the community away from the cold storage found in large teaching hospitals, and also means that this vaccine can be supplied to parts of the world where it wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be possible.  Apart from a non-selfish point of view that the world should be protected from this virus, I also wonder how important it will be to control the virus in a global scale to reduce the chance of further mutations that may cause another pandemic in the near future.')
