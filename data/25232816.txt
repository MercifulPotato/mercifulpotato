Then three things happened. First, I got exposed to some of the highest quality tools and libraries in the industry. As in, the ones that only a few people are lucky enough to get to use, and it made using anything less polished afterwards painful. Sort of like living in a mansion and then needing to move back into a slum. The other thing was just finding out about too many of the nasty corner cases that exist in technology, which in most cases are safe to ignore, but are hard to unthink about once you know about them. The third was just having too many things I depended on break over time or abandon the principles that attracted me to the project in the first place.<p>So now, later in my career, my biases are more tuned towards reinventing things than ever before. I&#x27;d rather minimize risk by having something perfectly tailored to my specific needs. If it breaks, I&#x27;ll only have myself to blame. I view that as a fun learning experience. Much better than the alternative, which is nagging folks in the open source community and filing issues expecting them to support me, and then feeling guilty afterwards. Only thing I&#x27;m worried about is that my standings will continue to grow so high that the joy of programming is so hard to find that I&#x27;ll just do management, and just let other people have fun with all the churn.')
