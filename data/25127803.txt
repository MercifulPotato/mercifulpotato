Item(by='RonaldRaygun', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605638617, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25127357, text='&gt; If someone doesn’t want to wear a mask that is their choice. Your choice is to avoid situations where you might be in contact with people who don’t wear masks.<p>Do you also believe this about laws prohibiting drunk driving, or regulating seatbelt wearing and the side of the road you&#x27;re allowed to drive on? OSHA rules around workplace safety, hardhats, fall protection? I&#x27;ll wait to see if the anti-mask crowd crusades against the infringement of their &quot;right&quot; to drive intoxicated. Otherwise, I&#x27;ll continue to see it for what it is: Political virtue signaling and contrarianism sans empathy.<p>It should be (and is) perfectly possible to legally avoid wearing a mask in places with mask regulations. You may do this by avoiding public places.<p>&gt; It’s not to force everyone into your beliefs.<p>Strange how selectively this idea is applied by some in this country.')
