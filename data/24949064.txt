I’m definitely not sitting there twiddling bits to call a REST API.<p>&gt; It requires both server and client to agree on the definition.<p>This is true of literally every API. If the client and the server disagree on a REST API call, nothing good is going to happen. Period.<p>gRPC is designed to allow evolution of APIs where clients and servers have different versions of the IDL. It’s no more brittle than a JSON API, and arguably it’s actually less brittle because of how the approach it takes.<p>&gt; It requires a different naming service from the standard internet naming service (DNS) which is brittle across network boundaries.<p>That is unequivocally false.<p>It doesn’t use a special naming service to connect servers and clients, unless you specifically choose to override the default behavior, which you could also do with JSON API if you wanted to make it really brittle as well.<p>Instead just use DNS, which is the default for both.<p>It <i>absolutely</i> doesn’t require a special naming service, as you claim.<p>gRPC is built on the HTTP&#x2F;2 standard. Based on the rest of your comment, you clearly also didn’t know this.<p>&gt; gRPC is a repeat of CORBA is a repeat of ONC-RPC is a repeat of... there&#x27;s common reasons why RPC as a concept is brittle and tightly couples implementations of clients and servers.<p>Your information so far can be trivially disproven, so... apologies if I’m not going to take advice from you on this subject right now.<p>I’m glad JSON API works for you.<p>EDIT: I see you repeated a lot of this misinformation in yet another comment. I get it —- the very idea of RPC is offensive to you. But you should at least research the technology you’re ranting about. Your information about gRPC is entirely, factually wrong.')
