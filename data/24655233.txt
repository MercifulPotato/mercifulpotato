The effect is initially impressive, but that soon wanes. Almost every man has a creamy, peachy skin tone, and the grass in each shot is a warm, yellowy green. The sky is blue. If it weren’t for the daubs of bright red blood, and the bomb craters, this would risk being a unnaturally prettified image of war, with remarkably consistent scenery. These are really incredible images – so homogenising them in this way does them a disservice. It’s not easy either to dispel the thought that all these colours (as well as many of the sounds) are simply guesswork: the colour of hair, blankets, signs and wildflowers having been plucked out of the air.</i>&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;silentlondon.co.uk&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;16&#x2F;lff-review-they-shall-not-grow-old-honours-veterans-but-not-the-archive&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;silentlondon.co.uk&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;16&#x2F;lff-review-they-shall-...</a>)')
