They make an argument for why the raw data is meaningful. Scientists interpret data, which involves a layer of human analysis that is not objective but is attempting to find the correct language and narrative to describe the results of an objective, quantitative process. Outside of the methods and data sections, academic science writing absolutely has to strike a tone. And especially when you are seeking grants and career progression one of the tones you have to strike is to highlight the importance of the work.<p>Once in a science course in college, I had to present a paper to my class. I tried to present it &quot;objectively&quot; as you would describe it, avoid striking a tone or making judgements. My professor told my presentation was technically correct but failed to highlight the broad significance of the research, which comes from tone. Science writing requires selecting a tone of voice.')
