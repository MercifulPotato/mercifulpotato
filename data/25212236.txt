You have to trust somebody to determine what good integrity looks like and to then verify the integrity information is fresh. The same privacy concern exists if you run OCSP against cypher-text as it does plaintext. You still have a stream of all the things people do. Bad for privacy.<p>Running a decentralized system means you have to trust all the nodes to not to store data or collude. Same problem in a different way. You simply cannot achieve integrity verification if you don&#x27;t trust anyone to do it. And this is why they are orthogonal. Trust is not compatible with doubt.<p>The issue here is that Apple took off the shelf OCSP and applied it in a way it was not designed for. So there _are_ actual problems with their late implementation. They should be fixed. And personally I think OCSP is kinda dumb because it mechanically defeats the advantage of certs (you don’t need a cert if you’re going to phone home for every invocation, just check a hash), but meh.')
