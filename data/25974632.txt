But if that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s very important that we\nacknowledge that fact now and work to prevent it. We can&#x27;t just say that\ngovernments will suddenly become incorruptible because the alternative is\nunpleasant. We have to face that unpleasant reality and respond to it.<p>To be clear I&#x27;m not saying that government will automatically become\nincorruptible (we should be so lucky, eh?)<p>How shall we formalize our response if not through government?<p>How can we be sure no one is using the surveillance unless we use the surveillance?<p>&gt; &gt; What would prevent it?<p>&gt; The fact that it&#x27;s not working. Even in totalitarian regimes like\nChina, they&#x27;re not stopping all crime, they&#x27;re just crushing political\ndissidents. And they don&#x27;t even have perfect enforcement on that.<p>Ugh, give them a minute.  :(<p>To me it seems obvious that you get either: 1) a split-level society, where\ninsiders get away with stuff while the masses live under the panopticon,\n<i>or</i> 2) you get a <i>universal</i> panopticon that <i>includes the police and\npoliticians</i> and we are subject to the absolute rule of Mrs. Grundy.<p>I just do not see a realistic scenario with <i>partial</i> surveillance.\nThe technology will become too cheap.<p>&gt; To get to the point in enforcement you&#x27;re talking about, we would need\nan even larger jump in surveillance than what we&#x27;re talking about now.<p>Our smart phones are already a surveillance system.<p>Consider that a fleet of networked self-driving cars will be a\nsurveillance system just as a side-effect.<p>The economics will drive it even if politics doesn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; And even in that world -- it&#x27;s not lack of surveillance that allows\npolice officers to violate people&#x27;s rights with impunity, it&#x27;s lack of\nprosecution. Enforcement of the law isn&#x27;t just a problem of finding\ncriminals, it&#x27;s also wrapped up in the system&#x27;s own brazenness and\nwillingness to apply different standards to different people.<p>Now we&#x27;re talking.  Did you see the movie <i>Elysium</i>?  I didn&#x27;t finish\nwatching it, because there&#x27;s a scene near the start when Matt Damon&#x27;s\ncharacter is standing in a line and robot police (it&#x27;s not clear whether they\nare autonomous AI robots or remote-controlled by humans) come by and\nhassle him and break his arm.  I saw that and was like, <i>Fuck That</i>.<p>If that&#x27;s what we end up doing to ourselves I&#x27;m not interested.<p>Why would you program a robot to do police brutality?  It makes no\nlogical sense.  If the robot is strong enough to break a bone (already a\ndubious design choice) then it&#x27;s strong enough to restrain a person\n<i>without</i> breaking his arm.  FFS!  At that point we&#x27;re just watching\nsomeone&#x27;s sick fetish.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elysium_(film)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elysium_(film)</a><p>That&#x27;s what I mean by &quot;humane tyranny&quot;: yes, the police are robots now but\nthey are programmed to be nice.<p>&quot;Klaatu barada nikto&quot;, eh?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gort_(The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gort_(The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_...</a><p>&gt; He is but one member of a &quot;race of robots&quot; invented by an\ninterplanetary confederation (described as &quot;A sort of United Nations on a\nPlanetary level&quot; by Klaatu, who is a representative of that\nconfederation) to protect their citizens against all aggression by\ndestroying any aggressors. Klaatu describes &quot;him&quot; as one of an\ninterstellar police force, holding irrevocable powers to &quot;preserve the\npeace&quot; by destroying any aggressor. The fear of provoking these robots\nacts as a deterrent against aggression.<p>&gt; ... preemptively getting rid of privacy when we have unequal standards\nof enforcement will make things worse because the corrupt parts of the\nsystem will have even more power.<p>Right, but I&#x27;m not advocating that.<p>I&#x27;m saying that, since privacy is going away anyway, let&#x27;s use that to make the\nsystem work well.<p>&gt; &gt; I feel strongly that laws should be legitimate or repealed.<p>&gt; This is a good ideal that we should strive for, but not a practical\nreality. Marijuana would not have become legal if people couldn&#x27;t have\nbroken the law. Gay rights would not have become a reality if people\ncouldn&#x27;t have been secretly gay. Perfect enforcement of the law can\nstagnate social progress, because the law is fallible. Fallible systems\nneed safeguards that make it possible to oppose them -- and extra-legal\nnormalization of certain behaviors is one of those safeguards.<p>I get what you&#x27;re saying but I think you&#x27;re wrong about the desirability\nof selective enforcement of &quot;soft&quot; crime because it&#x27;s\nhypocritical and because perfect enforcement of &quot;hard&quot; crimes is very\ndesirable.<p>I&#x27;m saying we better stop rounding up potheads\nand gay people, because we are about to have the power to make our laws\nstick for better or worse.  There are lots of places even today where\nit&#x27;s illegal to be gay.  If those places get tech before they get hip\nthey&#x27;re gonna have a bad time.<p>(I once worked for a startup that was developing a device that could read\nblood alcohol level and their market was a staunchly Muslim nation.\nThey hadn&#x27;t thought it through.  This nation severely restricts alcohol\nconsumption and you&#x27;re trying to introduce a fitbit that measures blood\nalcohol, think it through guys.)<p>Computers are the &quot;perfection of the executive&quot;.  (That quote goes\nback to Babbage BTW.  He didn&#x27;t say it, a fellow said it to him of his\nmachine, and he agreed.)<p>We are going to get perfect enforcement -or- hypocritical &quot;justice&quot;\nsystems -or- better, more humane laws.<p>As I see it those are the options.  The cameras are already deployed,\nbillions of folks are carrying self-surveillance devices right now.<p>&gt; There are other ways we could add checks and balances to the law, but I\nhave not seen many proposals from anyone that seem realistic or\nachievable to me. The reality is that breaking the law is often how we\nachieve social progress. Again, see Hong Kong and China, or the history\nof slavery in the US, or any number of social movements.<p>You make me realize that I don&#x27;t have any formal proposals in re: my\ntheory (that since tech makes surveillance inevitable we should all just\nbe cool.)<p>I don&#x27;t know that there are any concrete things to do.  Or that, if there\nare, I could come up with them.<p>&gt; &gt; We in the West could do that too but if we don&#x27;t because we value our\npersonal privacy over the occasional kidnapped kid, well, I&#x27;m no fan of\nthe CCP but that doesn&#x27;t seem like a defensible moral position to me.<p>&gt; I think it&#x27;s a completely defensible moral position.<p>It&#x27;s really not.  Either you&#x27;re not taking the thought experiment\nseriously or you don&#x27;t have children.\nI wouldn&#x27;t wish the loss of a child on my worst enemy.<p>&gt; I think that our privacy is one of the reasons that the US government\nis not the CCP,<p>The USA totally spies on us.  That&#x27;s what the &quot;Bumblehive&quot; is for:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Utah_Data_Center" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Utah_Data_Center</a><p>&gt; and I think that the harm China is doing to its own\ncitizens is pretty objectively greater than the harm that a couple of\nkidnappers will do. I&#x27;m not a fan of kidnappers, but the CCP is building\nconcentration camps.  Muslims in China need privacy more than they need\nprotection from kidnappers, it&#x27;s not a hard trade for me to make.<p>But that&#x27;s not the trade.<p>We can get rid of the kidnappers <i>and</i> the evil concentration camp-building bastards.<p>In the world I&#x27;m envisioning no one could build concentration camps.<p>Think about it: the CCP say those <i>aren&#x27;t</i> concentration camps and the very reason they can&#x27;t lie about it or about the other vile things they do and get away with it because there is too\nmuch information!<p>&gt; &gt; We should be talking about a universal highest-common-denominator of\nlaws for the planet so that the decreasing cost of asymptotically-prefect\nenforcement becomes a solution rather than a problem!<p>&gt; I think the solution you&#x27;re proposing is more difficult and less likely\nto happen then even the most long-shot of my proposals. The odds of all\nof the nations of the world uniting under a common set of laws, and those\nbeing laws being good are astronomically low. It would be easier to\ninvent an invisibility cloak.<p>I find it depressing but I agree with you there.  Realistically, I think\nthe CCP will pretty much pown the world this next century.  Depressing thought but\nif they can avoid starting a war (and we all don&#x27;t get creamed by climate\nchange) I think they&#x27;ve got it cinched.  Bummer.')
