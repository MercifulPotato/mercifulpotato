There&#x27;s not much science in another group of researchers taking over to test how penicillin treats syphilis; that&#x27;s already settled. Access to the affected patients would then be a legal matter - the records would be seized by the police and&#x2F;or prosecutors and that&#x27;s a very different kettle of fish to the original example.<p>For what itâ€™s worth, Tuskegee just happened to be the ethical failure that came to mind because it&#x27;s been in the media recently (in the context of &quot;why do PoC have reticence to take vaccination&quot;, i.e. for COVID-19). There&#x27;s plenty of other examples where the damage was irreparably done [1, 2] where it would be questionable to hand the participants&#x27; personal information over to another group of researchers for further study.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#Human_radiation_experiments" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unethical_human_experimentatio...</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Study_329" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Study_329</a>')
