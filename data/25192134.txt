I haven&#x27;t gone down the rabbit hole of reading everything he&#x27;s said on the subject, and that was mainly in response to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stallman.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2006-may-aug.html#05%20June%202006%20%28Dutch%20paedophiles%20form%20political%20party%29" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stallman.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2006-may-aug.html#05%20Jun...</a> . And I do get (and agree with) your analogy, too.<p>For full disclosure, I think you can make a reasonable case for at least some of what he said in the link I just posted. For instance, an 18 year old having sex with their 17 year old partner doesn&#x27;t automatically make it non-consensual, and lots of states have so-called &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; laws that agree. That&#x27;s where the call for caution and careful phrasing come in: does he intend to mean it&#x27;s OK for an 18 year old and a 17 year old to date (which I&#x27;d agree with), or for a 40 year old and a 15 year old (which I&#x27;d vehemently <i>not</i> agree with)? If what he meant was the former, I wish he would have clearly stated so and avoided the whole issue. If it really is the latter, then there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d attempt to defend that or be willing to consider the nuance (and more than I&#x27;d be willing to consider your analogy).')
