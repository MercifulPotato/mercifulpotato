If data storage and&#x2F;or social media can be viewed as critical digital infrastructure and a private organization provides those services,  an argument can and will likely be made that the services are tantamount to a digital company owned town.<p>As Justice Ginsburg said during oral argument regarding private digital networks, “the point is that these people are being cut off from a very large part of the marketplace of ideas. And the First Amendment includes not only the right to speak, but the right to receive information.”<p>And as Justice Kagan stated during Packinghan oral argument, &quot;whether it’s political community, whether it’s religious community... these sites have become embedded in our culture as ways to communicate and ways to exercise our constitutional rights.”<p>Moreover, AWS&#x27;s behavior may be viewed as an antitrust issue, acting in conjunction with a cartel. A party does not need to have majority market share to function in coordination with other dominate players in order to form a cartel that can manipulate the market.<p>Also, they may or may not have provided sufficient notice (a contract issue).<p>Either way, it&#x27;s definitely relevant to industry and likely to be litigated on appeal following the trial court&#x27;s ruling (whatever it is).')
