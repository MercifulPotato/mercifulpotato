Similar for disposability, where everyone is becoming painfully aware of externalities due to climate change.<p>“Economic man” was a 19th century concept, where philosophers dreamt of a society where everything was broken into transactions and property.  This is still the dream of some libertarians, and is one of the delusions that made the US so economically successful for so long in spite of its social and environmental costs.<p>However, we are an increasingly interconnected world, isolated disposable transactions certainly still happen at scale, but I see a lot of evidence this is being curtailed.<p>An interesting observation: most successful enterprise software companies have a large portion of their sales as “not” transactional, and these tend to have the highest repeatable revenue streams.<p>Consumers are also incredibly studying how the organization would use a contribution.  Who they politically donate to, etc.  Vs, just letting price and features dictate a purchase decision.')
