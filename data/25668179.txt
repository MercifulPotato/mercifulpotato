If you don&#x27;t openly misinform regarding public safety or very explicitly promote hate you can largely get away with saying almost anything else on Twitter, etc.  When Trump blatantly spreads dangerous misinformation about Covid, for example, there is a lot of whining about deplatforming.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.<p>Furthermore, claiming deplatforming (a delusion) is the <i>cause</i> of political violence is nothing more than a grotesque distortion and justification.')
