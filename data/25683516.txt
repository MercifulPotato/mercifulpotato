It is wishful thinking.<p>The only way to reach most companies is to turn up on their PR radar.  If something is seen as potentially damaging to their brand your concern will enter the company at a place in the organization which will have a far more direct channel to someone who can make decisions.<p>If you go through their investor feedback channel, unless you own a fair chunk of shares in the company or represent major shareholders, they will ignore you.  Of course, if you are a major investor you wouldn&#x27;t contact them through that channel anyway.  You would already have a relationship to someone in, or close to, top management who is responsible for handling major stakeholders.')
