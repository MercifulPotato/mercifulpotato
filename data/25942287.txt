Is there still no good alternative to this? In general, when you want to embed a browser in some GUI app. There have been lots of attempts to solve this in the past. But it seems like this is not really solved. And making this cross platform makes it more difficult, obviously. I thought now that we have Electron, this should maybe be easier? (I remember, on Windows, it was quite easy to embed an IE browser component in your app, even in the 90s. And this worked well. Only problem was that it was IE, and Windows-only.)<p>- You could go the other way around, and write an extension for an existing browser (Chrome, Firefox). There are also already a couple of such extensions which have similar goals as this project (keyboard-focused, minimal GUI). Why is this also suboptimal, or why does this not work as well? Why is the approach by qutebrowser better? (Some comments here seem to suggest that.)<p>Both approaches seem suboptimal somehow.')
