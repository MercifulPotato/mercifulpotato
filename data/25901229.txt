It was an organisational problem that caused them to make decisions to expedite release out of a plane that wasn&#x27;t safe. The question isn&#x27;t have they fixed the issue or not. The question is have they made the organisational changes to ensure that their complex hierarchy of management can&#x27;t overrule technical experts about whether safe procedures have been followed. In my opinion, given the timescales and what people are reporting, the same people who pushed to get the 737Max out the door in an unsafe manner in the first place in order to meet over-ambitious targets, will probably have also been motivated to push through sign-off on these changes too.<p>The question is less about whether Boeing can afford another crash, it&#x27;s more about whether all the individuals in the hierarchy can afford to tell their boss the 737Max isn&#x27;t ready- or as is likely, that it cannot ever be made safe in an economical way.')
