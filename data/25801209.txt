In some cases a choice is made to switch to X because whatever the team is currently using is &quot;dead&quot;&#x2F;has gone unsupported.<p>I think these reasons, along with others such as significant breaking changes between major versions that we&#x27;ve seen with some frameworks and libraries, better hint at sources of frustration over &quot;churn&quot; in JavaScript.')
