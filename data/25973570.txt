I don’t see how this is ever going to scale as bit depth, resolution and frame rates continue to increase. This is a losing strategy because a lossy, slow connection between your display and your controller will only get worse (quadratically so) as those three factors (bit depth, resolution and frame rate) increase.<p>They are going to have to beef up the client hardware and do more of the game engine and rendering compute locally, which will undermine the cost savings they offered being centralized.')
