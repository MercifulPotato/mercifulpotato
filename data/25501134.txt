Wayland goes back to the base problem - how to display a window on a&#x2F;many screens - and solves it splendidly. And leaves the rest to the actual desktop environment because it is not display related. UNIX phylosophy is not all that sexy when it is actually useful is it?<p>But wayland developers were clever enough to add a proper extension management system so a client can query what is available and use what’s given.<p>Does implementing wayland by multiple DEs consist of some duplicate work? Sure.\nShould  we not refactor all the technical debt that accumulated over DECADES to the point where a new hardware was introduced? I think the answer is no.<p>And I’m not sure which group is tribalist, the ones who blindly hate on something because - surprisingly - without work there would be nothing, or those who make the new thing usable.')
