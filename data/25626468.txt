Outsiders like the seemingly endless succession of German kings that went to Rome with an army hoping to get emperor status in exchange for helping the next pope into his job, but also by many others (e.g. Normans in what is now southern Italy).<p>Imagine what the District of Columbia would be like if elections routinely involved violence, war between US states wasn&#x27;t unheard of and (kind of like the inverse of the US Senate) nobody outside of DC had a vote for the presidency.')
