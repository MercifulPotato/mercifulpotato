The gaming market seems very elastic on the demand side, few people actually _need_ a new rig urgently, so an increase in price could effectively limit the initial demand and get them to people who need&#x2F;want them most while increasing margins for manufacturers or sellers.<p>As it is now private middlemen take that profit, presumably by standing in said lines wasting a lot of time. And buyers now have to trust some rando on ebay to actually ship a 2k$ graphics card. That is not an optimal outcome.')
