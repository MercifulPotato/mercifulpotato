Paying down the debt sucks away your income, and maybe if you&#x27;re not as successful as you&#x27;d hoped then you default and walk away. Generally companies only put themselves in that position if they&#x27;re near-bankrupt already (certainly that&#x27;s the case with Toys R Us - if it hadn&#x27;t been for the private equity deal they&#x27;d have been bankrupt 5 years earlier).')
