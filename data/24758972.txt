A disproportionate amount of that currency is held by companies and institutions based in the United States, and in many cases they&#x27;re the same companies and institutions that one might otherwise would expect to be responsible for much of the work of transitioning to IPv6.<p>Meanwhile, Asia has a relative scarcity of IPv4 addresses and so is (as far as I know) ahead of the curve because their incumbents have less to lose.')
