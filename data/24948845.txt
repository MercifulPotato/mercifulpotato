If you programmed line 10 wrong with a typo or other syntax sin, then the entire thing would fail. If you had a typo in the DATA section that was (now I know as) Hex, then the program would not fail but glitch, and it was typically with the sound&#x2F;music of the game. I had no idea what Hex was, but I did realize that it was only 0-9A-F. That made the confusion of 0(zero) and O(upper-case &#x27;oh&#x27;) less of a problem during transcription. I never understood it enough to modify any of it in a useful manner, but it definitely helped avoid hunt&amp;peck typos for a kid')
