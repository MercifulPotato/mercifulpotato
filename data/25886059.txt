Unlike a smart contract for some verifiable code-based outcome it doesn&#x27;t offer any guarantees I get paid, which I still rely on the courts for, it just adds complexity and unfamiliar risk.<p>&gt; An alternative viewpoint is that a centralized database manager can be seen as a potential risk<p>Sure, in theory it can be. But relative to all the other potential supply chain risks, the ERP cloud vendor colluding with a part of the supply chain to remove records from or silently update a datastore is pretty near the bottom of the list in terms of likelihood, expected cost and chances of it not being glaringly obvious to other parties and used as evidence of bad faith on their part in court.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying blockchain can&#x27;t be used as a datastore, I&#x27;m saying that overall its about as useful for mitigating supply chain risk as insurance against your spouse committing identity fraud is for mitigating potential problems with marriage.')
