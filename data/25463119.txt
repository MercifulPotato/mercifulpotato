I assume you at least can still read me.<p>Look at threads you&#x27;ve commented in in your browser&#x27;s incognito mode to see how your comments are invisible (Not this one, I&#x27;ve vouched for you which makes them visible, and some others have been vouched for.)<p>Your comments have been hidden by default to all users except those that chose to view them like me since September 2017. That&#x27;s why so few people reply to you. You&#x27;ve been talking into a void. Don&#x27;t know what you did back then to piss someone off!<p>Crazy isn&#x27;t it?')
