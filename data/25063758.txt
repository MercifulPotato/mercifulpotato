The only issue is escaping government regulation (censorship). And that is a different problem. I&#x27;d rather fight for freedom of speech than trying to censor my users.<p>Also there would be no reason to switch away from Twitter if you want to censor users anyway.<p>And I disagree that the spread of misinformation is such a huge issue as you make it out to be. Misinformation existed before the internet, it isn&#x27;t caused by it. The internet makes it easier to double check information.<p>If watching a boy burn ballots makes people burn ballots, I don&#x27;t think Twitter is the problem here. I think those people have some other deep seated problems. I&#x27;m sure I wouldn&#x27;t burn ballots if I saw that video (I haven&#x27;t).')
