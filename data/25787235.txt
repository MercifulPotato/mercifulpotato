But this can be an advantage!<p>Our basic vision is a combination of low-effort agriculture, camping, and art, but we might also try to make wine.  The plot is terraced in three roughly equal sections, each a longish rectangle.  It’s regulated agricultural land, so no building, but we think we can drop a couple containers on it.<p>Suggestions welcome!')
