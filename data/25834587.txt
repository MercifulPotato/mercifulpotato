Where can I find even one cat-50 tool holder and cutter for $100? I have room for such a massive machine, most people don&#x27;t which is why I got it so cheap. (or a way to move - the typical fork lift won&#x27;t budge it)<p>I actually got two for that price, but on closer inspection one has a fatal break in the casting and so it is scrap - I expect to make $2500 once I get all the valuable parts off of it')
