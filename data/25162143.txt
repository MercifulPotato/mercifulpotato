If we don&#x27;t think that it won&#x27;t utilize full GPU (not even one compute unit) and assume that it scales similarly to big systems then:\n1)165GB&#x2F;s is an algorithmic bandwidth of benchmark, including consecutive FFT+iFFT. Both of them take one upload and one download from chip - total 4 memory transfers. The real bandwidth for this value will be 4*165=660GB&#x2F;s.\n2)one FFT is 2 transfers - upload and download. Total 16KB.\n3)660GB&#x2F;s &#x2F; 16KB = 43M iterations per second. Similar to your number, but your number didn&#x27;t account that benchmark has 4 uploads instead of 2.<p>These benchmarks don&#x27;t include transfers to and from GPU, as those are done with PCI-E bandwidth (30GB&#x2F;s) which is really slow compared to VRAM-chip bandwidth (&gt;500GB&#x2F;s). This is why it is important to have enough VRAM and avoid CPU communications as much as possible.')
