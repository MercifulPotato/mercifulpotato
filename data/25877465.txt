Sorry for getting off-topic. I&#x27;m trying to understand liberal thought a bit better, hopefully without getting flamed out too much.<p>I agree that the Starbucks choice of greeting is a &quot;babiest of baby steps&quot; which is probably why only one person really cared in a country of 300 million. But I really struggle to understand the justification here, and it seems to be related to other Culture War crusades. How is avoiding Christmas inclusive? Everyone knows what country we&#x27;re in and that most people celebrate Christmas, so why would anybody be offended by saying &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;? This matters because if you don&#x27;t see it as an &quot;inclusive&quot; move, then it just comes off as a way to snub people who do celebrate Christmas.<p>That is, I can kind of believe that many liberals honestly see these things as &quot;inclusive&quot;, but from the outside they actually seem &quot;exclusive&quot;. The whole liberal platform is supposedly to tolerate and include, but in practice they seem to hate and exclude about 40% of the country. I just can&#x27;t see very much of the tolerance and inclusion from my perspective.<p>Sorry if I&#x27;m a bit all over the map, but I&#x27;m trying to understand, not debate.')
