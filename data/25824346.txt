The concerns run much deeper than you might think on the surface, and both sides have very legitimate gripes.<p>Allowing things to be forced into a false dichotomy rather than the many, many nuanced positions that reality actually holds is probably more likely to be a source of strife and conflict. US social media companies are doing more to fan these flames than anyone else by actively deplatforming and censoring anyone who runs afoul of their social policies. What do you think all these people are going to do? Without any engagement on their concerns, will they just dry up and disappear? I strongly doubt it.<p>To ease the tensions, our first job is to stop viewing our neighbours as enemies. We want 90% the same things as anyone else: stability, safety, prosperity. We have different ideas of how to get there, but we share one thing: people telling us to hate each other based on strawman conceptions about what each other actually believes.')
