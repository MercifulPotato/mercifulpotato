Your characterization isn&#x27;t quite right. Apple doesn&#x27;t want to not have apps that allow users to execute code, in fact they themselves write apps that let the user execute code they write and demo them at WWDC (Swift Playgrounds? Shortcuts?). Some of the best apps on the App Store let you write code and run it. Saying iSH is in violation of those rules would require pulling down those apps too.<p>What Apple is <i>really</i> trying to do is prevent apps from changing their behavior after they review them in a silent way to bypass the usual process. The real issue here is that their guidelines don&#x27;t reflect this and this confuses the reviewers (and evidently commenters here on Hacker News). What needs to happen here is Apple clarifies their guidelines so that we don&#x27;t have rules that can be inconsistently enforced.<p>(If you need more to convince you, I&#x27;ll point you at the stuff I wrote when that was going on: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saagarjha.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;08&#x2F;fixing-section-2-5-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saagarjha.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;08&#x2F;fixing-section-2-5-2&#x2F;</a>).')
