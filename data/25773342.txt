When politicians are elected, they should be given the opportunity to actually govern on the agenda they ran on. Otherwise, elections becomes completely meaningless as everyone knows that meaningful change can never be implemented no matter what. I would argue that is <i>more</i> dangerous to democracy. The modern world evolves rapidly and a country needs a Government that&#x27;s able to respond effectively to those changes.<p>The argument that an elected majority, elected by free and fair elections, should <i>not</i> be able to implement the platform they ran on seems fundamentally anti-democratic in itself.<p>What prevents an elected majority from consolidating power? Well, that&#x27;s why we have 3 different branches of the Federal Government, and staggered election to bicameral Congress.')
