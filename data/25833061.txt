It is highly unlikely they are uploading multiple streams from every participant and just muxing the right-sized stream for the other participants to download. Bandwidth costs might be more expensive than the transcoding costs. Remember, you can use ASIC accelerated transcoders which can be quite cost-effective. If they really want to cut corners, they can simply command-and-control every participant client to send low-res stream and restream to every other participant without full transcoding â€“ at least for free tier.')
