Looking good is a secondary target.<p>The direct competitor is XFCE. There are a couple of advantages I personally find over XFCE:<p>- XFCE has a very severe lack of resources; in worst case, this translates to bugs (even severe) not being fixed for a very long time<p>- MATE has a very flexible interface (it&#x27;s actually impressive how they have exactly the opposite philosophy as the GNOME guys)<p>I&#x27;ve been a longtime XFCE user, but when a couple of bugs started affecting my workflow, I had to leave it.<p>The worst case has a been a bug where around 25% of the times (if not more), moving files via file manager caused the file manager to crash. This has gone unfixed for a very long time (at least 6 months).<p>Despite what some people believes, it&#x27;s not possible to swap the default file manager. While it&#x27;s technically feasible, DEs have their FM harcoded in some places (ie. Desktop), which causes subtle breakages if the default FM is swapped.')
