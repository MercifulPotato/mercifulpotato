I&#x27;m certainly no role model for it, but there are two things that have helped a lot:<p>- Start at a consistent time.  Right now my daughter is in school so I have to get up and get her going on remote school.  This usually gets me started around 9am.<p>- End at a consistent time.  I have a hard stop every day at 7pm, because that&#x27;s when Jeopardy! comes on, and when we have family dinner.  I even went so far as to create a voice announcement through the whole house that it is time for dinner and Jeopardy! so my family keeps me accountable.<p>This ostensibly means I work for 10 hours a day, but I allow myself to not feel bad if I need to take a two hour break to go shopping or fold some laundry or just take a break to watch some TV, since I know that my default is 50 hours a week.  A two hour break every day would get me to 40 hours and I don&#x27;t take a two hour break every day.')
