What&#x27;s that about - I don&#x27;t really get it?<p>I work hard on my software ideas.<p>I can absolutely understand if you simply don&#x27;t have time - work&#x2F;kids&#x2F;family&#x2F;friends&#x2F;health etc.<p>But if you do have time and instead procrastinate - that&#x27;s a mystery to me.  I&#x27;d like to say &quot;just do the work&quot; but I think that would be missing the point somehow.<p>I made a definite decision a while back I&#x27;d rather do something with my life than play endless hours of computer games or TV&#x2F;Netflix watching.
