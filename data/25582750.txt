Item(by='epistasis', descendants=None, kids=[25583014], score=None, time=1609343911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581727, text='&gt; As a result of Amazon&#x27;s action, the top-ranking drone, which previously had more than 6,000 reviews, now has only about 50 reviews and its star rating has dropped to three and a half stars. But the other two listings I mentioned above—both of which I also mentioned in a Monday email to Amazon—still have thousands of positive reviews, including a bunch of obviously bogus ones.<p>The result of blatant fraud and manipulation is simply removing the fraud?  Why is Amazon continuing business with this shady company <i>as if nothing happened</i>?<p>I consider their &quot;corrective&quot; action far worse and damming than their inaction on other pages. Inaction could be from an inability to police everything. But merely covering up fraud when it happens is nearly as bad as taking no action.')
