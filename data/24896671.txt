I&#x27;m also absolutely sure you&#x27;ll find that 99% cross-stitch and scrapbooking content online is posted by a tiny percentage of cross-stitchers and scrapbookers.<p>You&#x27;ll also find that radical centrists (as defined by actual political positions) are an infinitesimal group, and that the vast majority of people will report their beliefs as middle of the road no matter what the actual content. They will also report that they are middle-class, no matter what their income.<p>And what content-free questions:<p>&gt; It concludes that unlike in the US, climate change is not a culture-war issue in the UK. In Britain, it found that 85% of voters believe climate change concerns us all. The most sceptical group were voters described as “disengaged traditionalists”, where the figure was still 76%. Meanwhile, 79% of all voters say gender equality is a sign of progress.<p><i>Does climate change &quot;concern us all&quot;?</i> Yes, climate change is being used as a weapon to destroy progress and people&#x27;s livelihoods.<p><i>Is gender equality a sign of progress?</i> Yes, when the courts stop favoring women, and give me the right to choose who I want to hire regardless of whether they&#x27;re a man or woman, society will have progressed.<p>&gt; The research also suggested that the Covid-19 crisis had prompted an outburst of social solidarity. In February, 70% of voters agreed that “it’s everyone for themselves”, with 30% agreeing that “we look after each other”. By September, the proportion who opted for “we look after each other” had increased to 54%.<p>I don&#x27;t even know what this question means, or how it&#x27;s relevant to the thesis. I think they were searching for people who both had no loved ones, and are not just covid denialists, but not even aware that anything is even going on. Covid denialists have support networks, that&#x27;s how they keep their businesses open and schedule protests. It&#x27;s very difficult to phrase a question when the position that you think is the most reasonable is also a very extreme one (that covid is very dangerous and justifies extreme measures.)<p>&gt; More than half (57%) reported an increased awareness of the living conditions of others, 77% feel that the pandemic has reminded us of our common humanity, and 62% feel they have the ability to change things around them – an increase of 15 points since February.<p>Unintelligible. And these are the <i>entirety</i> of the examples cited in the article.<p>edit: also Jo Cox supported BDS, so I guess she was an extremist, too.<p>edit2: missed this<p>&gt; Its polling found that 73% believe hate speech is a problem, while 72% believe political correctness is an issue. Some 60% believe many are too sensitive about race, but 60% also recognise issues around “white privilege”.<p>- looks pretty extreme to me.')
