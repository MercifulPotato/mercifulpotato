The time was magical and feels nostalgic in retrospect. I feel like pulling out one of my early works and doing the same.<p>Most impressive though I think is the development you did as an artist. Starting from the effect based presentation in your early works, it&#x27;s wholesome to see you take all of the stuff you learned about physics engines, still top it off with more you&#x27;ve learned along the way — but then let it all take a backseat to telling a story instead. One of drama, hope, despair, struggle and eventually, &quot;escape&quot;.<p>Thanks for making my day.<p>There&#x27;s a drawer in my closet that&#x27;s labeled &quot;unfinished business&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m inspired to open it right now.')
