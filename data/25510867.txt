That would be a dream come true for the other person’s lawyers.<p>If the OP wants to keep his equity, he needs to continue fulfilling his duties and demonstrate that he is, in fact, still working for the company.<p>Please don’t follow petty HN comment section advice like this. Not only is it unprofessional, but it can quickly turn into self-sabotage. Play it clean and don’t give the other side ammo to use against you in court.')
