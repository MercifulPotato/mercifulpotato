Is this really something we shouldn&#x27;t tell other people or should we work on it?<p>If someone has a tick accent that I can&#x27;t understand or uses too much of slang that I cannot interpret without thinking about it or if someone acts as if they are simply a puppeteer of a persona(like if they bring up their identity all the time as if everything is about this persona definition but without personality) I also get very intimidated because I don&#x27;t know what to expect at my encounters. I may intend to have a quick chat about something technical and it may end up me trying to understand what I did wrong to upset this person.<p>It&#x27;s not about races or communities or genders, some people are acting as if they try to get upset, they are fishing for a chance to bring up their agenda or make everything about themselves.<p>In cases where there&#x27;s no  stigma to confront this kind of people, you can fight back but when this person is from a community that is ready to make it a big deal, it&#x27;s really intimidating to confront people that make everything about themselves or their persona.<p>From the way she describes her standing point, I got the impression that she would be one of the people that I would try to avoid.')
