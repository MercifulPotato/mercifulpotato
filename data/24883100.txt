Item(by='incompatible', descendants=None, kids=[24883119], score=None, time=1603588114, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24880745, text='It&#x27;s yet another word for libertarian communism &#x2F; anarcho-communism &#x2F; anarchism &#x2F; communalism in the tradition of Bakunin, Kropotkin, Bookchin and Graeber. Obviously it has a long and interesting intellectual tradition. The basic principles are rejection of all forms of social hierarchy and inequality (nobody can give orders, and all work is voluntary), and rejection of private property (you get access to what you currently need from the shared resources of the community). Perhaps the only law needed would be to prohibit doing harm, or risking harm, to others, at least without their consent. The few practical implementations (in a Western, developed context) have generally succumbed to outside forces, such as Catalonia in the 1930s, and perhaps Rojava today.')
