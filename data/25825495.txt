Yes, but that&#x27;s exactly what I meant! I think my phrasing was off. For a company of that size, I&#x27;ve seen very good activity promoting the julia brand, both officially and through word-of-mouth networks. (your own Cambridge meetups notwithstanding). Therefore, I think much of the hype is at least partly that, rather than just the technical merits of the language (which I agree it has plenty). I don&#x27;t remember this kind of &#x27;buzz&#x27; before v1. Back then it was just people who saw promise in its features. Now people seem to be promoting it quite actively.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a shift in the winds, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying. I wasn&#x27;t mean to come off so negative. (certainly not as negative as Chris took it!)')
