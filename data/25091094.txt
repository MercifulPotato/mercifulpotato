I’ve worked with them on ARM and have a few pi’s around running with projects on them.<p>But it depends on the type of backend work. If you’re using C and assembly and need to target x86, then I can see issues.<p>Regarding the move, I expect these first ones to be targeted more to regular users and to projects testing their projects on them.<p>IMO the main reason why things aren’t working on them right now is due to there not being availability and projects not having to move to it yet. But there’s no technical reason why things won’t be ported for them. The ecosystem just needs to grow.')
