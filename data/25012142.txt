OKI and Brother printers are generally similar (in fact I would not be surprised if Brother printers are actually made by OKI), but OKI printers tend to have better firmware and actual licensed PostScript implementation from Adobe. And at least here (Czech Republic) you can often get OKI printers on sale with almost ridiculous discounts.')
