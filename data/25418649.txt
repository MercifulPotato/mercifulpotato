But when one system can be used to compromise all the nodes in an org, is it really worth it?</i><p>If you think about it, the modern cloud-native approaches are logically aiming for the same. You have a centralised management system (the cloud provider&#x27;s engine), with programmatic configuration (infrastructure-as-code and indeed everything-as-code). We even call these modern best practices. Just instead of a webgui management console, we have git repos, and in place of two-person change protocol we have mandatory code reviews enforced by tooling.<p>A single point of failure is one side of the coin. The side you&#x27;re not looking at is single point of control.')
