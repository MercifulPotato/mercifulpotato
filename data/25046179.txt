From hardware to software. It&#x27;s like a breath of fresh air, really.<p>E.g. - Had a paper jam at some point. The on-device screen said &quot;Paper jam. Open the front panel.&quot; Opened it, the message changed to &quot;Remove the toner cartridge.&quot; Removed it, and it kept on going to tell where to look, what to pull, etc. Ditto with the driver installation - downloaded, run, clicked OK, done. No junk to &quot;manage my printing experience&quot;, just what&#x27;s needed to control all printing options, all laid out clearly, and exactly where Microsoft says it should be. Beautiful. Almost shed a tear.')
