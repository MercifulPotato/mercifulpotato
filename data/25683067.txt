Modern life can lack a sense of purpose and community, so even with infinite entertainment at our fingertips we still yearn for something deeper. Like you said, conspiracy or chaos can fill those desires. You get to be part of an &quot;in-group&quot; and be part of something bigger. Life just gets a bit more dramatic and interesting. Probably why cults can exist at all as well.<p>I used to wonder how anyone could be stupid enough to fall in with a cult, but after living a traditional modern 9-5 for a while I can totally see the hole that was missing that a cult, religion, conspiracy or commune would fill.')
