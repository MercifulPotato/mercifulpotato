They really moved the overton window on what is morally normative in terms of advertising... and then applied those norms to everything... content, not just advertising.<p>Apple do stuff you might disagree on. They normalised demoting applications to &quot;apps,&quot; which exist inside a walled garden, pay rent and play by Apple&#x27;s rules. This might not be a good vibe. But, the app store isn&#x27;t their product.<p>Monopoly, by and large, is not Apple&#x27;s business model. Apple are big enough that they do monopolize markets, like the app store. But the app store isn&#x27;t the product or business model. Selling phones is. They don&#x27;t generally pursue dominant market shares, prefering to cream the high end.<p>A business model that isn&#x27;t inherently monopoly seeking at its core, isn&#x27;t mostly about data, advertising or somesuch... that basically makes Apple a shining example. Everything is relative.<p>That said, despite hoping FB lose generally, I do hope that antitrust builds up to something meaningful. I&#x27;ll be hoping for a guilty.')
