The added benefit is that Chinese isnâ€™t a dead language.<p>As a native Korean speaker this is an apt analogy, even more so because it won&#x27;t help much initially but will help a lot once you&#x27;ve got to the later stage of learning. This is of course a valid strategy if you want to eventually learn both Chinese and Korean.')
