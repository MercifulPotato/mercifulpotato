Item(by='lifthrasiir', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607765431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25396864, text='Maybe my wording is not accurate, imagine the following (not necessarily idiomatic) C code:<p><pre><code>    int main() {\n        int x;\n        {\n            int x[];\n        &#x2F;&#x2F; &lt;-- caret here\n        x += 42;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis code doesn&#x27;t compile, so the IDE tries to produce a partial AST. A naive approach will result in the first } matching with the second {, so `x += 42;` will cause a type error. But as noticable from the indentation, it is more believable that there was or will be } matching with the second { at the caret position and `x += 42;` refers to the outer scope.<p>Yes, of course parsers can account for the indentation in this case. But more generally this kind of parsing is sensitive to a series of edit sequences, not just the current code. This makes incremental parsing a much different problem from ordinary parsing, and also is likely why ibains and folks use packrat parsing (which can be easily made incremental).')
