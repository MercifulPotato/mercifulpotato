The stateless HW can accept decoding jobs in any order as long as all the information is properly provided (parameters extracted and deduces from the bitstream along with the previously decoded references). As a side effect, it is trivial to multiplex multiple streams using this type of HW.<p>The V4L2 layer keeps a bit of the state (more like caching, to avoid re-uploading too much information for each jobs). The userspace is responsible for bitstream parsing and DPB management (including re-ordering).')
