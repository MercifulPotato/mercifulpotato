And indeed, over time, they&#x27;ve added ads and analytics and generally made it more commercial and less user-friendly. This is a subjective opinion as someone who&#x27;s used reddit off and on for the past 10 years.<p>My site is owned by me. I expect to be the primary contributor to it after the initial hype dies down, and I would prefer to spend my time contributing to a site that I control.<p>Privacy policy is at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;100millionbooks.org&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;100millionbooks.org&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;</a>. You can judge it for yourself. I run my own mailing list server and analytics server. There are no trackers on the site. Since launch 3 years ago, there have never been any trackers or ads on any 100 Million Books apps or extensions (not even affiliate links). That&#x27;s a pretty good track record, and you can bet Hystoria will benefit from all of it.')
