But you can make this magic very much constrained. There&#x27;s a fundamental difference between &quot;fusion reactors that are absurdly efficient for magical reasons&quot; and &quot;FTL drives that work by magic&quot;. A difference in the level of abstraction, if you like. The more lower-level your magic, the bigger and more interesting the network of potential consequences. And also the easier to keep universe self-consistent - because you have small-scale axiom, and large-scale rules are extrapolations using real-world physics and reasoning.')
