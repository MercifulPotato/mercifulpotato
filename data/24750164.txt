Interfaces external to the driver evolve over time (which bleeds into changes internal to the driver), requirements change, people want to add new features that old hardware <i>ought</i> to support -- all this adds up and puts evolutionary pressure on the drivers. Code duplication really hurts here.<p>It&#x27;s possible that the AMD developers are from a Windows culture where they don&#x27;t have to worry about this because Microsoft gives them a stable interface. Though even there, I find it questionable whether it&#x27;s a win. Surely the occasional bug will surface that affects drivers for older hardware as well?')
