Maybe I&#x27;m meeting the wrong companies.<p>Here&#x27;s my original comment:<p>Well, the flip side is. Do you have experience with AWS? Not really, but I&#x27;ve known Linux for years, have done stuff on Heroku, Digital Ocean, my own servers, hacked boxes and IBM Bluemix, but no AWS.<p>Sorry, we rejected you because you have no experience with AWS.<p>So to be honest, I&#x27;ve been looking into it, because apparently a lot of Dutch (not all) are too short-sighted to see that I&#x27;ve done development and am able to figure it out, or have transferable knowledge (fun fact&#x2F;example: in part via HN articles that showed how to load balancers [0]).<p>Also on the money side, it&#x27;s not that bad.
