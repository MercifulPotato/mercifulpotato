I had an AMEX card - there was an annual fee, but it also came with a &#x27;free&#x27; return domestic flight. Since I went to visit my parents (interstate) at least once a year, that &#x27;free&#x27; flight meant my card was effectively &#x27;fee-free&#x27;.<p>With a reasonably generous point scheme - and more importantly, one I could transfer to about 8 different airlines, I just accumulated points for a decade.<p>In 2015, I cashed in 2&#x2F;3 of my points balance for a round-the-world trip on Singapore Airlines in Suite Class (where you get your own cabin).<p>I wasn&#x27;t getting free flights each year like a business traveller, but for an effectively cost-neutral card that didn&#x27;t require me to change my spending habits, I feel like a Suite Class RTW flight every 6-7 years is a decent reward.')
