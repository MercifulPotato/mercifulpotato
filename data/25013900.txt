Honest discussion is pretty much impossible on any other mainstream web platform. Websites like hacker news are heavily moderated to &quot;stay clean&quot; and then we got reddit, a dystopian wholesome echo chamber.<p>By the way: Pretty much every other 4chan user is looking down on &#x2F;pol users. They don&#x27;t trust &#x2F;pol, because they realized it&#x27;s indeed inhabited by the bad kind of racists and generally heavily biased people.')
