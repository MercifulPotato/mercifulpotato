In reality, endgame theory is in some sense, far more complicated than many opening systems, because their are so many degrees of freedom. Yes there are 32 pieces at the start of the game, but prior to development and initial piece placement, there are usually far fewer candidate moves. I think it&#x27;s a good idea for a beginner to learn at least a few opening systems after getting the &quot;gist&quot; of the endgame like king opposition and opposite color bishops etc.')
