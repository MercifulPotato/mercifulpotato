So really, we&#x27;re not having an argument about &quot;Free market vs total centralized system&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;how much centralization is appropriate&quot;.<p>So maybe we don&#x27;t today need to work with the Department of Widget creation, but we need to hire lobbyists for the Senate Committee on the Widget Sector. I&#x27;m not prepared to say that informing&#x2F;influencing&#x2F;steak-dinnering the Senators&#x27; aides is per se better than having a nasty political fight in the Company Of The People.<p>The history of the US farm bill and food safety is a great example of how we don&#x27;t have a genuine free market in the US. I don&#x27;t argue <i>for</i> a free market, by the way. Regulation has done a great deal of good. It&#x27;s just very important to speak with care about topics, and use words that are true to the reality.')
