Do you mean that, to get it to compile as C++, you have to add an explicit cast? That isn&#x27;t a significant burden.<p>Requiring explicit casts, and forbidding implicit conversions, <i>reduces</i> the odds of being surprised by an unwanted conversion. There&#x27;s a good argument to be made for adding explicit casts to C code even when the language doesn&#x27;t require them. GCC&#x27;s <i>-Wconversion</i> flag can help with this.')
