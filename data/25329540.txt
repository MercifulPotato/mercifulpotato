Item(by='krastanov', descendants=None, kids=[25329601], score=None, time=1607318474, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25329473, text='&quot;Quantum Advantage&quot; and the synonymous &quot;Quantum Supremacy&quot; (considered somewhat inappropriate because of other uses of the same word in racist orgs) are recently established &quot;terms of art&quot; in this field. They refer to &quot;an experiment that unambiguously demonstrates computational capabilities unreachable by a classical supercomputer&quot;. Importantly, it is not really expected that the computation in question would be something useful, rather just something classically difficult as a proof of concept. I would say &quot;useful quantum supremacy&#x2F;advantage&quot; experiments are not yet demonstrated and will take a few more years (maybe almost a decade). Still, the progress since conceiving this field in the early 90s is astronomical.')
