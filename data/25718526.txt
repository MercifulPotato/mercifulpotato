It starches every Ryzen chip in single core performance<p>It most certainly does not. It trades blows, winning on some benchmarks and losing others. It seems a bit ahead on floating-point workloads and a bit behind on integer workloads.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested&#x2F;4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a><p>It <i>does</i> simply outperform every Intel design. That&#x27;s great, but not enough to make it the fastest core in the world. It, to no one&#x27;s surprise, falls behind the parts with higher core counts.<p>Caveats:<p>1. These benchmarks are preliminary. We are, by necessity, comparing across operating systems and architectures.<p>2. Comparing single-threaded performance between a SMT system and one without SMT is a little misleading, since a non-SMT core is worse than an SMT core even if the single-threaded performance is similar.<p>3. I have no clue how to handle the big.LITTLE architecture. I&#x27;ve never used a machine with heterogeneous cores and have never written any software for it. It is certainly a benefit to efficiency. It <i>probably</i> improves performance on highly-threaded workloads, but I am not sure.<p>I find myself annoyed by these discussions. I love new hardware! I find this chip very impressive! It is the best chip in the world in performance-per-watt! It is clearly the best mobile chip on the market! It has a lot of interesting accelerators! Please stop forcing me to be the naysayer.')
