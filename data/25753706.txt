The 1st amendment protects you from being persecuted by the government for your speech. It does not require private entities to publish, promote, transmit, or broadcast your speech. Similarly, discrimination is legal in the US. It is only illegal to discriminate against members of protected classes on the basis of them being members of those protected classes. Political affiliation is not a protected class.<p>Anyone that wants to spout off abhorrent things on the internet is free to do so. However, no private entity can be forced to allow such behavior. You do not have a right to have your tweet published by Twitter. You do not have a right to store your bits on an Amazon server.')
