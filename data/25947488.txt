In particular, with daytime running lights on most cars, high beam flashing is the most practical tool for the job.<p>On my Model Y, it is a simple pull of the left steering wheel stalk to do that, the same on all other cars I&#x27;ve previously owned. On my prior car, flashing the non-bright lights would&#x27;ve required turning an awkwardly positioned dial that also controls fog lights and running lights. That is easier than the touchscreen method but still poor UX while driving.')
