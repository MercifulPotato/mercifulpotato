Eventually, however, the host has his brother explain a convoluted story where, basically, his brother (an <i>extremely</i> competent researcher and scientist) discovered a genetic anomily in all the mice used in labratories around the world.<p>Because the mice were bread with such a pressure on the population, the telemeres on their DNA were getting awkwardly long (or short? I don&#x27;t remember) resulting in their cells being _unusually good at repairing themselves_ with a downside of under-reporting the incident-rate of cancer.<p>The discovery got sniped from him, when he started reaching out from other prominent researchers, and eventually the discovery was buried.<p>It seems <i>plausible</i> that he tripped across an extremely damaging fact, one that would have forced a broad re-evaluation of the risk of many substances and medications recognized as &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;healthy&quot;.<p>Stuff like this long-term testosterone decrease, if it&#x27;s indeed a bad thing (it might not be!) could be a result of that kind of scientific burying.<p>Anyway - it was an interesting story.')
