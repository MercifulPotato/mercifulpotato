Wait for an M2 or an M3 MacBook. By then not only the software would be finally optimised for Apple Silicon, it would run even faster than M1 with an M2 or M3 Macbook.<p>Perhaps the 16 inch MacBook (2021) or the other 2021 Macbooks would probably run M2 or so. So I&#x27;d wait for those instead of getting last years model.<p>&gt; if not then what are some powerful alternatives that we could use that would be as powerful as m1 MacBook<p>Judging by the statistics, M1 MacBooks are already 3 years ahead. Until the M2 or M3 Macs come in, there would be no point buying these intel laptops.')
