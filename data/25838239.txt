Wait for an M2 or an M3 MacBook. By then not only the software would be finally optimised for Apple Silicon it would be even run faster on an M2 or M3 Macbook.<p>Perhaps the 16 inch MacBook or 2021 Macbooks would probably run a M2 or so. So I&#x27;d wait for that instead of getting last years model.<p>&gt; if not then what are some powerful alternatives that we could use that would be as powerful as m1 MacBook<p>Judging by the statistics, M1 MacBooks are already 3 years ahead.
