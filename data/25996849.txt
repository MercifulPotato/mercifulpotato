In particular, the way the video compression crushes all dark colors into a single shade of black. Plus, when Google kills Stadia in a year, you&#x27;ll have lost the games you purchased and paid a subscription fee for.<p>I was excited to see Google make a game that would only be possible on Stadia, be it an MMO, races with hundreds of cars, or something more creative their designers could imagine. With their internal developers shut down, all that&#x27;s left is more expensive, inferior quality versions of games I could play elsewhere.')
