On earth, the projectile would attain its highest velocity (right as it leaves the rail gun) in the thickest part of the atmosphere (at ground level).<p>And just for a sense of scale, escape velocity from earth&#x27;s surface--assuming no atmosphere at all--is 25,000 miles per hour. The projectile is going to tear itself apart in atmosphere at those speeds.')
