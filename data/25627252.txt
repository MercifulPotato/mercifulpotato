I don&#x27;t think I disagree with many or most of the points you&#x27;ve made.<p>It might be interesting to define a systematic and testable definition of organizational efficiency relative to an ideal market. Just like combustion engines can be compared to their theoretical maximum efficiency, it would be interesting to compare a particular organization against its maximum potential.<p>Here is another angle on the topic of relative efficiency. Consider a particular organization. Coca Cola will do as an example. Given its environment (financial incentives, regulations, cultural norms, etc), are we <i>surprised</i> by its behavior? This raises the question of how much an organization&#x27;s particulars (e.g. leadership, history) affect its efficiency.<p>I suppose I take a systems view of it. Many deplorable businesses survive in niches. But can you &quot;blame&quot; them? It is a matter of perspective: organizations, like life, adapt to their environment and modify it to their liking. Such organizations can stretch the environment to or past its breaking point for a relative long period of time before having to deal with the downstream consequences.')
