Looking at &quot;Why are you seeing this ad&quot; it&#x27;s basically &quot;Is this person female and aged 25-35&quot;<p>It&#x27;s annoying because: The ads are extremely disctracting: I can&#x27;t help but notice them. They look like they for the same game the last 500 ads were for with a reskin. And I haven&#x27;t played a mobile game since 2012 and facebook is supposed to be able to track all of this right?<p>The other ads are for womans clothes or shoes which is reasonably accurate. But you need almost zero tracking to determine that I <i>might</i> be receptive to online clothes store. (I&#x27;m not, I buy clothes in persons because sizing is hard)<p>I also once got ads from Jordan Pertsons thing... WOW HOW WRONG CAN IT GET')
