It&#x27;s an old 19&quot; with a resolution of 1280x1024, you can get those pretty much for free these days.<p>But hey, n + 1 screens &gt; n screens :D<p>I usually just have my browser on it in full screen. And because of the resolution I don&#x27;t have to worry about overly long lines on websites that aren&#x27;t restricted in with (like hacker news).<p>At work I picked up an old 19&quot; TFT from the trash that connects neatly to the unused VGA port of the docking station. It has abysmal ghosting issues, so it&#x27;s no use for the browser, but still good enough for a terminal.<p>With modern graphics cards supporting many outputs and monitors that you can literally get for free, you can have the luxury of dedicating a display to a single task or application, so that&#x27;s pretty cool.')
