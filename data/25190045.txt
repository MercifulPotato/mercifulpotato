But it&#x27;s a bit different in some ways. The developer decided in the first place to opensource the software while absolutely no one could produce a gaming platform that was free. And in this case the developer got acknowledged which is a big deal, generally big companies use FOSS without even bothering to do so. That acknowledgement may help improve the career for FOSS developers and raise the potential of obtaining really well paid commercial gigs. I wish FOSS were paid but then it wouldn&#x27;t really be FOSS. At least being acknowledged is the first step towards fairness.')
