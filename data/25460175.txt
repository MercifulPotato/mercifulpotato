The code is not even peephole optimized up to 1985-ish standards Regarding { c, 0 } versus { c }, I don&#x27;t expect in a mature C or C++ compiler for such high level differences in an expression to affect instruction selection. Both { c } and { c, 0 } say exactly the same thing: one member is initialized and the rest are zero. I would expect that there is no difference in intermediate representations at all, long before we get to a code generating back end. The compiler should convert the initializer to a canonical representation early on and not deal with different cases of it thereafter. This is definitely a WTH?')
