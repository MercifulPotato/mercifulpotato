The hardest part was actually not building the &quot;cable&quot; but balancing and bending it all just right so that the pins actually maintained contact.<p>Now, in the days of complex calculated power delivery negotiation, a hack like this would be impossible.<p>And for good reason. Devices are safer now, more compatible with each other&#x27;s chargers, and can charge faster. And the things we can do with USB-C&#x2F;USB-PD are fantastic. I discovered yesterday that if for some reason I really want to, I can charge my MacBook Pro from my Android phone.<p>But my little foil hack was fun at the time.')
