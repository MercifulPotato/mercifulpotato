They ran coverage analysis and removed all uncovered code, thus achieving 100% coverage.<p>The point was to fit all their code in an very small executable (typically 4k or 64k). It was absolutely terrible for robustness: all edge cases are ignored. But since it was a demoscene production, it didn&#x27;t matter, but if it was a server, that would have made it the most exploitable code ever.')
