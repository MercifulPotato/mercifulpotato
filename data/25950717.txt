Item(by='dalbasal', descendants=None, kids=[25950795, 25950883], score=None, time=1611874561, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25950187, text='&gt;&gt; This lawsuit will go nowhere... increasingly desperate if they&#x27;re willing to brazenly manipulate the market like this.<p>IDK...  I&#x27;m probably missing something about norms or precedents, but allowing selling and not buying is not just brazen. It&#x27;s straightforward enough that the average person is incensed <i>and</i> understands specifically why. This isn&#x27;t systemic risk and turtle stack complexity.<p>This is probably my info-bubble, but nihilistic rage of WSB seems to be spilling out into the world. The social media (dischord&#x2F;reddit) aspects, hedge funds, markets&#x2F;brokers... it all adds up to symbolic whole that has ordinary people cheering on a bunch of maniacal gamblers. The SEC is looking more like a belligerent than a regulator.<p>Remember that the SEC is, first and foremost, a bunch of cowards.')
