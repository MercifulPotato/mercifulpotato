I haven&#x27;t looked closely at it.<p>If it were possible, your iteration times could be ridiculously low. Play the game until the bossfight you&#x27;re iterating on. Dump it out to disk. Edit the code, recompile and run from saved state in a couple of seconds? That sounds amazing.<p>Unity has pretty good edit and continue for simple stuff, but it quickly falls apart once you start doing non trivial things.')
