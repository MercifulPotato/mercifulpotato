I know AX is still early but because I am in the market and both my daily devices are AX I might as well try (Unifi 6 Lite or LR though both don&#x27;t support AX in 2.4GHz so something with 160MHz in 5GHz and AX in 2.4GHz). If you buy consumer AX now forget updates in a year or two. On the other hand the first AC Lite still receives updates and that board has gone through more than 30 revisions (I recently bought one for someone and that had board revision 36 or something). Sadly I haven&#x27;t had the same luck with their wired routers. The EdgeRouters are running some old Debian and I have had trouble with their PPPoE client. So I flashed OpenWRT recently on it but it didn&#x27;t run great (for my fiber) either. I am looking for either an R4S NanoPi or one of those protectli devices for just routing. I think in the router part these devices are not cutting it for me (I can do things like dnsmasq blocklisting and stubby with openwrt and cake sqm works great). Anyway I need to plan my WiFi 6 Fiber upgrade well otherwise its easy to get carried away and blow up the budget.')
