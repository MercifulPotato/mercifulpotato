The only app that guarantees that right now, with minimal configuration, is Signal.<p>Jumping from Facebook or WhatsApp to Telegram doesn&#x27;t make any sense from a privacy perspective. Well Telegram supports secret chats, It unfortunately defaults to non-secret chats, which are just to secure as any old Facebook post. In fact, if we&#x27;re comparing WhatsApp to Telegram, from a privacy perspective, you would be giving up more data by switching to Telegram because WhatsApp is completely end to end encrypted by default.')
