That&#x27;s such poor product support.<p>I have a whole army of Google Homes, and not one has bricked or had any problems. However, at their price point (bought the Home for $100, Home Minis were mostly free or $20) I wouldn&#x27;t mind shelling out for a replacement. Considering the starting price of the HomePod, it&#x27;s nuts that Apple would charge that much to fix (for something that was their issue no less).')
