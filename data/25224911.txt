It&#x27;s mostly the really messy, inconsistent, and difficult to use standard library that turns me off personally. And this isn&#x27;t about inconsistent argument order or naming, I can deal with that as well, but stuff like not being able to create temporary files well, or not being able to check for specific errors in fopen(), and a long list of similar things. These are things that make writing simple, correct, and elegant programs very hard, or sometimes even impossible.')
