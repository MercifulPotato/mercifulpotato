I&#x27;m not swayed by that claim standing alone, since with metrics compiled along linguistic rather than genetic diversity axes (arguably a larger determinant of culture influences) [1], the US ranks around middle of the pack among nations.<p>What I suspect is happening is a form of the Resource Curse. Take a large, economically powerful great power (US end of 19th century), add generous immigration and assimilation policies, turn it into a superpower (US post-WW2), and it is possible the ensuing mayhem scramble for financial dominance within that economic windfall vortex (the Resource) creates fault lines in society that find their expression in culture differences. Lots of cultures, lots of differences. I also suspect if it wasn&#x27;t cultural differences, it would have been some other differences leveraged; the incentives are misaligned to find commonality.<p>If my suspicions are true, then China and EU would be prudent to decline ascending to a superpower role, multipolar world or not. If this is the real dynamic at work, then the superpower mantle is the ultimate appeal to a nation&#x27;s people&#x27;s vanity, containing a hidden poisoned chalice just like a Resource Curse. And would be better served by participating and &quot;leading from below&quot;, charting a new direction in nation-state evolution. Some form like more open information sharing with less developed nations on what works but leaving them to their own devices unless they start destabilizing armed foreign adventures of their own, putting effort into a global tide lifting all boats through trade. Perhaps re-directing the centralizing destructive forces of extreme economic prosperity I suspect develop around a superpower into a wider, amortized net of network effects amortizing the prosperity into more internalized relationships into a diffuse commonwealth-style syndicate of powers, perhaps in turn re-directing to Big Hairy Problems like getting off planet. And the US and rest of G20 would be prudent to participate in such an evolution.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_ranked_by_ethnic_and_cultural_diversity_level" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_ranked_by_et...</a>')
