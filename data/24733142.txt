You need to reverse-engineer the ground truth of who is aligned with whom, what cliques&#x2F;tribes exist, who has it in for whom etc.<p>And this is crucial: you must _NEVER_ let on that you are thinking this way -- you will be targeted as difficult, political, divisive, not a team player etc.<p>The hardest thing to come to terms with in a large org, esp for spectrum-y nerd dev types, is WYSINWYG. No one is allowed to admit that the place is toxic with politics -- until perhaps you are best friends and really trust each other, and then only when drunk, and even then half the time your &quot;bestie&quot; will use this off-the-record talk against you.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like the first rule of Fight Club.')
