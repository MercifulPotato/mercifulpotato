But one guy taking a negative expected value bet and winning big doesn&#x27;t really help all the other little guys on WSB who got roped in to buying GME at 100+ today or might even be ITM on their calls but will get crushed by insane spreads, theta decay due to halts and don&#x27;t have the capital to exercise.<p>I&#x27;m not spiteful of KG and the other people who are making the real money off all the crowds at the option casino, if anything I respect their shrewdness - Citadel prints insane money on these option premiums, and as a bonus KG gets to invest in Melvin at firesale prices and probably gets to extract insane terms.<p>As far as &#x27;jealous fucks working miserable engineering jobs&#x27; - I think you might be projecting a bit there :)')
