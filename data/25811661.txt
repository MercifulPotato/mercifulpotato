I&#x27;ve refused to upgrade since then because I felt that all of the newer MacBook&#x27;s were inferior in some way.  Now I&#x27;m finally thinking of upgrading again once the 16&quot; is released, and it&#x27;s sounding like the new laptop will look exactly like mine from 10 years ago.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of MagSafe though.  It&#x27;s always falling out whenever I slightly move my laptop around.  And my thought with the touchbar is that they should replace it with physical keys, however, the keys should have tiny OLED displays beneath them.  That way, if you want the function keys back, it will look at exactly like the rest of the keys on the keyboard, but if you want some other type of button, that&#x27;s possible too.')
