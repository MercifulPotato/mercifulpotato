It’s more straightforward and avoids accidentally creating dependencies (for example some other code calling pluck_definition) that will be  make it harder to modify when you need to add features or the API changes.<p>Testing pluck_definition by itself is completely pointless since it does nothing on its own. This is the “test public interfaces, not private implementation” principle.<p>Similarly build_url and pluck_definition <i>need</i> to be coupled because they both depend on the specifics of a third party API. It makes it much more clear what the expected output is to keep them together so that if something breaks you know which url to check and what the response should look like.<p>I also dispute that it’s hard to unit test the first function—-you would simply mock the api response and then you have a great test.  Much better than having separate tests for tiny helper functions that do nothing on their own.<p>Now maybe this example is just too simple and the presented architecture makes more sense on larger code but if so then the article is poorly written.  Examples need to be realistic enough not to obfuscate.')
