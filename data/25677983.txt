Or because of other banks at least half implementing them - it stymied the number of people who would actually switch to Simple or showed that people just didn&#x27;t really care.  At the end of the day, Simple provided a slick UI to get people to <i></i>use their bank<i></i> and it seems like there just wasn&#x27;t enough of an edge to drive users to their underlying financial institutions.  Privacy definitely wasn&#x27;t as much of a big deal back when Simple started?')
