Even if they are signed (such as AUR and PPA) most people will blindly add signing keys for people or organisations they do not know, giving them the feeling that they have secured themselves, but have they really?<p>I guess detecting attacks is easier if all files have to be uploaded to a central service, which does allow everyone to see the personalized attack (I mean adding `if (targetUser()) attackTarget()` isn&#x27;t that hard, but it would be visible for everyone compared to doing that server-side). But then if I&#x27;m a sophisticated attacker I&#x27;d be sure to make that way less obvious in my code. My feeling is that it would be detected later rather than sooner if hidden well enough. And that is excluding things like non-official apt repositories.')
