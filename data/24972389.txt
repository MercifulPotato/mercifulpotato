A ruling on a motion to dismiss shows that the law applies to a situation as alleged in the complaint.<p>As I said in the comment you originally responded to, damages are likely to be negligible, which is why I wouldn&#x27;t bring such a claim.<p>You didn&#x27;t explain what objection you had to the concept of tortious interference as it relates to a takedown request, so I just checked my database for examples of successful tortious interference claims at any stage. (I&#x27;m following over 100 similar cases where people or companies harmed by false infringement claims sued.) To the extent you were objecting because I lack a relevant contract, I don&#x27;t see why the GitHub contract isn&#x27;t sufficient. The biggest issue is damages.<p>And as I said above, the plan is to file a declaratory judgement claim, which definitely applies if I can get standing.<p>Whether a tortious interference claim would work depends on a number of factors including the exact details of a hypothetical RIAA takedown request, and as I said I don&#x27;t plan on pursuing one anyway.')
