For medical emergencies they can basically force some course of action.<p>I guess most people who are familiar with this at all are familiar with it from Star Trek, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning that this is just a natural extension of Starfleet&#x27;s pseudo-military basis.<p>When I was in the Army, my word carried nearly as much weight on medical matters as my immediate commanding officer&#x27;s, even though I was a lowly line medic, not a near equal as the doctors in Star Trek usually are to their respective captains. I had no official authority of my own, but the fact that I could go to my medical superiors for backup meant that I was never questioned when I said something was medically necessary.<p>My point is, we don&#x27;t need to go to a SciFi TV show to see this dynamic. It exists in our own current society.')
