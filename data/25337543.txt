In my experience people don&#x27;t understand that for a computer to be &quot;fast,&quot; you have multiple possible bottle-necks: hard drive read&#x2F;write, CPU, RAM, network bandwidth, etc. My very intelligent father-in-law (I mean this seriously, he&#x27;s very intelligent, and was a programmer for years.) wanted to boost his internet speed, and upgrade from DSL to cable. (something like 15mbs to 100mbs) Well, he didn&#x27;t really notice much speed difference. And this was because he was seldom, if ever, saturating his 15mbs link. In fact, on a modern webpage, there are so many new TCP connections that each one can be a bit slow despite bandwidth. (and this is to say nothing of the delay incurred by actually trying to render the js and other elements on the page.)<p>My point was that most consumers don&#x27;t understand these things, and just assume that &quot;computer speed&quot; is one-dimensional: it&#x27;s either fast, or not fast.')
