Perhaps even get your employer to pay for them.<p>I&#x27;ve done this with every office I ever worked at. Dear employer I love you but my hands are my bread-and-butter and they trump your office standards. My hands, my peripherals. You&#x27;re welcome to pitch in. If you have a problem with me using custom gear, bye.')
