Employee health is a personal matter, and the employer does not get automatic access to that information. The employer can get a dedicated physician (affiliated but not employed by your employer) to assess your illness and guide you back to work, but even then the physician&#x27;s records are off-limits to the employer.<p>Speaking only for NL here, but I think the regulation is the same EU-wide. When you call in sick, you are not obligated to answer any questions from your employer except:<p>- whether the cause of the illness is (or might be) work-related<p>- how much time you expect to be out<p>- discuss a next moment of contact (phone appointment or presence in the office)<p>Any data regarding the illness itself is off-limits for the employer, you are allowed to volunteer the information but the employer strictly isn&#x27;t even allowed to ask.')
