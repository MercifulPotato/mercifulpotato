Why is there little to no work going on to improve compatibilty?<p>Why are you asking this here in the HN comments section? Maybe communicate directly to them through a means of contact on their page. Why &quot;grill&quot; them on their progress? Maybe go invest in the project yourself.<p>This just comes off as lazy criticisms. It&#x27;s not like GSOC is your money, nor does Google &quot;make it rain&quot; with their stipend.')
