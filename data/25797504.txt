If you&#x27;re producing a product that&#x27;s highly successful, profitable, then you&#x27;ll be able to afford to keep the patent for more years. If you&#x27;re a patent troll not producing anything, it&#x27;s going to get expensive quick.<p>Edit to add: I just realized patents are definitely part of the legal industrial complex..')
