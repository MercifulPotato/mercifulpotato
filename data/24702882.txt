I mean I don&#x27;t think as stark as yours.<p>I noticed the Kinesis Advantage forced my hands into a position that encouraged touch-typing, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and learn to touch-type while doing my normal work (Still QWERTY though) It worked! I can now touch-type greatly...<p>Sort-of, it really only applies to the Kinesis though, when I go back to a normal staggered layout keyboard I go back to my two-three finger pecking around the keyboard.<p>It&#x27;s obviously still the same layout, so I don&#x27;t think I experience it as bad as you do on a standard keyboard, but now I&#x27;m pretty much stuck on my Kinesis!')
