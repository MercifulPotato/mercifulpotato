I&#x27;ve never met such a confluence of interesting contrarians in my entire life. I don&#x27;t write that to proselytize SV or to mask criticisms of the region, I genuinely feel my experience living there was substantially different with respect to the exposure of eye-opening ideas than any other place I&#x27;ve lived in.<p>Airbnb isn&#x27;t even like a crazy idea of a company, but the gist of the company was incredibly oft-putting to the majority of people I told back home in 2009. &quot;What? Short-term rental to a stranger in my place?! No way!&quot; Now of course, Airbnb as a concept is as &#x27;normal&#x27; as any other large corporation. It doesn&#x27;t matter that my hometown produces great engineers or has billions of dollars in funds, when the overall community is highly risk-averse and conformist, it affects the market size, investment, etc.')
