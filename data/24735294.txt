Indexing works very differently in julia than it does in Matlab. There is some overlap in function names, but less than you&#x27;re implying, mostly in the names that everyone uses anyway (sin, cos, etc) and even where the names are the same, the API details often aren&#x27;t. Ironically the number of overlapping method names has increased because Matlab has been copying method names from Julia in recent years. That said, Julia and Matlab are completely different languages, so I&#x27;d encourage you to look in one step further.')
