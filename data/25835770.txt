I&#x27;m just reading <i>Sapiens</i> and there the author presents the exact opposite thesis - that if you take a high-level view of history, there&#x27;s a clear trend towards unification. Cultures meet, mix and merge.<p>And I find this view easier to square with reality. Especially in the last century, we can see how the &quot;western culture&quot; - which is better called <i>universal culture</i> - has reached and embedded itself in pretty much every nation on the planet. Almost everyone respects the dollar. Almost everyone has a McDonald&#x27;s. As the economies of nations became deeply intertwined, we&#x27;ve entered the world where everyone&#x27;s tools, foods, entertainment and habits start to look alike. I think it&#x27;s just a matter of time before what we consider &quot;local culture&quot; will finally get reduced to a mere curiosity.')
