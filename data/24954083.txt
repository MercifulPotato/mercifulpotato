In that case, you could just do a few more test coughs with the same person to double check, and get that false negative rate down.<p>If false positives are per-person, then your scenario won&#x27;t happen. It&#x27;ll be the same 6 kids for whom the test never works right.<p>So with all this in mind, you&#x27;ll have to come up with appropriate norms around the results. You could call it &quot;okay&quot; vs &quot;suspect&quot; instead of negative and positive. Maybe there&#x27;s a lowered-risk version of activities for people who are &quot;suspect&quot; that day. Maybe they don&#x27;t go to the gym that day, maybe they sit in the isolated booth in the classroom, whatever. But then, they need to take a standard test <i>that night</i> to return to school the next day. Or as someone else mentioned, a rapid-test at the nurse&#x27;s office.')
