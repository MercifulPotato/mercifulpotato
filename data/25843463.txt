Like some sort of manufactured low key sales pitch on the companies they invest in.<p>Anyway I think the general takeaway from the article is the degree to which VC culture has become media&#x2F;influencer&#x2F;entertainment dominated. I really had to laugh when I read his &quot;build&quot; article and the next thing I read was that he pumped countless of dollars into clubhouse, a digital nightclub. So much for building real stuff. I feel like at this point if you put all the VC people together they couldn&#x27;t build a bus station.<p>Never been the biggest fan of Elon personally but in contrast to all the valley types he and his companies to me represent what technologists should actually do, build companies that actually manufacture things.')
