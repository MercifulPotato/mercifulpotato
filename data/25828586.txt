Here are some recent numbers for revenue and unit sales:<p>Honda -&gt; $144B revenue<p>- 12.4M motorcycles, ATVs, etc.<p>- 3.3M automobiles<p>- 5.7M generators, small engines, etc.<p>Daimler -&gt; $207B revenue<p>- 2.4M automobiles<p>- 0.5M trucks<p>- 0.4M vans<p>- 0.03M buses<p>So, Daimler seems to be about 40% larger in revenue, but Honda sells almost 40% more automobiles. But 2.4M automobiles for Daimler seems like it&#x27;s still comparable in scale.<p>Honda seems to still be largely a motorcycle and small engine company, in the global picture, while Daimler has a substantial business in heavy duty commercial vehicles including nameplates that aren&#x27;t necessarily associated with Mercedes by the average person.')
