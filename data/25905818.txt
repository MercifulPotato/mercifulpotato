For the vast majority who actually <i>experience</i> the disease, it is not much worse than the flu. Thus, people start to mistrust the science because there&#x27;s a disparity between the statistics on paper and what people actually experience in reality. I think most people understand now that covid is basically like the flu 99% of the time, and much worse than the flu for a tiny subset (and for the most part, the tiny subset can self-identify).')
