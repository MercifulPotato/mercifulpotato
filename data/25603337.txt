I&#x27;m interested in the idea of a reversible state machine, for parsing an application specific language syntax into some machine representation, then allowing the user to modify it and unparse back to syntax again. So far I&#x27;ve had to implement procedural code for both directions but I figure there must be some way for some smart code to both parse and unparse using some declarative parser rules^. I&#x27;ve had no luck finding any existing art so far.<p>^I figure this won&#x27;t be super simple, since e.g. whitespace is often ignored at the tokenizer step and would need reinjected by the unparser, but that sort of stuff is probably not too difficult to handle.')
