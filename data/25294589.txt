From the machine configuration section:<p>&gt; 1 remote client machine, 1 database server, both in the same cloud datacenter<p>&gt; Disk Size: 4.8TB of disk in a raid0 configuration (EXT4 filesystem)<p>Both those statements lead me to believe it&#x27;s a single server with locally attached SSDs in a RAID0.

TimescaleDB seems like a cool product.<p>Another suggestion I&#x27;d make is to run the Amazon Timestream clients across multiple AZs if you aren&#x27;t already. The blog post doesn&#x27;t mention whether all the t3 instances are in the same AZ or not.')
