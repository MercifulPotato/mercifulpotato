I had never before used APEX, she had been introduced to it an an Oracle tech day, but that was the extent of either&#x27;s experience with it. The application is long gone, but got a lot of use over several months.<p>PL&#x2F;SQL is an excellent tool for implementing business logic, and I really like APEX largely because I can call PL&#x2F;SQL at any of several points.')
