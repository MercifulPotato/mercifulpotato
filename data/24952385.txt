Yes, there&#x27;s a bunch of people using it, and I&#x27;ve managed to use it for this (admittedly very simple models).<p>Is it as nice&#x2F;easy to use? Not quite. Although Qt is pretty good on some Linux flavours and Windows. With more donations, I&#x27;m sure this could improve, too.<p>But on a deeper level, the feature set is large&#x2F;mind-boggling, and I think this is a problem for adoption for a specific use-case like FDM&#x2F;FFF&#x2F;3d printing design, but also in general for software quality and software development.<p>For example, some workbenches work better than others - one even straight up threw a classic Python 3 error, &quot;bytes required, not str&quot;. This can be mitigated to a certain extent by disabling workbenches you don&#x27;t need [0]. But it feels like a jack of all trades, master of none situation.<p>What are the alternatives? I don&#x27;t know. OpenSCAD basically has no editing GUI and a bizarre language. Fusion 360 still works, even though it&#x27;s clear Autodesk will continue to squeeze it (not only the non-commercial restrictions, but the significant price in 2018 if i&#x27;m remembering correctly). Blender is great, and boolean tools are improving, but it isn&#x27;t parametric, and the non-destructive workflow is unusual.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freecadweb.org&#x2F;Interface_Customization#Workbenches" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freecadweb.org&#x2F;Interface_Customization#Workbenc...</a>')
