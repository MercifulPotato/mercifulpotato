The scientific evidence points to the contrary. It is demonstrated that humans have a general ability to learn wide range of things, without being genetically programmed to. None of us evolved to drive cars. Yet nearly everyone in my grandparents generation were able to learn this totally new skill despite being a new invention, where you couldn’t possibly have had time for evolution to act. They weren’t genetically evolved to drive, it was learned within their lifetime and generation. There are tribal humans in different parts of the world that haven’t developed written language. Yet you can teach them written language. Where’s your “pre trained brain” theory there?')
