The file format is closed. You can, of course, periodically export them into common document formats. But you can&#x27;t restore the same Google document and expect it back with all its functionality.<p>For the rest, you&#x27;re completely right. Everything possible should&#x27;ve been backed up. It just has nagged me that a real backup isn&#x27;t possible, and it has bitten me in the past (corrupted drawing, which corrupted related documents as well). Since then, I have only used the Google sheets&#x2F;documents&#x2F;etc. for throwaways and drafts.')
