Obviously I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t exist. I&#x27;m obviously not implying it.<p>What I am implying is that starvation is dramatically lower in percentage then it was in the past.<p>&gt;Did you hear about the Nigerian farmers who were executed last week by Boko Haram? Not very different than a barbarian raiding a small village.<p>Again tragic but in the big scheme of things historically this would be something happening across the street from you. Nowadays it&#x27;s happening in few places but you think it&#x27;s a huge deal because the news manages to cover it.')
