Rounded text fields look exactly like buttons in the light mode, which is bad. They differ slightly in the dark mode, which is great because I&#x27;ll be using the dark mode.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t like how the buttons in the toolbar don&#x27;t have any borders and have an annoying delayed hover background color effect.<p>Otherwise, the UI is quite usable.')
