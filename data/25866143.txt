I know the SF experience isn&#x27;t typical, but it was still mind boggling.<p>Resistance to it doesn&#x27;t have to be snobbish either. The entire grocery business model today is designed for people shopping for themselves. Stores occupy the largest and most expensive retail spaces in the center of the neighborhood. There are wide aisles, fancy decor and complex layouts to showcase products and keep people inside. I love going to the grocery store without a list or any agenda and coming out with a new interesting dinner option, buying loaves of bread on impulse because they just came out of the oven and smell great, talking to the butcher about fresh cuts of meat, getting a recommendation for a new wine or cheese to try out. Like myself I imagine grocery shopping is as much a hobby as bare necessity for others as well.<p>If delivery becomes a norm then none of this will exist anymore (at least at an affordable price). Grocery stores will just be large warehouses outside the city optimized for serving pre-decided orders as quickly and efficiently as possible.')
