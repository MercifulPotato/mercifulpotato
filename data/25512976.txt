It&#x27;s a terrible disincentive that even trying to do something can disqualify you for the safety net you would need if your attempt fails.<p>Some states (say, Nevada) have wonderful programs and can assign you a social worker or other advocate who can recommend organizations that might help.  Other states (say, South Carolina) are more bare-bones, or require you to fill out a 100-page application to be put on a multi-year waiting list before you can access the state&#x27;s impressive resources.  If you don&#x27;t already know where your state fits on that continuum, you might want to ask your county health department or local school district (even if your son has aged out of their programs, they should know who to talk to).')
