Item(by='zmmmmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607381809, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25331971, text='Unnecessary refactoring and whitespace changes are hard fails for my code reviews. There are rare exceptions where refactoring is essentially intertwined with the change being performed, but they are rare.<p>I <i>need</i> to be able to see the intent and minimal definition of a change. Anything that obscures that is obnoxious not just to the reviewer but everyone after who might have to merge or understand the change. Perhaps it is because I manage code that is &quot;high risk&quot; and hence &quot;I can&#x27;t understand your change&quot; equates to &quot;it can&#x27;t go into production&quot; makes a difference.<p>Apart from that, it also ruins the chance to cherry pick &#x2F; separately merge parts of the change.<p>To me this is pure laziness and selfishness and lack of discipline on the developers part.')
