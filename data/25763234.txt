Maybe we can&#x27;t have a true democracy unless everyone is putting a lot of time into participating in decision-making, rather than just hitting the ballot box once every couple years. I actually think this idea of doing things the &quot;hard way&quot; usually getting better results applies in almost everything, personally.<p>There are lots of alternative models out there to the one that is glorified in the US, invented by the Founding Father deities some centuries ago. There has been more than a little innovation since. Worker co-ops -- which have existed for almost as long as the US, or longer in some sense -- have experimented with many structures where workers or consumers, or both, share power in how the company is run. Alternative government structures with more direct representation and delegation have also been attempted, e.g. the democratic confederalism approach in Rojava, which also includes worker and land co-operatives for organising their industries.<p>I think this discussion is also leading towards the suggestion that Google&#x27;s services should become more like utilities and therefore be publicly owned and managed. Basically nationalised. This makes a lot of sense when you consider how powerful the search engine is and how much of every person&#x27;s data and flow of information is controlled by Google. However, it wouldn&#x27;t make sense, or at least it wouldn&#x27;t be fair, for the US to be the government that nationalises Google, since it&#x27;s not only the US population which uses this &quot;utility&quot;. It seems we need to invent a new kind of concept that considers the global population as a &quot;public&quot; that owns and controls these vital global resources.')
