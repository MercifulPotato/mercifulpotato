Nobody in the Middle East is going to get to &#x27;form&#x27; or &#x27;control&#x27; their own Military Industrial Complex.<p>They may be able to &#x27;assemble a crude drone&#x27; but they are not going to be &#x27;creating their own GPS system&#x27; and &#x27;air force&#x27; with &#x27;global drones&#x27; and &#x27;hyper guided weapons&#x27;.<p>&quot;How secret can you keep an aircraft once it gets shot down?&quot;<p>You can&#x27;t but what&#x27;s your point?<p>How many F22&#x27;s shot down? F35s? Heck F18s?<p>If the Russians captured an <i>intact</i> F22 it would take them 15 years to copy it. There&#x27;s an incredible about of know-how and knowledge in those sytstems.<p>And what are &#x27;People on the Arab Street&#x27; going to do with an F22? Absolutely nothing.<p>And yes, the Chinese are &#x27;very aggressively&#x27; pursuing their own Engine technology, they have been for 20 years.<p>There are literally only like 4 countries in the world that con produce modern, 5th Gen fighter engines - let alone the &#x27;rest of the jet&#x27; which gives you an idea of how far away the &#x27;Arab Street&#x27; is to doing anything with tech.<p>They are fighting with sticks and stones. If there are a million bodies there, they can have power, but aside from that, the only hope is political terror within their own borders against dysfunctional regimes.')
