I do not believe it is unreasonable then to demand these platform be require to allow all persons to speak provided their speech is legal speech.<p>This is standard would be massively more open than the current moderation standards of the platforms today<p>Now each one of the platforms are free to fore go those special legal provisions, and be treated as publishers,  like say a NYTimes, or a DailyWire publication.  Under those rules then they have full and complete editorial control over everything on their site but they also assume more legal liability.<p>What the platforms today want is a little bit of A, and a little bit of B,  I think that is not what we as a society should allow<p>They need to choose, are they platforms or publishers')
