Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603472751, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24866733, text='In this comment and also <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24867774" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24867774</a>, you&#x27;re misinterpreting HN moderation. If you look more closely you will see that it is different than you&#x27;re imagining. For example, it&#x27;s neither saying nor implying the things you&#x27;re mentioning here.<p>(I&#x27;m not saying this to defend anythingâ€”I just thought you might be curious.)<p>In the current discourse there are only a few (if not merely two) squares that people are supposed to occupy, and the prevailing feeling is &quot;you&#x27;re either in my square or the enemy&quot;. But operating a community like HN requires not functioning that way, and we don&#x27;t function that way. The goal is to open up space for something more interesting and complex than angry bashing. That&#x27;s not so easy. This thread actually did a pretty good job of it, except where it got sucked into angry bashing.')
