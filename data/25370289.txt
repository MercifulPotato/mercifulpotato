Their profound reaction from matter led them to preach bareness, renunciation, poverty; and the atmosphere of this invention stifled the minds of the desert pitilessly. A first knowledge of their sense of the purity of rarefaction was given me in early years, when we had ridden far out over the rolling plains of North Syria to a ruin of the Roman period which the Arabs believed was made by a prince of the border as a desert-palace for his queen. The clay of its building was said to have been kneaded for greater richness, not with water, but with the precious essential oils of flowers. My guides, sniffing the air like dogs, led me from crumbling room to room, saying, &#x27;This is jessamine, this violet, this rose&#x27;.<p>But at last Dahoum drew me: &#x27;Come and smell the very sweetest scent of all&#x27;, and we went into the main lodging, to the gaping window sockets of its eastern face, and there drank with open mouths of the effortless, empty, eddyless wind of the desert, throbbing past. That slow breath had been born somewhere beyond the distant Euphrates and had dragged its way across many days and nights of dead grass, to its first obstacle, the man-made walls of our broken palace. About them it seemed to fret and linger, murmuring in baby-speech. &#x27;This,&#x27; they told me, &#x27;is the best: it has no taste.&#x27; My Arabs were turning their backs on perfumes and luxuries to choose the things in which mankind had had no share or part.[...]<p>and when i read that, i knew..i just <i>knew</i> that was the &#x27;smell of the desert&#x27;. just as tangible as the rose or jasmine or lavender. for one brief moment, i was the Bedouin myself.<p>on a slightly different(related?) note, today Gingko Bioworks based in Boston can create any fragrance you want(or can dream up) with their fermentation tanks. so there&#x27;s that.')
