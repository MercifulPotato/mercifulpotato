And it worked, it totally tweaked them! A friend of mine working at Sun at the time once lamented to me that &quot;The name &#x27;Eclipse&#x27; is so unfortunate. And why won&#x27;t anybody use NetBeans?&quot; ;)<p>Eclipse is a big bold name with an obvious meaning related to Sun, that expressed IBM&#x27;s goal in one word: they intended to eclipse Sun in the Java world.<p>Their plausibly deniable cover story was that they meant to be competitive with Visual Studio on Windows (which was a passive-aggressive dig at Sun, because Sun had nothing to compare with Visual Studio, which was more ambitious than NetBeans to eclipse).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eweek.com&#x2F;development&#x2F;eclipse-behind-the-name" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eweek.com&#x2F;development&#x2F;eclipse-behind-the-name</a><p>&gt;Eclipse: Behind the Name<p>&gt;Whats in a name?<p>&gt;Back in 2003, when Sun Microsystems Inc. was considering whether it might join the then soon-to-be-independent Eclipse Foundation, one of the key concerns, aside from technical issues, was the name Eclipse.<p>&gt;Sun said it would not join an organization named Eclipse, and the foundation agreed to change the name. The Santa Clara, Calif., company didn&#x27;t want to join an organization whose name was perceived as encouraging the demise of Sun, company executives said at the time. [...]<p>&gt;&quot;We decided to do what it would take to be competitive with Visual Studio on Windows,&quot; he [IBM&#x27;s Nackman] said.<p>&gt;So the target then was and now is Microsoft, not Sun, he said.<p>&gt;But the name seems so perfect a knock against Sun. How could it not be? Well, according to a source, some of the early Eclipse originators had a retreat where one of the themes was the universe and many code names emerged involving celestial themes. Eclipse stuck. And while Sun was not necessarily the primary target, &quot;these were really smart people, and I don&#x27;t think the visualization and competitive implication was lost,&quot; a source said.

[...]<p>&gt;And of the tools landscape, a Microsoft source said: &quot;The game is not over, but when we think of developer ecosystems other than Visual Studio we think Eclipse. We don&#x27;t think NetBeans.&quot;<p>Oh, snap!')
