Software is hard to get right - which is why aerospace software has traditionally faced much higher bars for verification than &#x27;traditional&#x27; software (and is much more expensive as a result!) The same is true of hardware, which I think many HN commentators forget; the cost of a bolt or connector that is aerospace-grade is typically many times that of a conventional or automotive-grade part, due mostly to extensive testing+verification required for safety.<p>Most of the scenarios you&#x27;re describing are dealt with in a few ways:<p>1. Building systems with sufficient margin to account for this kind of uncertainty; even with passively stable aircraft, these margins exist. Feedback control typically increases these margins.<p>2. Extensive verification under a wide range of input conditions; this is more challenging (how can you enumerate every possible failure condition?), but usually boils down to some kind of Monte-Carlo sampling or worst-case analysis when those cases can be identified. Here&#x27;s [0] a neat paper that does this in a more sample-efficient way.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1709.06645" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1709.06645</a>')
