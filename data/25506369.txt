I would express though that every time these skeletons happen, the whistleblowers and organizers don&#x27;t survive the trip: Everyone from the Google Walkout organization was retaliated against and were fired or pushed to quit.<p>Maven got cancelled, but Google now has a contract with ICE&#x2F;CBP&#x27;s &quot;virtual border wall&quot; program and is working on a big contract with Saudi Arabia, after, you know, meeting with the very same guy who had a journalist cut into pieces. Thousands of Googlers may have walked out before, but they walked back in, and haven&#x27;t walked out again, even though things are just as bad... or wose.<p>Timnit Gebru was immediately walked out for daring to question the ethics of Google&#x27;s large scale AI systems.
