I&#x27;d grab 20-50 cards to study from the top of the stack, work through them and repeat if needed. Then shift them to the back. The very easy ones (&quot;ser&quot; or &quot;ir&quot;, for example because they&#x27;re seen so much) would get moved out of the deck entirely, and only ever seen again for a full-deck review. New terms or concepts (conjugating for different tenses, for example) would go on top. I ended up with 1k cards in Latin over two semesters. Not sure how many for Spanish.')
