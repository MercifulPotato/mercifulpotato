Maybe they don&#x27;t KNOW know, in the sense of actually visiting a slaughter house and smelling the blood, but I&#x27;m sure most people know about animal shipments, tiny cages, and that gassing or slashing animals throats isn&#x27;t a picnic.\nPersonally I donate money to an animal protection program (probably don&#x27;t donate enough).
