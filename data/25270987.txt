Lambda billing for a month? What on earth does that say? 10 invocations running 15 minutes? 90,000 invocations running 100ms? (Those two are equivalent btw).<p>If I know my function takes around ~35ms ballpark, and I will probably invoke it 5,000 times per day, then I can calculate my monthly: 0.0000000021 $&#x2F;ms * 35ms * 5,000 * 30 = 0.011 $&#x2F;month.<p>AWS usually shows a neat example of usecase and what the billing would be on their pricing pages.')
