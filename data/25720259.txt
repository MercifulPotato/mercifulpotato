Item(by='rkagerer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610314949, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25714093, text='Educational settings are one of the worst places where insidious terms crop up.  You often simply don&#x27;t have a choice.<p>I&#x27;m a volunteer firefighter and was registered by my department to take a course with a government-run institution to upgrade my certification.<p>A while back that institution began using Blackboard - a Netherlands company - for all learning materials, whose ToS [1] includes a clause where I must agree to <i>defend and indemnify</i> Blackboard <i>from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney&#x27;s fees) arising from</i> my <i>use of and access to</i> their product, as well as <i>any other party&#x27;s access and use</i> of the product with my username or password (which I contemplate could occur if Blackboard or the institution were to suffer a data breach).<p>To read the textbook (only available online) there was a similar ToS from yet another third party.  You can&#x27;t access any of the material without explicitly agreeing to both contracts.<p>I was uncomfortable with the clause.  For one, I didn&#x27;t understand why my interaction with my local government institution required me to indemnify two foreign companies with whom I have zero relation (and didn&#x27;t want any). \n Before &quot;cloud services&quot;, the institution would have contracted with the vendors themselves to buy the platform, then presented their <i>own</i> contract to me (which is the right way to do this, and which I&#x27;d be fine with).<p>I deferred accepting, and reached out to the institution to find out if there was some alternative way to obtain the materials (e.g. in hardcopy).  I spent months trying to find alternative arrangements, but the bottom line was nobody cared.<p>I showed it to a commercial lawyer in the department who agreed the clause is nonsensical and he expressed some choice words for the institution foisting this upon its students.<p>I give of my own time and volition do firefighting and rescue (and love doing so!).  Nobody was paying me to take this course.<p>In the end I wound up hitting the Accept button, with a deep feeling of having effectively been bullied into it.<p>Compared to some of the other ToS&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen out there this one was comparatively mild.  I can only imagine how parents must feel when such garbage finds its way into their kids&#x27; learning environments.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.blackboard.com&#x2F;Terms_of_Use" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.blackboard.com&#x2F;Terms_of_Use</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tosdr.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;service&#x2F;2230" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tosdr.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;service&#x2F;2230</a>')
