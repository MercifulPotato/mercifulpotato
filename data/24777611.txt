I went there at a &quot;busy&quot; time, so I had to queue for something like five minutes. This is in a city of about 1.9 million inhabitants.<p>Here&#x27;s a map of the results of the election: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wien.gv.at&#x2F;stadtplan&#x2F;grafik.aspx?lang=de-AT&amp;bookmark=yUnlRF9XqUXHotdGofg9Rv8d7h5lmnGmmkeu25v6MZj6Cg-b-b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wien.gv.at&#x2F;stadtplan&#x2F;grafik.aspx?lang=de-AT&amp;book...</a> . Ignore the colors, but each delineated area is one &quot;voting district&quot; (<i>Wahlsprengel</i>, not sure if there&#x27;s a better translation). Each of these &quot;districts&quot; corresponds to a separate ballot box (not a separate polling place; several districts usually have separate rooms at a shared polling place, typically a school). I can&#x27;t find data on how many districts there are in total, but each seems to correspond to about 500-1000 voters.')
