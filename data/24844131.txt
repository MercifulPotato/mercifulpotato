It doesn’t always. Programming computers has multiple levels of abstraction for solving different problems.<p>But there’s also this idea that the magical compiler does good enough abd there’s no reason to challenge the assembler. But there are programming problems where that is in fact essential.<p>It’s not a kissing contest. Writing great asm or C is as challenging as writing great css. But to be sure, knowing what your code actually requires hardware to do is really valuable. It matters and we don’t have abstraction in many cases to abstract that away totally.<p>It doesn’t hurt to have a good idea on how the machine works.')
