We very much know that we’ll be involved in a cat and mouse game with facial recognition companies over time. Our objective is to protect users from facial recognition today and going forward. Even if next year, for instance, a facial recognition company can develop tech that works on protected images posted this year, if we are able to advance our protection to match advances in facial recognition next year the user will still be protected in real time - which is what really matters. So in short - it likely won’t matter if&#x2F;when there are advances in facial recognition if we can keep up!')
