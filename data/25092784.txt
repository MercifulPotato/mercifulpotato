Assuming an uncorrupted chain of delivery between you and the manufacturer, if you&#x27;re running a vanilla AOSP, the only organization having root access is Google and you. Even with Samsung and other manufacturers, they are the only additional party whose packages have admin rights.<p>The situation is more nasty with devices bought&#x2F;leased from a carrier because these insist on preloading all kinds of crapware - which is why I would strictly recommend everyone to work out their own financing and buy a stock device independently from a carrier. Chances are it&#x27;s gonna be cheaper in the long run anyway.')
