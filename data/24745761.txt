At least it&#x27;s got tangible benefits and customers without harming a soul. GPT-3 can be and is likely already weaponised, it&#x27;s nice to see anyone out there using it for humble things rather than straight-up digital warfare.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m hoping we can finish some of Tolkien&#x27;s unpublished books (Please give me beta access OpenAI heh)<p><i>&gt; [...] GPT-3 can be and is likely already weaponised, it&#x27;s nice to see anyone out there using it for humble things rather than straight-up digital warfare.</i><p>Well, not that I necessarily agree with the decision (I&#x27;m undecided), but one point in favor of only giving access to the model via an API rather than releasing it, is that the use can be monitored and hopefully &quot;weaponization&quot; will be either noticed or detected[0].<p>It would be pretty interesting if OpenAI eventually provided an external &quot;ML API abuse monitoring&quot; service, but one problem I haven&#x27;t figured out a solution to is that when providing such a service, the goals of &quot;reducing harmful use&quot; and of &quot;slowing the arms race&quot;[1] (which are both valid goals) are somewhat opposed. I&#x27;m still thinking about that.[2]<p>[0] Using ML to detect harmful uses of an ML API would be a quite interesting research topic, and quite in line with OpenAI&#x27;s stated mission, but gathering the necessary data set for training purposes may require allowing harmful use of the API in the first place (though I have thought of a few ways to mitigate those risks and limit the actual harm).<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;810&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;810&#x2F;</a> is amusing, but misses the point. Spammers aren&#x27;t <i>just</i> attempting to evade filters, but also trying to accomplish their goal, so inadvertently training a bot capable of writing an apparently constructive comment that successfully sneaks a spam link through to be clicked on and&#x2F;or indexed isn&#x27;t exactly a win for the good guys.<p>[2] I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised in the least if a GAN-like social deception arms-race (especially since the same networks have to serve as both generator and discriminator) was the proximate cause of the Upper Paleolithic Revolution.')
