Not only because they recommend engaging content that may lead to addiction and waste of time, the most precious thing every human being has.<p>What is even worse such algorytms force creators to become part of this harmful scheme. Knowledge is the thing that is hurt also. It should be out there. For decades people learned how to explain complex things in an easy way. Because there is no other way we can as people evolve and learn.<p>But now these algorytms promote the opposite. People who have nothing to say, people who complicate simple stuff beyond imagination are paid for doing so.<p>On the other hand people who have something to say are bashed because they are not engaging enought, they don&#x27;t do videos that fit needs of video addicts. So they are not paid.<p>Such algorytms are the worst thing humand kind invented in last years. The devastating effect of these can be compared to drugs and gambling. It should be banned.')
