I got to try the Mouton last year; not the 89, but even with a more recent vintage, the difference was instantly obvious.<p>That tasting was blinder than most: during the Marathon du Medoc, where we sampled two dozen wines over the course of 26 miles, right at their chateaux. Many were fantastic, but even so, the Mouton stood out. And I didn&#x27;t realize until later which one it was: it was 20 miles in on a very hot day, and I was rather bleary-eyed by that point. I tasted it and my notes are quite clear how much I loved it, and only later synched my notes up with the wines along the course.')
