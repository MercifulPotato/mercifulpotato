Ma&#x27;s had always been wholly obsequious, in public at least.<p>I guessed that Ma&#x27;s spoke up for one of the reason&#x27;s I&#x27;ve done so in the past: Ma was <i>done</i> and decided to stop playing. He felt he finally had enough juice to make some kind of a power play. He felt that Truth and Duty were principles worth dying for.<p>Whatever the reason, I&#x27;m sure he now wishes he hadn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;ll be doubly surprised if Ma doesn&#x27;t have an exit strategy. Opting for that seaside villa and teaching poetry to local school kids.')
