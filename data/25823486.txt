The OpenAI team only trained one full-sized GPT-3, and conducted their hyperparameter sweep on significantly smaller models (see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2001.08361" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2001.08361</a>). The compute savings from not having to do the hyperparameter sweep are negligible and do not significantly change the feasibility of the project.')
