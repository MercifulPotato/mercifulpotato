You were just being very, very negative, and if you read any of my other comments I have a deep passion for the southern part of California extending down into Baja, California.<p>This state has <i>massive</i> problems that do come with its <i>massive</i> population and economy. But it is also a truly special place with a totally unique geography, a rich, diverse culture, a robust economy, and one of the best public university systems on the planet.<p>I hate it when people start on the &#x27;California is falling apart&#x27; train, because it&#x27;s not. The state has <i>massive</i> problems. Yes, I&#x27;ve walked alone south of Los Angeles street recently. I&#x27;ve seen the used needles scattered on the Gold Line tracks. But that is just one tiny part of what is a truly magical place. For all of that, there&#x27;s Joshua Tree, and Grand Central Market, and Lake Sabrina, and the quiet postwar bungalows of San Diego, and the Sutro Tower poking out of the fog, and Coronado island, and the Griffith Park Observatory, and the Broad, and Big Bear Lake, and Kelso Dunes, and Telescope Peak, and the French Laundry, and Pappy and Harriet&#x27;s.<p>California is falling apart in some places and booming in others. It&#x27;s a big &#x27;ol nuanced tapestry. That&#x27;s how it goes when you have 40 million neighbors. But, I wandered around downtown Palm Springs this morning, and lemme tell ya San Jacinto has never looked more gorgeous. I was in Oklahoma two weeks ago, and <i>man</i> the first thing I did when my plane landed back in California was remind myself how fortunate I am to live here.')
