News media already has serious problems that are generally ignored, go unrecognized, or become part of false partisan narratives. Indicating that <i>they</i> are to be trusted and this other class shouldn&#x27;t be might sound fine at first, but the fight will be at the line drawn between the two.<p>Will less popular media outlets be flagged as illegitimate? What if a site pushes a conspiracy theory that&#x27;s actually well-backed but is considered harmful by one of these companies? Even assuming good faith, look at the coronavirus filtering and compare it to what the &quot;trusted&quot; media sources and CDC were saying back in January and February regarding masks. If you were to independently say, &quot;hey, what they&#x27;re saying about mask efficacy doesn&#x27;t make much sense. Everyone should wear some kind of mouth covering just in case&quot;, would you be flagged as dangerous misinformation? Because that position would be correct and warranted but also fly in the face of the cited authorities and experts (who were curated in a biased way to begin with, ignoring Chinese scientists&#x27; recommendations and the experiences of East Asian countries with other pandemics). Remember, in January and February, those in the US and often EU were being told that masks didn&#x27;t really protect you, could even increase your risk, and to specifically not purchase and wear them. This was always an inconsistent narrative, of course, because the point of this misinformation was to reserve stock for healthcare professionals because masks do work and healthcare professionals needed them.<p>We need <i>better</i> systems for addressing misinformation than placing the burden on platforms who will inevitably work in their own interest and attempt to automate processes that should be manually (and expensively) done on an individual basis.')
