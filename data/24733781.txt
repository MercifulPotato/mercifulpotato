News media already has serious problems that are generally ignored, go unrecognized, or become part of false partisan narratives. Indicating that <i>they</i> are to be trusted and this other class shouldn&#x27;t be might sound fine at first, but the fight will be at the line drawn between the two.<p>Will less popular media outlets be flagged as illegitimate? What if a site pushes a conspiracy theory that&#x27;s actually well-backed but is considered harmful by one of these companies? Even assuming good faith, look at the coronavirus filtering and compare it to what the &quot;trusted&quot; media sources and CDC were saying back in January and February regarding masks. If you were to independently say, &quot;hey, what they&#x27;re saying about mask efficacy doesn&#x27;t make much sense. Everyone should wear some kind of mouth covering just in case&quot;, would you be flagged as dangerous misinformation? Because that position would be correct and warranted.<p>We need <i>better</i> systems for addressing misinformation than placing the burden on platforms who will inevitably work in their own interest and attempt to automate processes that should be manually (and expensively) done on an individual basis.')
