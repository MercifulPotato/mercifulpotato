Item(by='mlyle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611070482, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25832573, text='&gt; Child was left alone once(!!), peed and pooped itself. There was no evidence of harm caused to her at that moment.<p>&quot;On the wall beside the bed was a large area of damp in the wall and the wallpaper was coming away. There was a very strong and overpowering smell of urine and faeces in the room. I saw the child curled in an almost foetal position on the bed lying on a pillow. She sat up when we came into the room and she was holding an empty pink bottle. I went towards the child. She stood up and came towards me. I saw that her clothes were wet and that she was wearing a nappy that had fallen off between her legs. Once in a different room I could see the child&#x27;s clothes were wet and she was shivering. The strong smell was coming from her and it was clear that she had not been changed or cleaned all day. I removed the child&#x27;s nappy to find dried and fresh faeces. The nappy was so swollen with urine that the child was unable to walk properly. There was also dried faeces on the child&#x27;s body and her skin was soaked in urine that had leaked from her nappy and gone through her clothes.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a bit more than having just soiled oneself.  That&#x27;s many, many hours of neglect.<p>&gt; she was seen walking drunk on a street barefoot<p>Pushing the baby down the middle of the street at 1AM while severely intoxicated.<p>&gt; There are 2 more facts,<p>No... then the child was removed a whole year and a half later after attempts at parenting classes, etc, but where the mom continued to have police contact and the child showed developmental delays that were strongly suspected to be from neglect.')
