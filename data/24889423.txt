So gnome having an objection to these basically means wayland does not have them.  All the other wayland clients together are mostly background noise.<p>Stated from a programmer perspective, what I can count on being available.  What is the baseline?<p>Desktop linux is a mess compared to windows or OSX, with gnome&#x2F;KDE as major frameworks, and a ton of minor but still relevant frameworks.  The one thing they have in common, the one thing that makes GUI applications  work more or less together is X11.  Wayland causes a split here: yet another painfull technology reset that will probably cost us a decade before everyone has migrated.  Now if wayland itself is fractured between its major player and everybody else, there is a 3-way split.<p>It seems X11 will die, Gnome as 800 pound gorilla will dictate the technological baseline, hence end users will lose basic functionality after suffering trough wayland&#x27;s maturisation.<p>I can understand your frustration.  You&#x27;ve probably built something great, X11 seems a dead end, and I presume you can&#x27;t do much about Gnome.  But I&#x27;ll either have to live with this mess or run back to windows.  I&#x27;ve dealt with pulseaudio and systemd, and both were arrogant low-quality projects that took years to stabilize back to their original levels.  I can live without beeps on my desktop for a week, or the occasional service weirding out.  I can&#x27;t live with a usable UI.<p>Maybe you deal with climate change conservatives by demonstrating they still can get their groceries without their CO2 spewing SUV.')
