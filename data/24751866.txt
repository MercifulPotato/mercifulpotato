With that we can work out the math:<p>- If you add 1.0f to FLT_EPSILON then you get an exact result\n- If you add 1.0f to FLT_EPSILON * 0.5 then you get a number that cannot be represented and it will either round to 1.0 or 1.0+FLT_EPSILON\n- Similarly, if you add 0.5f to FLT_EPSILON * 0.25 then you get a number that cannot be represented and it will either round to 0.5 or to 0.5 + FLT_EPSILON * 0.5<p>With the default rounding mode that last calculation rounds to 0.5. There are a _lot_ of floats below FLT_EPSILON.')
