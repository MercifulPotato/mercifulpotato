I don&#x27;t understand why nobody mentions this, but the decision to ship a USB-C to lightning cable makes a lot of sense when you think about customer segments:<p>- People who are upgrading an old iphone will still have a USB-A to lightning cable from their old phone, so they can charge their new iphone using their old charger and old cable<p>- People upgrading from android probably already have a USB-C charger, so they can use the bundled USB-C to lighting cable to charge their new iphone<p>- People who want to buy a new USB-C charger can do so without also needing to buy a lightning cable to go with it. (The charger can also be used for charging an ipad or magsafe puck, so it makes sense not to include a cable with the charger.)<p>In short, by including the USB-C to lightning cable, almost everyone who buys an iphone 12 won&#x27;t <i>need</i> any new accessories with their new phone. (Unless you want faster charging or wireless charging and don&#x27;t have other USB-C bricks floating around.)')
