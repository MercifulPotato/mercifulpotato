The person was high functioning on the autism spectrum and had been taunted and mocked in school for being awkward, different, and unable to defend themselves socially. More importantly, the person also said their parents were socially ambitious and always vocally disappointed in them for not being part of the &quot;popular&quot; kids.<p>As an older teen, this person rebelled against their parents, smoked a lot of weed to self-medicate, but also had serious self-image problems and attempted suicide. Eventually got into programming and earned a decent living in a different country. But when I knew them as an adult, I always found them cranky, critical, and anxious. I later found out from an ex-partner that they were manipulative and needy, threatening to leave or even kill themselves when they didn&#x27;t get their way.<p>I was friends with this ex-partner who told me it looked like a mild case of borderline personality disorder: and the symptoms and actions seemed to fit. It&#x27;s often caused by childhood emotional trauma, leads to emotional abuse of others in vain attempt to get the affection they were missing as children (that&#x27;s a very rough summary). And it can lead to their own children missing the critical affection they need and thus perpetuate. And that made me think that perhaps this person&#x27;s parents were also emotionally abusive because of a similar situation. And I even wonder if borderline personality disorder isn&#x27;t a social comorbidity with autism spectrum, not medically related but a social situation that can happen more frequently.')
