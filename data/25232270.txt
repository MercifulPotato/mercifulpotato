It&#x27;s &quot;more a matter of nature than nurture&quot; after all. Someone could be lying to themselves. &quot;Conventional-minded people don&#x27;t like to think of themselves as conventional-minded. And in any case, it genuinely feels to them as if they make up their own minds about everything.&quot;\nDunning-Kruger and all. In fact, you can&#x27;t even trust the ne plus ultra: the conventional minded have to be curious in order to find out what the conventions are, no? But then, I&#x27;m being critical here, and feeding &quot;a firestorm of rage from the aggressively conventional-minded&quot;; I clearly show all of those poor qualities.<p>(I&#x27;m trying hard to figure out how &quot;One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally by most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs are. It&#x27;s hard to be a conformist if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re supposed to conform to&quot; <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> imply that ignorance is a virtue.)<p>I am a bit disappointed Paul doesn&#x27;t mention some of the downsides to independent thinking; he seems to regard it as an unalloyed good. &quot;Founders can delay the problem by making a conscious effort only to hire independent-minded people. Which of course also has the ancillary benefit that they have better ideas.&quot; The problem here is that those independent-minded people are going to want to see their ideas in action---even if those ideas disagree with those of the founder. (Hence unhappiness and the promotion of conventional thinking.)<p>(I notice that Paul picks out &quot;administrators&quot; and &quot;middle management&quot; as specifically conventional. I wonder if extending that to &quot;management&quot; would strain the cognitive dissonance of those readers he personally knows?)<p>I do like the fine distinction of &quot;Fastidiousness about truth doesn&#x27;t imply that an independent-minded person won&#x27;t be dishonest, but that he won&#x27;t be deluded. It&#x27;s sort of like the definition of a gentleman as someone who is never unintentionally rude.&quot; I certainly have always found it advantageous to prefer the presence of those who <i>know</i> they are lying.<p>[1] Unskeptical, indifferent to truth, herd-minded, humorless, and incurious, with poor thinking and poor ideas.')
