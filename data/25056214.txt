By his definitions, you can kind of strive for easiness but get complexity, and if you aim for simplicity it may be hard. His point is, that you&#x27;d much prefer simple-hard over something &#x27;easy&#x27; that leads to incidental complexity.<p>I feel like Go isn&#x27;t so much aiming for simlicity but actually for easiness in that line of thought, and thus its only a matter of time until complexity is encoded within the Go code.<p>Now, aiming for simplicity is not easy, at times definitely hard but it can lead to actual simplicity.<p>[</i>] obligatory note that while I like this talk I don&#x27;t agree with all of his utterances.')
