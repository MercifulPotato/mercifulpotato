This type of extreme claim makes me <i>even more</i> skeptical than I already was of such a short overview. Each of the topics listed could easily fill 100 pages themselves...<p>All <i>who</i> needs to know? Hopefully not anyone actually using this in their job. Maybe it would be a useful reference for the definition of the term, but it&#x27;s completely wild to suggest you&#x27;ll have <i>any</i> understanding of SVM, NN, CV, <i>or</i> gradient descent after only 100 pages, much less all of them...')
