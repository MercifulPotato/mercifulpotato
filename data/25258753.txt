This takes a bit away from the super-efficient design they have currently.<p>The RAM isn&#x27;t on the SOC, it&#x27;s soldered on the package, which is a very different proposition. Possibly so they don&#x27;t have to bother routing on the board (meaning they can shrink the board further), and can cool the RAM at the same time as the SoC (without the need for a wider cooler base).<p>The PS5 also has unified memory and uses faster RAM, the RAM chips are soldered on the board around the SoC.')
