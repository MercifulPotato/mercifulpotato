I was mostly excited about a big camera upgrade, and there are definitely some big improvements from what I have been using. But I&#x27;m not 100% sure if I&#x27;m going to keep it. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m blown away enough for just shy of CDN $2,000.

I know the regular 12 and mini have a polished back, and the mini looks like a good option for me except for the fact that I&#x27;d be losing the 2x lens. If I have two lenses, I&#x27;d rather have the wide and 2x of my X than a wide and ultra-wide that the 12 and 11 before it have.')
