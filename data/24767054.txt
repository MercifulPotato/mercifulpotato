In summer, it&#x27;s very bike friendly. There&#x27;s a bunch of lakes throughout Minneapolis and St. Paul. Mill City Museum is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever been too, and there&#x27;s a ton of theatre all around.<p>Sure, winter gets cold, but it&#x27;s easier to handle on the cities where downtowns have pedestrian subways, and the city clears the snow. Plus there are events like Luminary Loppet.<p>Sure, the summer is humid, but lots of folks have basements. And offices have AC. And the lakes are still cold once you get more than two feet down.<p>The only things it really needs are mountains and ocean nearby. Even then, it&#x27;s got some excellent areas nearby')
