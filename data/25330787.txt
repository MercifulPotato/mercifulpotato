I never worked anywhere where people did. People drink beer for a buzz. I also have a beer at work on a Friday if I&#x27;m in the office but no work is getting done after it. I especially disagree that it is relaxing to have a beer at lunch and then go back to work and unless you are planning on doing nothing for the rest of the day.')
