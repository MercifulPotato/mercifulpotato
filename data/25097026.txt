Item(by='twblalock', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605401040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25095575, text='&gt; You joke, but the past year shows something like a zombie apocalypse is a possibility.<p>For me the past year shows that the economy has been more resilient than most people expected, that the Fed is willing to drop rates to zero in order to keep it that way, and that the stock market actually goes up when that happens because it is the only investment that might return more than a fraction of a percent.<p>If you are going to keep that much in cash, I might suggest putting some of it in inflation-protected securities like I-bonds. They are backed by the US government, and I can&#x27;t forsee a situation where the government could default on them without the value of the dollar also tanking. They are better protected from inflation than money in a savings account.')
