Some brands have this problem - and it sucks. Ex: if writing quickly in a pocket moleskine, close it, and then open to find lifting on the other page.<p>For #2, most pens dropped on their head distorts the roller ball action. I&#x27;ve lost a few pens to this problem.<p>#3 some pens I&#x27;ve had in this list will not last the whole way through - either the ball rolls too much ink, or jams over the lifetime, rendering the remaining experience less than ideal.<p>I&#x27;ve been journaling for a few years, daily, and always carried a roller pen of various brands.
