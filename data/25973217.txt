Item(by='robocat', descendants=None, kids=[25975673, 25974646], score=None, time=1612042347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25972103, text='&gt; The only difference between a UBI and a negative income tax is framing.<p>No way.<p>Taxation requires benefit systems for those that are not working (unemployment, disability, maternity etc). UBI simplifies benefit systems, administratively and for the needy. The social outcomes for benefits are entirely different from what a UBI would bring.<p>Taxation is chunky (per year) and delayed (processing delays). There are heaps of corner cases of employment and salary changes during the year that might be equivalent over periods of many many months, but where a weekly UBI payment would make a huge difference to you if you were poor or unfortunate.<p>Taxation has more scope for fraud so requires much more overhead for prevention. A UBI is simple to manage - the things you need to detect are far more limited and are more easily checked and less invasively checked.<p>Disclaimer: I am not a UBI fan: I am just arguing against your point because it is so egregiously incorrect.')
