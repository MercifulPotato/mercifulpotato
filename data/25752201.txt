You can still use FB and not listen to persons X, Y and Z. It&#x27;s all posted by users, and users decide what to follow or read (except paid content). Not like TV Stations and Newspapers. That&#x27;s what Social Media companies have been telling us for a while!<p>But if we want apply usual standards of platform rights and responsibilities to FB, we should then require it to also be responsible for what&#x27;s posted there.<p>You can&#x27;t have it both ways.')
