If there IS a deal that appeals to me, it&#x27;s well hidden and I cannot find it.<p>It feels like in this day and age, a 3rd year ComSci student with Python knowledge and few open source libraries should be able to fill up my cart :P<p>So why don&#x27;t I (or any of my friends - they all seem to share the perspective) have more luck with Prime day? Is it a business decision of some sort?<p>More broadly, for all the incredible privacy-invading technologically-ingenious, morally-dubious tracking and advertising, why don&#x27;t I get exposed to things I actually <i>want</i> - why does so much effort get put into something with so little seeming business value? What am I as a consumer missing in this whole analytics&#x2F;advertising ecosystem? :-&#x2F;')
