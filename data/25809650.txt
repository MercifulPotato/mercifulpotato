Perhaps the mediocre writers have an advantage if they have relations. No doubt a lot of awfully bad books are being published every year, and some even are successful.<p>I used to think about this, &quot;only people with relations can make it&quot;. When I got older I realized that if you care about some subject, you will probably end up making relevant connections on the way.<p>And I also think this way of thinking about privilege is self-defeating. If you don&#x27;t have &quot;privilege X&quot;, find another way.<p>Some writers now got rich without ever having an agent, self-publishing.<p>I&#x27;m sure people will find some other alleged privilege they had, which allowed them to do that. That&#x27;s not the point.<p>If you are dead poor and have no connections whatsoever, you have the &quot;privilege&quot; to write authentically about being poor.')
