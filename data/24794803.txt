I generally look at this as the legislature abdicating its authority.  The excuse is that its actually delegation to experts that actually have to enforce the rules.<p>This is why it is so important to read the Federal Register and push the folks in the Senate and House to specify rules on important bills to give the executive branch as little wiggle room as possible (this advice should apply to all parties).')
