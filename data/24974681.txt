My own observation is that much like the rest of the rest of the populace, it&#x27;s a spectrum. I have talked to <i>many</i> SFO folks looking to move out of there specifically because they want to be somewhere &#x27;conservative&#x27;, usually using more colorful language.<p>And I also have some doubts about the whole &#x27;techies are going to come here and take over&#x27; trope.  Sure, they will influence things (money always does), but entrenched political and social structures don&#x27;t just melt away overnight.  They know the rules of the game because they made them.  I live in a pretty lefty area that&#x27;s also pretty desirable to live in, and periodically you&#x27;ll get an influx of individuals from other places that make noise about some aspect of the area that isn&#x27;t conservative enough for them (taxation, commonly) and how they&#x27;re going to change things.  And the incumbent political actors spin up and work the system and it usually goes nowhere.  I suspect you&#x27;ll see much more of that than radical changes brought on by the arrival of tech money.')
