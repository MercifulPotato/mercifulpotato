Item(by='ElectronShak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606380901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25218061, text='&gt; The obvious question is: why? Why was it ever necessary, if God is omnipotent?<p>To answer this, God is a just God. If the penalty of sin is death, then surely someone had to die to pay the price. God could have just swept all mankind&#x27;s sins under the rag, and acted like nothing ever happened. But such would not be considered integrity or righteousness on God&#x27;s part.<p>Also if by one man (Adam), sin came into the world, and all men were considered sinners, then justly, by one man (Jesus Christ)&#x27;s death and resurrection, the price was fully paid, all men (mankind) can now freely claim the gift of righteousness.<p>&gt;Why was it so late, so that people living earlier had no chance?<p>Well just like you stated, God is omnipotent, and not limited by time and space. It&#x27;s never late or early in God&#x27;s eyes. We would not explicitly say they had no chance, then or now, goes back to God being Just.')
