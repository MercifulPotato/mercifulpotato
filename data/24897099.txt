For example, the judicial and prison system. Black people aren&#x27;t incarcerated at such a high rate [1] because the judicial system and the police are full of KKK members or anything. It&#x27;s due to a bunch of systemic problems and America&#x27;s history of racism and slavery. It&#x27;s a result of when America was clearly straight-forwardly racist. Like when black people couldn&#x27;t buy houses in white neighborhoods. Now they have on average 10x less wealth than the average white family [2] and have access to worse schools, etc. This of course will lead more black people to turn to crime, because they have less good options, because they are on average, poorer and less educated. All the old laws and our history going back to slavery still has effects today that are compounding and allow the problem to continue to exist.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prisonpolicy.org&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;raceinc.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prisonpolicy.org&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;raceinc.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;racial-wealth-gap-costs-economy-1-5-trillion-dollars-report-finds&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;racial-wealth-gap-costs-economy...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;unequal-opportunity-race-and-education&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;unequal-opportunity-race-...</a>')
