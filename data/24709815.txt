Now turn the paper around so the word faces away from you. Hold it up to a light and you can see that the word is now flipped horizontally. Now face a mirror: the image is projected onto the mirror with no change, so you see the exact same thing you saw when it held it up the light.<p>IOW the mirror is inessential. We can ask the same question about just a transparent piece of paper.')
