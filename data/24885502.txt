Item(by='oefrha', descendants=None, kids=[24885742], score=None, time=1603625930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24885235, text='&gt; China has extremely strict anti-scraping laws<p>It might be the case, but the repo you linked doesn&#x27;t support that claim very well, and the cases cited are largely irrelevant to the case at hand.<p>&quot;Forbidden area #1: providing scraping-related services to criminal organizations&quot;. Three cases listed. The first is one programmer&#x27;s personal account of being arrested, which is very scant on why; the only info I can glean: &quot;I developed some sort of ML API which is then used by a criminal enterprise against some influential company for god knows what purpose&quot;. Hard to draw any conclusion from that. The second case is ML-based CAPTCHA bypass for credential stuffing against Tencent QQ, emphasis on credential stuffing. The third case is some sort of black hat SEO campaign against Baidu, the scraping part (if any?) doesn&#x27;t seem central to the conviction.<p>&quot;Forbidden area #2: scraping and sale of personal info&quot;. Common sense, irrelevant.<p>&quot;Forbidden area #3: commercial use of unlicensed business data&quot; and the following untitled category list three cases, all of which are mass scraping operations either from a business competitor or that seriously affects site operations (through aggressive scraping).<p>AFAIK there are a lot of low hanging fruits in the Chinese piracy scene not yet targeted, and there are enough small-time <i>commercial operations</i> involving copyrighted media products begging to be taken down, it&#x27;s highly unlikely anyone will bother to target some high-barrier-of-entry tool mostly facilitating the download of otherwise public videos.')
