The reason high paying tech companies go international is because their US recruitment funnel is drying up to the point where it&#x27;s cost-effective to recruit internationally even with the increased overhead. They&#x27;re not underpaying visa holders, they&#x27;re using them to avoid increasing domestic wages even higher or lowering their hiring standards, which are different things altogether.')
