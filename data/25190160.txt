And the latter so-called &quot;lifted out of poverty&quot; (a oftenly used propaganda tune in Chinese spokesmen to refute others&#x27; human rights infringement blame) is nothing but opening up the nation and letting our hardworking people to make products for the world (mostly in downstream application wise products, even nowadays, you see huge Chinese tech companies all cannot live w&#x2F;o Github, btw, that&#x27;s why government doesn&#x27;t block github). Which is seen by me just recovering those years we had losing in politics and culture revolution.')
