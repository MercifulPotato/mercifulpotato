My keyboard just sits on my lap.<p>I&#x27;ve always found office chairs hideously uncomfortable, so it&#x27;s been pretty great. The key seems to have been getting my reclining posture to be almost neutral, with my head up a bit. My monitor sits on the corner of the table so it&#x27;s almost directly in my sight-line.<p>Because my body is totally relaxed I don&#x27;t get the discomfort or tightness of sitting upright for extended periods. I have to remember to get up and move around regularly though, because there&#x27;s no discomfort trigger.')
