Maybe some sort of buy-out conversion from private landlords to private-benefit-corporation landlord (as opposed to public housing).<p>The alternative is localized rent control, that makes sure that the landlords don&#x27;t capture the rising value of the neighborhood that is being added by the residents and their work. You also need some limits on redevelopment, so the landlord doesn&#x27;t just replace the building with something more upscale and manage to replace the tenants as part of that. Maybe allow refurbishing and some new units in exchange for current residents getting rent control.')
