Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=[25169109], score=None, time=1605914765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25164342, text='Yes, the type signature for JSON.parse() isn&#x27;t inferred&#x2F;deduced, it&#x27;s explicit in lib.es5.d.ts (imported from lib.d.ts):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;lib.es5.d.ts#L1059" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;lib&#x2F;lib....</a><p>You could provide your own lib.d.ts with `unknown` type returned for JSON.parse. I&#x27;m almost surprised there isn&#x27;t a standard stricter lib.d.ts, though I suppose that linters fill enough of those needs with their rulesets.<p>Looking at GitHub issues surrounding it, it doesn&#x27;t appear that there has been an explicit ask to switch the type signature to use `unknown`, probably the next closest was this one, where `unknown` is mentioned in a comment as a possibility but the comment is not addressed in follow up discussion: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;issues&#x2F;26993" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;issues&#x2F;26993</a><p>It would be a big breaking change though at this point, so they would probably be hesitant to do so. I thought I saw somewhere there was a proposal to add it as a compiler flag to treat all uses of `any` in lib.d.ts as `unknown`, but I have no idea what happened to that proposal and quick searches don&#x27;t turn up anything.')
