It&#x27;s not the same thing as a delimited continuation (is it?) but it&#x27;s close enough for my purposes.<p>Normally, you just want functions, but sometimes, you want coroutines. Normally, one-shot coroutines are fine, but sometimes you want multi-shot. I have never once felt like a full-blown continuation was the construct I was missing.')
