These aren&#x27;t just 2 companies, these are two companies who are competitors with each other in many fields. These are two companies who pay very large salaries to hold on to talent in order for their competitors to not hire them, and this situation is only possible due to the current situation around &quot;work from home&quot;.<p>As someone who works remote even outside of a pandemic, I would be worried that stories and potential situations like this will be a point in the &quot;we require all employees to be back in the office&quot; column. This employee taking advantage of work-from-home in order to violate a non-compete (which I am sure exists in their contract) puts a bad look on every one else.')
