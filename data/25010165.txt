You&#x27;re falling prey to savior complex, so instead you should &quot;Get out and get powerful and come back to be a hero&quot; Translation: Go make fuck you money and then change what you independently determine is important. \nYou&#x27;re wrong, because you&#x27;ll have no idea what barbells to move when you come back, you&#x27;ll just throw them around without purpose, like a meathead in a gym. Even so, not many people can move  a 500lb barbell by themselves, but you get a few people around you you can trust, and 500lbs is pretty light. Much lighter if y&#x27;all can work together to break it down and take some weight off the bar before you move it, too. \nYou go away and get powerful, make some fuck you money, sure, you can buy a few houses, or support a policy or something, be a savior. You can toss a few barbells around with ease. \nBut if there&#x27;s no buy in from others who trust and understand your motives, your effort will die. You might get your name in the record books for the barbells you threw, but there wont be lasting impact.')
