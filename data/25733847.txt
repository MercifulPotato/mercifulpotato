My point is that you can&#x27;t expect the compiler to do everything for you in terms of creating a stable ABI for shared libraries.  I think a lot of people are under the impression that this is purely a compiler feature.<p>What I expect to happen is that rather than &quot;Rust gets a stable ABI&quot; it will be &quot;Rust very gradually builds upon the C ABI for selected features&quot;.<p>Most C++ libraries have templates in their signatures these days for efficiency, and Rust has a similar flavor.  I think there is a fundamental tradeoff there between stability and performance, and both languages have a heavy emphasis on the latter.  I could be missing something as I certainly don&#x27;t know all the details of the C++ ABI.')
