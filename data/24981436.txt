GPUs have huge latencies on VRAM, but are fed by GDDR6 or HBM2 at 1TBps at relatively cheap prices. There&#x27;s no comparison with bandwidth.<p>NVidia NVLink is 300GBps GPU-to-GPU communications. In contrast, AMD EPYC is 50GBps CCX-to-CCX communications. Once again, there&#x27;s no comparison with bandwidth, the GPUs simply win.<p>GPU-to-GPU is wider than CPU-to-CPU. VRAM-to-GPU is wider than RAM-to-CPU.<p>-------<p>If you have a problem that cares more about bandwidth than latency, then GPUs are simply the best architecture. Period. The pure compute performance is paired with absurdly huge bandwidth numbers.<p>Most consumer problems are latency-bound. HPC however, is specifically programmed to be bandwidth-bound instead. It takes effort and optimization to get there however.')
