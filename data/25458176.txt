If you&#x27;re using it to detect new login locations or new devices as a security alerting thing, then I think you can make a strong enough claim that this is essential. (Again, not a lawyer, this is not legal advice.)<p>What if a PM wants to look in these logs for how many unique users show up in each country? That&#x27;s pretty squarely on the side of analytics, and is probably not essential.<p>But... muddying the waters more, what about if an engineer wants to query unique users to figure out how many more racks of servers to buy? I have no idea. I&#x27;d be asking a lawyer.')
