You&#x27;ve allowed his comment, which I&#x27;m sure multiple people flagged, stating this, to stick:<p>&gt; I am beyond tired of people making excuses for public threats of violence from authoritarian right-wing actors. It isn&#x27;t helpful to any discourse to pretend words don&#x27;t mean what they mean anymore.<p>Fuck you, dang. Go ahead and ban me. You&#x27;re a really fucking shitty moderator, and you allow fucking garbage political threads like this to go with one-sided, bad faith, bullying trash from people like AaronFriel. But, OOOH GOTCHA ISOSKELES, YOU SAID &quot;LYING&quot; WHEN MAYBE HE JUST DIDN&#x27;T KNOW. Fuck you. And fuck Hacker News.')
