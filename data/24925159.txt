I accept Wayland brings benefits for some people, but I couldn&#x27;t care less. Since I don&#x27;t care about the benefits it brings, it needs to be entirely painless.\nUntil the switch is more painless than holding on to Xorg, there will be a good chunk of users with no incentive to make the move.</i><p>That depends a lot on how difficult it is to keep Xorg working with modern distros. You might get forced into Wayland when your favourite distro and all acceptable alternatives don’t want to put the work into integrating and patching an aging Xorg.<p>Whether it’s with a carrot or a stick, you’re going to Wayland sooner or later.')
