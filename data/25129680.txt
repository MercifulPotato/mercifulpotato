I can hardly imagine a smaller burden to place on a person than to compel them to wear a mask, and yet look at the endless bickering it&#x27;s caused. The idea that the people protesting mask mandates would find this tax more palatable seems completely implausible.<p>The whole idea about taxing away undesirable behavior is fine in general I guess, but if you think of the major effect as reducing the R0 of the virus, then why not just go further and make a full mask mandate? The smoking thing for example might have secondary effects, but not the way a &#x2F;virus&#x2F; does. Is there no burden so small, no benefit to society so large, as to justify a mandate?')
