We agree that this is creating even worse problems.<p>There, we are on the same page.<p>A good historical example I brought up few weeks ago somewhere on HN.<p>A shameful truth from NSDAP days Germans did not come to admit even to this day is why Kristallnacht has happened.<p>The prime majority of Germans were not antisemites in thirties, and not even in forties. The image of the schizophrenoidâ€”paranoid antisemite was completely uncharacteristic for anybody, but for single digit percentage of fanatics not unlike the current rightist crowd in America.<p>So, if most Germans did not drink the NSDAP coolaid, why did Kristallnacht happen?<p>It happened not because of Jewish people being Jewish as such. It happened because of Jewish people being rich (or being deemed so,) and NSDAP effectively promising complete impunity for looting.')
