Everybody does that in multiple parallel projects, operated in different capacities with people of varying competency.<p>Any “storytelling” about single agency or project or a person is incomplete almost to the point of being misleading&#x2F;disinformational. The legacy of ashes is one such example.<p>Does it mean one shouldn’t be (allowed) telling those stories? Certainly not. But without actively and profusely apologizing and warning that the story is definitely incomplete and almost certainly incorrect without proper context, which often is unknowable - the value to the consumer is negative.<p>The producer knowingly or not is acting as a propaganda actor for one or many competing agencies.')
