Its like paying a restaurant not to harass you...<p>This level of entitlement is just staggering. You can pay for YouTube in two ways; watch adds or pay for add free.<p>Now, I get that the price for watching adds right now is too high. It simply ruins most content. But your metaphors are still just way out there.<p>In reality there are now 3 &quot;tiers&quot;.\n- Premium. Pay with money.\n- Get a free taste. Choose if you want it.\n- Unwatchable content.<p>I don&#x27;t think that is going to work out for YouTube in the long run. But shaming people for being willing to pay for actual loads and loads of quality content is not constructive.<p>On the other hand, I _am_ glad if this means that random, prudish advertising companies will hold less sway over YouTube at some point in the future, where subscriptions make up a bigger part of the revenue.')
