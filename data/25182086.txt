Item(by='bigiain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606087888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25181180, text='&gt;  When setting up your first lemonade stand, you learn that you should set prices at the sum of costs for goods, labor, and overhead, plus a profit margin, hoping that the output of your manufacture delivers more value to your customers than that sum.<p>That&#x27;s kinda opposite of a lot of (good) HN advice about pricing.<p>Here, we (mostly) agree that you set your prices to capture as much of the value you&#x27;re providing to the customer as you can, not some simple markup on your costs. If the customer gets 10k&#x2F;month value from your startup, of course you don&#x27;t price it at $1k - even if it only costs you $500 to provide it.<p>If I had been running a lemonade stand on the island where Fyre Festival was failing to eventual, you can be sure my pricing would have been regarded as predatory and obscene to all the &quot;cost plus a profit margin&quot; folks.<p>I reckon the big error here - is tradition wholesale and retail chain ignoring the fact that geographic market segmentation is rapidly disappearing for many things. Shimano think they can gatekeep their markets, and sort-of can at retailer level using distributor contracts. But they totally can&#x27;t stop consumers buying online from wherever it&#x27;s cheapest, and that includes dark shift and&#x2F;or knockoffs from AliExpress et al. Shimano will slowly kill their distributor network, who&#x27;ll go broke or give up stocking Shimano as more and more consumers use them as a showroom and then go buy parts&#x2F;bikes online. That&#x27;ll happen more or less slowly depending on Shimano&#x27;s brand strength, but the smaller and less discounted distributors will go (or skirt the wholesalers) first, and sooner or later the only place to see a Shimano bike will be a few major specialist bicycle retailers or on late night TV watching the Tour De France.')
