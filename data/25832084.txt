The current way of showing threads by default is untenable because some programs launch hundreds of threads, making it hard to get an overview of a system unless you make the terminal size very large.<p>I appreciate the author wanting users to discover a program running amok and producing a bunch of threads (anecdote: I&#x27;ve never seen it happen), but there&#x27;s a bunch of ways to solve it from a UX perspective:<p>* make threads collapsed by default<p>* add a column showing the number of threads a process has<p>* add the threads toggle to the bottom bar for easy discovery<p>* add a prefix to all threads, e.g. [THREAD]<p>All of these are a lot more obvious than the color green.<p>The authors story of having users ask him why processes are green is simply an indication that the user interface is hard to understand.')
