In one of the labs I rotated in, the PI (pre-tenure professor) still had a lab bay filled with the most impressive display of reagents I&#x27;ve ever seen (he was a physical chemist).  He would go over, look at it sadly, and then disappear into his office to write grants all day.  What a waste of talent.')
