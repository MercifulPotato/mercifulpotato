Like not telling someone, who just &#x27;drooped&#x27; garbage that they just &#x27;drooped&#x27; garbage. It is 100 times harder when it is your partner.<p>Now we don&#x27;t have any secrets between each other anymore. But that was a long long way and not easy.<p>Now imagine a Relationship which wouldn&#x27;t do that. You can easily start living next to each other over a longer period of time and then suddenly you realize that you crossed that border.')
