It&#x27;s designed for questions of manufacturing or cost of living.<p>China has a high PPP GDP simply because it has hundreds of millions of people living in some form of poverty, which drives down costs locally.  Clearly if the driver of your high PPP GDP is a massive underclass living in poverty, you can&#x27;t turn around and use that as an argument in support of your economic might -- it&#x27;s incoherent.')
