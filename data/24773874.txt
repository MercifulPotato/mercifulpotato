They think I will gladly hand over large amounts of money for a phone that is highly inconvenient to unlock.<p>When it became clear that people around the world were being legally required to cover their face, in some places at any time they left the house, Apple should have raced to equip the next iPhone with a fingerprint scanner. Apple didn&#x27;t even apologise for not including one. I <i>would</i> have bought the phone with that feature. Maybe next year.')
