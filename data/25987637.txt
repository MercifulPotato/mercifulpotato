Trump&#x27;s own legal team were so clear they had no credible evidence that their court cases never even alleged any fraud. Why not?<p>I&#x27;ve still yet to hear a coherent reason why Trump is even alleging such massive fraud. I&#x27;ll do without proof even, I understand something can be true or strongly suspected without proof, but you need a reason to suspect it right? Some initial concern or reason for thinking there might be fraud on the scale of millions of votes across numerous states in this particular election. Including states in which Republican appointed election officials supported and certified the results. Honest question, what is it? To my knowledge Trump has never given one. I&#x27;d love to know.<p>For conservatives like myself outside America that view the Republican party as our natural political allies, it&#x27;s desperately sad. Fortunately there are responsible Republicans standing up for the Democratic process, but so few. We&#x27;re going to be dealing with the corrosive effect of this on democratic processes across the world for many years to come.')
