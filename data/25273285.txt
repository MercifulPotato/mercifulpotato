So please do not underestimate the efforts.<p>&gt; If you think this doesn&#x27;t also apply to your physical racks in datacenters<p>Self-hosted means more than just datacenters, can be within office or home. So it&#x27;s not easy to shut. Also there are numerous examples of aws account suspended with all services blocked just based on one sided terms of service not even a legal notice requirement.<p>As I said earlier most people trade freedom for convenience and that&#x27;s what cloud service is. Its not freedom but slavery to convenience.<p>&gt; stick to running instances<p>What&#x27;s running is not the question here, but freedom and ownership.<p>Here its still an issue of who owns the resources and data within those resources. Buried within terms of service and agreement its the cloud provider who is a judge, jury and executioner.<p>&gt;  With a warrant, the authorities will come and take your shit.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to get a warrant from a court for a legitimate business to confiscate their resources (bar is just too high) vs a notice via an email to a cloud provider for perceived infringment (indeed most cloud provider have dedicated contacts for government notices and implementation, given they also provide services to government agencies). Also targeting individual self-hosted infrastructure is very costly. Examples you are presenting are just to create FUD, majority of the self-hosted infrastructure in the world is for legitimate purpose and true freedom.')
