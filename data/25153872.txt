If someone is confused about how to interpret sin^2(x) vs sin^{-1}(x), there&#x27;s no amount of &quot;understanding&quot; that&#x27;s going to help them (it really is just idiosyncratic, inconsistent notation), but a checklist like the article might clue them in.<p>I think students often underestimate what &quot;understand&quot; means in a math class. The progression you&#x27;re describing (&quot;the first couple of semesters are foundational...&quot;) is definitely not universal in US undergrad programs, though. There&#x27;s just not that much coordination between professors.')
