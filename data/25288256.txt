The market say &quot;I want to buy power a certain amount between specific hours at a specific date&quot; and the power operation can say &quot;I will obligate to supply that energy at that time and date at this price&quot;. Batteries could at any time jump in and bid below that of any current bidders.<p>In that aspect we already have variable pricing. Individual customers usually don&#x27;t see this, but I suspect the primary reason has more to do with averaging out the cost over time and not exposing individuals to the internal details of the energy market.')
