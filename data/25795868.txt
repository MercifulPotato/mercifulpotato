As it stands, teachers unions keep <i>terrible</i> teachers employed, against the interest of the students, while the students have no real representation or organization to provide balance by looking after student interests.<p>My mother was a middleschool teacher when I was in highschool, and drove me to highschool in the morning.  Because she was a teacher, she had to get there before the school obstensibly opened, which wasn&#x27;t a problem for me or my brothers because the administration of the highschool was reasonable and let us sit quietly in the office until the school opened.  A handful of other kids had this arrangement too.  It worked fine until my junior year, when the teachers union decided to throw a hissy fit.  The result of that was all students being made to stand outside in the cold until the school was officially open.  The teachers Union said that allowing students into the building before school hours unfairly saddled them with more labor... never mind that we were all quietly sitting in the office receiving compliments from the secretaries for being well behaved.')
