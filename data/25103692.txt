This will give time to create the needed charging points and to implement price regulation to eliminate the rampant price gouging at many places.\nThey will also need to implement a progressive ramping up annual licence for  gas&#x2F;diesel cars that will prevent the emergence of an enduring repair and maintain the gas&#x2F;diesel cars - without which repairs could keep them going for another 20-30 years - which will gut the process.\nThat said, there should be a path for converting a ~5 year old otherwise good car, via the e-skate conversion process so someone can convert their great gas&#x2F;diesel Mercedes into a reasonable e-car.\nIt can and should be done.')
