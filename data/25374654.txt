Not all know differences between linked lists and arrays and if they know what a breakpoint is they are hired.<p>Now, imagine giving the people environment that imposes no structure on your project and gives hyper powerful tools like macros and you are in a big problem.<p>At least with Java you get Spring and this is how you do endpoint, this is how you connect to the database, and so on. The structure is suboptimal and redundant but at least they are getting <i>some</i> guidance which are most likely already familiar with.<p>In Clojure, as a lead of the project, you would have to do the same but now it would be up to you to define all of that guidance. The question is, are you better at this than entire organization that supports Spring?<p>The only situation I see where Clojure would realistically be beneficial is when you only get like world class developers who know what they are doing and can work together.<p>I can&#x27;t work on a Clojure project with a person that is unable to go through something like Let over Lambda with full understanding of the code examples and trust they will be able to make good decisions when building abstractions with macros.')
