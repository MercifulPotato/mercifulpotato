Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608583102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25499188, text='&gt; Here&#x27;s one idea: Cap the amount that all student loans can collect at something like 15% of taxable income, for max 20 years after signing. After that they are written off.<p>Make it the 10% of discretionary (not gross), and up the limit to 25 years of any of the loans covered graduate or professional study, and you&#x27;d have an existing option for current federal student loans.<p>Make this the only option for federal loans, remove private loans from the protection against bankruptcy discharge, and you the job is done.<p>&gt; But let the lenders see everything -- school, major, test scores.<p>Private lenders can, AFAIK, already put terms like this in contracts if they want.')
