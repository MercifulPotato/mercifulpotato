They use the Patterson + Hennessey book that many other large universities seem to use. That class was one of the ones that took me the longest since the only background I had was going through the nand to tetris book a few years before.<p>Definitely no compilers or linear algebra though. Personally, I plan on going through some self-study of those topics at some point or another, but I&#x27;ve had a hard time prioritizing them over what seems like more relevant material to the area I&#x27;ve been working in (full stack web dev).')
