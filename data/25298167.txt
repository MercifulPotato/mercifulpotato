It&#x27;s really cool stuff, kudos!<p>We are currently writing an application where we already have auth set up using AWS Cognito. I haven&#x27;t been able to find any documentation about it, but is it possible for us to keep using Cognito while still integrating with Supabase and taking advantage of the <i>very</i> nice row level security features, or would we essentially have to roll over to use Supabase for auth as well?<p>Also, let me just say that it&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> selling point for us that you&#x27;re running with Postgres, thank you!')
