Assuming that a macbook won’t be used in extreme condition is just normal engineering scoping.\nYou aren’t chilling on the balcony in underwear, are you? Well of course not because your body, even raised in a cold climate, needs to keep itself at 37°C. Your macbook too need to keep warm, and it cannot use its muscle when the CPU is not heating enough.\nBut, hey, maybe you just got a good business plan ! Design a macbook parka to sell to your fellow countrymen.')
