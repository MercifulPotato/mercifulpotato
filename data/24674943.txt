For many CLI applications, arguments parsing and (relevant) help are their primary UI. It absolutely makes sense for larger applications to put a lot of effort into making the experience as painless as possible.<p>Of course if an application just has a few simple args then it may not be worth it. But for something like, for example, ripgrep[0] you&#x27;ll want something that produces nice help and context sensitive error messages to help the user find the commands they want.<p>In short, a good UI can be a complex beast even if it&#x27;s only a text interface.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;ripgrep" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;ripgrep</a>')
