Often the server that runs on localhost is poorly secured and may even expose &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *&quot; headers. And even if it doesn&#x27;t, the browser still has to run a request to find out whether such a header is present, so some attacker controlled data does end up in these services. This in turn can be used for attacks.<p>Maybe these services were coded assuming that an URL can only be 1 kb long? What if you overrun that buffer?<p>For example did you know that cups runs a web server at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:631" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:631</a> ?<p>TLDR: not a fan of this.')
