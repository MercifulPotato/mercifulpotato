But I think the above is well understood, and I guess rejected by some, because I see so many positions that think giving away our freedom is ok.<p>What we really need are stronger politicians who can unite people and find compromises between freedom and public health measures, that help us collectively move  forward. This crisis has shown how weak politicians have become (and how horribly technocrats and corporates have been at filling that void). Leadership is not forcing people to do stuff, that only makes society more divided and undermines attempts to solve problems. We need leadership and we don&#x27;t have it.')
