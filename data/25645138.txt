The fundamental idea is that you have enough connections that you can guarantee that at least one thread has all the connections it needs - because if it does, it can proceed, finish, release its connections, and then another thread can pick them up and gets to proceed, etc.<p>If a thread needs Cm connections, then Cm - 1 connections is enough to be one thread short of what you need. If you have Tn threads, then Tn * (Cm - 1) connections lets every thread, in the worst case, be one short of what it needs (if the connections are not evenly distributed, then at least one thread already has as many as it needs). So Tn * (Cm - 1) + 1 connections means that at least one thread definitely has enough connections.')
