The <i>sale</i> value may be zero, but as long as people are making shorts, the <i>use</i> value is the fee you can charge for lending them out. (And since it has a use value to make more profit, the sale value isn&#x27;t exactly zero, but is more related to its use value than anything about the underlying product being securitized.)<p>Being able to sell it on is one exit from this gamble; but also, simply having accrued more lending fees (over time) than the share cost to acquire. Mostly, it&#x27;s some combination of the two.')
