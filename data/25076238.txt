The only performance work I‘ve done recently is with react profiler.<p>I have never used it to inspect API requests, which I assume it can do? I‘m comfortable with Charles proxy, which is likely overkill.<p>My usage is maybe 45% elements, 45% console, 5 % source&#x2F;debugger, 3% storage, 2% network. Somehow I dislike elements UI in chrome.<p>Now I‘m thinking that I may be missing out and should look at what it does and what chrome could give me.<p>Edit: after playing around with it for a few minutes: I have in fact been missing out and using Charles and Paw way too much when I could have done it way quicker in the browser. I hope I don&#x27;t have to switch to chrome now.')
