It was featured already in Cyclone, a C-like memory-safe language that was a heavy inspiration for Rust. Rust ultimately went for borrowck and lifetimes as opposed to general regions <i>because</i> of ergonomics. Regardless, it&#x27;s always interesting and worthwhile to see alternate approaches being revisited - for instance, explicit regions might help with some scenarios that currently require unsafe{} in Rust.')
