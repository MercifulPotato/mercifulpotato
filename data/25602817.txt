If a general election happened tomorrow I doubt he would have problems. It’s pretty clear most countries have struggled to handle it so that’s probably why Boris hasn’t had as much flack as expected.\nLike I said, it’s unlikely that would be the reason he resigns, if that was the case he would have gone already.<p>Brexit will cause issues, but I don’t think many of them will happen in the next 12 months. The UK won’t “cease to exist” with the next few months let’s not be alarmist. (And I’m the one in an alternative universe?).<p>It’s more likely that Scotland will continue to ask for a referendum and Boris will continue to deny it.')
