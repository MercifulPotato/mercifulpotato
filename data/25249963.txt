Just like the author&#x27;s, it&#x27;s &quot;shitty&quot;. It lacks features, doesn&#x27;t handle edge cases, isn&#x27;t particularly secure or performant.<p>None of that matters. It&#x27;s locked up behind HTTP authentication and it&#x27;s for my use only. It has exactly the features I desire, and none that I don&#x27;t. I understand it top to bottom. It was fun to write and extend. It serves my needs perfectly. I didn&#x27;t have to fight with, or conform to someone else&#x27;s notion of how software should be built.')
