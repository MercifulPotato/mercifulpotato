Why would the hardware be any more of a pet than any random VM in the cloud? You could also just run a hypervisor on the host and get the benefits of virtualization along with full control of hardware.<p>Sure, if a drive breaks you&#x27;d probably want to replace it instead of just replacing the entire machine; it&#x27;s a thing you don&#x27;t need to do with VMs, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s difficult. It definitely doesn&#x27;t take &quot;hours&quot;.<p>Managing physical setups is <i>different</i> from managing fleets of cloud instances, but it&#x27;s not necessarily automatically inferior.')
