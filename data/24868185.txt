They don&#x27;t work that well in rough seas.<p>Think of these vehicles as floating on a layer of &quot;thick air&quot; above the ocean.  They bounce through that air like a boat on the waves.  If the layer is rough enough they will bounce more deeply into it the same way a boat will sink the bow deeper into large waves. If the sea is rough enough they go through the ground effect layer and hit the wave below.  Bouncing off the waves without crashing necessitates a reduction in speed that kind of makes these vehicles useless compared to boats.')
