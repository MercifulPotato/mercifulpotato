Almost all baseball players have ankle problems, but no one who plays baseball with friends after work is at risk of this.<p>The reason rowers get back problems is basically a combination of overuse, the asymmetric load-bearing motion of sweep, and underdeveloped antagonistic muscles. Given the device and the target market, none of these issues are really at play here.')
