Asking a good question does as well. The saying is, &quot;the most stupid question is the one you haven&#x27;t asked&quot;. However it omits one should put in effort to do their own research. That effort is somewhat arbitrary. It doesn&#x27;t equal using Google (I generally don&#x27;t even use Google search engine), nor does it require success in using Google. A good basis is the ability to do research; I believe the emphasis should lie there. And it needs to be taught before university (which is 18+ age).')
