Not particularly for pushing code, but for convenience.<p>For example: Access to the latest build of an application or the URL of a branch specific QA environment. Or are there workflows that require all team members to have GitHub accounts purely for the sake of SSO?<p>Other companies have zero need for designers to access source control.<p>Personally, as an engineer, I&#x27;m kind of shock when a new designer joins and doesn&#x27;t even have an GitHub account.')
