Nobody is arguing that lockdowns should last forever.<p>But this is exactly the mindset that I&#x27;d characterize as an erosion of &quot;respect for human rights&quot;. When the government proposes extraordinary restrictions, it&#x27;s <i>their</i> responsibility to clearly define how long the restrictions need to last. Answers like &quot;until it&#x27;s safe&quot; or &quot;stop building this into a strawman&quot; should not satisfy us, because the entire principle of human rights is that governments can&#x27;t be trusted with such unlimited mandates.<p>(I should note to be fair that many governments have indeed limited their mandate, saying that they&#x27;re going to remove all the restrictions once a vaccine is widely available. I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with that from a policy perspective, but it&#x27;s much better than an indefinite commitment to stop the disease from spreading.)')
