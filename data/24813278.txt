Item(by='babuskov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602968113, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24812274, text='&gt; Peer-to-peer bandwidth requirements for a single user increases linearly with the number of participants while a client-server model is essentially flat regardless of the number of participants.<p>True if the server integrates all incoming streams into one. However, in that case, CPU requirements on the server also grow on linear basis.<p>An interesting solution would be one where each client downscales the resolution of their stream to the actual space it would take on target computers. That way the per-user bandwidth would remain constant as smaller uploads would probably be enough to offset overhead of having multiple incoming streams (of course, each incoming stream already downscaled by sender and thus requiring only a portion bandwidth).')
