If you are driving too fast to stop for pedestrians, you are driving too fast, period.<p>no offense, but this is kind of ridiculous. on a street with parallel parked cars, an uncareful pedestrian can instantly transition from being totally obstructed from view to only a couple feet in front of a moving vehicle.
