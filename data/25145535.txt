And this mentality continues throughout the chain—if you want to actually install unsigned <i>kernel extensions</i>, or inject code into system processes, you need to boot into recovery mode and run a command to disable SIP. This is still not at all onerous if you know what you&#x27;re doing (and like Gatekeeper, you only need to do it once), but it&#x27;s definitely a next-level test for next-level privileges.<p>I actually think Apple&#x27;s implementation of this stuff is <i>brilliant</i>. And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not personally concerned by the boiling water argument, at least not yet—whatever Apple&#x27;s incentives, the current setup strikes me as the best way to handle things.<p>All of that said, where I <i>am</i> starting to get annoyed is with the authenticated root stuff in Big Sur. Having to reboot every time I want to edit a system file is a clear progression into &quot;consistently annoying&quot; territory. If you want to talk about Apple locking down the Mac, I&#x27;d start there!')
