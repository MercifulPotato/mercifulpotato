If &quot;energy()&quot; is an integral part of the model, why shouldn&#x27;t it be a method of it? Maybe the example is not well chosen, but it looks more like extreme minimalism to me. If there are different kind of models (like Ising and XY), they could all implement the same interface with an energy method. Any views on this?')
