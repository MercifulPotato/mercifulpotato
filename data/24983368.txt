I spend a lot of my time alone on big trips around the world, and out in the wilderness. I&#x27;m immensely more happy than I was sitting at a desk watching my life go by without really being <i>alive</i>.<p>I get a lot of this attitude about how I must be &quot;running from something&quot; or I&#x27;m &quot;throwing my life away&quot;.<p>I think it&#x27;s a symptom of our modern &quot;society&quot; that it needs to put down anyone who chooses not to be drowning in it.<p>Which, of course, makes me want to distance myself from it even more.')
