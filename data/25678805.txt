They all start with `create-react-app` because it&#x27;s &quot;easier&quot; this way.<p>&gt; <i>Imagine if I said Ruby&#x27;s hello world was 1 million lines because I had started with Rails. That is what is happening here.</i><p>Incidentally, I remember visiting a code bootcamp a few years ago. Back then, they put people who never saw a line of code in their life in front of Sublime and showed them how to make web apps with Ruby on Rails. So this definitely happens, and the results are as expected.')
