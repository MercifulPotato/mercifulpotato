Meaning, unless syscalls are horribly slow, you&#x27;d expect them to be pretty much unaffected by the underlying OS.<p>It&#x27;s not even really only WSL being benchmarked here, but also stuff like the OS&#x27; scheduling etc.<p>Micro-benchmarks for each syscall and comparing their actual performance might be more useful - it would allow you to more easily control for auxiliary differences between the operating systems - so you don&#x27;t accidentally benchmark ext4 vs ntfs or something instead of your syscall.<p>Edit: I was unaware <i>WSL2</i> is essentially a linux kernel in a VM now. What is even the point of benchmarking this and why is it supposed to be a successor to <i>WSL</i>? This is something completely different conceptually.')
