If we call it “Browser” it should be browser, isn’t it? It should brows pages.  It was never intended to be overweighted virtal machine and not a good one by the way.<p>Past 8 years or so Youtube has nothing really more to offer then it was offering back then. The only new things it offers for me is overweighted dumb slow shit that fails to perform  what it was perfectly doing 8 years ago, and all those slowness added for no particular reason that I could appreciate.<p>All of this ‘comfort’ is getting on the way or doesn’t work at all. Perfectly capable IPad Pro now is struggling to load even Youtube.<p>Almost every site I visit is bloated  with idiotic unnecessary  things that do not not even work properly.<p>And once you see some new idiocy appearing on some big site, the first thing you think is :‘oh no’ because you can be pretty sure that every “designer”  would copy this bullshit and it will appear on every site very soon for no reason.\nIf that is not a dumb design by definition then what is? I would not call it even design. Those are layers and layers of garbage piled on top of each other and at this point when I see simple HTML I just wish to thank the author for lack of so called “design”.<p>It’s not crappy browsers - It’s crappy sites overloaded with useless features. \nI didn’t see One big site lately that did become better ... not one!
