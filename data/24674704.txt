But Mulholland Drive is absolute rubbish which people like because they know that most won&#x27;t like it (because it&#x27;s rubbish).<p>I&#x27;ve been invited to similar groups that have esoteric music tastes. They think that because I have a good taste in music I will fit into those groups. But I can&#x27;t stand them. It&#x27;s all about finding the most obscure thing possible. The kind of thing that isn&#x27;t popular for very good reason. It&#x27;s just not that good.<p>Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony has virtually universal appeal. Die Hard is considered one of the best action movies of all time. Those are the kind of things you need to make sure you see. After that, whether you watch the latest mindless popcorn thriller or crap that nobody really likes is up to you. I&#x27;d rather watch the popcorn thriller, though.')
