It&#x27;s not a straight copy, kind of like if you copied every other word in places, but it&#x27;s definitely Latin.<p>It does likely have relatively similar usage patterns to English in terms of letter distribution, if only because they&#x27;re both indo-european languages and English has deep vocabulary ties to Latin through Norman influences.')
