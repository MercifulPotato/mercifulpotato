For one, think about all the libs&#x2F;apps which communicate over the Internet and use encryption libs to talk via HTTPs. Is mentioning The Wassenaar Arrangement [1] in terms of software even necessary nowadays?<p>&gt; Linux, Windows, MacOS - all have encryption libs built in (at least on the kernel level). They have been made in various countries, yet they are used all over the world. Do they fall under the terms of The Wassenaar Arrangement?<p>&gt; --------<p>&gt; [0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jukefoxer&#x2F;Signal-Android&#x2F;tree&#x2F;feature&#x2F;wa-" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jukefoxer&#x2F;Signal-Android&#x2F;tree&#x2F;feature&#x2F;wa-</a>...<p>&gt; [1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wassenaar.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wassenaar.org</a><p>It&#x27;s also mentioned in the original signal repo.I guess they have their reasons to include it and the fork just left it there.')
