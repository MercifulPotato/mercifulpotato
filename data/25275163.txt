But unfortunately the friction of yet another specialized tool kept me from actively maintaining it, which of course makes it entirely worthless.<p>I&#x27;ve started just using Google Contacts for this. It syncs and integrates with all my devices, supports birthday reminders, relations and custom fields, and has a general purpose note taking area for gifts and other details.<p>I only wish the custom fields were more powerful&#x2F;versatile and that the relations could be hyperlinked with other contacts instead of being just text fields.')
