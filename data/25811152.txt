Lightning and MagSafe are the best out there. They feel satisfying to use; the lightning click is the phone equivalent of the German car door clunk, likewise with MagSafe, I also like that the connector tells me if its charging or not with the green&#x2F;orange light on the connector. They are resistant to dust and electrically reliable. They fail safe; The lightning connector in the cable breaks, unlike mini&#x2F;micro USB which knackers the port in your device if you bend it by accident. If you trip over the MagSafe cable it just pops off. The standardised ports seem to have mechanical and experiential design as an afterthought. In terms of the physical connector (not the capabilities of the port), USB-C feels like a step backwards from lightning.')
