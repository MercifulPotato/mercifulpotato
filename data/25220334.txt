Weâ€™re right at the precipice of the inflection point. Pushing for these deadlines in a few more large markets will push us over the edge.<p>Obligatory ask: If this is important to you, contact your government representatives and demand a timetable for combustion vehicle phaseout in your jurisdiction.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehic...</a>')
