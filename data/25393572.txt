Because<p>1) Their sales demos (which we recorded) pitched functionality that literally did not exist or was EOL&#x27;ed from the system without a replacement before we implemented.<p>2) It was a fixed-price contract, and when they screwed up &amp; couldn&#x27;t deliver on their benchmarks, they refused to continue working without additional payment<p>3) Paid customizations were developed in bad faith &amp; without the contracted specs. In one example, there was a simple requirement: Users could enter a long blob of text, and clerks could review it as part of the user&#x27;s record in Peoplesoft. They delivered the first part, not the second. When we asked where that functionality was, they said they didn&#x27;t need to build anything more because the data was available to clerks via the assistance of a DBA.<p>The implementation failed, we got a settlement, and chose a different vendor while out Legacy system limped along for a few more years.')
