My org is a 24&#x2F;7 one, but one Christmas back in the 90s (way before my time) some work was done on Christmas eve, I think it was on the phone system, in the days before widespread mobile phones.<p>It broke, which was a major problem, this meant that senior management were being phoned (ho), and relatively high middle managers were on site to deal with the fall out. Of course most suppliers were also closed so everything was harder to fix.<p>There&#x27;s good reasons not to do changes when places are closed, or at least skeletoned, for 2 weeks.')
