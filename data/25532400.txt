Those “overall terms depending on EU trade deals” were overwhelmingly favourable terms negotiated thanks to the immense negotiating power of the whole EU trade bloc. We’ve now lost almost all of that.<p>And bear in mind a lot of these EU trade deals weren’t forced on us, we played a leading role in negotiating those deals ourselves. Now we’ve lost the benefit of a lot of that hard work.<p>Fortunately we have negotiated maintaining trade access with some countries, including Canada and Japan under our former  EU arrangements. On many other cases though I believe including India, no such luck so far.')
