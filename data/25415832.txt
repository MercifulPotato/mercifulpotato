Arrows are spring loaded and when you step on it, it bottoms out on a metal bar, which make contact with another metal bar on the bottom side of the arrow. Ugly, noisy, but worked really well.<p>For the electronics I just took a cheap gamepad and soldered the wires from the sensors to the button traces. Cheaper is usually better here. The gamepad was still functional, so I could use it to select songs and things like that.')
