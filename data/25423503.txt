I&#x27;ve seen a few high-speed accidents less than 15 minutes after it happened. People were mostly standing on their own legs, except for that one car that hit a tree at high speed even though it was pretty far from the highway (that was ugly). High speed accidents can be and very often are fatal, but it&#x27;s not as absolute as you&#x27;re saying.<p>It&#x27;s all about the car - don&#x27;t drive 260 in an Octavia, not even a Passat, much less a second-hand one. Recent Mercedes E-class with all the additional safety equipment can handle high speed crashes well, and the automated systems can do <i>a lot</i> for prevention as well as saving the situation (but there aren&#x27;t many situations that need saving with the prevention systems).<p>BTW going 260 in a Mercedes feels about as controlled and smooth as going 70 with less expensive cars. It really is something totally different, and you have to feel it to truly understand it.')
