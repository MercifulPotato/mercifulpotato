The point the authour is trying to make is that guard clauses convey a different intent from a standard branch. It&#x27;s a way of communicating &quot;this method is not relevant &#x2F; necessary (or sometimes invalid if you&#x27;re raising) for this set of inputs&quot;. If what the guard clause is doing is the &quot;point&quot; of your method, you&#x27;re losing that intent from someone reading it, and conveying something else.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s Rubocop&#x27;s fault in this case - there&#x27;s really no way that we can expect a linter to glean &quot;what is this method really about&quot;. But structural issues like this probably don&#x27;t make sense to use a linter for IMO.')
