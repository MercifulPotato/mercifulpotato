Really, even compared to other &quot;walkable&quot; cities beyond a select few, similarly expensive places.<p>Nobody really brings up that the bay area has better LGBT and other minority protections than anywhere in the US, either. Every time someone mentions cheap midwest cities I have to pull up <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crossingenres.com&#x2F;out-in-the-united-states-where-can-i-live-f44954bf06b2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crossingenres.com&#x2F;out-in-the-united-states-where-can...</a> and see if anything&#x27;s changed since I last checked.<p>Nobody really brings up the general art and culture scene in SF and Oakland. Or access to extremely high quality produce and food.<p>Generally nobody brings up the possibility that some people _want to be here_ outside of their jobs. It&#x27;s weird.<p>I guess most of those that want to be here don&#x27;t really comment on articles like this.')
