I did medical billing. Our local govt agency (this was for medicaid level care) required that they only pay 25% of the price of the service. When 90% of your patients are on medicaid, you raise the price so that 25% of price is now what price should be.<p>But very funny when someone comes in and wants to pay cash. While that would be SO much easier than dealing with the agency - you got to charge them 4x so some politician and HN posters can go on about how much money the govt &quot;saves&quot;.<p>I just wish prices (cash paid) had to be posted publicly.')
