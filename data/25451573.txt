Increase in economic output from population growth in a consumer based economy is a reason that economists would give and that politicians would use to support the policies promoting a higher birth rate.<p>I think we probably could eliminate most policies promoting population growth. Of course some of those could meet some ethical concerns. If we start talking about policies to limit population growth, that could get even trickier.')
