Other apps do to, but I think vscode has gained a lot of development in the ecosystem because of the FOSS dressing it adopted. I think it&#x27;s it has been closed source, paid for, then it wouldn&#x27;t have garnered that attention and instead other OS projects would have gained more attention. So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say it&#x27;s just about free-gratis status.<p>Vscode kinda brought me back towards MS, or at least closer to them. Once I&#x27;d started using it on Linux (Kubuntu) then trying Win10 again was less of a leap.<p>I&#x27;ve not bought in to the New Friendlier Microsoft, but the hope was growing.')
