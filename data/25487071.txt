Item(by='sgift', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608479604, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25486642, text='We had this when game consoles were very dominant: PS3&#x2F;Xbox360 era, start of the PS4&#x2F;Xbox One era. Games were developed for consoles and then &quot;touched up&quot; for PC. It sucked. Starting from good machines and pushing them is far better imho. They should have cut off the base versions of both last gen consoles, but Sony&#x2F;MS don&#x27;t allow that afaik (e.g. either you don&#x27;t deliver for PS4 at all or you deliver for PS4 and PS4 pro). At some point you have to realize that hardware is too old for something and accept it.')
