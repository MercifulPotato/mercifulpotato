Item(by='vishnugupta', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603309037, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24850015, text='&gt; Isn&#x27;t the point of democracy that the people have power?<p>Over last few decades the democratically elected government has been retreating from providing public goods and services. It may or may not have been meticulously engineered but the US is now at a point where just about every aspect of services and goods has been privatised.<p>It is assumed, at least as per the PR, that free markets are more effective and efficient than elected government in discharging public goods and services. And the government&#x27;s role has reduced to maintain the quality of the USD currency. Housing, , health, transportation, education, law enforcement, national security and military, public safety -- just to name a few -- have all either been fully privatised or almost there.<p>Given this, to what extent can public influence the way things are run? The public get one chance in five years to choose a government which has anyway privatised much of its functions. To add to that the political parties get non-trivial funding by these private corporations.')
