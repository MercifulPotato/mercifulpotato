SQLDelight [2] is a YeSQL-like alternative for the anti-ORM and anti-Vendor-Lock-In folks but it relies on Multiplatform Kotlin to support both Apple and Android ecosystems.<p>Engineering is about managing trade-offs given a set of constraints. Core Data is sometimes a fine choice.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Enterprise_Objects_Framework" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Enterprise_Objects_Framework</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cashapp&#x2F;sqldelight" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cashapp&#x2F;sqldelight</a>')
