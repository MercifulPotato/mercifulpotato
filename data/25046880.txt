Sad to see psychological terrorism so prominent throughout the United States let alone globally. I&#x27;m genuinely surprised hacker news hasn&#x27;t built a feature to filter out this junk, but of course disinformation is more profitable than real credible studies. This is a great example of the same psychological exploit used with push notifications just in click bait form... Anyone else tired of the internet being abused in this form?')
