It&#x27;s pretty interesting numbers (lets assume its true).<p>So a raise of 25% would equate to 1.28% unemployment. A fully socialized welfare system (Centrelink in Australia) costs 14% of GDP with 6.8% unemployment. So a reversal of 25% would reduce that to 5.52%, and 11.36% of GDP (assuming overheads etc are linear, optimistic).<p>TLDR; if this article is correct, raising minimum wage 25% requires governments invest 2.6PP of GDP.<p>At least that&#x27;s a decent point to have a rational discussion about where governments spend money and what your priorities are - thanks for sharing.')
