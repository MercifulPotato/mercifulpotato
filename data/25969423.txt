I coulndn&#x27;t even use my keyboard and mouse (the one on macbook, NOT bluetooth one) for 2-5 minutes after lid was opened.</i><p>True that this is a good example of a security system that affected people negatively – though ironically I was unaffected by this because I was on-site with a customer, working on an annoying network without internet connectivity. But yes – it&#x27;s fair to say the ecosystem is not perfect.<p><i>And don&#x27;t get me started on the completly stupid difference between ctrl+c and cmd+c. One (the standard for everything except macos) is used in terminal and the other in every other app.</i><p>This is not &quot;completely stupid&quot; – it&#x27;s just a difference between platforms. The command key sends commands, and the control key sends control codes. The cmd+c combination will copy text in both the terminal and all other applications; ctrl+c will send an interrupt. If anything, this is one of the things that keeps tripping me up working on a Linux desktop after so long – I keep inadvertently sending ctrl+c instead of copying, because the control key is overloaded with both text manipulation commands and control characters! But this is just a muscle-memory and familiarity thing.')
