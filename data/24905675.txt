The submission title should be changed to the actual title, “Download Youtube Video in Golang”. (Edit: the title was something like &quot;youtube-dl in golang, actively maintained&quot; when the comment was posted.)<p>Btw, I should point out there&#x27;s no shortage of web video downloader projects that support YouTube as well as different, often reduced (compared to ytdl) collections of sites, with different focuses and ergonomics. For instance, two projects I&#x27;ve used&#x2F;contributed to, both active, YouTube-supporting, and with a focus on Chinese sites:<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;soimort&#x2F;you-get" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;soimort&#x2F;you-get</a> (Python, 8 years old, 35.8k stars)<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iawia002&#x2F;annie" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iawia002&#x2F;annie</a> (Golang, 2-3 years old, 12.7k stars)<p>(Not trying to diminish the project posted; what I&#x27;m saying is you can find quite a few actively maintained projects with reduced scope if you look around.)')
