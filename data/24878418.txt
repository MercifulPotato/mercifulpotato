It would be impacted if the purpose and character of the copy was inconsistent with fair use, but remember youtube-dl hasn&#x27;t taken or shared any permanent copies.<p>So unless you think that youtube-dl has made a copyright violation (which I think we&#x27;ve established they haven&#x27;t) then youtube-dl is Sony Betamax, permitted to sell VTRs as long as there are substantial non-infringing uses, and the copyright claim will have to be brought against the infringing users.<p>That does not mean the courts won&#x27;t find this is an &quot;anticircumvention device&quot; or will find that the takedown is improperly executed. They may very well rule it is an illegal anticircumvention device, Betamax happened before DMCA, and didn&#x27;t decide anticircumvention.<p>But to my knowledge, in Sony one of the opinions spoke about &quot;jamming&quot; with hypothetical language, stating that it could be possible for Sony to build a box that jams unauthorized copying and I&#x27;m not aware of landmark cases that would have solidified those concepts.<p>If RIAA has accurately characterized the key rotation mechanism in YouTube then youtube-dl may well be ruled a circumvention device and that could be the end of it, fair use or no.')
