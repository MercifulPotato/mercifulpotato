Them not disclosing information is to their advantage, not to yours.<p>I think that&#x27;s an unhelpful point of view in any but most commoditized-labor situation.<p>The more rare and hard to find your combination of skills and experience, the longer the recruiter has spent looking for you, and the more motivated they are to get you the best offer possible to get you in the door. It&#x27;s not in their or your interest to lose you to save a few tens of thousands of dollars.<p>&gt;&gt; You make it sound like if they don&#x27;t tell you what the range is, they are somehow doing you a favor. No, if they don&#x27;t tell you the range it&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re nice or whatever, but because they&#x27;re trying to get you to sign on for the lowest amount possible.<p>Again that kind of only works in the most commoditized situations (eg: &quot;hire anyone with 6 months experience with React&quot; or whatever.) The more specialized the recruiting search, the broader the range becomes: for example, &quot;we need someone who knows technology X and Y, has been in industry A and has shown attributes B and C&quot; they recognize they may end up hire a more junior or a more senior person and expect different things from them. So the role may pay 250 or it may pay 500 based on who you are. If you&#x27;re in the 250-level experience range, it&#x27;s meaningless for you to hear that it can go up to 500.')
