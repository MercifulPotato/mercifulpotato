I got to sign that HelloSign document because one of my business partners requested it, so if anyone should report bugs, it would be them. This was my first time using HelloSign, and it left a bad first impression.<p>I just find it amusing that they are bragging on top of HN about a product feature that doesn&#x27;t even work properly.<p>&gt; rather than assuming that downvotes are coming from the company!<p>Who else then?')
