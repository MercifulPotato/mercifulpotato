I think there isn&#x27;t any doubt from a health perspective that doing weightlifting has benefits for overall health but the program someone should go on is dependent on so many factors. Also, why can&#x27;t it just be &quot;Stay physically active&quot;. I would say that has further greater benefits than even weightlifting. Doing half an hour to an hour of moderate cardio activity every day or a few times a week is great.<p>My recommendation for someone wanting to seriously get into weight lifting is to do your research. There is definitely a lot of &quot;bro science&quot; out there but fortunately there is also a great set of resources out there that is firmly in the realm of solid science.<p>Here is some Youtube channels that are very solid on approaching weightlifting grounded in real practice and science: Jeff Nippard, mountaindog1 (John Meadows), Greg Doucette, VitruvianPhysique and Renaissance Periodization.<p>A good book is: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;Science-Development-Muscle-Hypertrophy-Schoenfeld-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B0837DWFPF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;Science-Development-Muscle-Hypertrophy...</a><p>What I have personally found is that for me there is two primary focus points: reducing the risk of injury and keeping consistent with the program. Reducing risk of injury comes down to knowing your own limits for what exercises are comfortable and not going hard with attempting to do max reps all the time. Personally, I don&#x27;t do any traditional squats and for deadlifts I use a trap bar. Being consistent is much harder. Making a schedule to be in the gym three to four times a week is really hard.<p>So, yeah, if you want to get started with weightlifting, spend a few hours with those Youtube channels. Picking a class of exercises as a one size fits all is definitely not the way to go.')
