My cofounder and I started our company [0] literally based on the pain points we were feeling and still, when the first user tests on the first version of the product came around, users didn&#x27;t get it. Or they didn&#x27;t see the value. It was a tough lesson - we were building the thing we thought we wanted and others didn&#x27;t want it. But we persevered, pivoted a little here, rewrote a lot there, and ended up with something that users not only liked a lot more, but also worked better for us too.<p>Moral of the story is scratching your own itch makes you qualified to talk about the problem, it doesn&#x27;t make you an expert on a good solution.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitemaker.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitemaker.co</a>, the super fast, hotkey-driven product management tool&#x2F;issue tracker that has deep integrations to GitHub, Figma, Slack, etc.')
