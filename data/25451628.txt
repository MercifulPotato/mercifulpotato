The common saying &quot;nobody is thinking about you (except you)&quot; is specious.<p>Upon examination it falls apart. You think about others, albeit not everyone you encounter but the people you care about. Why wouldn&#x27;t they think about you? Either you&#x27;re unique in that you&#x27;re the only person who thinks about others or you&#x27;re invisible to them.<p>And as you point out, your image in the mind of others translates into tangible results: money, sex, etc.<p>Looking at social media, we can prove the point further: some people are thought about much more than others.')
