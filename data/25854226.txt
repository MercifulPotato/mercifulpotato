What happens with gentrification is that locations become desirable, and because of inability for them to grow people &quot;spill out&quot; into adjoining areas.  If you could build housing right there (i.e. taller buildings, denser neighborhoods, subdivisions, etc...) the problem wouldn&#x27;t have happened in the first place.  But NIMBY rules prevent that to protect existing owners.')
