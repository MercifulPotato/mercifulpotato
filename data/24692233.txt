Similarly gigantic is the 5 kilometers long Haringvlietdam[3].<p>These projects are quite old, though, so some innovation to water control is always welcome. The system used by MOSE seems to be quite easy to hide compared to the massive steel and concrete structures of the Dutch system. If it turns out there is no penalty to longevity and maintenance, a system similar to the Italian project might just show up in the Netherlands as well.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Delta_Works" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Delta_Works</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oosterscheldekering" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oosterscheldekering</a>\n[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Haringvlietdam" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Haringvlietdam</a>')
