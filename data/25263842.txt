Just because you don&#x27;t like it when people judge others for ethically reprehensible practices does not mean that suddenly they&#x27;re &quot;authoritarian&quot;. Even if it did, that wouldn&#x27;t be a bad thing. Keeping society ethical is hard work and sometimes that means calling people out on their bullshit.')
