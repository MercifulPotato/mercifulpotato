For example, the belt is industrial nylon (not plastic), the same material as seat belts. The main benefit to this is it makes the rower quieter and feels smoother. The rail is aluminum and legs and frame are made from steel, which makes it stable and is why the Aviron rower weights twice as much as the C2. Finally, it is selling for $1999 with taxes, shipping, and the screen included.')
