PyPy does that and it&#x27;s quite good at doing it. The problem is exactly what mitsuhiko says, and lots of Python apps use some or all of these features implicitly (through the native extensions used by many common dependencies). Sure, some of this madness can be accessed from Python itself, but that&#x27;s also the case for JS, where you can do certain things, which will slow down your code greatly because the JIT can&#x27;t work with it.')
