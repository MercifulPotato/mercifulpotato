Remove all subsidy to this mode of transit? Yes.<p>We agree<p>You make an important point, the exact one that makes me doubtful that EV transition should be subsidized, again.<p>EV incentives will go to the same actors that created these conditions and is going to pay for the same infrastructure that made our cities a living hell.<p>Instead of banning cars, remove the need to use them.<p>Instead of subsidize car makers, subsidize the rethinking of the entire mobility plans<p>If people won&#x27;t need cars, they won&#x27;t use them<p>If people feel that they invested in new &quot;safe&quot; EV cars, even the young people who show no love for cars (not wrongfully) will start using them, because they are new, they are modern, they are safe and probably smell good too and for sure they signal that you care about the environment, so you won&#x27;t keep them hidden in the garage, you&#x27;ll use them as much as you can (also to maximize the investment)<p>Which will bring us to the same point we are now: much of the cities public real estate is eaten by roads and parkings while walking is disincentivized because everything useful, from IKEA to the shoe shop, are in some giant mall out of town unreachable without a car<p>We need to get rid of cars as a social need, EV or not, it is a really bad habit to rely on them other than for fun and the occasional emergency')
