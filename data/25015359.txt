I have a Raspberry Pi with a camera, looking out my apartment window. It takes a picture every minute, and uploads it to a server. Every day I concat those images to create a time-lapse video, like this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn-share-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;example.mp4<p>The whole thing is automatized, it has been running in the past 3-4 months without problems, I have around 90 videos now and tons of images.<p>Now I&#x27;m looking for ideas what could I do with these images&#x2F;videos? Do you have any fun project idea?')
