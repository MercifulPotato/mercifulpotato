If you&#x27;ve worked as a SWE in some capacity, it seems like most companies (even top ones) consider you good enough to at least interview you.<p>My pedigree is average at best. I&#x27;ve worked my entire career at non-tech companies (banks, hedge funds) doing decidedly unsexy work. I&#x27;m still able to attract enough attention that FAANG and many other top tech company recruiters contact me first.<p>Interestingly enough, it&#x27;s the top companies in my current sector (finance) that refuse to even have an internal recruiter casually speak with me. i.e. Citadel, Two Sigma, Jane Street, etc.<p>There&#x27;s also stories I see occasionally on LinkedIn, etc. of people from completely non-technical backgrounds getting hired as SWEs at top tech companies. Taxi drivers, ex-felons, aestheticians, etc. getting hired as SWEs at FAANG and unicorns.')
