I guess traditional Open Source advocates could abandon the entire term and go off and create a brand new movement where we try to make that even more explicit, but people are just going to follow us there and then try to coopt the term again.<p>&gt; people with the temerity to offer source-available licenses get treated like shit anyway because they aren&#x27;t giving away the farm<p>I will call out people who are doing that.<p>But really, the only comments I have about source available products are:<p>A) they don&#x27;t offer all of the advantages of Open Source (although they offer many more benefits than fully closed-source software), and I think that pointing that out is not a moral judgement, just a statement of fact about what the licenses do and do not allow.<p>B) people who offer source available licenses need to stop saying that they&#x27;re basically the same as Open Source, or that they&#x27;re just a subset of Open Source, or that they exist because Open Source has lost its way.<p>Because the licenses are not the same. All other debates aside, both us at this point in the conversation recognize this, right? You and I are disagreeing about a fundamental philosophy on what rights and moral responsibilities people have around code. You fundamentally disagree with me about whether or not large companies have the right to completely freely reuse permissive code, or whether they have an obligation to pay for it. That disagreement is so large that it affects our attitudes about whether offering large-scale commercial hosting of an Open Source product is <i>moral</i>.<p>And it&#x27;s fine that you and I disagree on that point, but we can look at that disagreement and say that clearly your goals when licensing software are different than mine. So to me, it seems pretty reasonable that people who have this fundamental disagreement with the OSI should acknowledge that instead of acting like the Open Source movement is broken. It&#x27;s not broken, it disagrees with you about the goals are in making code available to other people.<p>It&#x27;s not people being stubborn, it&#x27;s not that the OSI doesn&#x27;t understand the consequences of Open Source, it&#x27;s that it <i>does</i> understand the consequences of Open Source and it disagrees with you about what consequences are desirable. The Open Source movement doesn&#x27;t need shared source advocates to &#x27;save&#x27; us, we need them to acknowledge that their goals are different than ours.')
