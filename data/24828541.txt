I wonder how he&#x27;s able to get these A-list guests? Is it just that he&#x27;s the only one in the space doing these kinds of podcasts? I heard his interview with Jim Keller (chip designer extraordinaire) and Fridman did ask some good questions, but there were also some very cringey questions and others that seemed to indicate he was out of his depth (at least with the topic at hand). In spite of it, Keller had a lot of good things to say. So I&#x27;ll probably listen to this Lattner interview and cringe at points and find what Chris has to say interesting in spite of it.')
