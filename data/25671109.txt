Some ideas:<p>- trimming the contact list to the minimum; move most conctacts from the builtin phone address book (Google Contacts) to another store for contacts, which is not integrated with the system<p>- getting a separate phone just for WhatsApp; different account, different number, different contact list<p>- revoke most of the app permissions, use only the most essential features (basically text)<p>- post new _content_ elsewhere<p>- FB will probably try to track &#x2F; intercept links in the app; setting Duck Duck Go as the default browser might help (purge browsing data often)<p>I&#x27;m not sure how far iOS 14 privacy features will go. It&#x27;s their time to shine. If they do prevent WhatsApp and Facebook apps from doing shady stuff, it might be a time to switch.')
