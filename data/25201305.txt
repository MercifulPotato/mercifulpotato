I created my own C# application that with calls on user32.dll. It not only move the mouse and perform clicks, but it&#x27;s also named as a vendor utility (e.g. LenovoUpdates) that can be minimized to the system tray. I use it to open up various programs (email, browser, code, etc.) and I get to define where it clicks and how long in-between each set of clicks. If you were to open it up, you&#x27;d have no idea what the hell it is. The buttons are so generically labeled and the saving&#x2F;loading features are done using F-keys. Still going strong after 10 years :)')
