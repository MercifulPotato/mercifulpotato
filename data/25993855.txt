I personally think of all cuisines in the worlds as points within a large embedding- &quot;recipe space&quot;.  Every recipe is a graph of nodes representing items, and edges representing actions (&quot;take sugar and flour and mix in a bowl&quot;).  Out of this whole space, different cultures have explored various areas but we&#x27;ve ended up with a number of very similar approaches, such as:<p>flatbreads.  a wide range of cultures&#x2F;cuisines use a flatbread as a starch structural vehicle (tortilla, dumpling wrappers) combined with a protein&#x2F;fat interior (cheese, dumplings, whatever).  This pattern shows up over and over and suggests a wide range of new fusion approaches (&quot;world wrapps&quot; is an example of prior art).<p>Once you&#x27;ve cooked across enough cuisines you&#x27;ll see people have rediscovered a number of techniques (quick fermentation, drying, evaporating) to get rich flavors quickly.<p>There&#x27;s a side comment in one my cookbooks (Sauces) which dives into salsa- which means &quot;sauce&quot; but most people think of it as a condiment.  It points out that if you think of salsa as fresh sauces it opens up a whole new world of saucing opportunities.<p>Building the latent space for recipes would mean taking every recipe in the world, encoding it, and generating an embedding; with the result, you could easily create fusion food by casting vectors between two cuisines and sampling points between them.')
