They struggle with lots of sub-par products being sold, so maybe being the patron of such a service could be rationalized as a PR move as well as a practical benefit to buyers&#x2F;a way of providing stronger-quality signal.<p>I know that if I could see a pop-up link to Consumer Reports&#x27; info on a product when buying -- or, better yet, choose to restrict my buying only to things that are confirmed to be awesome by CR when I&#x27;m buying a BIFL type product, so I don&#x27;t waste my time -- I&#x27;d buy BIFL stuff on Amazon more frequently.')
