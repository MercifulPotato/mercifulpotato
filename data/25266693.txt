The article has no details showing why FreeBSD is better than macOS for the author&#x27;s workflow, except that there are a lot of processes running and setup apparently takes longer.<p><i>&gt; This is where many people will tell me “Okay but not everything works outside the box”, true! but which OS works outside the box these days anyway? Windows is still a nightmare, setting up macOS took me 3 days the last time, Linux takes way more if you’re building it from scratch. Setting up FreeBSD took me 3 days, however this meant that I will NOT need to change it again for a very, very, VERY long time.</i><p>Why is Windows a nightmare? I use Windows 10 on a PC I built and it&#x27;s fine. I also use it for dev using the Linux subsystem with WSL2 and Powershell.<p>Why did setting up macOS take 3 days? I don&#x27;t even think it would take 1 day if I set up a new machine from scratch.<p>Why are you building Linux from scratch for comparison??? It took me two hours to set up Debian by hand yesterday.<p>And then they say FreeBSD also took 3 days of setup (?!), but that&#x27;s alright because they won&#x27;t have to change it going forward. Leaving aside my skepticism of that last part, the same probably applies to macOS.<p>EDIT: I think the author actually <i>is</i> better served by FreeBSD given the fact that they were hand-modifying persistent packet-filter rules. That is not a thing I would suggest someone do on a macOS machine. But the head scratcher I have is why they would try to do this on macOS (or Windows) in the first place, and why setup times took so long besides the breaking updates.')
