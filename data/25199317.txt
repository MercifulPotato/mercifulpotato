Take a thinking styles test, like the HBDI (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Herrmann_Brain_Dominance_Instrument" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Herrmann_Brain_Dominance_Ins...</a>)<p>People in executive roles frequently tend &quot;Yellow &#x2F; Blue&quot; in their thinking HBDI thinking style.<p>HBDI certainly isn&#x27;t gospel, but it can help frame the people around you and make sure your communication includes thinking style elements they connect with.<p>2. One time each week, make a short, bulleted summary of what is happening in words that can be understood by anyone. I first saw this technique in a lab mate. He made them in powerpoint, kept them in a binder, and was ALWAYS ready to make an account.<p>3. Make peace that detailed documentation should be for your benefit, and occasional CYA. Even most technical people you report to will want a summary.<p>4. Many decisions in business are made by people that are able to operate on gut feel. Sometimes this is works well, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. However, the outcome is largely immaterial. This is because people who only direct when information is complete don&#x27;t end up leading, either formally or informally.<p>Appealing to the &quot;gut&quot; sensitivities of the de facto leaders of your organization will almost always increase your visibility.<p>Hopefully this helps!')
