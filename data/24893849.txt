Imagine a world where photoshop or Illustrator showed up late and were actually not very successful against competition. It’s a not-bad product, it’s just behind by one or two steps at things like plugins verses Sketch or Figma. Sure Figma isn’t native but it is very performant regardless and the portability of just piping a browser open anywhere is LOVED by clients.<p>Sketch is sketch. They invented this market and everything is basic a rip on it. Mac only, but that’s generally UX designers anyways.<p>It is very notable that XD is used by very few major companies. The industry leading firms overwhelmingly use Sketch or Figma or both.<p>That is very important in development or plugins. There is just so, much, more.')
