There will be less incentive to hire someone from Europe for international companies. I know this is an unpopular opinion. I work for an international company and I already get paid around 2-3x less than US counterparts at the same level.<p>I do work a lot, but I have accepted the fact if it means I can earn more. I can retire that much earlier this way.')
