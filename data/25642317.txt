Many start their day early, study before going to school, after it, and even during weekends.  The school program is way more ambitious than most (maybe even all?) its occidental counterparts.   All this is very competitive, even on extra-scholar activities (art, sport...).<p>Later, as adult, most are used to the idea that they must work hard, to the point of not even considering another approach.')
