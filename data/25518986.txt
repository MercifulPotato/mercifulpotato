I simply don’t agree. Just like when I _know_ someone didn’t read the article, I will call them out on it. It really is ok. To be honest, I find it sort of lame whenever someone says “The guidelines say you’re not supposed to do that.” This isn’t elementary school.<p>I think these sort of rules actually do a disservice to intellectual dialogue and aren’t working as intended.<p>Why should I pretend that someone said something that they didn’t? Why should I pretend that someone read the article when it’s easily provable that they didn’t?<p>Again, I didn’t flag the comment. It’s not just me who refused to give OP the benefit of the doubt. Maybe our reaction _is_ the strongest plausible interpretation.<p>For example, I understand what you said about philosophy being a male-dominated field. But the article referenced _2_ female researchers by name. This is why there are other comments on this post complaining about the researchers being _whiny_.<p>For example, Timnit Gebru, who does a lot of work in Ethical AI related to sexism and racism, was mentioned briefly. This is why some guy with the username “koreanguy” called Timnit racist and basically said he hates her guts. This is why OP ruslanbogan made some very wacky comment about if statements and racism. He mentioned race first, not me. (He also hasn’t elaborated fully on what he meant, but still has time to downvote me for some reason. He can easily say “No, I actually meant this. My bad.” It’s so simple, really.)<p>Earlier, you mentioned technophobia. Take a moment and think about what are some of the biggest fears currently being researched related to Ethical AI. You guessed it: are machine learning algorithms doing more harm than good when it comes to the intersection of race and gender.<p>ruslanbogan’s comment was flagged for a reason. When people make weird&#x2F;wacky jokes about racism, it usually means that they’re racist. It’s a shame that you’re assuming good faith in him but not me.<p>Here are a few links related to facial recognition:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;19&#x2F;federal-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-systems-casts-doubt-their-expanding-use&#x2F;%3foutputType=amp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technolo...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;24&#x2F;in-facial-recognition-challenge-top-ranking-algorithms-show-bias-against-black-women&#x2F;amp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;24&#x2F;in-f...</a><p>(And no, I’m not one of those users that hates amp pages.
