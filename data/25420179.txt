Yes, all programming is about balancing storage, CPU, memory, network I&#x2F;O against each other, but AWS introduces the complexity of needing to reason about these things over time horizons that are long by a startup&#x27;s standard.<p>If all of your business&#x27;s metrics are sharply up and to the right, you probably don&#x27;t need to worry so much, but if your goal is operational cost efficiency for a relatively stable workload, AWS is a challenge. That may be a blessing in disguise, as self hosting becomes a reasonable thing to consider if your needs are nontrivial and relatively inelastic.')
