While it&#x27;s promising, e-ink has some inherent problems. Namely, color and speed.<p>I always design my software on paper first and, color is needed for diagrams. I also read academic papers a lot and use color-coded highlighters (remember &#x2F; further research &#x2F; etc.).  Remarkable doesn&#x27;t support these workflows.<p>e-ink is not a fast medium. I have an eBook reader (Kobo Glo HD &#x2F; 300dpi) and I love it for reading but, highlighting process is slow and ugly (lower color depth -&gt; overdrive for fast response -&gt; repaint with correct gray levels -&gt; done). Writing will be similar, with some lag and that&#x27;s flow breaking and unacceptable for me.<p>At the end of the day, it&#x27;s a good skeumorphic device which mimics paper albeit a rigid and slower one. On the other hand, paper&#x27;s tactile response is unmatchable, especially when combined with fountain pens (which I use a lot).<p>Also, there are some ritualistic stuff with pen and paper. Every project has its own notebook, which triggers context response in my brain. When I get the notebook, I reload the stuff at the background. Every other task is automatically pushed back by the subconscious. It&#x27;s a kind of leveraging the &quot;library&quot; system of the brain.<p>iPad pro has a faster screen and color but, backlit screens kill my eyes after a certain time period (All my panels are either OLED or high quality IPS with reduced blue light). I don&#x27;t want to lose my eyesight for that.<p>I want to add that paper is hard to digitize, takes a lot of physical space and has maintenance but, these downsides are balanced out by the advantages it brings, at least for me.<p>I love working with digital systems. I use Pagico &amp; Trello extensively. A digital diagram a lot. Keep structured knowledge bases in Evernote and Zim but, when it comes to thinking and documenting the thinking process, I always return to the pen &amp; paper and, get that 10x boost instantly. I just can&#x27;t replace it and I don&#x27;t want to replace it anymore.<p>Trivia: Words like &quot;On the other hand&quot;, &quot;in that case&quot;, etc. comes from early memorization techniques where you imagine that you&#x27;re actually putting that subject&#x2F;idea in to your hand or a physical case which helps with structuring big subjects a lot. Using paper, different notebooks, etc. triggers the same circuitry to improve focus, retention and efficiency.')
