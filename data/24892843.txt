They just conveniently sweep the other people contributions as their era of dark ages. The dark ages are for them and not for other part of the worlds.<p>This Brief History of Surgeons article is another proof of this biased narrative. The five volumes of The Canon of Medicine book by Ibnu Sina (Avicenna) was used as one of the main reference textbooks throughout Europe including Oxford and Cambridge University for several hundred years until 18th century [1]. It also has significant original contents on surgery that were based on the work of Galen and extend them [2]. If you think the title is familiar it is because the English word &quot;Canon&quot; is derived from the title of this book, in a similar fashion that the word &quot;Algebra&quot; is derived from the title of another book by Al-Khwarizmi.<p>There are many other significant medical works from Middle Eastern scholars on the subject of surgery since they are the pioneers of modern university based hospitals that are common in the world today.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Canon_of_Medicine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Canon_of_Medicine</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;32013741&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;32013741&#x2F;</a>')
