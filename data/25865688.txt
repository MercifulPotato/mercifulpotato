So what should be done differently here? Are you advocating for mass availability to the general public on a <i>caveat emptor</i> basis, after say, animal safety trials?<p>From the FDA side, I suppose the issue is that in the absence of preliminary phase trial data, we don&#x27;t know what we don&#x27;t know. So it&#x27;s less about not trusting the public to understand their individual risks, but that the drugs&#x2F;vaccine offer risks that are unbounded. So perhaps the vaccine lipid nanoparticles are contaminated with toxic precursors that were not fully purified in the supply chain, or the lipids trigger an immune response to implants (something that did happen with cosmetic fillers), or they cross react with prescription statins in dangerous ways, or the encapsulated mRNAs trigger ANA antibodies, and so on. You may understand your own risk, but we were extremely ill equipped to understand the risks associated with the vaccines themselves till very recently.')
