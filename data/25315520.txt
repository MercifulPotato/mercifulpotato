It goes straight to the heart of what is actually going on.  I give a longer explanation of this in the last section of my paper, but here is the TL;DR: The way in which you get copyable classical information out of non-copyable quantum information is by discarding parts of the wave function.  The mathematical description of this operation is called a <i>trace</i>.  The classical information that comprises our classical reality is a proper subset of the quantum information in the universal wave function.<p>The next question people usually ask at this point is: isn&#x27;t that just multiple-worlds?  And the answer is: yes, it sort of is, but with one important difference: the MWI insists that all of the myriad multiple worlds are equally real.  And if you take the &quot;god&#x27;s-eye point of view&quot; and look at the universal wave function, this is true.  But it is not possible to actually take the gods-eye view except in the abstract.  In order to take any &quot;point of view&quot; at all, you have to be a classical entity.  So nothing can actually take the god&#x27;s-eye view, not even God!  Only a classical entity can take a point of view, and that point of view is necessary bound to one particular universe, and so that universe -- your universe, and mine -- is privileged from our mortal&#x27;s-eye point of view, which is the only point of view anything can ever actually take.')
