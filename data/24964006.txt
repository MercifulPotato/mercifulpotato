If you mean a unique model than this is impossible. The reason is compactness theorem (every theory in which every finite set of formulas has a model has a model). The basic idea is to add constants and introduce axioms stating they are different. This will allow models of, say reals where there are plenty of reals that are not real reals (sorry for the pun, I could not resist). Nonstandard analysis takes it a bit further and makes it a bit more precise and useable.<p>If you mean you want to deal with (naively) definable reals only then intuitively there are only countably many of those that you can define (by formulas, etc) and you are missing a huge chunk of the real line again.')
