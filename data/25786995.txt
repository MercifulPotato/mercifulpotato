I do a lot of rhythm teaching where the student uses their own metronome and taps, claps or sticks the rhythm and I listen for accuracy. I was dismayed when I switched to Zoom and experienced the filter. It has no idea what to with that kind of audio, where as it was so simple in GH. Even with all of the Zoom setting optimally configured you never know for certain what’s going to get through and what’s going to be canceled out.<p>As for configuring the settings, it can be easy enough to walk a student through the desktop config but last I checked the tablet config is ridiculous. And even required uninstalling and reinstalling. Would be so happy if that’s no longer the case?<p>The best part of Zoom imo is being able to share your computer’s audio or the audio from a certain window. That combined with Google Shared Piano is pretty clutch for me.<p>[edit] oh yeah one other offering to the Zoom gods. I also do a lot of screen sharing, like most of the lesson, and I hate how the video feeds default to a tiny format that can not be resized. A lot of times I need to be able to share my screen AND see my students hands but that’s just impossible now. I could do it with Google Hangouts no problem...')
