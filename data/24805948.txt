Great experience, fast, reliable, high quality output.<p>Rare the pages that did <i>not</i> come out at rated engine speed.<p>Canon engine, tweaked to 400 dpi instead of 300, with the host doing the rendering in DPS (anyone remember machportdevice?) and a custom DMA interface delivering the bitmap directly to the engine IIRC.<p>No interfaces on the printer itself, no ports, no Wifi, no LCDs, no memory, nada.  And none needed.  Printer is for printing.')
