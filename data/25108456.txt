Anything public on the main platform is censored by Facebook. Anything in private groups are moderated by site admins (including removing spam, though users can still report classes of entirely banned things like violence, hate speech, etc -- but until a user reports, Facebook doesn&#x27;t see).<p>Consider the alternative: public groups would get spammed by bots. There would be no more public groups.<p>Agnostic just isn&#x27;t possible, because now you&#x27;ll have to ask the question, &quot;well what&#x27;s spam?&quot; For legal reasons you need to consider things like CSAI (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protectingchildren.google&#x2F;intl&#x2F;en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protectingchildren.google&#x2F;intl&#x2F;en</a>), and then ask yourself questions of morality like &quot;is it OK that the platform I&#x27;m building helps to proliferate misinformation that is affecting election outcomes -- potentially damaging democracy, and is causing deaths by way of encouraging people to behave recklessly&quot; ??? There&#x27;s no way to build the platform and not ask these questions.')
