Hiring a law firm to consult on employee management and unionization would not be illegal. If anything, they should be learning the correct and legal actions that they can take based on the consultant&#x27;s recommendations.<p>Not to mention, the comment the plugin displayed wasn&#x27;t saying anything against illegal actions, but rather stating that concerted activities are protected. I don&#x27;t see how that has any bearing on the use of a law firm&#x27;s website.')
