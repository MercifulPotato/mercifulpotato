We generally don&#x27;t study only the &quot;useful&quot; things; if we did most of the most important mathematics we have today would have gone unstudied.<p>&gt; Your claim that HoTT is &quot;broadly regarded as an exciting and important new area of mathematics&quot; is simply wrong.<p>According to whom? You? You&#x27;re making an argument about consensus regarding the importance of a given area, but I have seen nothing to indicate that the consensus among mathematicians is in line with your opinion.<p>&gt; Steve Simpson and Harvey Friedman<p>They are in the minority. Again, if you&#x27;re arguing about consensus you can&#x27;t just point to one or two individuals and say &quot;look! They agree with me!&quot; For goodness&#x27; sake, the thread your referring to is well-known partially <i>because</i> it was controversial.<p>&gt; Jacob Lurie [...] doesn&#x27;t think highly of it<p>The content of Lurie&#x27;s comment and yours are quite different.')
