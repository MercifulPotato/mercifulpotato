So for example, let&#x27;s say I ask users about users&#x27; name and address, and I ask their permission to store this under GDPR.  In a separate table, I store &quot;anonymous&quot; sensitive data, like which how many users in each country have a particular health issue, but it&#x27;s &quot;anonymous&quot; so I never asked the user&#x27;s permission to collect it.  I am violating GDPR, because I can use my demographic data to identify some specific users who have some specific health conditions, and I never asked permission to do that.')
