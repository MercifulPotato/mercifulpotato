Google’s behavior is grossly unethical here irrespective of who reached out to the media first.<p>To give a counter-argument to this: If party A makes a claim or accusation, and party B just says &quot;no comment for now&quot;, it&#x27;ll be near-impossible to reduce the (potentially unjustified) fallout of the premature verdict made.
