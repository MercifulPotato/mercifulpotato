I own the domain so ultimately I can point the DNS to some other provider. Outlook stores the mails locally so I have a backup. I think the most important thing about E-Mail is to receive future E-Mails and not look at historical ones. In the end you can always ask the receipent to send you a copy of the email conversation - if you dont own the domain it get much harder to convince you actually own the email.')
