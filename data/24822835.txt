There was no advertising as such, not self-contained 30-second video. For there was as yet no widespread, rabid retail domestic  market...<p>But there was product placement. The game show host would read the question, contestants would try to answer, then they would all toss back the refreshing, bubbly delight that was Pepsi Cola. The newscaster would present the lead story, a bottle of Pepsi ready at hand. The ecstatic race car driver and his crew would chug some Pepsi as they celebrated thier victory.<p>It was a different time. It really happened.')
