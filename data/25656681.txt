Then came the issue that housing prices went up faster than my income could keep up with. And of course I was single &#x2F; single income; entering into a financial interdependency (my vocabulary is on fire today) is not the norm, and cynically speaking, most relationships end up in tears, sharing a mortgage in that case is even more sucky.<p>But anyway, the rent I spent on various &#x27;student&#x27; housing over the years does add up to a quarter of the value of my current house. In retrospect, I should&#x27;ve bought a cheap apartment ten years ago.')
