I&#x27;ve recovered so much of my time back. I can sleep longer etc... And my health is better.<p>The reason for the four hour commute (total.. Not each way), is that my wife works in the Bay as well but in the opposite direction. So we split the distance. Her commute is two hours (hour each way) since she can drive. But it&#x27;s better to be closer to her place of work since if there&#x27;s anything that requires us getting back home, she can respond faster (20-30 minutes in non rush hour).')
