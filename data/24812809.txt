He still skies during the winter, his cognition is still good, that is to say he still has a full life.<p>I would kill him without thinking too hard if it meant saving my nephew, aged 10, from dying. My grandfather lived a full life and I&#x27;m sure if he had the choice to trade his life for his great grandchild he&#x27;d sacrifice what he has remaining in order to gift the chance at that same full life to his progeny.<p>On a societal scale we think the same way, an 80 year old dying is less bad than a 10 year old dying, its less tragic both emotionally and from society&#x27;s perspective, economically. Losing a grandparent is tough, losing a sibling in the prime of their life is terrible, and losing a child is devastating. I can&#x27;t comment on OP&#x27;s feelings on the subject, they could have aid it in a callous and inhumane way, I don&#x27;t know their inner thoughts, but the essence is true even if it is painful.')
