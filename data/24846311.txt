Continuously improving. Much, much easier to set up for CRUD - I can get one up within half an hour. Web support seems better. Handles relations very well, whether it&#x27;s one to one, many to many. God forbid you want to upload images direct to MongoDB, it handles that well. Integrates into some email adapters as well. The dashboard that accesses the DB is sexy and powerful, and has improved a lot since Facebook abandoned Parse.<p>Documentation is excellent, far better than Firebase. And the data belongs to you even if Firebase shuts down.<p>Cons: Self-hosted. Poor support. And won&#x27;t land you any full yome jobs. Database is not real time unlike Firebase. Analytics and bug tracking is probably worse.<p>Similar: Cloud hosted functions, authentication. I don&#x27;t remember if Firebase does sessions, but it handles that too, on web and apps.<p>In general, it&#x27;s perfect for CRUD, especially on different range of apps and web.')
