You will probably not find anyone advocating disabling swap.<p>Actually I saw recently some discussion exactly about that. I think many people would be glad to do it if they new how. It is not easy when you relatively new in the area. It is not too complicated but a lot of information and it is not obvious what is important and what not, so you read all and get overwhelmed easily.<p>&gt;I do not run X11 anymore. I stay in VGA textmode. Doubt anyone would want to do exactly what I do.<p>I do exactly what you do, simply because x11 is not working on Pi with TV I have and I have nothing more since MBPro has simply died. (if you wish details, see here ”how“: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25778247" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25778247</a> )<p>&gt;If you study how NetBSD&#x27;s install media are created that will teach you almost everything you need to know. Happy to walk you through it though if you want to try NetBSD.<p>Thank you very much. This advice is already precious, because it helps to orient yourself in tons of info, and now I would know where to start digging. I would love to try once I’ll have equipment and time.  I really wish to encourage you though to write down this process, I am sure there are some people who are desperately looking for this setup and how to achieve it properly, bothered with many questions. This guide could also be a good practical introduction into a NetBSD by the way.<p>&gt;Chromebooks are claimed to be 100% safe from certain types of attacks. The developers came up with this silly &quot;whitewash&quot; gimmick. Their motivation for a disk-less-like system is to force users to store personal data in the cloud. Ugh.<p>it’s a shame really and done for wrong purpose. I never considered Chromebooks seriously for that reason.<p>&gt;Well, the disk-less systems I have been creating for recreational use long before Chromebooks existed are just as safe. Probably safer because I do not use a graphics layer or a web browser with Javascript interpreter.<p>What I really like about it is the ability of fast recovery, which gives more freedom for experiments. I love it.')
