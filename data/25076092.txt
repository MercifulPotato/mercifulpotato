Apple has supplied virtualization capable hardware to certain developers - Parallels certainly - so it&#x27;s strange to see that Docker seems to have had to sit on their hands until now? I certainly would have expected a Docker release a lot closer to hardware availability.<p>The fact that a stable golang for Apple Silicon likely won&#x27;t be out until February is not a great look either. That blocks Docker but a <i>lot</i> of other things also.<p>I mean, you should expect a lot of startup issues when moving to a new ISA, but it seems Apple could have done a lot more here.')
