I suppose the change in the refractive index of the water is akin to g_{00} component of the Riemann metric, since it produces a compensating change in the wave vector at that point. Whether you could imagine GR consistently in terms of changes in the local speed of light a.k.a. changes in the permittivity of free space, again, I do not know.')
