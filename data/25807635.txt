Item(by='herodoturtle', descendants=None, kids=[25807668], score=None, time=1610851990, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25807366, text='&gt; and of course see what is meant to be running in production (and run it yourself if you&#x27;re able to).<p>This comment of yours is only the second time I&#x27;m hearing of Matrix (the first time was several days ago, in a bunch of comments on an ASK HN discussing the WA policy announcement). And because of your comment (and the implication that Matrix is something one can run independently in production) I am now perusing matrix.org - thanks for sharing.<p>Also I enjoyed your insight with respect to the Signal dev team and what they&#x27;re possibly currently frantically busy with.<p>Mind if I ask you, what your thoughts are on the Signal project long-term?')
