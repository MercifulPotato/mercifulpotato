While it may be unkind, it is a greater evil to force someone to interact with someone they don’t want to, even if it’s for reasons of race, sex, living gay, or just being ugly, mean, old or young, or any other reason.<p>Only in an unfree world there is no discrimination.<p>I’m reminded of a tattoo I once saw written in runes: “free men are not equal; equal men are not free”.')
