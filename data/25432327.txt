It&#x27;s kind of a continuation of what happened with the pets my sister and I had growing up. We (as kids) made up stories, and our parents participated to some extent. We used to joke about making a book, &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Kitty&quot; (of course, someone else has done it, just checked). As adults, we just kind of continued it because, why not? It&#x27;s entertaining and amusing just like any other story telling activity.')
