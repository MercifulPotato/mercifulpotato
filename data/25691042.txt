They do well in the mid-range to high-end.\nIf Tesla even tries to enter the lower-end it will ruin their brand. They won&#x27;t be the &quot;think different&quot; car anymore. Then all bets are off and they would need to compete with the likes of Toyota and VW. I don&#x27;t think they want that.')
