Item(by='arbuge', descendants=None, kids=[25126892], score=None, time=1605635197, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25124426, text='&gt; Amazon, in contrast, has played on a much higher difficulty setting from the beginning, selling and shipping physical items, with all of the marginal costs that entails. If anything the company has doubled down on the physical world, investing billions to deliver items in one day; I don’t think it is a coincidence it is Amazon that is Google’s true competitor.<p>I have believed that about Amazon being Google&#x27;s true competitor for many years now, ever since it became clear that many people were starting their online shopping trips. Those shopping trips are far easier to monetize via search than search queries unrelated to items which can be purchased, which meant Google was being increasingly left with traffic that was hard to monetize.<p>I interviewed at Google for a PM job a few years ago and tried making this point to several of the interviewers when the conversation wandered towards dealing with potential Google competitors. All of them without exception looked at me as though as I was crazy. And I didn&#x27;t get the job :-)')
