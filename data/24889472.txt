It&#x27;s the industrial structure, rather than the demands of the job (provide a good search engine) that matter here.<p>In order to be a sustainable google competitor, you need to be a competing search <i>business</i>, not just a competing search engine. The business model is such that market share affects unit value. A search business with 1% of google&#x27;s traffic (or 1% of fb&#x27;s social traffic) does <i>not</i> make 1% os google&#x27;s revenue. More scale, more unit value.<p>Meanwhile, the way most&#x2F;many small search engines monetize is via adwords. Adwords has already been found guilty (EU court) of abusing this nasty grip on their (minimal) competition&#x27;s revenue avenue.')
