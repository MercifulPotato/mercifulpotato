Item(by='nomel', descendants=None, kids=[25522573], score=None, time=1608746894, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25517531, text='I no longer agree with my previous mentality that &quot;anyone can do it if they try&quot; and &quot;everyone is capable&quot;. It was an innocent, non-judgmental, perspective that I&#x27;m glad I had because it helped prevent some sort of inflated ego. But, the older I get, the more people I meet, and a mini stroke later that knocked down my IQ some very noticeable points, I&#x27;ve realized that I&#x27;m incredibly lucky to be above average intelligence (in certain areas). It has made life relatively easy. Having the somewhat rare perspective of experiencing an instantaneous drop in intelligence, I would never agree with you that we are all like Einstein. I firmly believe that the &quot;obviousness&quot; that a more intelligent mind sees cannot be learned. It&#x27;s seeing things that aren&#x27;t there, that others can&#x27;t see at all, or take much too long to see. For this reason, I believe there is a very real difference in the range of what people are capable of. I think everyone here should be thankful for their roll of the dice.')
