While I personally am not that concerned with the cost of connection establishment, and much more concerned with the context switches in a threaded &#x2F; process model, the fix for the latter would also likely fix the former. I think there&#x27;s a few higher priority issues in PG (some are prerequisites too), but it&#x27;s somewhere in the top 5 issues<p>&gt; The biggest limiting factor in my experience is actually Work Mem.<p>For me it hasn&#x27;t been that big an issue in practice. It&#x27;s transient memory usage, i.e. it&#x27;s only used in the backends processing queries, not idle ones. And many - but not all! - cases where you have a huge number of connections most queries are simple, and use a good bit less than 2MB.<p>There are a fair number of issues with work_mem, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But more around it being used several times in more complex queries, than the simple fact of using some memory for query execution. And it being hard to limit the number of concurrent queries rather than the number of connections.')
