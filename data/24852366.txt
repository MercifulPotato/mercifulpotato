Item(by='ohazi', descendants=None, kids=[24852505, 24854967], score=None, time=1603315540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24851941, text='The only way to guarantee that your keyring is secure long-term is for the source code (and change history) of your password manager to be inspectable and verifiable. A promise made by a corporation is not sufficient.<p>You can pay a corporation to buy a product with more features or better service. But you can&#x27;t pay a corporation to hold or maintain a principle. There will always be someone who can offer them more money to hold the opposing principle. Principled people who work for a corporation eventually leave and are replaced with apethetic or differently principled people.<p>In this case, the principle is the privacy and security of the credentials in your keyring. How much money do you think a bad actor would be willing to pay for these? How much money do you think a bad actor would be able to pay to a corporation that secures credentials for a huge number of users, and who can push arbitrary updates without pesky source code validation getting in the way? You and I don&#x27;t have enough money to win this game.<p>Look at another high value target for comparison -- browser extensions that have a large installed userbase. Browser extensions are frequently bought for tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars by ad&#x2F;tracking&#x2F;malware vendors in order to quietly replace the extension with one that does their bidding, without the users&#x27; knowledge.<p>What&#x27;s the solution to this problem? Open-source, inspectable, verifyable software that is maintained by a person or a community that shares your principles. I trust the work of Jason Donenfeld (pass, wireguard) and Raymond Hill (uBlock Origin) more than the work of any corporation selling a similar product at any price.<p>The incentive structure of corporations in general precludes them from being given the level of trust required for certain products.')
