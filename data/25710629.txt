Here&#x27;s the entire issue with this liberal-conservative dichotomy. No matter which one of you nuggetheads won, you would say the election was stolen by the other. Do you people seriously expect the rest of us to sit idly by and watch while you attempt to interrupt the implementation of the Constitutional order because you&#x27;re butthurt? Many of us took oathes to uphold that Constitution with our lives if necessary. Not those pretend oathes you weekend warriors take before you go out to your range and practice shooting unarmed black kids or whatever. I&#x27;m talking about oathes that we fully intend to go to the grave with. You want to interrupt the Constitutional order at the Captiol? Fine. But next time, I&#x27;m telling you right now, you&#x27;d better be packing something a lot more powerful than some cockamamie story about election fraud.<p>That goes for the liberals too when your turn comes to relinquish power.<p>I can&#x27;t believe that there are people out there who still can&#x27;t see that this crosses a line. I&#x27;m done coddling these political people.')
