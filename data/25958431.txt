At the same time, it&#x27;s done involuntarily and has privacy and self-censorship implications. It&#x27;s likely that reducing user-identified data collection will both be a win for privacy, but also a detriment to the long tail. Of course, when Facebook makes this argument, it seems false, given their long neglect and, indeed, antipathy toward privacy. It also seems false because it uses small businesses to cover for large ones (who probably need less targeting anyway, given their mass-market products.) Tide won&#x27;t suffer but artisan knitting needles might.')
