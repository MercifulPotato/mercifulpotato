Especially with giant headers like in AMDGPU, it should be much easier to change the meta-code if there is a need to make modification in the generated code. Essentially you look at what needs to be changed, and work backwards to figure out what change in the meta-code will result in the same change in generated code.<p>I believe you might be referring to stuff like boilerplate code, the whole purpose of which is to be generated for further development. In which case I agree with you, but then boilerplate codes don&#x27;t balloon the way AMDGPU header files did.')
