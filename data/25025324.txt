In fact, I&#x27;ve heard and seen a lot of good work by many parties concerned about the negative influence of gang activity in the US.<p>However, such discussions are definitely a red herring when advanced <i>in the context of police violence</i>--an entirely different and largely unrelated problem.<p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death among African Americans in the US and I hope someone&#x27;s working on that, but if you argue that racially-skewed police killings aren&#x27;t a problem because of heart disease then it&#x27;s entirely expected and reasonable to be met with complete silence or active suppression.')
