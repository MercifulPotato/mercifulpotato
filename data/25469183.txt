I applaud your achievement.<p>In my case, I have often considered going back for a degree (I had a &quot;redneck tech school&quot; education), but I could never justify devoting the time and money to get a degree in tech that would already be at least three years out of date by the time I graduated, qualifying me for a job, paying half of what I was already making.<p>Nowadays, the point is moot. I have spent my entire adult life, relentlessly self-teaching (still at it), and no longer need to prove anything to anyone (the biggest issue with not having a sheepskin, is looking up noses <i>everywhere</i>).<p>I love learning, and do wish I could have gotten a &quot;more rounded&quot; education, but the mitigating factor is that I have been <i>shipping</i> software, since I was 22, and that has taught me some stuff that I wouldn&#x27;t have learned otherwise.')
