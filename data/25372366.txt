There may be some speculators, but overwhelmingly the people trading this product will be water utilities and large farms who need multi-year planning for in particular tree crops.  It looks like it&#x27;s purely a cash backed contract and there isn&#x27;t delivery, so it&#x27;s going to just be used for hedging.  Privatization of water is a huge issue especially in the developing world, but this isn&#x27;t the same problem.<p>EDIT for clarification : water is a basic human right, but pumping 1 million acre feet to grow almonds and make bank is not.')
