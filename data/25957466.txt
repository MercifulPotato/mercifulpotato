It was like that way before the &#x27;bourgeois&#x27; ever even existed.<p>None of the examples you gave had the means to wield &quot;the accumulated and monopolized power of all its individual members&quot;, not least because technological limits alone introduced massive logistical challenges to central control that made any empire of the time very much decentralised and dependent on the extent to which local representatives had their own agendas.<p>&gt; The problem with these Enlightenment era definitions<p>Arendts book was published in 1951.<p>&gt;  it was just never generally available to the merchant class.<p>It&#x27;s much bigger a distinction than that. The big change brought by the growth of capitalism was disconnecting <i>responsibility for the population</i> from the accumulation of capital. A feudal lord could squeeze his population hard, sure, but cause them to die of starvation and his output would drop - his power and ability to accumulate it was tied to land and tied to keeping the population living on them able to produce. With capitalism accumulation was disconnected from that feedback loop - the capitalist can optimise away the workers in a way those dependent on at least the survival of the workers can&#x27;t, and <i>that</i> is real reason why the nobility was beaten:<p>The only way to beat the Merchants was to become one, and ditch the liability that having a notional responsibility for your workers provided.<p>But that also changed the nature of accumulation for those at the top from one naturally limited by being tied to a scarce resource (land) to being a near unlimited thread-mill. It&#x27;s natural to then look at the side effects of that. They&#x27;re all bad, but they&#x27;re also not all good.')
