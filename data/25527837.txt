Experts and the rest of us all understand that acquired immunity is real, that it is powerful, that it is <i>very</i> difficult to understand, and that it&#x27;s part of any reasonable strategy for controlling outbreaks of infectious disease.<p>The problem is that we&#x27;re seeing organizations that are part of public health infrastructure turn away from science and reason before we have formed replacements for them.  With this move, the WHO shows clearly what many reasonable people have been saying all year: that it is really more of a trade organization, representing pharmaceutical companies and products, than a clearinghouse for science that will lead to health in our communities.  This critique has of course been muddied by the many batshit conspiracy theories.<p>The fissure between the mainstream scientists in the academic world and the WHO is incredible to watch unfold in real time.  But what will be the result?  The information age brings a great opportunity to open a new and <i>much</i> more equitable chapter in public health, and the deprecation of trade orgs like WHO and hedge funds like AMA are perhaps a part of that.<p>But is there a clear path emerging?  One that allows scientists to continue their work reasonable uninterrupted despite the seismic shifts that are coming into focus on the horizon?')
