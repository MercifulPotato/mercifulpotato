When looking at the Alexa top 1000, you&#x27;ll find not a single semantic website that cares about their markup, most of them not even having an alternative text for images.<p>The Semantic Web also came with the idea of separating content, design and functionality; and came with the idea of having optional JS rather than integrating it to build intermixed components and (ab-?)using it to build a web page.<p>Personally, I think that this is a view on &quot;how to build a website&quot; that a lot of web developers lack these days, because they just clutter their web page full of JSX and don&#x27;t care about how it looks like - as long as it is a pixelperfect implementation of what they are tasked to implement. Webpack and others just minify it anyways, so nobody cares whether or not their code can be read by humans.<p>The difference to how web development was perceived back then was that a handcrafted website was worth much more, and developers would argue and defend their implementations with things like &quot;but it&#x27;s validated, and it has print stylesheets!&quot;.<p>But anyways, with that experience comes a lot of understanding what the Web used to be: It was a web of craftsmanship, and not a web of advertisement. People were proud of what they built.<p>Personally, I hope that people value my craftsmanship; so my personal websites all have code that I can identify myself with and that I&#x27;m proud of. So my portfolio includes a lot of gimmicks for kids, people, and likeminded people that they can explore and be fascinated with. [1]<p>Coming full circle to what I hope the web could be: I think that a mixture of the Semantic aspects and today&#x27;s Web Apps are necessary, and that this can only be achieved using swarm intelligence mechanisms. A centralized way is always too proprietary to outlive its creator. Combining that with a decentralized approach for training AIs on the labels could be a glimmer of hope that the web isn&#x27;t lost yet.
