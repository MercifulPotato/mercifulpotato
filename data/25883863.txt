Most people can&#x27;t stop in quick on a normal daily walk, because the inherent space-inefficiency of cars means a long detour to hit multiple stops, whereas with walking it&#x27;s an easy in-and-out grab.<p>However, even when patiently explaining this difference, it is a mental leap too far to consider any change. Not only is it the physical design of the stores and car-only infrastructure, a lot of it has to do with package sizing and pricing structure, as another poster pointed out; smaller quantities get massive markups in US stores, for no good reason other than once they&#x27;ve got you in a store, you&#x27;re fairly captive and they want to extract the maximum amount of money from you so that you don&#x27;t end up elsewhere.<p>Until people experience it, and realize that having a five person family is no challenge at all for this style of life, it&#x27;s hard to give them the picture.')
