Depending on how you usually regulate your serotonin release, getting a very similar feeling to that of a run of the mill &quot;roll&quot; may happen if you are just very happy or melancholic or introspective. A very deep conversation about something that you have been wanting to let go for a while or a therapy breakthrough can elicit that feeling.<p>I don&#x27;t know about this couples therapy thing, but remember that in most of this trials researchers are dealing with somehow of an &quot;unstable&quot; brain chemistry. Individuals with PTSD or ASD tend to dissociate even when sober and to be very sensitive to mindset and setting and believing they took a pill that is going to make their struggles go away while talking with a therapist can be a very warm and welcoming setting.<p>That being said, I also would like to point out that how people act on cocaine is usually heavily misunderstood and most of the stereotype of someone under the influence of cocaine is usually how people act on cocaine+some other strong stimulant like pseudo-efedrine. Cocaine was used medically for a long while and it&#x27;s effects are very well understood and not similar to the usual &quot;that person is on coke&quot; stereotype.')
