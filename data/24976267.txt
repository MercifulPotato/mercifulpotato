Totally agree it&#x27;s a great time, you folks have a lot of of very cool things going on.<p>I do have two related questions.  Just based on the listings I took a look at last week and what&#x27;s here now, the engineering orgs at least seem relatively flat. \nWould you say that&#x27;s true or is it just whats on the roster?   Second question is if &#x27;Senior&#x27; means anyting specific at SpaceX or is it just intended to communicate expectations around experience&#x2F;skills?<p>Thanks!')
