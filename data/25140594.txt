Unfortunately the name of the city happened to be very close to a rather common Finnish word (not even really identical). Google insisted to show me Finnish hits, I could not find a way by quoting and adding semi-common French search words to make their algorithms what I want. I could just not get up any reasonable French matches.<p>Just to demonstrate the effect to myself I took a VPN connnection to France and voil√†, very useful hits.<p>That&#x27;s the geographic dimension of the search bubble. I am sure there are more.<p>(I never use Google search when I am logged in to Google and I delete my cookies at least daily. So things should be pretty neutral for me. Someone might say, hah, your fault. If you hadn&#x27;t subverted their profiling you&#x27;d get better results. I doubt that, I had not heard about that French city before and I certainly search more Finnish pages than French ones.)')
