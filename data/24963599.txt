I tried a replacement reservoir, but it didn&#x27;t work.  So I tried a different type, with a screw based impeller mechanism, and got ink all over my fingers and desk.  Some of the ink went up into the reservoir, but wouldn&#x27;t flow back down through the nib for the purpose of writing.<p>I don&#x27;t like disposable fountain pen ink.  The plastic is bad for the environment, and the experience is half of what I am trying to get away from by returning to the mechanism of the refillable apparatus.<p>I tried buying a new fountain pen, for $50 from Officeworks.  It has a screw based impeller mechanism that has the same shortcomings as the one I tried with my Parker 45.<p>Has anyone seem a replacement reservoir for Parker 45 that works?<p>Can anyone recommend a non-refill fountain pen?<p>I&#x27;d love to return to using a fountain pen!  Not just for ergonomic reasons.  The writing looks better too.')
