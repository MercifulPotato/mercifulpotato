Oh the systems are down and we are loosing billions of dollars, ok share some of those billions and you will have people lined up to be on call. Tell me it&#x27;s part of my regular salary and I am nope&#x27;ing on to the next opportunity. I am totally in agreement with you on this one. If I am attached to a phone that can disrupt my life at any moment I expect compensation for every hour I am attached to that phone, whether it rings or not, it is surprising how many companies think that is an outlandish expectation, but don&#x27;t bat an eye at the fact that being on call literally robs a person of their free time and don&#x27;t see that doing that without further compensation is not an outlandish request.')
