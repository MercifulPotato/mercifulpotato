Will you machine them ? That would be a CNC machine and it’s a rabbit hole needing space, money, time, material, learning and safety measures. The mild version is a 3D printer, but it’s still a significant cost, a learning curve, a dedicated place available for long hours with effective ventilation.<p>We’re pretty far away from a simple hobby anyone could try, compared to fishing or papercraft, or guitare, or even wood working. Basically that seems miles away from anything you would start out of boredom.')
