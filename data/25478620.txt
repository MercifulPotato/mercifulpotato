If you want new OS features or security patches, or apps that rely on those features, or if you buy a new device, then you don&#x27;t have an option. Eventually everyone will have this update.<p>So the article is &quot;correct&quot;, but not really in a useful way.<p>OTOH, this is more a natural side effect of how software development works than any malicious intent on Apple&#x27;s part. Letting users opt into specific OS patches would be a maintaince &#x2F; security nightmare.')
