I don&#x27;t know if the public generally &quot;vilifies anyone who understands taxes&quot;. Some certainly do. But I would point out that those two things are separate and distinct from one another.<p>I think there are greater obstacles for the collective of ordinary people being able to effectively change the law than reading comprehension, and one of those things is the nearly limitless capacity of large corporations to lobby government. The more they lobby, the less they pay, the more they earn, the more they lobby, the less they pay, the more they earn, the more they lobby, the less they pay, the more they earn.<p>You could add into that cycle &quot;...the less money is available to fund the government, the less money is available for education, the dumber the people get, the less  capable they become at managing their own government, etc...&quot;. Never minding of course that schools are largely funded by property taxes (stupid IMO), it still affects the overall availability of public funding.<p>Corporations should pay more because the tax code should be written to require it, not out of dumbness or virtuousness. The cycle of wealth inequality must be broken, and it&#x27;s not a simple thing to actually implement a solution.')
