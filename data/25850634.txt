I might have read a PDF on my phone once or twice, out of sheer necessity, but it&#x27;s painful.  But the mobile device I most want to have a better reading experience for PDFs – and documents in general – is my eReader. I&#x27;m not especially impressed with the ePub format, though I can see its attraction in making possible ereaders with very limited hardware.<p>Yes ereaders all will show you PDFs, but by design the layout is fixed. In most cases, to get the text big enough to read I can&#x27;t fit a whole page, so I end up scrolling around painfully.  Sometimes I can show a full page and, with my glasses, am able to read the text. Sometimes the document is in 2-page landscape mode, which never works.')
