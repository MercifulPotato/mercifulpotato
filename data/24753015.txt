I think I might have gotten as much as 30% of the way through... I reached the windy tunnel, but didn’t collect much in the way of exotic equipment beyond the  icer.<p>I love the emergent gameplay that comes out of that clever teleportation mechanic, and the amazingly robust physics. As you say, it plays fair -- the enemies use the same teleporters you do, and the monkeys jump in honest parabolas. It’s great how just about everything is destructible, although usually needing much more firepower than you have available.<p>I used to enjoy just zooming around the central cave with my jetpack, dodging the guided missiles that one of the tall robots launched from its side-tunnel. If you infuriated it enough, it would fall off the ledge and end up at the bottom of the cave!<p>Wonderful game, and an amazing technical achievement.')
