Brave offered a pre-search affiliate option for some keywords before the use navigated. Our mistake was doing this for fully-qualified domains too.

They&#x27;re opt-in. And they&#x27;re built on privacy and anonymity. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brave.com&#x2F;rewards" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brave.com&#x2F;rewards</a> for more. A quick summary: users who opt-in to Brave Ads receive a regional catalog of ads. Their browser, locally on their device, studies the catalog for relevant items. When an ad can be shown (users determine frequency), a notification is displayed. At this time, 70% of the associated revenue is directed towards the user.<p>Brave Rewards is a way for users to support content creators on the Web without having to sign up for services, hand over personal information, or dig into their own pocket. It&#x27;s a way to passively translate your attention into real, substantive support for the sites you visit.')
