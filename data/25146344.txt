QAnon is just the latest adaptation of solipsistic, uncritical, and delusional thinking that started long before the internet and will continue long after it dies. Ever wonder what happened to flat earth theory? That used to be the &quot;viral&quot; bad idea of the time, but if you look around now it&#x27;s practically dead. It&#x27;s dead because flat earthers have moved on to QAnon [1].  &quot;Wealthy democrats drink the blood of children&quot; is literally a random stupid idea that only spreads because these idiots all talk to each other. It could be anything; In a different decade they would instead be talking about the Freemasons, or a flat earth, or the Jewish agenda. The common theme is not the idea or the politics, it&#x27;s the broken mentality that creates a worldview in which nothing is your fault, everything bad is caused by inhuman others, and you are one of the few smart enough to see what others cannot.<p>It&#x27;s foolish to think that censoring these people actually solves anything. Because you never addressed the broken psychology that attracts them to this garbage in the first place, they&#x27;ll continue finding other outlets, your attempts to censor them only feeding their delusions further. Censorship might help you avoid them on the internet, but let&#x27;s see if you can avoid them at the polls.<p>[1] In Search Of A Flat Earth <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JTfhYyTuT44" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JTfhYyTuT44</a>')
