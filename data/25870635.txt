Item(by='LukasReschke', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611314007, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25870514, text='&gt; Most rewrites fails because the team rewriting is not the team that did the initial development.<p>Looking at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;owncloud&#x2F;core&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;contributors" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;owncloud&#x2F;core&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;contributors</a>, most of the initial core contributors contribute now to Nextcloud instead.<p>I am interested in seeing how the rewrite affects end-users. Currently, it seems to be mainly focused on File Sync and I don&#x27;t see things such as calendar or contacts management. (they totally could appear in the future though)<p>I&#x27;d assume that limiting the scope of components, makes a rewrite also easier. Nextcloud for example has a ton of hooks that allow you to write apps to customize the behaviour (want users to sign the ToS before downloading a share? Should be doable etc.). When you leave these out, implementing new things just got a whole lot easier :)\n(so I guess I am envious on the fact that they got rid of a ton of backwards compatible APIs to maintain :-) )<p>Disclaimer: Contributed to ownCloud for a few years, then to Nextcloud.')
