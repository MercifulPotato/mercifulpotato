So, I listen to audio-books or podcasts on my way to work, which I usually do riding a bike (because of Covid, I avoid taking other public transportation, or Uber, whenever I can help it). That gives me a solid hour and a half of listening per day. It&#x27;s much less than reading for the same amount of time, but it&#x27;s something.<p>Books that I &quot;read&quot; this way in the last few months, and which I enjoyed tremendously: Peter the Great by Robert Massie, Pacific Crucible by Ian Toll, The Admirals by Walter Borneman.')
