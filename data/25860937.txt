It would be nice to see a refocus on simplification and speed while eliminating things that involve taking shortcuts or adding backdoors for NSA.<p>Also, it would be interesting to see significant changes with the instruction set.<p>But I personally doubt Intel will get back on the path to greatness any time soon.  However, any steps in the right direction will bring more competition in the market, which will ultimately benefit consumers.  So this has to be a win, even if it only shows us that Intel is going to keep fighting.')
