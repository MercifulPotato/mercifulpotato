There are multiple different cloud providers, multiple different payment providers, and you can always use the web as a distribution model instead of apps.  You can buy your own servers and run Kubernetes on them if you want a cloud-like platform you have control over.  It&#x27;s never been easier to set up your own infrastructure if you need it.<p>If your app is so objectionable that you&#x27;ve somehow managed to violate the content policies of ALL of these players, I really don&#x27;t see anything as wrong.  Nobody is entitled to a platform.  I mean their app is basically a breeding ground for right-wing terrorists, and we almost had members of Congress murdered because they provided space for those people to coordinate.<p>Reminds me of the classic quote:<p>“If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you&#x27;re the asshole.”<p>No fundamental right has been violated.')
