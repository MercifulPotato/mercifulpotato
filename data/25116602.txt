At this point it seems like you just want to sow confusion. If I had misinterpreted your words in some way, you could have clarified the misunderstanding like 10 times by now. Instead, you choose to reply in snarks like saying I&#x27;m confused, or asking me to read your comment again. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any misunderstanding. You took an extreme position that didn&#x27;t hold up to scrutiny, and you don&#x27;t want to defend your position or back down, so you just reply in snarks instead. If there is some kind of misunderstanding, please do go ahead and explain what the misunderstanding is.')
