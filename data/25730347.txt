At the same time, when we live in a world where <i>everything</i> is privatized (and monopolized) you very quickly run out of options.  Host it yourself?  What if all server companies refuse to sell to you, or the internet service providers refuse to provide you with connectivity?  Do you need to lay your own fibre and fab your chips?  Where do you get those supplies?  It&#x27;s tough.')
