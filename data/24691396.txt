My posture has been pretty bad for neck pain, as I prioritized avoiding carpal tunnel. Now that I have a relaxed neck, I&#x27;m finding that I still get neck pain due to shoulder position. So having built a zero-g solution for my neck (i.e reclined with monitors still &quot;in front&quot; of my eyes), I am still working on shoulder and arm positions. I thought solving awful neck position would resolve the pain but it didnt. However, removing that problem now allows me to be sensitive to arm position, and all the times i&#x27;m using muscles to grab the mouse, or reach for a key.<p>My WIP involves a Zero G chair from relax-the-back, a sit-stand desk from which I mount the three monitors only, and a side table for the Mac. I dropped the $$$ on the chair because (a) it is motorized so I can change position throughout the day slightly, and (b) because if I ever have to go back to the office 100%, the chair is nice enough to put in the living room. The sit-stand desk allows moving the monitors up and down. Finally I have a couple of pieces of foam, with an MDF board glued on top for a workspace. The foam rests on the chairs arm rests, and now also two more side-tables just to support the foam. I use two magic keyboards, one for each hand (karabiner is required to make the cmd key etc work across keyboards)<p>It is a WIP. Step 1 was taking the load off my neck. I can now totally relax it during the day, with the result that I am now taller. Step 2 is taking the load of my shoulders. My second iteration has resulted in my elbows being slightly above my shoulders, so I&#x27;ll be needing to get some thinner foam.<p>I&#x27;m in for about $5k so far, mostly the chair.<p>Will hopefully get to a writeup when it is 100% comfortable.')
