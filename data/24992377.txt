Since volunteering at the Hawk Conservation Trust in the UK I&#x27;ve learnt lots of useful tips that apply even when you can just see a little silhouette. For example:<p>- Falcons have relatively scythe-shaped wings while Hawks have more rounded wings relative to Falcons<p>- Hawks and Eagles have more pronounced &#x27;fingers&#x27; at the ends of their wings relative to Falcons<p>- Buzzards and Kites: Buzzards are more stubby and have a diamond shaped tail; Kites have longer wings and a forked tail<p>- There are similar differences with respect to the length of the tail.<p>Some raptors have diagnostic flight patterns: Kestrels hover in place, Kites perform extremely dynamic acrobatics, especially in groups. Even when you can see the plumage, it doesn&#x27;t always help - there can be significant differences between juveniles and adult males and females.')
