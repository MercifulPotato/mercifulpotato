My GP is at Stanford, although she only seems to practice once a week or something (it can be hard to get an appointment).<p>I go to the doctor when something&#x27;s bothering me, but that&#x27;s about it. It&#x27;s never been suggested that I go regularly. (I&#x27;m not quite 40 yet, so maybe that&#x27;s the difference?)<p>My dentist on the other hand, sends me a postcard every 6mo.. :)')
