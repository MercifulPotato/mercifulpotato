I wondered about this and went to search around a bit, and found this bit[1] (though this is more about CRT TV)<p>&gt; When we used to manufacture TVs, we&#x27;d produce them for customers in the southern hemisphere too. When building these, we had to run them through our production lines upside down.<p>&gt; When the old cathode ray tube TVs were built, the earth&#x27;s magnetic field was taken into account during the production process. This ensured the current flowed the right way through the TV and so the TV was able to function normally.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SonyUKTEC&#x2F;status&#x2F;1228239522166501376" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SonyUKTEC&#x2F;status&#x2F;1228239522166501376</a>')
