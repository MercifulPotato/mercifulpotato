Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=[25922384], score=None, time=1611703661, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25922044, text='&gt; I sincerely don&#x27;t understand why &quot;won&quot; is in quotation marks – I think you meant to say &quot;the popular vote isn&#x27;t something that can be won since we have the electoral college&quot; – and if that&#x27;s the case, let me clarify that what I mean is that she received a significantly higher number of votes than Trump did.<p>Yes. It&#x27;s like &quot;winning&quot; the first 100m of a 400m race. If the runners were in a 100m race, they would run differently.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t understand the point you&#x27;re making here.<p>The point is that there was a significant third-party vote in 2016, so it&#x27;s not like Clinton had a particularly large vote share overall. The same vote share &quot;lost&quot; the popular vote in 2004, where third parties were less significant.<p>&gt; Russian hacking was discussed prominently during the presidential debates in 2016, so I have to disagree with you on that point.<p>Of email servers. Not election systems.<p>&gt; That may be true, but I haven&#x27;t yet heard a good-faith argument for reforms (or in fact any argument for reforms) from people objecting to the 2020 election, nor any sense of what those reforms would be aside from things that could also be described as voter suppression<p>The fact that Democrats can describe something as &quot;voter suppression&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean anything. Many things Democrats object to, such as Voter ID laws or signature matching, are prevalent in European countries. In Switzerland, mail-in voting has strict signature matching requirements. In Pennsylvania, it was the subject of a civil rights lawsuit. Mail in voting is, in general, discouraged in most of Europe. France had it, then abandoned it in the 1970s, due to voter fraud.<p>Other countries don&#x27;t run elections like we do: with a flurry of last-minute lawsuits trying to chip away at any sort of rules or deadlines. That&#x27;s not a healthy way to run an election system.')
