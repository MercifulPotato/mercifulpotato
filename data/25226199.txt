In my country (France) some are in the street as a lifestyle choice, or are only pretending being in need to leech on charity. Those people generally refuse food and take offense if you offer some. On the other hand, there are people who are genuinly suffering, hungry who will gladly take food when offered. The trick is too distinguish between the two (the latter are in fact, quite rare, I&#x27;d rate really struggling beggars are less than 10%). Looking them in the eyes is the way to spot them, people who will accept food have a different gaze and their suffering is readable on their face.')
