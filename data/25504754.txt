It&#x27;s not really &quot;light&quot; but it&#x27;s much much less of a beast than the 400&#x2F;2.8. I really like it - it feels like it hits a sweet spot for me in the weight&#x2F;light gathering ability&#x2F;quality trade off and the quality is indeed excellent. But there&#x27;s an argument that a 70-200&#x2F;2.8 plus a 2x TC is very close in quality these days, gets you more flexibility and is a bit less unwieldy for a loss of only half a stop in light gathering ability at 400mm.')
