Specially notorious was Picnic CSS[1] where many of the issues were on the level of &quot;hey can you give me the code for X&quot; or &quot;how do you do X&quot; where X was a general CSS question and not related to the library at all. I&#x27;ve also received unkind words when I closed some of my repos issues as a PR [2][3]:<p>&gt; If you spot a bug or any other issue you may go to hell because this software is officially Bug Free(TM).<p>&gt; part of offering these to the public through open software is maintaining them and allowing feedback from users.<p>&gt; It seems umbrella.js project suffers the same desease.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed there was a strong push around 2016-2018 to recommend newbie programmers NOT to go to Stackoverflow, but instead to ask the questions straight in the Github issues. Turns out, the problem was low quality questions all along, and that just converted an issue that StackOverflow had solved long ago into burnout for open source developers on Github.<p>Github needs to step up their game and give authors more powerful tools, there&#x27;s so many entitled developers out there that will come and demand changes. It might make new devs feel less welcome, but the balance is tipped way too much to allow anyone to create massive spam for projects right now.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;picnicss.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;picnicss.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;franciscop&#x2F;picnic&#x2F;pull&#x2F;203&#x2F;files" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;franciscop&#x2F;picnic&#x2F;pull&#x2F;203&#x2F;files</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;franciscop&#x2F;picnic&#x2F;pull&#x2F;202" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;franciscop&#x2F;picnic&#x2F;pull&#x2F;202</a>')
