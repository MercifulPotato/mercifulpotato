Would you really say that restricting freedoms generally causes <i>severe</i> psychological distress? What about militaries around the world, that either through volunteer or conscription, severely restrict a soldier’s freedom and requires compulsory training and work?

There is a difference between stress and “severe psychological distress”.')
