It looks more like an individual race, than a synchronized collective effort.<p>In the scenario where only the old accept to get vaccinated, and the vaccine doesn&#x27;t reach the required threshold to stomp the virus. The virus become manageable, the economy reopen but the virus run rampant in the asymptotic population slowly mutating over-time until it finds a variant that is resistant to the vaccine by successfully infecting a vaccinated person.<p>And it just needs for this to happen in a large population cluster where the vaccination doesn&#x27;t reach the threshold, either because they do not have access to the vaccine yet or because some fraction of the population decide to  not get vaccinated, for everyone to get screwed-up again.<p>Then we get a new vaccine every year.')
