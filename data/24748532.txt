It&#x27;s the engines. I was able to experimentally connect &#x2F;one&#x2F; source of hum to tug boats specifically. Interestingly, though, the huge container ships that passed by did not make an audible noise.<p>One unfortunate effect of the name &quot;the hum&quot; is it kind of implies a single source. Realistically, it&#x27;s probably a whole collection of sources, including some real physical phenomena, and some tinnitus-like audio hallucinations.')
