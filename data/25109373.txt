I did say that the court would have to rule every single time. And if speech on the internet wasn&#x27;t centralized the way it is today then the court would have to make as many decisions as there are people making the same statement. That would not work effectively if the expressed opinion was backed and expressed by many people in many places.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget that the content of the opinion in question is not one on which a fruitful political debate can be built, you f<i></i> p<i></i>s ;) If it was, the court may have come to an entirely different conclusion.<p>I do not want to defend the court&#x27;s ruling here and I have too few insights into the Austrian political landscape to understand how (in-)adequate this decision might be. But the fact remains: If I live outside of Austria but my website is reachable from Austria, I can write whatever I want and have nothing to fear from an Austrian court as long as I am not trying to take my website-business to the Austrian market.<p>They may decide to block my IP inside Austria but that would hardly be global censorship (even if it&#x27;s still an issue worth fighting over).<p>The whole &quot;people couldn&#x27;t care less about FB&quot; talk really takes this to the wrong place and is making me tired as long as you misinterpret everything else and repeat my own statements as if it was a counter-argument.')
