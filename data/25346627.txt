I never made any such comment on the subjective experiences of listeners.<p>You can enjoy music and know it&#x27;s &quot;junk food.&quot; I like listening to plenty of bad music. I don&#x27;t judge anyone for what they enjoy.<p>To call Philip Glass a master of his domain, a rightfully-celebrated contributor to Western art music, or any of this other crap - that&#x27;s what I take issue with. Enjoy his music all you want - it&#x27;s all available and in print, and his various corporate music labels make sure of that. Just don&#x27;t mislead others who may actually take HN users at their word.')
