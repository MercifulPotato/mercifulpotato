Re: Cognex - it&#x27;s interesting and good to know. I&#x27;ve mentioned Instrumental, because based on my brief review, Landing AI&#x27;s platform focuses on exactly the same sub-domain (even specimen photos looked similar to me), not general manufacturing inspection. I have looked up info on ViDi and, based on Crunchbase, the company was founded in 2012, three years earlier than Instrumental. Thus, I admit that the label &quot;pioneer&quot; in my original comment is incorrect and I&#x27;m respectfully taking that part back. Nevertheless, I still think that Instrumental is the leader (or, at least, one of the leaders) in their respective category.<p>P.S. I glanced at your website and was pleasantly surprised to learn that you have graduated from Georgia Tech - I have recently worked at GT for 4+ years (and was affiliated with both ME and MSE schools). It&#x27;s a small world ... :-)')
