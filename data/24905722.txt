As a finn with norwegian friends it&#x27;s the norwegians who are the most nature-loving and it is no suprise since their landscape makes it hard to ignore the elements, and easy to enjoy the views.<p>The finns probably share the extreme relaxation part of nature with swedes. Going to your cabin in the woods with family or friends and leaving your phone on the table to socialize or relax with those around you. A norwegian might like to &quot;relax&quot; by facing the elements and summiting a local mountain :)')
