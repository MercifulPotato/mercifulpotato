How does Truth prevail in the public square?<p>Even Good Samaritan Chomsky has no response to the Paradox of Tolerance.<p>As someone who&#x27;s still on the free speech bandwagon. I think that this situations is pretty straight forward. One of the founding motivations for free speech is that it allows us to form accurate beliefs. Any approach that uses censorship to deal with the problem of misinformation and lying doesn&#x27;t even pass the sniff test as a solution. This is because if the censor is factually wrong, it&#x27;s game over. There is no recovery from that situation. The second you start filtering information that disagrees with your beliefs is the second you lose the ability to change them when new information comes in.<p>You can&#x27;t fix the issues with free speech by selectively attacking individual topics based on your belifes about ground level truth. You have to do it at least 1 meta level up. Ask yourself, if humanity was a collection of nodes in a network, and social media was the protocol, &quot;how do I choose a protocol which maximises the probability that the nodes in the network all converge to the truth <i>even when I don&#x27;t know it a priori</i>&quot;.<p>You&#x27;ll quickly find that platforms like twitter, instagram, and tiktok are the opposite of the answer. Each of them is engineered to minimise critical thinking, source checking, viewpoint sharing, and discussion. Facebook and reddit are bit better, at least on those you can post an essay and respond. Hacker news is even better, it has a simple UI that prioritizes text.<p>You also get more interesting ideas, like integrated cryptographic signing into social media platforms, or tuning feed algorithms to promote discussion using simple unbiased mechanism.<p>There&#x27;s a whole bunch of shit we can do to solve the problem. Most of it hasn&#x27;t been tried. Don&#x27;t let people who are extremely intolerant use the paradox of tolerance to shut down opinions, ideas, and cultures they won&#x27;t tolerate.')
