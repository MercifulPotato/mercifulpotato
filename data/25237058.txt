Item(by='beagle3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606564966, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25236955, text='20 or so years later, it is my impression that there are no compilers that can do enough ILP (on software not specifically written for the Itanium) to justify the Itanium’s VLIW.<p>Intel licensed some stuff to Cyrix, VIA, AMD, Harris and possibly others at the time. But if AMD didn’t license AMD64 back (by way of cross licensing) things might have been grim for Intel back in 2003-2008 when AMD was killing it previously.<p>Intel did nothing out of the goodness of their heart, and neither did AMD - so I’m not sure why it is bothering you that people are cheering for AMD for providing (at this point) a technically and economically better product, and hating on Intel for being a fat cat. The pendulum may swing back sooner or later, both technically&#x2F;economically and public opinion wise.')
