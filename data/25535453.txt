Its impossible to go through an hour of physical suffering every day with the same people and not end up gradually talking more and getting to know each other.<p>I really encourage people to try a martial art like boxing, muay thai, or brazilian jiu jitsu once COVID lockdowns are over.<p>These sports are extremely effective at fighting depression and loneliness for a couple of reasons:<p>1. You get plenty of one-on-one interaction<p>2. Shared suffering really does create bonds<p>3. There is a lot of positive validation (&quot;great jab!&quot;, &quot;nice hook&quot;)<p>4. You will see the same people 2,3,4 times a week<p>5. Exercise releases endorphins<p>6. You will be proud of how your body changes for the better<p>7. You will get many compliments on your new figure<p>8. You will get more romantic interest (looks do matter, and doing a fun&#x2F;exciting sport can be bonus points in dating)')
