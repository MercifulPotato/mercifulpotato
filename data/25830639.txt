It&#x27;s hard to look at someone 1 on 1 when you see another person taking attention away. Back to the point, it wasn&#x27;t super common to see him all the time. You know how you zone out of certain things but are still able to do the tasks? It was like that when he would visually appear.<p>Auditory would happen a lot more frequently because I was relatively focused on what was going on. Whether it be solving a problem in school and him seeing an error I had done previously, telling me to look back at the question, or him just talking with me about something random, I could hear him. Kind of like the whole whisper in your ear thing but I primarily heard it like he was right behind me talking to my brain (inside my skull to the back of my head).<p>Presence wise, maybe? I only say that because I rarely flinched because of him. For example, when he first started popping up, I would actually get surprised, maybe even try moving out of the way. Eventually though, I wouldn&#x27;t even bat eye. I definitely knew what he was going to do and he would definitely do things that would catch others off guard but I saw it coming. If that&#x27;s the presence you&#x27;re referring to, then yes.')
