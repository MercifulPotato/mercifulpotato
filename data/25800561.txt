Item(by='tgsovlerkhgsel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610778987, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25794273, text='&gt; Element is less polished than Signal app<p>Exactly, which means that it lost.<p>There are opportunities that are rare or unique, and it doesn&#x27;t matter that you&#x27;re &quot;catching up&quot; - either you&#x27;re good enough when the opportunity arises, or you&#x27;ve missed that window.<p>You might get a second chance later, but this opportunity is lost, and the options aren&#x27;t &quot;Signal or Matrix&quot;, the options are &quot;Signal or frustrate people, get them to go back to Whatsapp, and be even more reluctant to switch later&quot;.<p>And even if through some magic Element was polished right now: Signal has been polished for years now, and as a result, has built up a brand and user base.<p>I&#x27;m not going to be able to switch all my already switch-reluctant friends to something they haven&#x27;t heard about and that nobody uses; I am going to be able to switch them to Signal, because they&#x27;ve already been pestered about it by several people, have heard about it in the news, and (except for today, which is a huge problem for adoption&#x2F;switching people over), <i>it works</i>.<p>At least on Android, Element is simply not suitable for end users. I&#x27;m not talking about some poorly formatted UI, I&#x27;m talking about confusing&#x2F;broken UX and features that don&#x27;t properly work.<p>So I put my tech elitism away and do what works, because otherwise we&#x27;ll be stuck with Facebook.<p>Edit: Forgot the biggest problem: Matrix has no chance because it doesn&#x27;t use phone numbers as a forced default. With Signal, if your friends have already installed it, you can just start using it with them. With Matrix, you can&#x27;t. This is one of the hard choices that Moxie made that is a bit of a dick move but was absolutely necessary.')
