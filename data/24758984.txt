Otherwise we&#x27;re just talking fantasy.<p>For the most part, I do not think we should discuss the limits of engineering, that is what&#x27;s practical or not, because we&#x27;re nobody to say what is practical to a type II or type III civilization.<p>My dad&#x27;s astronomy professor told the class it&#x27;s impossible by the laws of physics to create a telescope that can see exoplanets. He went through the equations to show you could never build a telescope mirror to accomplish that. What he didn&#x27;t think of is we found other ways to create bigger telescopes and we used gravitational lensing to zoom in on a distant star. Nothing in our understanding of physics changed to allow that, merely a change in how we looked at the problem. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so arrogant. We don&#x27;t know everything about what is possible or not, and one day we might just see a way around limitations that seem absolute today. Our short history is filled with us doing that again and again.')
