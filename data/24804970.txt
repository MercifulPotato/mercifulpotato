The key differentiator: Turning down a request does not lead to anything negative. In particular, the requestor is not displeased or upset. If he&#x2F;she is, then it was likely a demand disguised as a request.<p>On the other hand, fulfilling a request can, and often will, lead to a positive. It&#x27;s still a request.<p>If you&#x27;re going to be upset about it, don&#x27;t phrase it as a request. A big chunk of the population will be annoyed by it.<p>Soapbox aside, getting to your comment: If someone is giving me that money unsolicited, I may or may not give a thank you. Context is extremely relevant. I did not give a &quot;Thank you&quot; to the recent stimulus check, for example. And I&#x27;ve definitely had fights with people <i>voluntarily</i> giving me stuff over and over and complaining about my not saying &quot;thank you&quot; (or even worse, not reciprocating). I&#x27;ve had to forbid them from giving me gifts in the future. I&#x27;m not saying my attitude is the norm, but it is &quot;one of the norms&quot;.<p>The book <i>Influence</i> covers this topic in a lot of detail, and this is commonly discussed in Negotiations books. The bottom line: Be wary of gifts, and either reject if you suspect reciprocation is desired (which could mean &quot;Thank you&quot;), or make the understanding explicit and keep the reciprocity in mind. Of course, this goes at odds with several cultures.<p>As much as we like to talk about &quot;open source&quot; culture, it doesn&#x27;t exist. It gets argued to death every time it comes up, which is a good sign it doesn&#x27;t exist. A big chunk of the SW world, if not the majority, do not feel a need to reciprocate - even with a thank you. (Most of that chunk are OK giving a &quot;Thank you&quot;, and this is not a contradiction).')
