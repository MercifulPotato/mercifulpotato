Google does.<p>The problem is that once Google gets their hands on our sweet data (in the off chance you don&#x27;t have an android phone), then they will definitely put that data in &#x27;good use&#x27;.<p>I see some (marketable) benefits though... Fitbits can be tracked. Imagine walking past a store, a sensor with &#x27;talk&#x27; with your fitbit, and pull your G-ad profile and a screen will display the ad you missed to see on your gmail. And this is what I need to see. Walking past a sex shop and being flashed this huge wierd looking dildo with lights and lasers, because Google &#x27;knows&#x27; I enjoy sex and Star Wars (not combined though).<p>And all that thanks to my FitBit bracelet :) \n(my android phone is security-hardened enough to not run in the background and&#x2F;or transmit &#x27;stuff&#x27;)')
