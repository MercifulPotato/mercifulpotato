Also giving the trainees 30 hours of work to do per day is a realistic although brutal way to teach prioritization.  Certainly, after graduation, most officers are going to use radio procedures or legal processes or excellence in first aid is expected a lot more than calculus on the job.<p>Personally I thought army basic training was OK other than not having a full nights sleep for two months.  Certainly I could never pass a calculus exam on a couple hours of sleep over the past weeks.  It really is amazing how unproductive humans are after a couple hours of hard work or even just ten hours sitting in a chair.<p>Also your job assignment for officers is given based on your GPA and your GPA will be based on a curved test.  So its not that cadets are accepted in a grueling process and then it smooth sailing, its more like the grueling process just begins and whomever high scores the calc test gets branched Aviation in three years whereas the guy at the bottom of the calc test gets Chemical corps or ADA (supposedly the work-life balance of ADA is the worst in the entire Army...)')
