I work at a University and navigating the bureaucracy just to pay for Asana was an utter shit show. Especially once the university procurement team learned ANOTHER department was paying for it, and suggested we just use their license... smh. In a similar vein, I often opt for yearly billing even not discounted just to not have to submit receipts and proof of purchases every month for the things we are allowed to purchase.')
