IRC, Telegram, matrix, etc.<p>I was thinking about this yesterday actually. I’ve been having a lot of questions about this new linux distro I’ve been using, and piling them on in the IRC channel, but if no one answers it right away it gets buried by the next message after me. So I kept re-asking it for multiple days before realizing, you know what if this is something that only even a few people might know how to help me with, I should probably leave it to “steep” on a proper Discourse topic, or reddit thread, or stackoverflow question or whatever. I hadn’t done that because I was just super impatient and knew it might be a good half a day or 2 or 3 days before I get a reply, but it’s much more likely to get one at all than in the IRC, where someone butting in with a meme or something right after me means my question might as well be nonexistent in the conversation stream.')
