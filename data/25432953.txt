Easy enough, all you have to do is add the comment field to the GraphQL query for the article search page, it&#x27;s a GraphQL success story!<p>But now when the article search page loads, it runs 1 GraphQL query that retrieves 20 articles, and for each one it runs the SQL query to load comments.  So instead of making 2 database queries it&#x27;s 21.<p>Now we have performance scaling along with the number of results on the page, which is not ideal.')
