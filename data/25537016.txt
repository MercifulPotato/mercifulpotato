That&#x27;s the issue that made other models come forward</i><p>Keynes worked after stagflation as well:<p>&gt; <i>I just do not think that is right. Stagflation is very easily explained: you just need an ‘accelerationist’ Phillips curve (i.e. where the coefficient on expected inflation is one), plus a period in which monetary policymakers systematically underestimate the natural rate of unemployment. You do not need rational expectations, or any of the other innovations introduced by New Classical economists.</i><p>[…]<p>&gt; <i>Stagflation did not kill IS-LM. In fact, because empirical validity was so central to the methodology of macroeconomics at the time, it adapted to stagflation very quickly. This gave a boost to the policy of monetarism, but this used the same IS-LM framework. If you want to find the decisive event that led to New Classical economists winning their counterrevolution, it was the theoretical realisation that if expectations were rational, but inflation was described by an accelerationist Phillips curve with expectations about current inflation on the right hand side, then deviations from the natural rate had to be random. The fatal flaw in the Keynesian&#x2F;Monetarist theory of the 1970s was theoretical rather than empirical.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mainlymacro.blogspot.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;understanding-new-classical-revolution.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mainlymacro.blogspot.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;understanding-new-c...</a><p>&gt; <i>But my small quarrel with Simon involves how we got into this state. He dismisses the stagflation of the 1970s, on the grounds that IS-LM macroeconomics quickly adapted to the new information. Indeed, this happened very fast: by 1978 both the leading undergraduate macro textbooks, Dornbusch-Fischer and Gordon, had accelerationist Phillips curves and extensive discussions of stagflation. (Compare this with new classical macro, which failed decisively in the 1980s, but never adjusted at all.)</i><p>&gt; <i>Nonetheless, I remember the 70s quite well, and stagflation did indeed play a role in the rise of new classical macro, albeit in a subtler way than the caricature that it proved Keynes wrong, or something like that.</i><p>&gt; <i>What mattered instead was the fact that stagflation had in effect been predicted by Friedman and Phelps; and the way they made that prediction was by taking a step in the direction of microfoundations. Specifically, they asked what a more or less rational price-setter would do in the face of persistent inflation; their answer was, raise prices preemptively, and if everyone did this it would shift the Phillips curve up by the amount of expected inflation. Sure enough, the Phillips curve did seem to shift as predicted.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krugman.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;28&#x2F;stagflation-and-the-fall-of-macroeconomics&#x2F;?smid=tw-NytimesKrugman&amp;seid=auto" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krugman.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;28&#x2F;stagflation-and...</a><p>What &quot;other models&quot; are you referring to?')
