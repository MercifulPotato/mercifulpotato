This doesn&#x27;t work well for general stuff like news sites, but webcomics that do their own ads, or a super focused forum like candlepower or head-fi? Contextual ads are ideal there.<p>Second most effective are platform-specicic hypertargeted ads, such as Facebook ads. Lot of misses there too, but their first party targeting is good to the point of actually giving me some interesting content.<p>In practice the third party &quot;contextual&quot; ads mostly are misses for me. Wow, another ad for the home improvement thing I either researched and bought last month, or that I was looking up on a whim and don&#x27;t have any intention of actually purchasing.')
