How often does that happen?  5%?  That might still make you significantly more likely to buy the next vacuum than a random member of the population.<p>Of course, if you bought a vacuum <i>and</i> returned one, that would be the ultimate targeting point.  I don&#x27;t know if &quot;they just returned a vacuum cleaner&quot; is a datum provided to advertisers.<p>It also might be that people usually don&#x27;t return it until they&#x27;ve chosen one that they think would be better (possibly ordering the new one, even waiting until they receive it and trying it out before starting the return process).')
