They were attracted to its promise of long-term support and longevity, and, perhaps more vitally, it&#x27;s what all the other organisations who sought an &quot;enterprise-friendly&quot; distribution were running.<p>Over time, much of my tooling and deployment processes has come to presume CentOS. If the customer base overwhelmingly runs CentOS, you build process for CentOS.<p>Thankfully, though, Systemd--for all its faults--has narrowed the painful deltas between Linux distributions enough that a switch back to a Debian target won&#x27;t be too painful.<p>Where&#x27;s your God now, &quot;CentOS is something we can depend on, it&#x27;s not just a rag-tag band of open-source hippies&quot;?')
