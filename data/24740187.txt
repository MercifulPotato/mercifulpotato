It was produced really nicely in the Farsi (Persian) language.<p>Anyone who has ever read the book &quot;Made to Stick&quot; (highly recommended) would immediately that this video was designed to be a viral disinformation campaign.<p>The video started so credibility talking about the virus, the family of virus it belongs to, it talked about genetics similarities, etc. All seem very credible. Then it comes the  disinformation gotcha:<p><i>To defeat COVID (with some beautiful inside the lungs animation ) talking about alveoli and how they function, when you are indoor you need to laugh deeply and very hard. This laughing hard gets rid of the virus, etc. etc.</i><p>Great idea, right? Seems like a way to exacerbate the spread of a deadly virus.<p>To me the quality of video made me think it was probably produce by a state or entity working for a state with budget.<p>If that is so I considered this incident as one of the first examples of using disinformation to commit genocide.<p>The problem with Telegram team working from the United Arab Emirates, it&#x27;s unclear to me if it&#x27;s being used to weaponize disinformation for evil means or not. \nFrom what I have seen, I believe, Telegram is being misused and it needs to be removed from the App Store.')
