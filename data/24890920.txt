The difference is very important.<p>Censorship is when you are prevented from publishing on your own platform. Content moderation is when a platform owner choses what can be published on theirs.<p>Twitter decided they did not want their platform used to spread what they considered to be Russian disinformation and propaganda, but they in no way prevented the NY Post or anyone else from publishing the story.<p>In the same way, when Hacker News and other well-run platforms remove or hide abusive and troll-like comments they are not infringing on anyone&#x27;s 1st Amendment rights. A site does not lose the right to moderate content just because they become successful.')
