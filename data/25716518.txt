I think that&#x27;s part of the allure of Cast Iron. It&#x27;s a personal thing where people develop their own methods through experience.<p>However I try to avoid using soapy chemicals on my cast iron. If I do use soap it&#x27;s literally one drop onto the scrub brush instead of the pan. Although I&#x27;m sure that if you went heavier on the soap nothing would come of it anyway. Most of the time I use water and a scrub brush. I scrub with good speed and not a lot of pressure to break off lingering debris.<p>And if I&#x27;m going to be using it the next day I&#x27;ll leave it shiny, but if it&#x27;s going to sit for a couple days I&#x27;ll leave it on a little longer until it&#x27;s a little more matte looking. Not 100% matte, but not &quot;shiny&quot; either. Just a sheen. That way it won&#x27;t be sticky during storage where it will collect dust and contaminants.')
