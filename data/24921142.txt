It seems to me there are very few people who have that power, and even if a great majority of us wanted it, we have no way to enact it (and no way of knowing if it was actually enacted; we could be told it had been done, but that could easily be an inscrutable lie)<p>2) If they were actually shut down, what would the people who worked there do? Highly intelligent, skilled, with low morals, used to performing nefarious activities; they would go on to be in shadow NGOs, organized crime, reform under other names, etc.')
