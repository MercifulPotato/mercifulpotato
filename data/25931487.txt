With gas, especially with cell phone gps, you basically need no planning or forethought. You just drive, and if you think you are runnning low, you just look for a gas station along your route.<p>So yes, Tesla has a vastly superior charging network compared to to the others, but it is still vastly inferior to the gas station network.')
