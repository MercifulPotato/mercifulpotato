Quite many charity organizations find lots of people to man them. Universities are another example. Some people go into the industry, others become researchers.<p>Instead of paying 10 people 100k annually, I&#x27;d rather pay 20 people 50k. That&#x27;s enough to live a comfortable life in most places, including most places in US. Would it give you the people who are in tech only for the money? Probably not. Maybe you don&#x27;t really want them in the first place, because even though they might be smart and work well, maybe they aren&#x27;t the &quot;best&quot; people <i>for the job</i>, as they don&#x27;t optimize by what&#x27;s best for their users but by what&#x27;s best for them.')
