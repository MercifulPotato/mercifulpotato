I&#x27;ve been using 33mail heavily for a decade and my monthly usage is 40MB which puts me in the premium tier, but I&#x27;m near the top percentile of bandwidth usage.<p>The premium tier also has a lot of other benefits, like custom domains and anonymous replies - so lots of users upgrade to it without being close to the bandwidth limit.<p>If you do hit the limit we&#x27;ll first make sure that it&#x27;s not just a temporary spike, and then we&#x27;ll send a few warning emails.<p>At this point you can entire upgrade or block some aliases you don&#x27;t need that are using a lot of bandwidth, this is fairly easy to do in our UI.<p>It is extremely rare that we&#x27;ve had to block a user due to excessive bandwidth usage, in fact I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;ve ever had to do that.')
