You can imagine that the size of your payment greatly influenced how you were treated.<p>In Russia prior to USSR, facilitation fees is how all officials earned money, that was the official policy. That&#x27;s only 100 years ago that is was not even considered corruption &#x2F; bribery. Obviously that disease is still festering in Russia and the country as a whole is paying a grave toll for it.<p>Lastly, do keep in mind that as a local you can probably tell is a payment can be declined withoit repercussions, but as a foreigner you don&#x27;t really know.')
