Suppose you use a lot of banks (and&#x2F;or your friends&#x27; personal sites), imagine being able to update your address just once and automatically push that information to all banks you&#x27;re subbed to and only the banks you&#x27;re subbed to and have the push still go through &quot;immediately&quot; (on startup) if one bank is experiencing downtime.  Could be interesting.  This is part of the &quot;personal server&quot; idea...everyone should easily be able to create a personal server that&#x27;s a pure function of its event history and that is logically consistent with the network (clients, other servers, routing tables, blah blah).  You can make a personal server without having to worry about downtime because your server&#x27;s event history will always be consistent with the network&#x27;s.<p>Then there&#x27;s a mesh routing protocol built over current infrastructure so that any identity can figure out how to contact another and have the routing be correct.<p>Limited address space, spammers can just be blocked.<p>That&#x27;s the best I can do off the top of my head.  Criticize the execution all you want but I think the idea is really interesting.<p>Edit: imagine dealing with the fookin IRS using all this cool stuff.  I can only dream')
