They definitely bother me, but I&#x27;m more worried by &quot;organic&quot; content. It&#x27;s really the algorithmically curated feeds that I see being harmful. My dad has always been kind of wing-nutty, but it was localized. He was suspicious about things like Ruby Ridge and the Waco Siege when I was a kid. Now he is constantly repeating some garbage meme he encountered on FB. He is completely steeped in disinfo, and actively seeks out more of it by joining basically any FB group named something like &quot;Real Trump Patriot Boat Lovers&quot; and entices him with a meme about locking up the Clintons. If I watch him use it on his iPad, his feed is just torrent of crap, most of it endorsed by his friends and self-selected bubble. That&#x27;s the harm, he was susceptible to disinfo to begin with, but now with the social proof that all his friends agree, they are escalating to more and more radical shit. At this point they&#x27;re all saying how they won&#x27;t stand for another inch of Corona rules and the governor is about to have an uprising on their hands. We don&#x27;t even have any Corona restrictions in my state, but he&#x27;s radicalized against them regardless.')
