Why are they learning&#x2F;re-learning Python, C++, SQL, C#, college math? Nobody will be fooled by that; at 15 YoE they will be evaluated on what they have done over a career, not over the last month.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s all about how much time you can spend on Leetcode.<p>The author is playing a game built for new grads. Here&#x27;s a secret, speaking as an (ex) Facebook interviewer:<p>Facebook&#x27;s hiring pipeline is optimized for new grads, but its hiring needs are senior engineers. They know this, but you can&#x27;t build a high-volume interview pipeline for senior engineers: there&#x27;s not enough of them, their skill set is too varied. So Facebook is kind of at a loss, but in general if you have 15 YoE and can show you&#x27;re good, they want to hire you. In particular they&#x27;ll try to find deep domain experts (&quot;pirates&quot;, their term) to evaluate you.<p>So be prepared to demonstrate basic competence in coding, and also some deep expertise. T-shaped engineers, as they say.')
