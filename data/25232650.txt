Windows is <i>far</i>, <i>far</i> superior in this over macOS and even Linux [1]. Windows 1.0 apps run on a modern Windows 10 install. For that to be a thing on Windows on ARM, you need high emulation performance. The Snapdragons that Windows on ARM devices come with just are not up to that task at all.<p>Making Windows on ARM more enjoyable to use and more accessible to developers (which are more likely to have Macs  than underpowered niche devices) should really incentivize Microsoft to get Windows to run on ARM Macs at least using virtualization. Virtualization on Apple Macs is solving a supply problem of high performance, reasonably easy to buy hardware for both Microsoft and Linux distros aiming to work well on ARM.<p>[1]: Although ironically, Wine on Linux&#x2F;Mac is often even better at running legacy Win32 programs than Windows is. But I digress.')
