I just thought I&#x27;d play the part. Maybe I&#x27;ll try red next week and see how that goes.<p>&#x2F;s<p>Actually, I set my living room to red because that&#x27;s my favorite. And I set my dining room to blue because eating is cool. And when you gotta <i>go</i> then just look for the green light in the hallway in front of the bathroom. And my office is definitely purple in the morning to show just how much I want to punch things because I have to work. It&#x27;s pink in the afternoon because pink noise from the freeway shouldn&#x27;t be limited to sounds.<p>At night I set all the lights to 15%. With the colors it&#x27;s dark enough to not be blinded when I want some water from the kitchen but also bright enough to see the contours of the door knob or kitchen table or dining chair so I don&#x27;t stab myself with any of the corners while walking blind.<p>What colors do you set your lights to?')
