Item(by='Seirdy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608829303, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25525422, text='Icons are rarely rendered at their intended size; there&#x27;s a good chance that your browser doesn&#x27;t render favicons at exactly 16px&#x2F;32px, and a slim minority of Android phones have homescreen icons that are exactly 192px&#x2F;500px.<p>This is why it&#x27;s important to design icons that look good when passed through a variety of downscaling algorithms, and to test with other browsers&#x2F;devices to make sure the icon comes out right.<p>Clients that download multiple icons can re-use cached icons with the same URL, which is why I re-used the 192px icon as the apple-touch-icon and re-used the mask-icon as the webmanifest&#x27;s monochrome icon. Of course, I tested it to make sure it looked good when downscaled.<p>The master icon (svg): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seirdy.one&#x2F;favicon.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seirdy.one&#x2F;favicon.svg</a><p>I made this icon specifically to have a tiny footprint (176 byte 32px favicon, 785 byte 192px icon) and to look good at just about any resolution when downscaled from the original, even on an e-ink display. I admit that my approach is a bit extreme, but most sites would benefit from something similar.')
