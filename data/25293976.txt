And on top of that, they might be reluctant to admit it.<p>If you really wanted to know, you&#x27;d have to show them the characters in isolation. Try for example 發. I bet it&#x27;s not going to be so straightforward.<p>In any case, most people don&#x27;t really get to have the choice but if you&#x27;re planning to learn both, going with traditional characters first is easier because the simplification is a many-to-one mapping: if you&#x27;ve only known simplified, you won&#x27;t be aware there are supposed to be different characters in place of the same one you&#x27;re familiar with. In other words, you don&#x27;t only have to learn something new but also unlearn what you know and got used to, and the latter part is always more difficult.<p>For instance (and to stay within the same example), both 發 and 髮, unrelated to each other, were simplified to the same 发. A person who only knows simplified is likely to incorrectly write *頭發 for &#x27;hair&#x27; (instead of the correct 頭髮), and there are 2.5M Google hits for this keyword (to be fair, many probably due to the automated conversion, and some might be an intentional pun).')
