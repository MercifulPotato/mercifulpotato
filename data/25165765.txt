I personally have a lot more than the average person does, because of my adventures around the world. I&#x27;ve always felt comfortable getting vaccines in the past, and I encourage others to do so.<p>In the case of the COVID-19 vaccine I am more than a little concerned it has been rushed into mass production, and we don&#x27;t have years of data about side effects and possible long-term consequences. We have certainly screwed up enough things in the past to put doubt in my mind we can rush something like this and not make a mistake we won&#x27;t know about for 5-10 years. I was talking to a Doctor friend last night who said she has concerns because a couple of the vaccines use genetic material.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I won&#x27;t get it, but I doubt I&#x27;ll be one of the first to rush, and I may drag my heels a little to see what happens.')
