I hate pulling those huge images on my 256GB MBP, but it works.\nOf course, only bigger labs do that, since individual researchers are often unfamiliar with Docker.<p>However, if I run my software on HPC cluster, that’s no longer an option. The HPC at my university doesn’t allow running Docker, only Singularity containers(which isn’t supported on Mac).')
