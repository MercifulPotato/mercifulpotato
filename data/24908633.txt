Thousands of stories are posted on Twitter every day by news outlets that did not request or include a response from their subject.<p>Now we have people claiming that not only does NYP have to request a response from its subject, it must also provide them the subject with source material for their article. Ridiculous.<p>Also, Joe Biden isn&#x27;t even the subject of the NYP article - Hunter Biden is. Yet you are implying that Joe Biden must have been given the full source materials of the article and an opportunity to examine and respond to them, or else Twitter can block the story.<p>Was Trump afforded the same opportunity to examine the source material of the NYT story about his supposed tax returns?<p>The NYT still hasn&#x27;t released that source material!')
