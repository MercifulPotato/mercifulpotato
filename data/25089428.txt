Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605316627, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25089111, text='&gt; As to &quot;getting out&quot; of &quot;being cancelled&quot; by &quot;mobs&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t know since I already have trouble identifying what that&#x27;s supposed to mean.<p>I have a strong suspicion that you know what I mean, you just don&#x27;t want to recognize that. If you indeed know nothing about cancel culture, I envy whatever bubble you reside in, and I wish I could organize my life to never encounter it too, however it is not so for me. If you pretend not to know about it because you don&#x27;t want to engage in discussion about it, well, I certainly can&#x27;t force you.<p>&gt; And, yes, of course there are people apologising for all sorts of behaviour that&#x27;s being criticised every day.<p>You may find it hard to believe, but I actually know people do such thing as &quot;apologizing&quot;. I do it myself once in a while. My question was in specific context of the comment &quot;Agreed. Apologizing may keep the mob size small and insignificant.&quot; and related to this context, not to general act of apologizing and whether or not it is practiced in human society. I think you have missed this context and from that follows your trouble to identify what I supposed to mean. I think I made it cleared now, or at least did as much as I could to make it clear.')
