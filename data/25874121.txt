Plenty of accessible options there that will diagnose a bad bottom-end or piston rings. Further, your average Joe can replace crank bearings in an afternoon and many could re-ring an engine with some help from youtube. Your average Honda will need this once every 200-400k miles (14-25 average 14k driving years) with proper oil changes.<p>There are a lot more components (cells) in a battery pack than rotating components in an average engine. I&#x27;m unsure if they&#x27;re generally individually addressable, but I know they&#x27;re not designed to be serviced at the cell level. That has you replacing the battery pack any time there is a problem, a many thousands of dollars adventure just in parts. There&#x27;s also no major differentiator from a software perspective between &quot;the battery is old and has reduced capacity&quot; and &quot;the battery is swelling and has reduced capacity&quot;. The latter could lead without warning to a catastrophic failure that would make a ringland failure laughable.<p>I do appreciate your view is held by many consumers who purchase a new or certified pre-owned car every N years.
