Item(by='mwfunk', descendants=None, kids=[25704514], score=None, time=1610221191, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25703341, text='This is the thing: you can always tell when people come from utterly useless propaganda bubbles by 2 huge red flags:<p>(1) They don&#x27;t understand the difference between editorial content and reporting, because the media outlets they follow do their best to blur the distinction, all the way down to not even making a distinction organizationally or professionally, and making it seem like more legitimate sources of information don&#x27;t make that distinction either. So the biggest red flag is that they don&#x27;t even realize that there are professional standards and practices for keeping those things separate, and they don&#x27;t understand things like fact checking or there being burdens of proof applied before something considered news reporting is published. To them, editorial content and news reporting are the same thing, with the same minimal burden of proof, because those are the nonexistent standards of literally every source of &quot;information&quot; they have.<p>(2) They think that when a media outlet voluntarily issues corrections (not from a lawsuit or threat of a lawsuit), that it&#x27;s a sign that that outlet is less reliable than the places they go that never ever issue corrections unless legally forced to. The reality is completely flipped around, but that&#x27;s their mentality. Culturally, that dovetails with &quot;never admit being wrong&quot; and &quot;never apologize&quot;, which are ideals that resonate REALLY REALLY hard with people in these propaganda bubbles. The lack of accountability makes them trust untrustworthy sources even more, not less. Accountability makes them trust trustworthy sources less, not more.<p>I would add (3), how they react if they find out that something they themselves put out there isn&#x27;t true. Watch what happens if they find out something they posted objectively isn&#x27;t true. Instead of retracting it, they&#x27;ll say something like, &quot;well it doesn&#x27;t matter, the meaning of the message is the same&quot;, or &quot;well it doesn&#x27;t matter the fake news media does it all the time&quot;. Which is the exact same thing that pathological liars and con artists say when their lies are exposed- that everyone does it, and maybe even that they are victims of hypocrites for being called out on it, because they assume the people calling them out surely lie about stuff all the time too. They&#x27;re always looking for excuses to do worse, not better, and for excuses to think of themselves as victims, and for any possible reason to lower the bar for themselves rather than raise it for everyone.')
