Item(by='mcherm', descendants=None, kids=[25125336], score=None, time=1605628008, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25123199, text='&gt; their explanation does make some sense, that if IRCTC is super fast and efficient, then people with cash to spare&#x2F;with computers and good internet access will hog all the tickets, denying people in rural areas a fair opportunity to purchase tickets.<p>If I understand correctly (and I might not) that sounds utterly absurd to me.<p>It sounds like you are saying &quot;the official website is badly buggy and slow, but that&#x27;s fair because some people in rural areas don&#x27;t have good internet connections&quot;. I don&#x27;t understand how a buggy and slow website helps those users! I would completely understand having a bug-free and fast website that reserved a certain proportion of the tickets for rural users or even for those with poor internet connections, but that doesn&#x27;t sound like what you are describing.<p>&gt; Wait times have gone down considerably on a lot of trains, you no longer have to plan your travel 6 months in advance, you can buy tatkal tickets without paying scalpers etc.<p>That certainly sounds good.')
