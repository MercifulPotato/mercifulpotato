The question is whether that is a decisive advantage in M1&#x27;s impressive performance. After Intel refined their decoder and uop cache, you virtually never see that part of the frontend as a bottleneck when doing microarchitectural profiling. That&#x27;s been true since Sandy Bridge but even more so since Skylake.<p>All the legacy junk in x86 is obviously a pain for Intel to support. Any blank-slate ISA is going to have an advantage there.')
