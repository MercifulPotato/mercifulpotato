I like being able to relax and only focus on _intervening_ when there is a lot of traffic on my 45 minutes commute from work. I donâ€™t get home fatigue from the driving. Instead, I spend time doing the things I want to do, like play with my kids or work on my projects. To me it is worth the investment.')
