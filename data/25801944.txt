I&#x27;ve learnt a lot along the way by looking at existing projects, documentation, writing various tooling in Go. etc.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve been working with lots of projects involving gRPC, Protobuf and I really enjoy doing that.<p>Now, I would like to take it to the next step and do a (maybe just small) project that could be of use for others. So far, I was thinking about a MUC-style low-latency audio streaming solution (for jamming online) using gRPC for signalling, TURN for dealing with NAT issues and Ogg Opus as a low-latency audio codec.<p>I&#x27;m very curious about your ideas and now to approach it.')
