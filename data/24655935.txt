Storing people in a hellish place does not fix them, it only punishes them, with out counseling and education, how is a person who is released in anyway more prepared than when they went in?<p>I agree the current system makes it damn near impossible for someone with a conviction to get a second chance. That issue should be address at the corrections level, and the services provided after conviction.<p>But most companies do not have the resources, education, or ability to help rehabilitate someone, so should we blindly hire on hope that this person won&#x27;t cause harm to the people a company is responsible for, should the company forgo the opportunities that require your staff not have convictions, that is just an unrealistic expectation.<p>Think about it like this, say there was a piece of equipment that had malfunctioned and caused serious injury to someone, and your company then wanted to bring that piece of equipment into your office, knowing that there is a 44% chance that it will malfunction in someway again, and there is a 25% chance that the malfunction would cause serious harm to someone, would you be comfortable with that choice, if that malfunction happened do you think the company would and should be liable for this?<p>There are too many situations, where trying to make this right for someone with a record would have too many of my employees face situations I don&#x27;t think they should have to in a work place. with 1 in 5 women being the victim of sexual assault or rape, how could I ask any of them to work side by side with someone who was convicted of it, I can&#x27;t insure their safety, and I don&#x27;t feel it just to put them in that situation.  Same with someone who has been the victim of any violent crime.<p>I think it boils down to person choice I suppose, and for me, I won&#x27;t put the people I am responsible for at risk, not the company that I helped built. If that makes me a bad person, I think I can live with that.')
