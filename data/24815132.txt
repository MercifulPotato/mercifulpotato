One of our developers - very new to elastic - was asked to modify some indexes.  Folks were a bit too busy to help or heading out on holiday.  One stack overflow answer later... delete and recreate it... and she was off to the races.  When the test was tried, it looked like things still worked.  A quick script did the same to stage and prod, in both data centers.  Turns out that is not a great way to go about it.  It deleted the documents.  We got lucky, as we still had not killed off the system we were migrating off of and it only took three days of turn and burn to get the data back on the system.<p>So many lessons learned that day.  I trust her with the master keys at this point, as nobody is more careful with production than her now. :)')
