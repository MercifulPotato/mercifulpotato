Item(by='tjalfi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609688338, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25622230, text='YMMV, but most of our in-house applications use a few of the Aspose .NET libraries. Many of them are written to interact with our billing and document management systems (primitive VCS). I have written a few applications and most of them would be useless outside of our environment. I have released some PowerShell scripts to an industry specific forum, though.<p>The biggest barrier to releasing our applications as open source are organizational. It would take a number of approvals to do so and our developers would have to review the code first. We have a small development team with a large backlog of work; itâ€™s hard to argue that they should spend  time to do this instead of a higher priority task.')
