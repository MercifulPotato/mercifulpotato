Makes sense.<p>Currently, I do most of my work locally on a work issued laptop (and external monitor) with some services offloaded to AWS.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t mind building a desktop PC for fun, but as I don&#x27;t really do high-end gaming, I couldn&#x27;t see justifying the expense unless I was able to do work on it as well.  I&#x27;d of course have to get employer sign-off, but I&#x27;m just trying to figure out what that kind of agreement might look like.')
