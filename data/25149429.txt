Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605794094, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148393, text='&gt;  Agreed 100%, I have a troubled kid in school right now, who is off the charts smart but the only thing he will apply himself to is Advanced Math, Auto Shop and his Culinary program. If it&#x27;s not hands on or mechanical he just has no interest in rote memorization. School needs to fundamentally change especially for adolescent males, it just stacks the decks against the high functioning learn by doing types. I often wonder how many great minds we have lost to being store clerk (no looking down on them, its just a waste of a mind if you have it)<p>Huh... this sounds exactly like me growing up, except I took to Biology and did rather poor in Math until I taught myself Bio-centric Calculus in University and realized I actually did understand the concepts and could apply them to my desired ends.<p>I&#x27;d start by considering that his formal education should only account for 20% of his actual learning, and use that as a standard which allows him t pursuit other avenues (independent research and projects) outside of his schooling. Which can include College or University level courses, I personally started skipping HS altogether except for exam dates and attending University level Philosphy and Biology courses by Junior year. This wasn&#x27;t without controversy despite having a cumulative 3.5 GPA.<p>One of the things I always told myself was that I&#x27;d buy my child, boy or girl, a non-running car of their choice as an extra circular activity by age 12 in order to have them explore their curiosity, hone their research skills, learn how to apply knowledge to an actual tangible medium and interact with other people who also identify with the same car culture and give them a &#x27;tribe&#x27; of sorts which for males is very critical, especially at that age.<p>Furthermore, and this is difficult due to COVID to do in person, but I would encourage you both to watch conferences that are related to those fields and maybe take some entry and then advance classes together on Coursera or Udemy, Khan Academy and all the ED-tech platforms.<p>CU Boulder has a really cool entry level Biology series right now, I attended one of the instructors courses on campus for a few weeks and as person who did their under grad in Bio and then worked in a diagnostics labs for several years I wish I had that kind of instructor in my early formative years--I&#x27;ve only had 2 good teachers, both chemists, my whole Life in ~18 years of formal education.<p>In fact many of us who went through the Academia based Biology track and then turned Biohackers often wished we hadn&#x27;t done it all, as it stunted our initial curiosity and sense of wonder that is essential in making luminaries and vast advancements in Science in exchange for complying to the rote learning method that yields &#x27;good grades.&#x27;<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;m glad that you have made this observation in your child&#x27;s life, I struggled with it a lot with my parents, but ultimately I can tell you that despite the unorthodox methods and leaving my Industry, I achieved a great deal in all of the other Industries I focused on (Biology&#x2F;Automotive&#x2F;Culinary-Agriculture and too a smaller degree Fintech) and was able to accomplish a lot from the wide skill-set I had developed through my years of hands-on learning. My parents are very proud of my achievements and are probably more interested in the awards I&#x27;ve gained as a &#x27;polymath&#x27; in those fields than I am at this point.<p>My only wish being that I had something more than online friends on Newsgroups and Forums (some who I&#x27;d meet in real Life) for support to help guide me through the journey, so I hope you take a hands on approach in your son&#x27;s life.')
