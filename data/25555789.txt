Evolution produces flawed designs by &quot;design&quot;.<p>Evolution trends towards survival. One thing critical for survival is equilibrium of the ecosystem so on a macro level evolution will trend towards equilibrium even if that necessitates the need for flawed designs.<p>In fact, flawed designs are critical to ecosystem survival. It works because competing designs to the flawed design are also just as flawed.<p>An invasive species on an island ecosystem is a perfect example of an over efficient design destroying a local ecosystem and in turn eventually destroying itself.<p>This is why ebola didn&#x27;t spread as far as covid-19. Ebola is too efficient at killing thus reducing transmission rate and burning out the local ecosystem and thereby destroying itself before it got too far. The less efficient virus is the one that spread across the globe.')
