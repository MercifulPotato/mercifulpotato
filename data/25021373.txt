They investigated, found no corroborating evidence, and ran boring stories to that effect.  Glenn Greenwald also investigated and found no corroborating evidence, but he hated that some people might take the lack of a smoking gun as evidence that there was no corruption connected to Biden, so he thought the media should use this shady, unlikely, as-yet-unsubstantiated story as a titillating hook to talk really loudly about all the possible ways that Biden and his son <i>might</i> be corrupt.<p>I can kind of see his point, since everybody in Washington seems to regard Hunter Biden as a completely unexceptional person of no particular merit who makes huge amounts of money because of who his father is, and that should be a scandal, though more a general scandal about the system than about the Bidens specifically.<p>On the other hand, that&#x27;s no excuse to make a huge news story out of an unsubstantiated story fed to the media by partisan operatives a few weeks before an election.  If they did that, these stories would arise before every election, and part of the political contest between the parties would be competing to come up with the best juicy lies.  Considering what a free buffet that would be for the media, I&#x27;m honestly surprised that they managed to refrain.')
