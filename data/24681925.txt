We had immense diversified conglomerates even before big tech, and they were already problematic. With Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple  coming of age, the only new development is that the failure of antitrust enforcement in America (and elsewhere) is far more obvious and pervasive than even cynics imagined. With limitless capital, regulatory capture, massive patent war chests, and the ability to starve would-be competitors of talent (by spending a lot temporarily), the world is the mega corp’s oyster.<p>A society which limits the growth of mega corps will automatically see numerous benefits like redistribution of wealth and power, redundancy&#x2F;resilience in the economy, decentralization away from mega cities, an increased diversity of cultures, localized circular economics, and more. I think this is something both sides of the aisle (in America) could and should support, since it achieves some of the goals of directly redistributive policies but with the market as the mechanism, rewarding hard work&#x2F;success.<p>Outside of the US, other countries shouldn’t tolerate their customer bases being pillaged by international mega corps. It is a threat to their sovereignty, cultural independence, and limits innovation that could come from all those locations. We are super late on acting. Globally, we all should demand change from our politicians ASAP on this issue.')
