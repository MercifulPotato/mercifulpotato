Item(by='ojnabieoot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604779468, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25018403, text='&gt; But I&#x27;d like to believe that most are misled, misinformed, yet good people. I know my neighbor is one in fact.<p>Something I have found increasingly frustrating is this childish attitude that saying “so-and-so is a bad person” means “so-and-so will always be a bad person and can do nothing to change for the better.” Simplistically separating people by “inherent nature” leads to us not calling a spade a spade when someone is being a bad person, and means bad people can’t ever actually appreciate the scope and impact of their misdeeds.<p>People who voted for Trump did so for reasons that were, by and large, morally outrageous. We don’t need to treat them like lost sheep who were incapable of understanding what Trump represents. There were a shocking number of horrendously terrible people in Germany and Rwanda, and most didn’t go to jail when the genocide ended. After WW2 it was really hard to find a German who would say they voted for the Nazis, and I am sure many or those millions of people led upstanding lives. That doesn’t make their decision to vote for the racist strongman retrospectively defensible.<p>(There’s also the related problem of “he can’t be a bad person, he’s nice to me!”)')
