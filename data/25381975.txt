I first used VRBO sometime around 2002. They were the only game in town for this kind of thing for a long time.\nYes, you could rent out space in peoples&#x27; homes, but if you wanted a vacation spot that wasn&#x27;t a motel, they (eventually) did that better than VRBO did. I&#x27;m pretty sure VRBO didn&#x27;t change their vintage 1996 website until well after AirBNB was a competitor. Multiple years. I could be wrong on that, but suffice it to say that AirBNB <i>also</i> filled a vacation house need that VRBO had been limping on.')
