I&#x27;m not sure he has one on the Riemann Hypothesis in particular, but he does cover a number of items that would be somewhat related and help build a level of comfort with being exposed to the math, even if you can&#x27;t do the pure number crunching.<p>Mathologer would be my second recommendation.  Once again not sure he has touched the Riemann Hypothesis, but he does a number of great videos where you can start expanding being comfortable with often untouched fields of math (like modular arithematic) while introducing a how seemingly unrelated fields end up having connections.<p>Videos can go between 20 minutes to an hour and I often enjoy watching one every few days.')
