Something like ffmpeg, or maybe Retroarch, which can be compiled for freeDOS or a PowerMac or Haiku if you&#x27;d likeâ€”sometimes with different features enabled, but always with enough to be useful. If someone developed a brand new platform, these projects would be relatively easy to get running.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s just my particular love of weird and new (and old) platforms, but my greatest fear isn&#x27;t so much being stuck with a single engine as being struck on a small set of mainstream platforms in order to <i>use</i> the engine. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that the Switch and PlayStation 5 lack a user-exposed web browser; sure it would be a nice feature, but it&#x27;s not worthwhile for Sony and Nintendo to keep up to date.<p>If we&#x27;d had today&#x27;s web browsers in 2007, and Apple didn&#x27;t already lead the Webkit project, would Steve Jobs have been able to create the iPhone, with a first-class web browser as a key selling point?
