Didn&#x27;t actually see a Kickstarter campaign for that one.<p>Another game I&#x27;m playing and enjoying right now is Hollow Knight, which started off as a poorly received game jam entry , then a Kickstarter which raised a modest sum (less than 50K), and now it&#x27;s a highly acclaimed title with nearly 3 million units sold (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hollow_Knight" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hollow_Knight</a>).')
