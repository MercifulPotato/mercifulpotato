I work at Materialize.<p>I think the right starter take is that Materialize is a deterministic compute engine, one that relies on other infrastructure to act as the source of truth for your data. It can pull data out of your RDBMS&#x27;s binlog, out of Debezium events you&#x27;ve put in to Kafka, out of local files, etc.<p>On failure and restart, Materialize leans on the ability to return to the assumed source of truth, again a RDBMS + CDC or perhaps Kafka. I don&#x27;t recommend thinking about Materialize as a place to sink your streaming events <i>at the moment</i> (there is movement in that direction, because the operational overhead of things like Kafka is real).<p>The main difference is that unlike an OLTP system, Materialize doesn&#x27;t have to make and persist non-deterministic choices about e.g. which transactions commit and which do not. That makes fault-tolerance a <i>performance</i> feature rather than a <i>correctness</i> feature, at which point there are a few other options as well (e.g. active-active).<p>Hope this helps!')
