The exodus of southern racists from the Democratic party in the mid-century controls almost all the polarization in our politics. Reagan gets a lot of blame for being at the helm during the rise of the moral majority, but if you read Perlstein, the coalition Reagan was backed by has its roots in Goldwater&#x27;s southern strategy.<p>It is no more reasonable to say that Democrats were staunch opponents of civil rights into the 1960s (Truman integrated the military!) than it is to say that Republicans were religious conservatives. Southern Democrats opposed civil rights, and Northern Republicans were New Deal economic populists.<p>I did the (probably pointless) exercise a few years ago of reading the GOP party platform documents from 1972 through 2012, tagging each with specific issues like &quot;block grant benefits to states&quot; or &quot;oppose campaign finance restrictions&quot;. I don&#x27;t believe for a moment that these documents are representative of the real party, but it&#x27;s interesting that you can watch the GOP&#x27;s position change so clearly over time. Into the late 1970s, the GOP was open to abortion!<p>The parties have held relatively coherent positions since the 1980s; I think when people talk about the roles the <i>parties</i> have had in US history, as opposed to specific politicians, we should probably limit ourself to the parties of Reagan and Mondale and their successors.')
