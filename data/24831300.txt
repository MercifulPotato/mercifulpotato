The fact that anyone can fire up a server and make it accessible to anyone else on the Internet should be indicative of that.<p>Maybe what we mean when we say we want a &#x27;decentralized internet&#x27; is implicitly, that we want the popular nodes of the Internet Graph to be decentralized. That would be nice.<p>But I think we could realize that right now, the Internet is comprised of a ton of competing protocols, and as long as there&#x27;s a translation interface that enables cross-communication, the internet will remain decentralized.  That&#x27;s impressive resillience. Kudos to the designers.<p>It seems to me that what would actually bring the most benefit to the structure of the Internet would be long-range wireless communication. Basically, the ability to use HAM radio to bypass ISPs. That would bring about a sea change in how the Internet is structured.')
