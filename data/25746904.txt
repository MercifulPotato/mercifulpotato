However, I don&#x27;t see them drawing even with Apple on power efficiency, and AMD have their Zen 3 mobile chips in the near future, so it&#x27;s more a holding on in technical quality. Likely they will outsell both though, given the M1&#x27;s Mac exclusivity and the limited range of AMD laptops (and limited stock of TSMC 7nm  everything currently) - try buy a 4900H system vs a 108xxH, it&#x27;s much harder.')
