Street crime is extremely low on the Strip and nearby — muggings, car breakins, etc. That’s because the guys who run the most lucrative rackets in town, the casinos, simply don’t permit street thugs to ply their trade on the Strip — if you try to embark on a career as a petty criminal on the Strip, you’ll quickly find yourself in a dark basement with a guy whose neck is thicker than your thigh.<p>The country operates on the same principle — the “criminals” who get punished are the guys who sow chaos and disrupt the real racket in town, which is Corporatism.')
