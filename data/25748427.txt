Parler is a one-purpose app that existed solely (and was moderated by its own employees) to foment a chamber of hateful, violent rhetoric. Facebook and YouTube are used for many things by many people. Also Facebook and YouTube remove those kinds of content (even if they don&#x27;t do a great job of it, they spend a whole lot of money employing a lot of people to get rid of it). Parler moderators removed those people who disagreed with the violent MAGA rhetoric. They&#x27;re just not comparable, and pretending they are is ridiculous.')
