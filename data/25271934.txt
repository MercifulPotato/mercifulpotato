Ignoring the semi-annual rebrands and the MS chat products that were killed from before Google even existed (there&#x27;s surprisingly many!), there&#x27;s at least:<p>1. MSN Messenger (+ rebrands)<p>2. Skype<p>3. NetMeeting<p>4. Lync (+ rebrands)<p>5. Yammer<p>6. Kaizala<p>7. Teams<p>8. SharedView<p>9. Windows Meeting Space<p>10. Groove<p>11. Qik<p>I tried to err on the side of assuming that any time they killed one product and immediately replaced it with another, it was a rebrand. (E.g. were Office Communicator &#x2F; Office Live Meeting &#x2F; Lync &#x2F; Skype for Business actually compatible? If not, they clearly weren&#x27;t just rebrands.)<p>Overall this seems like a very similar amount of churn,  product overlap, and politics-driven product management.')
