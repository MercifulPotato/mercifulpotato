Then you&#x27;re on the hook. If I remember, deductibles for example don&#x27;t fully cover many hospital stays so you get hit with out of pocket costs. Those have a maximum cap but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some caveats if you end up in a hospital that&#x27;s not in network for example. This is what people talk about when they say they went bankrupt despite having insurance.<p>edit: For example checking the Maryland ACA page is showing maximum out of pocket costs of $7k&#x2F;person for most plans and up to $17k&#x2F;family for some. When you make $24k&#x2F;year that will wipe out your savings for years.')
