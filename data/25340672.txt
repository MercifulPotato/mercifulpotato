But I think there is a much wider prospective customer base and recurring revenue licensing the tech stack as a SaaS.  And that&#x27;s not to say they have to give up Uber as a taxi company while they do both.  It&#x27;s a much more reasonable moonshot than the autonomous driving experiment they did that killed someone moving fast and breaking things.  I see a lot of value there.')
