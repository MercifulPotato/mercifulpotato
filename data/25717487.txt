It seems the choices are lose cash to inflation or put it in some investment vehicle that ties up the cash for some period of time or has a different risk profile.  I&#x27;ve heard some people advocate against never holding cash and borrowing against assets (ex: real estate) but that puts you at the mercy of the lender.  If you hold literal cash what percent of the total portfolio makes sense? TIA')
