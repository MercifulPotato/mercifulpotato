You aren&#x27;t making it to GM without an extreme amount of talent.  Training is likely to be required too, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s much more likely that an extremely talented but untrained person could make GM vs an not-so-talented person with rigorous training.  Basically I&#x27;m saying that the vast majority of people would never be able to become a GM regardless of training.')
