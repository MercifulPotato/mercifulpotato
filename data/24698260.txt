In a 2020 study by La Jolla Institute for Immunology, they found blood samples pre-2018 that demonstrated a T-Cell immune response to Covid-19. It was found that in SARS-CoV-2 and “common cold” coronavirus fragments that were similar (at least 67% genetic similarity) 57% showed cross-reactivity by memory T cells. If the Covid-19 coronavirus is novel, then we should be designating every new strain of the flu as a novel virus.')
