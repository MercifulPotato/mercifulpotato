I couldn&#x27;t find any setting for that.<p>Source: built <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graticule.link&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graticule.link&#x2F;</a> to scratch my own itch, tried monetizing it but gave up since it would have needed to go in a direction I didn&#x27;t care about.<p>PS: The email verification page is blank.')
