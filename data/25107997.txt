The Presbyterians down here in my village in Alabama inflict the stuff on the poor kids.<p>I grew up Catholic in a tradition where the social responsibility was taken seriously (also see here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kolpingwerk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kolpingwerk</a>). We didn&#x27;t have the abstinence-only nonsense either, that must be particular to certain regions in the US. BTW, the Catholic position is that marriage is a sacrament that the couple administers to each other (the only sacrament where a priest is not needed), and, well, sex is complicated, and all sorts of Reddit drama happens when FWBs catch feelings &amp; so on. This was actually how the subject was treated in school.<p>The recent child abuse revelations are disappointing. I always said that child abuse isn&#x27;t confined to catholics, but the hierarchy at least provides some oversight that you don&#x27;t have in megachurches, but it&#x27;s clear that that did not happen, it was a total failure up to the Pope.')
