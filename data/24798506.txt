Are any of you seriously surprised by the questions asked? Of course the candidates prepared to answer these questions. If they weren&#x27;t prepared their prep team should be fired for being woefully incompetent. Seriously, all the questions are about the most popular topics. I honestly would have been shocked if Flint wasn&#x27;t brought up considering it being part of the national conversation.<p>Should she have gotten them? No. Is it cheating? Yes. Is it a big fucking deal to detract from actual issues? No. It is just another example of minor cheating that they are doing constantly. But this is like cheating on a test where the teacher pulls questions from the homework and changes a few numbers and you already memorized how to do all the homework problems.')
