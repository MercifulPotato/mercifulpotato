But the EU had already agreed to it.<p>The UK should have never agreed to Google buying DeepMind either.<p>These companies have tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. They can afford to &quot;create&quot; a new competitor in the market, rather than take out OUT of the market, and it we would all be better off.<p>I really think all $100+ million acquisitions of companies should enter automatic anti-trust review. Maybe even lower than that.<p>These acquisitions by large companies hurt consumers in two ways. Either they squander the disruptive technology and nothing comes out of it, slowing down progress for everyone, or they put it to good use and then they get to maintain or extend their dominant positions - and we don&#x27;t want any of that to happen as consumers.<p>We want these large companies to continue to have healthy competition. It&#x27;s better for consumers and it&#x27;s better for the job market, too (fewer companies in the market = fewer job hunting opportunities = downward pressure on salaries).')
