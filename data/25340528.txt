Your comment reminded me of another sarcastic comment I came across on this topic, on Slashdot (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;379156#comments" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;379156#comments</a>)<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve been seeing these articles for years. Oh no, Apple has made AirPods, who will buy anyone else&#x27;s wireless earbuds now?. Oh no,Apple has created iPadOS, who will buy a PC laptop now?. Oh no, Apple made the trash can Mac with AMD &quot;server&quot; cards for so cheap, who will buy a PC workstation now?. Oh no, Apple made the iPad, who will buy a normal laptop now?. Oh no, Apple has made the iPhone, who will buy any other smartphone now?.<p>And that&#x27;s the point you are missing.<p>Nobody denies that the Apple processor is a technological innovation. But like the iPhone, it is definitely an innovation limited to the APPLE ECOSYSTEM.<p>The new Apple processor will definitely make them more profit as it will attract more consumers. But it will neither kill Qualcomm or Nvidia or Intel or AMD. And whether you like it or not, Intel and AMD processors biggest advantage is the softwares they can run on it. And that&#x27;s a huge advantage over Apple Processor that can only run the highly controlled and closed macOS BigSur where an application Firewall isn&#x27;t even allowed to block Apple apps because Apple doesn&#x27;t want you to.')
