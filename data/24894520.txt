Two of those 16-bit machines (or rather their evolved descendants) are still with us today - the PC and the Mac. So you can&#x27;t blame people for phantasizing about what could have become of the Amiga platform if Commodore had managed it better. But today of course thinking that the platform could be revived and updated to become mainstream again is a pretty fringe view...')
