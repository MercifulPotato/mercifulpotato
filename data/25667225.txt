Two years is an <i>eternity</i> for a team&#x27;s headcount not to grow. It&#x27;s virtually certain that you&#x27;ll be a mentor to several new hires in that time. You&#x27;ll also have a long head start on understanding the codebase and tools relative to many others who will be working with them. If you&#x27;re not some kind of leader at that point, something&#x27;s wrong.<p>Unless you found one of those rare teams that stays together for the long haul, but the experience with such a special phenomenon should make it more than worth your while.<p>If L4s are not getting opportunity to lead, they are on a sinking ship anyway and the smart ones are LeetCoding.<p>(Obviously this all reflects the crazy economic moment of the last 10 years in Silicon Valley, but so does the level system you&#x27;re critiquing).')
