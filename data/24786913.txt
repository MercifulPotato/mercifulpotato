Tooling is often worse, skills cannot be transferred from and to other common areas (mobile, web) and development times are provably longer.<p>Unless your goal is to become a professional and create commercial products in the IoT&#x2F;embedded space, I doubt learning and using C or C++ would be easier in any way.')
