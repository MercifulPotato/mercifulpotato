That is, indeed, a plus.<p>But even if you require login to post stuff to the issue tracker, creating a login and posting a comment has been trivially automated.<p>You&#x27;re no longer running a useful issue tracker, you&#x27;re running a free ad network: you&#x27;re hosting a dozen useful issues and a thousand advertisements and blackhat SEO comments for spammers.<p>If it&#x27;s not visible to search engines, and your repo doesn&#x27;t get much traffic, it&#x27;s not nearly as valuable to spammers. It&#x27;s kind of like cutting off your nose to spite your face, but those basic economics of cost to spammers, cost to users, value to spammers, and value to users are the only rules that you can really apply when hosting content on the Internet.')
