Great job! I wish more people did high quality &quot;last mile&quot; integration&quot; on their machines. Energy chain and powder coat makes a huge difference in perceived quality.<p>Couple of questions:<p>1. Why did you chose to mount the Y axis servos in that orientation instead of where the axis of the servo is perpendicular to the floor?<p>2. Since you welded the frame, how did you manage the mount the linear rails square? Shims? Post weld machining the frame via bridge gantry?<p>3. What was the total cost of this vs buying an OTS machine? I&#x27;m guessing around $12k.')
