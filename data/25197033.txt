Item(by='beaner', descendants=None, kids=[25197166], score=None, time=1606212368, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25196909, text='&gt; We are only talking about &quot;conversion of energy into money&quot; because that is what the best current implementation of a BFT system is using.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s my point isn&#x27;t it? I said &quot;Bitcoin&#x27;s proof of work is basically a conversion of energy directly into money.&quot; I did not say &quot;all systems for ensuring the soundness of proofs in blockchains are a conversion of energy directly into money.&quot;<p>What we care about is trust minimization. It just happens that the first system utilized, proof-of-work, provides the best-yet incentives for ensuring trust minimization, and the most equitable distribution of coin. It being accidental does not mean it is not the the best method for securing &quot;proof.&quot; (Which isn&#x27;t to say that it <i>is</i> necessarily the best of all possible methods, only that the simple fact of it being first and accidental does not negate that it may be.)')
