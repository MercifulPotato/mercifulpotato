HDD is $0.01-0.03&#x2F;GB, SSD is $0.10-0.25&#x2F;GB, BD&#x2F;DVD are $0.02-0.10&#x2F;GB, respectively, at retail prices and before counting redundancy. $20&#x2F;GB was as far back for HDD as Oct 1999, which by the way fell further to around $7.50 next year in Oct 2000[1]. Yeah interesting but 10-100 fold density improvement would be nice...<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mkomo.com&#x2F;cost-per-gigabyte" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mkomo.com&#x2F;cost-per-gigabyte</a>')
