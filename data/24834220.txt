One thinks Hillary eats babies, and the other thinks the CIA did 9&#x2F;11.<p>Meanwhile, the landscaping guy at work seems to have a pretty balanced take on things and he doesn&#x27;t vote because he&#x27;s not a citizen. He&#x27;s one of the few people I can talk politics with over a cup of coffee and not want to pull my hair out.<p>I think it would benefit us all to be able to take a disinterested look at this whole deal.')
