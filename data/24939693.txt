To make most libraries be actually easily usable for a wide range of inputs is a tremendous amount of work.<p>The core of them mostly do the thing they claim to do, but if you feed them data that&#x27;s just slightly off, then it&#x27;ll break in interesting ways.<p>Speaking based on a lot of experience[1]. Nothing in the geospatial or environmental data world is easy and there will always be an unexpected problem lurking right behind the corner, regardless of how many of them you&#x27;ve already fixed or worked around.<p>Still, the complexity of the problem space also makes it fascinating. As an example, the definition and measurement of something that&#x27;s seemingly very simple: mean seal level is actually tremendously complicated if you think about it. The Wikipedia article talks about averaging over decades of measurements to get it right for example.<p>[1] I&#x27;m a part of the team behind <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.planetos.com&#x2F;datasets" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.planetos.com&#x2F;datasets</a>')
