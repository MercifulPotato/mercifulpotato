On the whole, I don&#x27;t find any dramatically superior.<p>PC laptops do have a race-to-the-bottom. Even top-of-the-line laptops are luck-of-the-draw. Lenovo is far more scammy than IBM ThinkPads of the golden age. I think the idea is you need to be 5% better than the competition to control the high-end market, and they cut quality until they hit that. Apple quality is much more consistent.<p>But with PCs, although really good laptops don&#x27;t exist, you can build a perfectly fine desktop.<p>Windows has become surprisingly usable with WSL. It&#x27;s also actually more stable than Linux or MacOS now. MacOS periodically stalls out using all CPU until my mouse pointer locks up, for reasons I can&#x27;t fathom. Linux runs into oddball issues with complex device setups. Windows just works for me.<p>On the other hand, Windows is trying to become a SaaS, and seems to collect a ton of data, do hostile updates, and really wants to show me ads. For now, I&#x27;ve disabled all of that, but it&#x27;s gotten harder to do so. If it goes further that direction, it might stop to be usable.<p>Linux has been going down the tubes the past few decades, but isn&#x27;t bad yet. Complexity has grown, and stability has fallen, but it&#x27;s still simpler than MacOS or Windows. I can understand and tweak the system. I&#x27;d never e.g. run a server on MacOS or Windows. Too much stuff going on behind the scenes.<p>On the whole, I find myself gravitating towards:<p>* Linux for software engineering, math, servers, or similar -- places where I do things by hand and want a lot of control.<p>* Windows for video conferencing, video editing, graphic design, and similar (which is odd, since this is Mac&#x27;s classic strength, but I&#x27;m finding Windows to work better now).<p>* MacOS for general-purpose computing (e.g. writing documents, making a presentation, or browsing the web). It excels at normal things.')
