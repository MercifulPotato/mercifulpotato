He said he disliked the saying “measure twice, cut once” because actual carpenters avoid measuring as much as possible! For example, to make a staircase, you could try using simple trig to calculate the lengths of the board, angle of stair cut outs, step widths, etc. But that would all be wasted effort because you can’t actually measure and cut wood to sufficient precision. Instead, you need to just get rough measurements and then use various “cheats” so the measurements don’t matter, like using a jig to cut the parallel boards at exactly the same length (whatever it turns out to be).<p>Analogy to monads is this: yes, there are mathematical formalisms that can describe complex systems. Everything can be described by math! That’s literally its one job. But will the formalisms actually help you when the job you’re doing has insufficient achievable precision (eg finding market fit for a website)?')
