A customer for 3.7 years now<p>1) Their customer service has been good. However, I&#x27;ve never had to use it for anything serious<p>2) Their API is awesome<p>3) Their level of complexity is slowly increasing. This is something very dangerous for them and they need to look into it. Their biggest advantage is&#x2F;was - super simple to set up everything<p>4) Like many others, not happy that costs are slowly increasing.<p>5) Perhaps I&#x27;m the only person who falls into the camp that Stripe doing things like Atlas and Stripe Capital is somewhat unnecessary and takes away from their focus on Payments<p>6) Don&#x27;t really understand why they are doing the whole Platform of Platforms thing i.e. Stripe customers can now offer stuff like Bank Accounts to their customers<p>Seems like adding needless risks and complexity<p>7) Anyways, I miss having Stripe be really simple and really focused on one thing. Hope they can at least be like Apple and Microsoft where they keep laser sharp focus on their money makers&#x2F;core competencies and have dedicated teams and the best people on it<p>and they don&#x27;t shift over their best people to pie in the sky stuff like Platform of Platforms')
