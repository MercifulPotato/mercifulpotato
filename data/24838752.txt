What Discord nailed is ease-of-setup, especially of the server part: by offering free hosting that imitated the &quot;one server = one guild&quot; structure well-known to gamers while actually implementing a much-cheaper hosting structure serving thousands of users from one physical server they eliminated one of the typical pain points with existing solutions, which all depended on either having one technically-savvy gamer hosting the server on his own hardware (mostly virtual private servers were used here), or someone paying for hosted versions. This structure provided an opening for Discord: since gamer clans and guilds come and go in quick succession, each time this happens, the continued use of &quot;classic&quot; voice chat solutions like Teamspeak etc. depended on whether &quot;the guy with the server&quot; would continue hosting the voice server for the new guild. Often enough, the new guild simply wasn&#x27;t lucky enough to have that guy, so they look out for solutions, and Discord offered them one: a free &quot;server&quot; providing a good-enough group voice chat solution.<p>With regard to monetization one could even argue that Discord failed a lot in that department. The attempt to sell games was largely unsuccessful, and besides the Nitro program they didn&#x27;t really find anything that works. And even the Nitro program had to be made into an actual &quot;premium&quot; program in order to lead to significant-enough adoption, offering better quality on core features of the service instead of purely cosmetic status-boosting, which is AFAIK not what they originally intended to do with the program.')
