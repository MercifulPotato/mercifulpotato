There are several problems with today&#x27;s as I see it:<p>1) Each small town used to have a crazy person who didn&#x27;t quite live up to societal expectations.  They might even &quot;publish&quot; but they had a limited audience (their town) who wasn&#x27;t receptive to the message.  With the huge &quot;communications platforms&quot; we&#x27;ve adopted on the Internet, those crazies can now find each other quite easily and band together into a group that has a much louder voice.  Please note here that my use of the word &quot;crazies&quot; is not a medical diagnosis but rather a description of someone whose thoughts are significantly outside the mainstream.<p>2)  In those small towns, there was societal pressure to NOT act on every non-conforming thought that you had.  If you got shunned from your town, you might not survive and&#x2F;or would be actively hunted down.  If everyone knew you, the town gossip mill would make sure that you were continuously under a microscope.  Now that the non-conformists have banded together in a large forum, they&#x27;re outside the confines of their own community.<p>If the goal is to quash hate speech and calls to violence, I think it&#x27;s also important to note that there are some types of non-conformance that are good for society.  Some is a gradual constant pressure that keeps our society ready for the day we live in.  Others result in scientific advancement - most of us here consider &quot;thinking-outside-the-box&quot; to be a good thing.  Doc Brown&#x27;s town all considered him a little crazy but he was a &quot;harmless crazy&quot;.<p>As you might have expected, I don&#x27;t have an answer to the current problem either but I think this is a discussion we have to have.  How do we put societal pressure to use on a large scale?  Can we in fact have constructive arguments with these groups?  If we&#x27;re willing to endure censorship, where is the boundary and how do we keep it from expanding?<p>I for one would like community guidelines to determine where those edges are - perhaps we&#x27;re &quot;too far gone&quot; as a society and we&#x27;re just headed into another version of the dark ages.')
