Item(by='ChicagoDave', descendants=None, kids=[24931732, 24933426], score=None, time=1603983491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929646, text='DDD is a set of principles where you have conversations with your business partners, model scenarios, determine a ubiquitous language, and build software that mirrors those models and conversations. Determining your bound-contexts, their relationship to other bound-contexts, and determining where sub-domains belong. Though this can be confusing since you could have an &quot;order&quot; domain in several bound-contexts with different purposes. It also tends to move away from traditional OO modeling since we&#x27;re pulling things apart, not abstracting them in order to decouple. I took Eric Evans 5-day class two years ago, but I&#x27;ve been professionally utilizing DDD for about five years including helping build Accenture&#x27;s new performance management system.')
