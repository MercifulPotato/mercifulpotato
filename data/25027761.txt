Voters have to have confidence in the system. And that system isn&#x27;t just technical, it&#x27;s social.</i><p>I&#x27;d go even further and say that if voters believe in the system, it doesn&#x27;t actually have to work.  Belief in the system is the mechanism by which democracy provides stability.  The election system actually working as advertised is only necessary to the extent that the system actually working is required to make people believe it works.')
