That&#x27;s just a good way to lose all of your quail.<p>But, they do need a flight pen, for humane husbandry. They naturally like to run around and peck things. They need space to do that. Anyone who justifies cage raised quail because they like confined space is just trying to justify a bad decision.<p>&gt;It just might be that we wonâ€™t really try until we are forced to by some kind of collapse scenario or another.<p>This is 100% what I believe the case will be. We won&#x27;t try anything, at scale, until forced to. The reason I live the way I do is to prepare for (what I believe to be) the inevitable change&#x2F;shift in the world in the next 3-5 decades.<p>That being said - mega-cities, and a majority of humans living in cities is a relatively new phenomena. I am not sure our current structure lends itself to &#x27;local&#x27; living - that&#x27;s my argument above. It takes a crap-load of space to feed a family.')
