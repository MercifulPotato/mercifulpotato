If it was up to me, I feel totally satisfied with my income. I can afford anything I want to buy, I can go out for dinner without worrying, I have savings, etc. Similarly I do not feel envious of others who have more than me, I am not looking for a change in lifestyle, and like some others in this thread I think some degree of inequality is optimal.<p>However when my longtime girlfriend (working in finance) feels insecure dating a man with a lower income, and is not happy with me because I can&#x27;t afford &#x2F; am not interested in luxury vacations and sport cars then  my income becomes an issue. When I chose my job I knew I&#x27;d be taking a big loss in earnings and I knew I would be okay with that, but when it affects the people important in my life and they think less of me because of my low salary it feels bad.')
