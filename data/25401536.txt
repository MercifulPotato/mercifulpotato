From some Googling it seems like the updater copies itself to a random directory each time it runs [1], and I guess Little Snitch classifies programs by their full path, so it sees it as a new program each time.<p>Copying itself is odd and probably suboptimal behavior, but it is explainable without assuming malice: my guess is that it’s related to some kind of “before we update let’s update the updater” bootstrapping logic.  I could be wrong, but IIRC the updater code is open source, so it should be easy to find out.<p>[Edit: Oops, it&#x27;s actually not open source.  Their Windows updater (Omaha) is open source, but their Mac one (Keystone) is not.  Of course, one can still open the binaries in a decompiler.]<p>Regardless, moving a program around on disk, or even deleting the program while it’s running (which is possible on macOS), would not prevent it from showing up in Activity Monitor.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reecefowell.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;ksfetch-annoyance-on-mac-os-x-10-8-ml-with-hands-off-or-little-snitch-firewall&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reecefowell.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;ksfetch-annoyance-on-m...</a>')
