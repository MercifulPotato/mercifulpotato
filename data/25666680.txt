But there are limitations:<p>- SMS is not encrypted.<p>- SMS supports text only. MMS is not well supported, and often not free.<p>- SMS is sometimes not as &quot;instant&quot; as it can be delayed.<p>- Delivery reports and, read receipts are not user-friendly, and maybe unreliable, too.<p>- Group SMS support depends on your default SMS app.<p>RCS or Rich Communication Service on 4g and 5g looks to fix this, but support and compatibility between network is still lacking. Privacy laws also need a reevaluation as even cellular providers are looking to data harvesting to make more money and RCS may also lack encryption support.')
