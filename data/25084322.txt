Whether it’s the dasher’s fault or the app’s or the restaurant’s who knows, but it happens too frequently.<p>The dasher doesn&#x27;t actually order or make your food, they just pick it up and drive it to you... AFAIK the restaurant has an app aka &quot;the tablet&quot; which they receive orders on that they can press a &quot;ready in 15 minutes&quot; button on when the order is ready.')
