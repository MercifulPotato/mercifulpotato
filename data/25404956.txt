I think the key feature of programming is <i>legibility</i>. A program is something that is clear enough to read and understand, to be decomposed in its constituent parts, and that has understandable semantics.<p>For example, writing an algorithm that has precise steps and procedures is programming. Putting my input into a box, shaking the box, and taking the result out is not programming, even if the box somehow solved the problem. Merely describing a problem and then having it solved is not enough to delineate programming, because that actually does apply to almost anything.')
