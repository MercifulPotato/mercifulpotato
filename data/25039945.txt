(I have to wait 15 seconds before the &quot;viewfinder&quot; even shows an image and then it might update the picture once every third seconds (if I&#x27;m lucky) - completely unusable). And it seems to be a very common issue. The ratings on the camera apps tell that users of seemingly all pixel devices have had this issue since recent updates (for at least a month now).<p>Not a word from google. I have no idea how to even figure out if this is a hardware or software issue.<p>Anyone know anything about this?')
