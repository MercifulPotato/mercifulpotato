Monday they leave for China.  The next Thursday, they have a business meeting in China where they are symptomatic but have suppressed obvious symptoms with OTC cold medication - who wouldn&#x27;t if you flew thousands of miles for a meeting?<p>A dozen people sit in a room in Wuhan with some infected person for several hours.<p>---<p>&gt; Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.<p>An &quot;extraordinary claim&quot; is along the lines of UFOs, ghosts and goblins.<p>There are hundreds of millions of international passengers a year.  That an unknown infectious disease could travel from Europe to Asia undetected is hardly an &quot;extraordinary claim&quot;.<p>Pending any hard evidence at all, it can only be described as a hypothesis.')
