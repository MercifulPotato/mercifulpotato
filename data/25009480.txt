First mover advantage I guess. It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;d have been able to prevent it anyways, as the root stores are not under their control, especially when Let&#x27;s encrypt is being supported, even started, by the entities which run the root stores (Mozilla, through Firefox, and Google, through Android).
