These weren&#x27;t documented acronyms but rather &quot;socially understood&quot; acronyms that meant each time I didn&#x27;t understand something I had to message someone asking.<p>While onboarding the amount of times I message people asking for help is so much that it gets uncomfortable (for me, at least) so minimizing the acronyms would be super helpful.<p>As a counter-point, though, it could be that each culture&#x2F;tribe needs their own language that only they can understand and it creates this feeling of comradery? Just a thought.')
