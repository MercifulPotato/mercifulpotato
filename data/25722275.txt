The developers are also maintaining Fedora Jam with KDE installed by default too. Unfortunately all the big commercial distros are using GNOME as default DE because RedHat is providing the commercial support for GNOME already and it&#x27;s easier for them to just make the same choice. So I don&#x27;t think Ubuntu will switch to KDE anytime soo, even if GNOME developers don&#x27;t like Ubuntu and make their opinion very public.<p>For those interested on why artists like Plasma so much, David Revoy made a nice summary: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davidrevoy.com&#x2F;article783&#x2F;kubuntu-linux-20-04-for-a-digital-painting-workstation-reasons-and-install-guide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davidrevoy.com&#x2F;article783&#x2F;kubuntu-linux-20-04-fo...</a>.')
