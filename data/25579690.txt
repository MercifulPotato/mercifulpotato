They offer several pricing plans, but I like the $40&#x2F;year registration and backup mail spool.  If your main MX server goes down, I believe they hold your email on the secondary for up to a week?  Cheap insurance at $3&#x2F;month.  Been very happy with support (live person picks up the phone, and generally is an engineer). Web interface is nice, they support standard privacy screen functions for whois, and generally seem to be good people.<p>My only affiliation with them is as a happy customer.')
