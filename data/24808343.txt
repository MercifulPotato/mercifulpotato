MS products always seem to prioritize corporate interests at the expense of user experience.<p>To give an example, I got a graphics card with ray tracing capabilities, and I wanted to try the Minecraft RTX beta to see what this ray tracing thing was all about.  In order to install it, I needed to create an account in this special XBox program, and then I had to delete and re-install the Minecraft application several times in order for the windows store to install the correct version.  I think I rebooted the entire computer at least 3 times in the process.  And on reboot, after signing up for this &quot;insider&quot; program, I got a new prompt about sending my usage data back to MS.<p>Once I did get it installed, I found that the Minecraft home-screen is now a garish display designed to put micro-transactions in front of you, to the point I had to hunt a bit for how to start a new game.  After all of this the RTX portion turned out to be a half-finished mess, and I had to read a tutorial online to figure out how to even access RTX content.<p>So basically the user experience I had, in trying to play a game for children, felt akin to being forced to walk down a dark alley and shaken down by MS in order to access the content I wanted.<p>Honestly it&#x27;s part of the reason I&#x27;m not a big fan of VSCode.  The &quot;suggested&quot; popup feature just seems like it follows this trend of MS finding ways to put content in front of the user without asking, and I&#x27;m just not confident it&#x27;s not going to be abused in the future to up-sell me on Azure services or something.')
