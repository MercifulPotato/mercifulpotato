The screen sharing archetype can be one of many possibilities, albeit not one that is (to your point) particularly well suited since the existing tools do well enough with that use case. The hope is that the existing metaphors people are used to can just act as a bridge to enabling them to take more full advantage of the benefits of a fully spatial, mixed media 3D world.')
