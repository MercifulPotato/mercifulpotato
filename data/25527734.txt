You threw out that label and never mentioned a single plot point to substantiate your claim.<p>I believe there&#x27;s very little deus ex machina. The main point is that Voldemort delved too greedily into dark magic, weakening himself very much, while Lily&#x27;s love magic was pure and protected her son against Voldemort&#x27;s evil magic. This is why Harry can see into his mind and why he manages amazing feats like Gringotts or escape at Godric&#x27;s Hollow, because Voldemort&#x27;s hubris handed Harry the tools. It&#x27;s all explained in the chapter &quot;King&#x27;s Cross&quot;, re-read that chapter and you&#x27;ll gain fresh clarity.<p>JKR does introduce new concepts and history unknown previously to Harry, but name a book she doesn&#x27;t do that. She&#x27;d be raked over the coals if she didn&#x27;t offer anything new in one of her longest of the seven books. She needed the Deathly Hallows as a new mystery, a new suspense that creates tension throughout the book, pulling you onwards and competing for the horcruxes. It also highlights Harry&#x27;s temptation to attain that which Dumbledore sought, but ultimately Harry chose the wiser path than Albus.<p>The other new concept was wand lore, which was not very fleshed out before DH. I don&#x27;t love that wand lore dictated the final duel so heavily, why does Harry have to win based on overpowering a 3rd wizard, the wand truly knows that? Why not just have Harry&#x27;s courageous, love-inspired magic overcome Voldemorts? It&#x27;s kind of a letdown that Harry beats Voldy because he took 3 wands from Draco&#x27;s hand...<p>Other than these two concepts, I don&#x27;t see anything new and cheap like a deus ex machina. That term would literally mean that Harry is defeated by Voldemort in the end (he never was), only to be saved by a God at the last minute (he never was). Harry won on his and his allies&#x27; courage, and Voldemort lost due to his own hubris and his own determination to focus on wands and to tell all his servants not to kill Harry.')
