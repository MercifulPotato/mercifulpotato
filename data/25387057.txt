Item(by='nrmitchi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607701929, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25386909, text='&gt; How often do you hear it for Airbnb? I haven&#x27;t heard someone express that worry yet.<p>I think the &quot;not getting murdered&quot; but is more to do with the demographic of people who are &quot;hosts&quot; with the service that they offer (which are mostly whole-homes). It is just at a higher price point that doesn&#x27;t match the stereotype of &quot;murderous Uber driver&quot;. If someone did &quot;something&quot; it&#x27;s a lot riskier to kill someone in a property that you own vs a moving vehicle. I&#x27;m not saying that stereotype is valid in any way, Uber&lt;-&gt;Airbnb isn&#x27;t really a valid comparison there.<p>That being said, I have 100% heard both stories and concerns about people&#x27;s privacy being violated in Airbnb&#x27;s. Hidden cameras, nosey &quot;hosts&quot;, etc. That&#x27;s not even including the trust issues around &quot;I showed up and the host won&#x27;t let me in and Airbnb is not being helpful, what am I supposed to do now?&quot;. Those trust issues definitely still exist.')
