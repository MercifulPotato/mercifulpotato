I imagine it’s a drop in replacement for NFS.<p>Cloud storage access control and data lifecycle control is much more advanced which is something you would probably have to give up with this. Eg IAM restrictions per bucket&#x2F;object, lifecycle policies etc.<p>If you’re writing new apps, I don’t see why you would want to add another abstraction layer rather than access cloud storage directly except for very specific use cases.')
