You can construct simple, iterative programs like `while(f(i++)){} return password;` whose behavior depends on hard problems like the Riemann Hypothesis (or easier problems which automated theorem provers still struggle with). Tree-shaking will be unfruitful, but if you can otherwise prove that an equivalent program exists that doesn&#x27;t leak the password then iO gives an implementation.<p>One interesting additional property is that you don&#x27;t need to come up with the program which doesn&#x27;t leak a password; you just need to prove that one exists, which potentially might be substantially easier.')
