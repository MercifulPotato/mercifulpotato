The irony is that fake news is basically both sides of the spectrum. I&#x27;m personally on the right-wing side of politics and it just cringes me at how many people on the right-wing buy into baseless conspiracy theories. I always tell people that fighting over a mask is not exactly the hill you want to die on.
