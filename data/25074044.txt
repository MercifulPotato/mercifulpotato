And faster.<p>&gt; Go has support for assembly and supports SIMD intrinsics just fine.<p>But wait, in this sense any language has support for assembly and SIMD. Bundled assembler is not the same as language-level support for SIMD - and even in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;program&#x2F;mandelbrot-csharpcore-1.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;...</a> a large portion of SIMD code is actually cross-platform (what uses Vector&lt;double&gt;), and I am pretty sure sticking to just cross-platform SIMD APIs would be enough to beat Go.<p>&gt; You wouldn&#x27;t compare a C# code optimized with SIMD intrinsics with Go code that doesn&#x27;t use SIMD intrinsics.<p>You use what&#x27;s not against the rules, and it&#x27;s not against the rules on CLBG. You&#x27;re free to submit your own version of the same benchmark on Go relying on SIMD or whatever you prefer.<p>&gt; It compares implementation of the benchmark code, not the quality of the compilers on the code that you&#x27;ll actually write in real life.<p>Yes, any benchmark is somewhat biased. But honestly, comparing real-life benchmarks is even harder - they involve much more components, so whoever isn&#x27;t happy with the results can always claim it&#x27;s a comparison of frameworks, not the actual programs, etc., etc.')
