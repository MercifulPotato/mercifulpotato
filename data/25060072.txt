I&#x27;m happy to celebrate Sketch as a great Mac app, and I still keep it in the dock for short tasks, but I&#x27;m not looking back. Figma won me over.<p>And it&#x27;s not just Figma&#x27;s collaborative features. Figma made fundamentally better decisions about design tool feature set. Better vector editor. Better concept of &quot;symbol&quot; as a component. Much better approach to auto-layout. Much better approach to shared colors &#x2F; text styles.<p>At every step, Figma is just a better designed design tool. And a large part of why it&#x27;s taking the design world by storm is exactly that. Most design work is done alone, not collaboratively dragging elements on the screen. Figma is just a great tool. Sketch is trying to catch up, but they would need to modify a LOT of their past decisions to get to the spot Figma is at.')
