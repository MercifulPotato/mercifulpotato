Spacetime is expanding. Inflation is a word reserved for the idea of a period of hyper-expansion in the very early universe.<p>The expansion of spacetime is also accelerating. Stars that are very far away from us will be increasing their distance faster than light could travel. They are passing beyond our horizon.<p>What you call &quot;quantic intrication&quot; is usually referred to as quantum entanglement. Current working theories have it that entangled fields interact over a spacetime bridge (an Einstein-Rosen bridge) also known as a wormhole, between the two allowing locality of information exchange (ER=EPR conjecture).')
