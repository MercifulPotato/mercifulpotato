Especially if you then keep the brightness up, you just have smaller things that are super bright.  Probably compounded, as your eyes are adjusted for less light.  At least in light themes, your eyes completely adjust to block more light.<p>Though, again, the point is more that <i>even with</i> dark mode, turn down the brightness.  (I think.
