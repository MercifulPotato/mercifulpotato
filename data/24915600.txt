True innovation, like the silicon chip itself, stands the test of time.<p>&gt; Most importantly, Tesla continues to innovate.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what his definition of innovation is, here. Both Amazon and Tesla took existing technologies and ideas, put then together in a novel way, and iterated on them. Is it because Amazon (excluding AWS) doesn&#x27;t build something physical? And if we include AWS, how can you argue that changing the way software infrastructure is managed <i>not</i> innovative?')
