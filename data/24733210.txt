The idea is the same work generates more value. Some of that extra value can be passed back to the employee, but if <i>all</i> of it is passed back to the employee, then the goods produced don&#x27;t actually get cheaper. If nothing gets cheaper, there&#x27;s no incentive for a business to invest in tech that makes employees more productive.<p>The data in the piece has a lot of problems with it too, but I think the core assumption is fundamentally off-base.')
