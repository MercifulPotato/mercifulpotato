I&#x27;m not interested in SSR or SSG at all. Mithril.js looks very promising as it provides you with everything you might need to build a simple web app out of the box. The only other frameworks that do that is Angular and Ember, but they&#x27;re both declining in popularity especially Ember. On the other hand React.js has CRA that is very complicated and doesn&#x27;t even come with routing out of the box. Is there any other good and modern SPA framework out there?')
