It seems a bit far fetched that the existence of cross-cutting categories like fluffy would be applied to all the different conceptions of what are basically tools or obstacles, as I&#x27;ve learned, that the brain tends to categorize into. If fluffy did exist as a sort of meta-category, though, perhaps it would exist in the touch circuitry as a bit of meta data associated with that specific usable object.<p>In a nutshell, my contention is that the brain does not have a library of categories it uses to efficiently map objects like some kind of database with tags, but rather builds an individual association for each object, of course in a web of relations, and it is this individual association that comes to represent the object as a tool or obstacle.')
