It&#x27;s not part of his platform. They are benefitting bigly from donations and favorable coverage from FAANG. Biden himself is prone to sell out to foreign companies as evidenced by his son&#x27;s dealings in China, Ukraine, and Russia. You can&#x27;t expect someone that corrupt to go after monopoly corruption.')
