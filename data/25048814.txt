My wife is a teacher and prints often enough that the ink never dries up.<p>What you need if you want to print ink often is an inkjet with CISS (continuous inkjet supply system).  You used to have to hack these together with third party gear (which I&#x27;ve done), but now the companies sell their own models.  Take a look at the Epson EcoTank products.  We&#x27;ve have one for a couple years, and it works very well.  Ink is cheap and lasts a long time.  And no way the printer can tell if you&#x27;re using third party ink or not :)')
