We shouldn&#x27;t be setting a precedent for a world in which the EU writes laws for everyone that take effect for products developed outside their borders.<p>To put it in context, just because EU users look at your site does not mean you need to follow EU laws any more than if China users look at your site or Iran users look at your site. You only need to follow your own jurisdiction&#x27;s laws, and other countries can act to block your site if they don&#x27;t like it.<p>That said, I&#x27;m pro-privacy and think there should be better regulation about that in the US.')
