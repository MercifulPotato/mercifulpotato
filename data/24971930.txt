Item(by='dwheeler', descendants=None, kids=[24975356], score=None, time=1604344773, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24961092, text='I did say, &quot;If this is a real DMCA takedown...&quot;.<p>You are legally correct that GitHub in isn&#x27;t obligated to take down a work if they receive a DMCA notice. But that would be very bad advice to take. GitHub handles millions of repos. GitHub could take a huge gamble by keeping the material posted after a DMCA request, or just take it down, wait for the DMCA counterclaim, and put it up after the counterclaim was filed. A CEO could easily get fired for risking the entire company when there was a no-risk alternative with the same result. The legal penalties are so stiff, and so easily avoided, that it would be improbable for a company to do anything else. This apparently isn&#x27;t a DMCA takedown anyway, but I thought I should comment on your response.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ll repeat myself yet again: They need a lawyer.')
