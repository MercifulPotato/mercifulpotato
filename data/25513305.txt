This practice is called a library, and it&#x27;s a very popular concept.<p>We&#x27;ve got three options to preserve human culture:<p>- extremely harsh copyright limits (single digit number of years, so it&#x27;s still in the public conscious and can actually be found again after copyright expires)<p>- copyright only applying for the duration that said content is widely available (no suing someone for publishing content you don&#x27;t even sell)<p>- refusing to abide by copyright laws (community sourced archives)<p>I&#x27;d be happy to go with either of the first two options, but media conglomerates aren&#x27;t, so piracy it is.')
