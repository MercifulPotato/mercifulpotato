So, why do people praise Microsoft so much? Satya Nadella turned it around, really? MS365 surveils you. Windows is full of telemetry, Cortana&#x2F;Bing ads and the UX is objectively bad as they have design from the 2000s mixed in with design from today. VSCode is a slow Electron app. I have a Surface - it is a flop and can&#x27;t compare to Apple. The new Xbox has worse performance than  PS5. LinkedIn is cancerous and nobody I know enjoys using it. The list goes on and on. I am at a loss to find a reason to use Microsoft products willingly, except GitHub which is still somewhat okay (yet).')
