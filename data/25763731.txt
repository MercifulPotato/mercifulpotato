It&#x27;s vital. And right now what the right in America is doing is wrong. I&#x27;m not some absolutist left-winger. I once had a firearms license here in Canada. Though I&#x27;m a happy Liberal Party of Canada member, I&#x27;ve voted for Conservatives in the past and I&#x27;m open to doing so in the future.<p>I do not have intolerance of other viewpoints. I actively seek out a broad range of views. What I have intolerance for is violence and calls to violence and lies. If that&#x27;s the charge against me I happily accept whatever verdict you or anyone else will levy against me. The truth matters. Peace matters. I am unwilling to let these half truths go by without comment or rebuke.')
