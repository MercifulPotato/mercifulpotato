You’re going to be drowning in new information and context and it’ll take you a few months to learn how to swim.&quot;<p>Useless is their word here, and the way they continue to describe it gives the same impression.<p>I&#x27;m in agreement that knowing how organizations work takes time and experience, but six months is indicative of a larger problem in the org. Brevity and succinct, digestive philosophy is valuable. If you can&#x27;t at least communicate a good outline to new hires in a month or two, something has gone wrong. The minutiae of course will take far longer than 6 months in total, but you should be able to &quot;swim&quot; by then, just not as fast as a 2-4 year vet.')
