These are &quot;GitHub Issues&quot;, many of which are feature requests, and many more are new users trying out this free open source software for the first time. Many of these &quot;bugs&quot; are from users asking why their setup isn&#x27;t working, and then failing to produce any kind of technical debug info when asked by the maintainers.')
