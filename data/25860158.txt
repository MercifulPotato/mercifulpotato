Let me elaborate.<p>I&#x27;m a bit of an old fart when it comes to software development. I prefer stable, slowly evolving solutions. I am a fan of the role of classical distributions. I abhor bundling every piece of software with all its particular versioned dependencies until everything works. I&#x27;m not gonna change. And that means I&#x27;m probably not the type to use Docker to deploy anything. That being said, I <i>do</i> see great value in it as a way for sysadmins to let semi-trusted people run their own OS on shared hardware without stepping on each other&#x27;s feet. I <i>love</i> that it lets all of us run each our OS of choice on our compute machines at work. But that&#x27;s just it: when I use Docker, I pretend it&#x27;s a VM. I really would like to learn to use it in a better and more appropriate way, but whenever I try to seek out information, quality search results are absolutely covered in garbage 10-second-attention span &quot;just type this until it works&quot; blogposts.<p>Any pointers?<p>(Alternative question: are there some cleaner solutions than Docker out there for the workflow I describe above?)')
