Surf Hill probably the sneakiest danger, it just didn&#x27;t have sufficient runoff, people regularly slammed head-first into the back &quot;padding&quot; at very high speed. Cannonball Loop definitely existed for a few years, but never saw it actually open. Standard Cannonball and Tarzan Swing shared an shockingly cold collection pool everyone was dumped into. Alpine Slide was way too easy to jump the tracks or flip. &quot;Cliff diving&quot; was probably 25, maybe 30 feet, was actually  safer than other rides because you could easily see if other people were in the way. Wave pool had 10 or 12 lifeguards but still was simply way too large to see everyone (plus they were evenly spaced instead of concentrated at the deep end with strongest waves). Saw, heard, experienced plenty of racism, anti-semitism, other -isms while in lines, in the changing rooms, etc., as might be expected when mixing kids from city, suburb, rural cultures and virtually no adult supervision. Plenty more rides, some were great, others disappointing, some it just depended on the day.<p>I can understand why an outsider might consider this place some kind of dystopian nightmare, with the injuries and chaos, but it was honestly the greatest place ever for a short period of age 16 to 20 or so. It did feel like a gauntlet you just had to put fear aside and make it through, in some ways, but then you felt stronger when you made it out alive, I guess.')
