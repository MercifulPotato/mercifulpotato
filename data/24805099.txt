Send them a &quot;window invitation&quot; and, when they accept, an arbitrary window is mirrored to their display.  Pairing? Everyone has a common &quot;virtual desktop&quot;, and you just have two people&#x27;s desktops temporarily merge.  Instead we have nonsense like Wayland that is retreating from the mantra that &quot;the network is the computer&quot; (Amazon WorkSpaces is particularly disappointing here: there is no way, afaict, to have two screens logged into the same desktop: something that&#x27;s trivial with tmux+ssh. My ideal is &quot;tmux, but for GUIs&quot;)')
