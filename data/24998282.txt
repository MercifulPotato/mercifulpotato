Item(by='ericvsmith', descendants=None, kids=[25007852, 24998462], score=None, time=1604585147, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998195, text='I have a decorator to add support for slots: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ericvsmith&#x2F;dataclasses&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;dataclass_tools.py" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ericvsmith&#x2F;dataclasses&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;datacl...</a> (although I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t tested it in a while).<p>The reason it&#x27;s not an option by default is because it would be the one case where the decorator would have to return a new class, and I didn&#x27;t want to do that on the first version. As it is, @dataclass just modifies an existing class. I might bite the bullet add a slots option, and we&#x27;ve had discussions on adding a language feature to automatically add slots to a class, based on annotations and maybe some other magic. If we did that, we wouldn&#x27;t need to return a new class. But it&#x27;s not a front-burner task for me.')
