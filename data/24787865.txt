My only gripe against Twilio is its definitely priced for enterprise.<p>I wouldnt build a startup on Twilio its costs eventually add up much higher than competitors. &quot;Just because someone spends a lot on marketing doesnâ€™t mean you should be paying for their marketing budget, especially as the core product commoditizes.&quot;[0] On the other hand they definitely have a rich API and I suppose they have tremendous uptime to boot. I never had a single issue setting up Twilio or Sendgrid any issues I had were with a web framework or other libraries, or network firewall but never Twilios APIs specifically.<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;alanquayle.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;sms-api-pricing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;alanquayle.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;02&#x2F;sms-api-pricing&#x2F;</a>')
