It feels like you can’t really iterate in an App Store product, it needs to be bullet proof on the first go.<p>Plus it needs to be native in iOS&#x2F;android to pull off the ui patterns. It just feels like a shit ton of work, but I sincerely believe it’s the obvious solution.<p>I’m perturbed by the mountain of work and execution necessary here, so of course, I indulge in the fantasy of it being built vs putting in daily progression towards making it a reality. All this leads to disliking who I am.')
