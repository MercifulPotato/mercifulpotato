This is what large neural networks are doing.<p>No, this is actually exactly the opposite of what the article is saying.<p>&quot;If you have enough lines you can approximate any curve within a margin&quot; is usually a bad thing because your approximations lose meaning as the number of lines increase.<p>The surprising thing about machine learning is that increasing the &quot;number of lines&quot;, if you will, increases the meaning, too, and there&#x27;s some wierd and subtle properties about mathematics in higher dimensions that makes this work.')
