January, when they were scheduled to <i>begin production?</i><p>The approximate delivery date on the kickstarter was listed then as July 2021. (I&#x27;m a little unclear whether the revised date of August 2021 applies to everyone or just to those who bought from SpecNext.com after the crowdfunding campaign ended, but... who cares?)<p>&gt; I&#x27;m also pretty fed up that, at least at times, critical comments about the project have been deleted from YouTube channels supportive of it (none of my comments that have been deleted have been any more strongly worded than this one).<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that what you&#x27;re saying is &quot;strongly worded,&quot; the problem is that it&#x27;s dishonest.')
