We collectively choose not to, on average.<p>While I agree with this on principle, to me it looks like it gives the collective us an agency which I would argue isn&#x27;t really there in that not enough people consider it as a factor.<p>I think that many people don&#x27;t really care. As another commenter said, people seem to care more about &quot;specs&quot; (like in the commenter&#x27;s example with people preferring Samsung phones because of the bigger screens) and about having the latest phone.<p>This makes me wonder what percentage of people actually have to repair their phones, and of those, how many would have opted to do it themselves with off-brand components.<p>While I understand the philosophical concerns around repairability and mostly like my laptops to be repairable, I also get the feeling that for phones it only now may become important, if at all, because of their usable life.<p>My previous phone was a Galaxy S5, with a user replaceable battery. A new Samsung battery from a reputable store (not Amazon) costed 50-60 €. A battery replacement for the iphone costs 70 € at an authorised shop (I&#x27;m in Paris, France). I know I could have used an &quot;alternative brand&quot; battery in the GS5, but after a terrible experience with such a battery for a camera, I wouldn&#x27;t go through that again.<p>Now I understand that this or that model may have design issues which would have random components fail prematurely. But I doubt that replacing the component with an off-brand one would be that great. I&#x27;d consider that model a lemon and avoid it. Even if it would be simple, I&#x27;d hate to have to replace my phone&#x27;s [x] every two weeks.')
