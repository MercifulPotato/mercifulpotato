Random ideas for projects and articles, problems and solutions, schemas and drawings, lists and tasks. Whenever I get stuck with a project I will open my notebook and start writing everything down, breaking down the complexities of the task into smaller less terrifying chunks, pinpointing the most problematic parts. In most cases putting it all on paper gives me the clarity needed to jump the hurdle and move forward with the project. I think it often comes down to a problem being too complex to fully fit in my mind. By writing it down I make the notebook an extension of my limited short-term memory. It&#x27;s a bit like swap memory when you run out of RAM â€“ it&#x27;s significantly slower, but can save you when the memory requirements of the task exceed what&#x27;s immediately available.')
