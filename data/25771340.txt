Remember rocks getting thrown at the Google busses? It&#x27;s both.<p>This is primarily attributable to two causes:<p>1. distorted views that result directly from inequality and the extreme poverty some communities have: to the (stereo)typical Tenderloin resident, as person who is able to afford a modest 3&#x2F;2 townhome appears to be vastly wealthy<p>2. the mistaken view of techies, themselves, as being in the same class as those who actually are wealthy, and presenting as such (including the disaffected&#x2F;indifferent attitude towards those in even lower socioeconomic brackets), which reinforces (1)<p>&gt; At the end of the day Bezos makes headlines but his personal largesse has very little effect on most people in the country. It has very little impact on the lives of folks getting &quot;pushed out&quot; of SF. That&#x27;s the folks he employs.<p>That&#x27;s so out of line with actual reality it&#x27;s best classified as &quot;not even wrong.&quot; I don&#x27;t even know where to begin with it.
