The flight time is cut from 6.5h to 3.5h. Let&#x27;s add 2 hours overhead at each end (somewhat ... optimistic), which makes it 10.5h vs 7.5h.<p>LA-Sydney is 14.5h vs 8.5h, or 18.5h vs 12.5h end to end.<p>Is that difference really going to change if you take the trip or not? Would you be willing to pay a significant markup for that?<p>Seems like the market would be constrained to relatively high profile business travel.')
