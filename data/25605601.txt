I have repeated multiple times in other comments that DeepMind&#x27;s success is at least built on top of Google&#x27;s tech and capital.<p>Interesringly, Google&#x27;s tech infrastructure were blueprinted by a lot of pioneers and two of the most well known are Urs Hozle and Luiz Andr√© Barroso both are of Eu descentdent.<p>There is no evidence that whatever DeepMind did can be done with another EU partner. Or even anyone who is not Google, largely thanks to Larry and Sergey&#x27;s personal tastes and experience. I doubt Msft or Amazon have the right culture for DeepMind.<p>The whole alphabet thing was engineered to allow independency. So that, among other things, a more pure research org can work without the ever encroaching of the profit driven hands inside Google.
