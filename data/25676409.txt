Rotating a second monitor and dedicating it to showing lots of logs or several rectangular monitoring screens tiled vertically hugely reduced the amount of window management I had to do.<p>In fact I kind of wonder why all my monitors are horizontal again. Probably because horizontal works better for personal computing, or I have my monitors arranged wrong, or both.')
