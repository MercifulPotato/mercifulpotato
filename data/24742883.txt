Iâ€™m with you on that in general, but I am considering buying a used 911, want Speed Yellow or Riviera Blue, and have realized that it might be much cheaper and easier to find a black&#x2F;silver&#x2F;white car with the mechanical options I want and wrap it for color. Especially white as they seem to come with a discount.')
