For an individual hacker, dynamically typed languages make a lot of sense. I don&#x27;t forget what types my functions accept as I am writing a program. All static typing can accomplish is slow me down when I&#x27;m trying to bang out something. This is why Python (for instance) is loved by data scientists, researchers, and startups. And they&#x27;re right to love it! Purely anecdotal, but I can accomplish more faster (from a clean slate) with a dynamic language like Python than I can with Haskell, Go, or Rust. The difference is small, but non-negligible.<p>But static typing has a few key benefits:<p>* No searching through comments for type constraints.<p>* Better autocompletion.<p>* Better compilation.<p>* Better serialization&#x2F;deserialization.<p>I do think static typing pays for itself in the long term. Sometimes, we shouldn&#x27;t care about that. Engineering means managing tradeoffs: short-term velocity vs long-term performance and maintainability?')
