Antic would halt the CPU and take over the bus in order to transfer data from main memory to use for display purposes, be it character or bitmap data<p>You could choose from a variety of modes (15 in all, IIRC) and add horizontal or vertical smooth scrolling to each mode-line individually by toggling a bit in the display-list entry.<p>One further bit allowed you to set a DLI (Display-list interrupt) where the CPU would be interrupted and run your code at that end of the specific display-line on-screen - you had the flyback interval to effect something (not a lot, but you could change colour registers, character-sets, do a few register operations, basically).<p>So it was minimally programmable, and certainly not comparable to today&#x27;s stuff - but it was groundbreaking in its day.')
