NS does not do it&#x27;s job freeing memory from UI.<p>The natural JS leakiness gets amplified if a leaked part references any JS object.<p>Performance suffers whenever any native API gets called from a JS loop, as exporting Java&#x27;s objects into JS, and accessing them is very resource intensive. The only way around it was to move loops to Java side of the code.<p>&gt; Also, did you try either Flutter or React Native afterwards or go straight to native? Did you find them better?<p>Flutter is not much better, though feels to be a bit more professionally done. It&#x27;s too a memory hog, it&#x27;s too a CPU hog, and it&#x27;s still gets way more issues over a native app to warrant its use just for economic reasons.<p>RN also shares the same Java-JS interop issues as NS.')
