And speeds less than C are observable, and do change w.r.t. an unboosted observer.<p>Rotational invariance would rotate both the source and the detector, and there would be no surprise that the possible results and statistics over them are unchanged.<p>The quantum surprise is that rotating the source relative to the detector leaves the possible results unchanged (though the statistics <i>do</i> change).')
