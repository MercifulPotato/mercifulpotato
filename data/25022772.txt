The seeming binary choice is part of the cause for all this. First election of Trump was a real cry that some seem to have forgotten. I am genuinely not sure how this is simply glossed over and simply explained as &#x27;racism&#x27;,&#x27;anti-science&#x27;,or w&#x2F;e. I still remember driving through Ohio and seeing signs along the lines of &#x27;Help us Trump&#x27; pre-2016.<p>And the simple reality is that until it is addressed, we will have a non-zero chance of another Trump or Trump-like candidate in the future. Worse, we will have a candidate, who is much, much smarter, who saw all the new avenues and the ways things could be done..<p>Instead, we have this weird sports event with confused crowd cheering equivalent of &#x27;my team won&#x27;. It is fucking depressing. I may be bitter, because I genuinely hate sports too.')
