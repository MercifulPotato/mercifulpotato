But it has been fine since the recent 2004 update.<p>Quite surprisingly, VcXsrv works very well as well out of the box. No additional configuration to what&#x27;s mentioned in the article has been needed.\nRunning a full GUI is a bit over the top but being able to run Linux GUI apps is sometimes a must.<p>This setup is all I&#x27;ve been asking for a long time and is worth trying to anyone who devs on Linux but wants to run windows as everyday OS.')
