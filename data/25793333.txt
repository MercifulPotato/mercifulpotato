Some have followed other religions with similar devotion.<p>Your bias is without basis.  Faith is an important component of many people&#x27;s lives.<p>I work for a company that is overtly Christian.  They advertise it on their web page, they have morning prayer meetings, they have a chapel and a chaplain.  They donate to Christian causes and partner with Christian colleges.  It&#x27;s also not a hiring metric (obviously), and it&#x27;s not used to discriminate against anyone, and many of my very successful co-workers do not profess any religion.<p>Judge people on their technical ability, not your opinion of their faith.  Judge people on the content of their character, not your opinion of who they pray to.')
