They appear on the map in the car and the car tells you if the station is full (or partially broken) of people and potentially re-routes you. Tesla charge location also usually have multiple very high performance chargers. Tesla chargers are usually higher at charging that the waste majority of other chargers. Payment is fully integrated with your Tesla account.<p>So its drive in, plug in, wait, plug out and drive away.<p>Pretty much non of that works consistently for other networks and the are usually slower and you have to spend there longer as well.<p>There are standards for the plug, standards, Europe is well standardized, US a bit less, China is a bigger mess. Important to note however, the plug is standard, the payment system on the other hand is not. Or rather it is partially standardized but the software compatibility might not actually work very well or is simply not implemented at all.')
