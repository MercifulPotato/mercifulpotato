People hate UPC for business tactics but their network is <i>good</i> and available everywhere.<p>Now in UK I have to put up with shitty 15 Mbit so called broadband and no sane amount of money can get me anything higher on a cable in my block. 1Gbit fiber is a feature for luxury housing. I&#x27;m paying for two extra unlimited data 4G SIMs (at least 4G network is kind of reasonable) and a VPS and spent weekends polishing my MPTCP VPN setup for get something resembling 100 Mbit broadband, but way more unstable and expensive.')
