We just got an M1 Macbook Pro and nearly half of our machines are already updated to Big Sur and we haven&#x27;t had any major issues. The only issue has been an old kext from Cisco that can&#x27;t be approved anymore but it hasn&#x27;t caused any major issues and Cisco has already let us know that there&#x27;s an update to that incoming. In my experience, this transition has been way smoother so far (even with the limited input) than our changeover to Windows 10.')
