How would you feel about it?<p>Similarly to how I react to replacing &quot;communism&quot; with &quot;[economic] liberalism&quot; and &quot;Marx&quot; with &quot;Rand&quot; and &quot;Engels&quot; with &quot;the Chicago boys&quot;. Unsurprisingly, changing the words in a text changes its meaning.<p>&gt; There are probably millions of people in the USA who barely escaped with their lives from vile communist regimes and yet the idea of communism is still entertained as some misunderstood noble thing. Until there will be &quot;Nuremberg trials&quot; equivalent for communism such ideas will unfortunately continue to propagate.<p>What do you think are the ideas of communism and of Marx and Engels in general?')
