Former Obama administration staffer Michael Simon said that he is gathering the names of anyone who supported Trump in the 2016 and 2020 election, and has created a project for this (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;trumpaccproject" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;trumpaccproject</a>).<p>This seems like the logical end of cancel culture and deplatforming, which is to assemble a list of people and organizations to target or shame or blacklist. I find this to be a very disagreeable suggestion given that people simply are exercising their constitutional and political rights and this furthers division, encourages extremism, and has a chilling silencing effect on civil discourse.<p>To me this reeks of authoritarian Leftism, like the violence seen in past revolutions in China or Russia. There is also a great deal of irony as well, since AOC and her supporters are certainly not calling for a blacklist of Marxists, despite Marxism being the cause of over 100M deaths in the 20th century.')
