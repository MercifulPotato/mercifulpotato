It&#x27;s not because I hate your tooling (it is visually nice and very featureful), it&#x27;s because the culture that delivered this software is antithetical to anything I look for in a software project I want to use or contribute to. How can I possibly do my job to any degree of satisfaction when I&#x27;m tracking work in a tool that requires 15 seconds between mouse clicks? That is the reality of Jira, and as a result I refuse to use it, or work for people who find that acceptable, because it&#x27;s a &quot;broken window&quot; that tells me much more about the target environment than merely something about suboptimal bug trackers.<p>Your page budget should be 100ms max, given all your tools actually do are track a couple of text fields in a pleasing style. Whoever the architecture astronauts are at Atlassian that created the current mess, flush them out, no seat is too senior -- this is an existential issue for your business.')
