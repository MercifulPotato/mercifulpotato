There simply needs to be ambition to accept a lower percent dividend per barrel in the same market, with the tradeoff&#x2F;tradeup that the environmental impact per barrel is dramatically lesser by a much greater percentage.<p>So you make money as reliably as an oil company, only less of it but it&#x27;s still possible for everybody to win.<p>Depends on what you are committed to.<p>OTOH whether it&#x27;s photosynthetic, photocatalytic, photovoltaic or direct radiant solar, efficiency is not as much of a show-stopper as it would seem.  Any net gain is free energy.')
