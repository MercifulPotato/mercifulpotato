Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25427113], score=None, time=1608006389, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25426526, text='&gt; Comparing pointers derived from entirely different objects (or arrays) isn&#x27;t legit.<p>The quote from the standard in your article contradicts the part you quoted:<p>&gt; Two pointers compare equal if and only if both are null pointers, both are pointers to the same object (including a pointer to an object and a subobject at its beginning) or function, both are pointers to one past the last element of the same array object, or one is a pointer to one past the end of one array object and the other is a pointer to the start of a different array object that happens to immediately follow the first array object in the address space.<p>But in any case the program in the article doesn&#x27;t compare pointers; it casts the pointers to integers and then compares those integers, which is always legitimate.')
