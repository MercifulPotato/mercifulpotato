I am helping my friends at Braavo Capital to launch their app analytics service on Product Hunt today.<p>Some of my portfolio companies that I invested in are actually using their reports for the investor updates and I love those! They really give a complete financial picture of everything happening in the company from profits to info that helps predict valuable cohorts to target user acquisition. Something that other tools can&#x27;t do.<p>Anyway, here is a 25% OFF promo code that I got and happy to share BRAAVOFRIENDS25. Please share with your app founders, ask them to give it a try &amp; would love to hear the feedback. Please share, and support the launch as well. Thank you!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;braavo-analytics-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;braavo-analytics-1</a>')
