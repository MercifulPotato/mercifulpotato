Item(by='fullstop', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606952573, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25283290, text='5 seconds after sleep, <i>except when kept unlocked by Smart Lock</i>.  For Smart Lock, I have &quot;On Body Detection&quot; as well as a trusted Bluetooth device enabled.<p>Part of the disconnect here is likely how I am understanding &quot;Trusted Bluetooth Device&quot;.  I likely have to unlock it once while paired with that BT device, while the text says &quot;$DEVICE_NAME unlocks this device when nearby&quot;.')
