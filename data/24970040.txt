Do you disagree? Democrats didn&#x27;t solve any core issues in USA the last times they were elected and Biden has promised to not solve any either. Corona is a very small issue in the long run after all, USA&#x27;s very short expected lifespan compared to countries with similar wealth kills way more people every single year and nobody has a solution. Instead they squabble over minor things when millions of preventable deaths happens every single year. I&#x27;d argue that any candidate who doesn&#x27;t acknowledge the issue and aims to fix it is not a valid candidate. Obama at least tried even though his solution failed.')
