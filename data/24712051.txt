The IP address is not a property that the base stations care about at all, it&#x27;s generally tied to the PDP context maintained by the GGSN&#x2F;PGW, which will generally not be invalidated unless the connection is idle. Mobile operators will only have a handful of core networks even in large countries; having a subscriber move from the area covered by one core network to another would be quite rare.<p>Switching between cells will cause a latency spike, and a lot of correlated packet loss if the subscriber has a large queue of undelivered data, but that&#x27;s all. But handling packet loss and ordering are what TCP is supposed to do.<p>I have no idea of what you mean by &quot;the TCP connection is no longer there&quot;. The TCP connection is a distributed system living on the client and the server. It doesn&#x27;t go away unless one of the endpoints decides so. (Modulo stateful middleboxes, like NATs. But nobody in their right mind would run a TCP state-aware middlebox on a cellular network base station).')
