I think it’d be possible to make something flat on both the cable and device side.<p>&gt; swapping the lightning port with a MagSafe one would make the phone pretty much impossible to use while charging<p>How so? I used my MacBook in bed while charging with MagSafe all the time. The magnets were fairly strong. With a cable going away from the bottom of the device, I think it’d be perfectly usable.<p>As far as waterproofing, getting rid of the lightning  port seems inevitable, because it allows for better hermetic sealing. A flush set of pins seems great for this goal, surely it’s trivial to avoid shorting something out in the prescience of liquid? (I am not an electrical engineer)')
