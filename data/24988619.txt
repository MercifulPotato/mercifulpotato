Who wants this? How many people?<p>As the Trump election (and many other elections around the world) show there is no &quot;we want&quot;. Different people want different things. Sweeping that fact under the carpet again and again leads to Paris type meaninglessness. Paris fails because there was never any &quot;we&quot;.<p>All the narratives of fear and blame, guilt and shame that have been tried did not make a dent.<p>Those who want to do something will do it and those that don&#x27;t want to wont.<p>Reconcile to that reality and things will actually move forward.')
