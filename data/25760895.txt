Item(by='Tycho', descendants=None, kids=[25761026], score=None, time=1610538495, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760353, text='Biden does appear to be the rightful victor, but it was a highly unusual and uniquely sketchy election, and, given the recent pattern of protests and riots cheered on by politicians (blm&#x2F;antifa trashing cities, mobs outside the White House and in the Capitol buildings for Supreme Court hearings), I’m only surprised that we’re not seeing <i>worse</i>. As the media hyperventilates to an ever greater pitch (“it was a coup!”), allowing all sorts of political opportunism, I’m starting to notice a chilling effect even in HN comments, with dissenters quieter than usual, opinion more lopsided.  Some might think that we will now revert to a saner political climate, but I fear that they are mistaken. The logic of leftism (constant redistribution of power in the name of addressing ‘unfairness’) may yet see us spiral into the abyss.')
