I checked it out and love it so far.  I&#x27;m going to make a point to listen to music through it for a bit and see what I find.   So far all the songs I&#x27;ve heard are Soundcloud and it&#x27;s hard to find any information on how&#x2F;where you source the material.  Is it soundcloud-only?  Any interest or plans for integrating a site like Bandcamp that&#x27;s more oriented around me eventually supporting the artist by buying something?')
