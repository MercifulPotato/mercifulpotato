Amazon has an Outside Activity policy that covers some employees (certainly all tech employees). For the vast majority of outside work activity that triggers the policy, you simply fill out a notification form that logs an affirmation that the activity does not trigger further review.<p>The license of open-source software that you want to contribute to on your own time is not part of the policy that would trigger further review. In other words, so long as developing that software is permitted by the outside activity policy, you are free to develop and make software available under AGPL on your own time while being an Amazon employee.')
