We recognised that there were a lot of Meditation apps that had very expensive monthly fees, profiting from people&#x27;s suffering and a practice that has been around for thousands of years. We&#x27;ve been around only for about a year and we&#x27;ve had around 400,000 downloads and are quite often to top search result for &#x27;meditation&#x27; on the Play Store. Very exciting!')
