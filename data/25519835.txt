Item(by='jiveturkey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608744225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25509465, text='ah thanks. yes, all startups operate &quot;underwater&quot; then. that is the operating model.<p>as to the use of venture capital, indeed, no investor will ever allow this -- if they have a say. seed stage funding is most often convertible debt, and the investor does not have a say (legally; but you damn well better do what they say anyway). i&#x27;m actually quite surprised that a seed investor would be noncommittal on it. however,<p>1&#x2F; that&#x27;s the other cofounder&#x27;s problem, not OPs. the way you phrase it is as if the OP is putting the other cofounder out on a limb with an unreasonable request; that is not the situation here.<p>2&#x2F; the other cofounder doesn&#x27;t have to use capital, they can take on debt (convertible or straight debt).<p>It&#x27;s an absolutely wonderful tradeoff if the business will be run better and more efficiently with just the one cofounder. A no-brainer really. Not doing it indicates a scam. In both cases, OP should insist on a buyout. So there&#x27;s really no difficult decision here -- on OP&#x27;s part anyway.<p>Of course with the business being &quot;underwater&quot; we are talking about a personal guarantee on straight debt. So again, how much does the other cofounder believe in the business and that his motives are pure?<p>The other cofounder can sidestep this whole thing with various shenanigans, however that doesn&#x27;t mean OP should just submit. A year of OPs life is worth it to stick to his guns, even if the outcome is inevitable. It&#x27;s not as if OP has to invest any effort to see through his position.')
