And fascinatingly unique in that it&#x27;s global public good, reasonably successfully managed without government intervention.<p>If the barricading is in reference to price increases, then again it&#x27;s not the acquisition that enabled this, it was the contract change with ICANN. Registries transfer ownership all the time. .Biz was acquired by GoDaddy this year, and Afilias who run .info as well as the technical backend for .org was acquired by Donuts. No one made a fuss about these, which is another reason why the .org upset feels arbitrary.  Is there something inherently bad with those acquisitions?<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand the drifting comment. .Org continues to position itself as a place for everyone. It&#x27;s not clear to me what policies you think are drifting from that.<p>What I think people continue to miss is that by and large the Registry is far, far less involved in the life of any particular domain than the Registrar.  Their policy choices, pressure points, and regulatory requirements are substantially more impactful than those of the Registry.')
