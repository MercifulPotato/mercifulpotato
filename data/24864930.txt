As a PoC, it worked in that if focus was set to a background object and then someone stepped in the direct line of the ultrasound, the stepper would turn in the correct direction to bring in focus. It was crazy telling the arduino where infinity was on the lens and then where near field focus limit was, and then keeping track of how many steps were moved. it was also complicated in that a focus lens is not a linear scale to get to infinity.<p>all in all, it was a fun project to ultimately understand why CineTape[0] systems are so expensive.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cinemaelec.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;cinetape_measure" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cinemaelec.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;cinetape_measure</a>')
