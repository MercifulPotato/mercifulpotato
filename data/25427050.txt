For those who don’t want to read the article, the quote sums it up. They discovered new lymphatic vessels in the brain in 2016 where previously the brain wasn’t thought to have any.<p>2 years ago I had a stressful life event. I became schizophrenic because of it. I  accidentally discovered that ketosis cures the schizophrenia. It turns out a doctor at Harvard has been sounding the alarm about this and nobody is listening to him [1].<p>After researching these things somewhat deeply, it appears that almost all diseases that involve the death or inactivity of neurons (Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, autism, etc) are sometimes caused by “inflammatory signals,” as I call them, which interfere with the metabolism of glucose. Note the way I worded that — there’s more than one way for those neurons to become deactivated. What we currently think of as being a single disease might be many diseases, many different types of pathology that ultimately lead to the silencing of the same general population of neurons and thereby causing the same symptoms. The point is that the metabolic angle doesn’t explain all neural pathology, so keep that in mind when ketosis is found to only put 20% of schizophrenics into remission in the next five years.<p>There is currently exactly one study looking at the effect of ketosis on schizophrenia, in Finland, and it keeps getting delayed.<p>When a cells glucose metabolism is interfered with by inflammatory signals, ketone metabolism is not affected apparently. Plaques are a downstream effect of metabolic dysfunction, not the cause.<p>Doctor Mary Newport has been sounding the alarm for years after witnessing the remission of her husbands Alzheimer’s following administration of ketogenic foods and nobody is listening to her [2].<p>Doctor Robert Naviaux at UC San Diego is provoking astounding recoveries in children with autism with a drug that is thought to interfere with immunological signaling [3]. If you have chronic fatigue syndrome, pay close attention to this.<p>In a bizarre plot twist, people who eat nothing but beef are experiencing the most miraculous recoveries from autoimmune problems that I have seen so far in becoming preoccupied with this general area of research [4][5]. It appears that ketone bodies are somewhat anti-inflammatory [6] but their main benefit is providing fuel that can power cells that are being shut down by inflammatory signals, whereas the carnivore diet seems to deactivate inflammation that is currently underway for many people.<p>This is 100% a medical revolution that is still in the pipes. The work being done in this area of brain inflammation and inflammation in general will rock the medical establishment, cure thousands of diseases seemingly overnight and turn a burning light onto the cruel and sordid apathy that has infected western medicine in the last 80 years.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;06e-PwhmSq8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;06e-PwhmSq8</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;eQwRSuwRP9c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;eQwRSuwRP9c</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Ux68qHr4CnI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Ux68qHr4CnI</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;iWWF5nN7fUA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;iWWF5nN7fUA</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;N39o_DI5laI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;N39o_DI5laI</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;HLF29w6YqXs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;HLF29w6YqXs</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;A5_R13Luit0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;A5_R13Luit0</a>')
