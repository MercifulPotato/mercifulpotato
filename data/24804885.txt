Revoking Section 230 could expose those platforms to the possibility of liability for content posted on them. This might cause a re-shaping of the Internet in general.<p>&gt;Part of me seriously wonders - would that necessarily be a bad thing? I am not convinced, by any stretch of the imagination, that these social media opinion aggregation platforms are universally positive.<p>Here&#x27;s where you are wrong to think this. It doesn&#x27;t protect social media giants, Hacker News and news websites. It protects literally everyone on the internet in the USA.<p>Thanks to this law you can&#x27;t be held liable if you have a blog with a comment section. Anyone can post anything there and you could be at serious risk of legal trouble if someone posted something that breaks the law on your website. Any communal website would either a) move out of the US and b) probably require some very strict controls on who can post and what.<p>The law doesn&#x27;t protect American giants, it protects everyone that uses the internet to discuss.<p>I suggest you read this blog post on the issue, especially this part:<p>&quot;&quot;If you said &quot;Section 230 is a massive gift to big tech!&quot;<p>Once again, I must inform you that you are very, very wrong. There is nothing in Section 230 that applies solely to big tech. Indeed, it applies to every website on the internet and every user of those websites.&quot;&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20200531&#x2F;23325444617&#x2F;hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-section-230-communications-decency-act.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20200531&#x2F;23325444617&#x2F;hello...</a>')
