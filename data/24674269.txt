It doesn&#x27;t help that in most &#x27;news&#x27; organizations, the news is considered entertainment and isn&#x27;t terribly rigorous.<p>The 2xxx series wasn&#x27;t terribly impressive to many so they&#x27;ve just started to peak out in the way that Intel did at least 5 years ago.  We&#x27;re heading into AMD&#x27;s 4th iteration of processors that basically mop the floor with Intel from a price&#x2F;performance and performance&#x2F;watt standpoint and it&#x27;s <i>just</i> starting to become accepted in the mainstream that Intel is in trouble.  It will take another generation or two of products before the press catches on to the fact that what nVidia is telling everyone isn&#x27;t true.  Of course it will be helpful if there&#x27;s some competition to point to that helps make the case.')
