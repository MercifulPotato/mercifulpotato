Numerical libraries are extremely important to me.<p>I recently started using Julia for simulating&#x2F;fitting some differential equations and am thoroughly impressed with the speed, syntax and library documentation. Startup speed was initially painful but I am used to it now since I only pay it once.<p>The IDE situation is not fully stable yet but Juno is very good. I wish they package a standalone Julia IDE (I am aware of the new VS Code plugin) based on either  Atom or Code just to make it easier for those switching over from MATLAB and Python (Spyder) IDEs.<p>Don&#x27;t know how far they&#x27;ve progressed on static compilation yet, but if they get that even for a language subset it would truly be a game changer for general purpose programming.')
