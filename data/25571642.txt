Item(by='tgv', descendants=None, kids=[25574620], score=None, time=1609260216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25570167, text='&quot;Mild&quot; in contrast to &quot;severe&quot;. With a 30dB loss, you can still hear the louder noises, speech, etc. I have a 30dB loss in the mid range in one ear, just where it matters for speech. I can hear and understand people pretty well, but fail when they are whispering, or when they are speaking something else than my native language in a noisy environment. On the positive side: if I sleep on my good ear, a lot of the background noise disappears.')
