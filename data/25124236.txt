In my social bubble</i><p>If all you&#x27;re speaking from is personal anecdote from a tiny biased subsample of people, then <i>don&#x27;t</i> speak about &quot;the majority of the people&quot;. Because objectively, millions care given the chance. Measures like the GDPR were popular. Or in the US the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), which in fact just this past election got an attempted[1] enhancing provision passed by popular referendum (2020 Proposition 24) with 56% of the vote, or about ~9.1 million people.<p>Of course people care about convenience and security as well. So again it&#x27;s very important to make it clear that those don&#x27;t have to be zero-sum games with privacy, and for technical people to not merely blindly oppose flawed efforts to improve that but put up better solutions. I think we&#x27;ve repeatedly made big mistakes there over the past 20 years, failing to get out in front of efforts like Apple&#x27;s iOS and then ending up with no way to create standards with the good but not the bad. But that doesn&#x27;t mean, all else being equal, that people don&#x27;t care, or in major cases won&#x27;t make some sacrifices for it. One of the real nasty strategies of anti-privacy forces in fact has been trying to twist it into zero-sum, claiming that privacy can&#x27;t be convenient or secure.<p>----<p>1: Proposition 24 is itself also illustrative of how popular support doesn&#x27;t always translate into perfectly written legislation, I know the EFF had reservations about it saying it was a mix of steps forward and backward. But again, the <i>desire</i> is clearly there.')
