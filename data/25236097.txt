That mutation:<p>- Hasn&#x27;t been observed in humans since Sep 5th;<p>- gives a <i>slight</i> advantage over escaping neutralizing antibodies (10%, not 100%)<p>- has no &quot;fitness&quot; at this point because there is no selective pressure for it<p>- has no effect on T cell based immunity<p>The Danish move was out of precaution, not because of the mutation, but because minks can become <i>huge</i> animal reservoirs of the virus due to the ease it spreads among them.')
