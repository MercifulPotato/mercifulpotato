There are most regular people who just see it as a tool and want it to let them do what they want without having to put much thought into it. They will have various levels of skill but don&#x27;t care much past that.<p>Then there are the people who I think of as enthusiasts. Who have have different things they care about and cause all the arguments and pedantic nit picking. There are the fanboys who love tech created by a company and always like to have the newest thing from them. There are the people who really into making their desktop look pretty. Finally there is the group who likes to have total control of their workflow and hate having features taken away (group i belong to).<p>So looking at all of this it is no wonder most people are not interested in desktops and the group that is are only going to like it if its from their brand of choice.')
