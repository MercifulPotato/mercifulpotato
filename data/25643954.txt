I do like simple text-based music tools, and the fact that it has a live web player is excellent.<p>A couple of things I noted:<p>- I couldn&#x27;t work out how to run two chunks in sequence - I&#x27;m presuming the language doesn&#x27;t support it yet, since none of the examples do it either?<p>- It would be nice if the &quot;play&quot; keyword accepted the &quot;loop&quot; syntax too (or something similar)<p>- On the web editor, despite the song reaching the finish, you have to press stop before you can press play again. It&#x27;s a little thing, but I spent an embarrassingly long amount of time thinking it was just a firefox bug, copying my song to clipboard, refreshing the page and pasting it back in!<p>That said, have enjoyed playing with it. Any future plans?')
