Within a short time these weirdos started donning MAGA avatars while promoting the GOP&#x27;s pick for the election.<p>Some of these people ended up in incidents like the Charlottesville Unite the Right Nazi rally where this person committed a ramming attack against protestors. The guy&#x27;s social media was rife with right wing memes and worship of supposed strong men like Trump&#x2F;Assad&#x2F;Putin.<p>One of the persistent themes in the growth of this faction and it&#x27;s takeover of the Republican &quot;moderates&quot; is the lack of visibility into it. Adherents say things like the MAGA bomber who targeted victims named by Trump are fake news, while outsiders just see a crazy person and not someone who followed right wing media choosing his victims from their screeds. This includes David Hogg, someone who became targeted by the right due to activism against firearm violence due to being in the Parkland school shooting. A shooting perpetrated by someone who was also in the MAGA cult.<p>The Parkland shooting was deemed fake news by a sitting Republican, one who attempted to overthrow the vote of their constituents by backing Trump&#x27;s coup.<p>It is hard to emphasize how deeply this cult has penetrated society in the US. While I&#x27;ve been writing about it for years people have been just kinda ignoring it as it took over their friends and family. Avoiding the issue instead of embracing the subject to learn about it as to defend against it.<p>Things got to the point of a legislative and violent coup attempt by people who believe in a different reality than us because not enough people have been identifying and contesting it. Everyone wants to play Among Us while ignoring the terrorists who wanted to kill my state governor, or the fact their activities were partially funded by the DeVos family and others who are willing to put their money on the line to back their ideological war.')
