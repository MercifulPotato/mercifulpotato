If there are only like three ad networks for 99 percent of the internet, and they can track me easily, and they know how much I&#x27;m worth to them, can&#x27;t they just email me every month and say, &quot;if you want a no-Doubleclick ad experience next month, it will cost you $4.65, click here to pay.&quot; Not like they aren&#x27;t already doing the tracking, and this would increase the value to their ad customers since they wouldn&#x27;t pay for views from people who don&#x27;t want to see ads.')
