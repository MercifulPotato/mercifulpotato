Item(by='DrBazza', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604358785, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24974063, text='In London (where I commute), without &#x27;mezzanine levels&#x27; or their equivalent, there&#x27;s nowhere to queue and everyone would squeeze onto the platform which is a safety issue and then the police and&#x2F;or the railway staff would close the station. This happens frequently when we have problems with the track or trains.<p>London has terminus stations - the platform the train arrives on is where the train stops, and then starts on its return journey.  Trains to your destination are therefore limited by signalling and traffic, typically a 10-15 minute turn around time.  On <i>average</i>, in London during rush hour, you have a train to your home station every 20 minutes.<p>Perhaps in the US all major stations are through stations, but in the UK, especially London, we just don&#x27;t have that, and mezzanines are at the very minimum, a <i>safety requirement</i>, because the platform your train leaves from, has other passengers waiting for other trains before your one.<p>Platforms are not large, and trains are very, very busy, and frankly, if you&#x27;ve only ever caught a train in the US you are in for a huge surprise commuting in the UK.<p>If the US ever adopted trains like the rest of the world has, the best time for building mezzanines, and huge stations is &quot;yesterday&quot;.')
