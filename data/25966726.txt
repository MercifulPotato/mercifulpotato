The contract on the stock market says that it is supposed to settle.  But a non-negligible percentage of the time, participants in the stock market do not make good on their contracts.  Maybe they are a day late.  Or the trade is reversed and the money or stock for your side comes back to you.  You will get whatever happens while executing the trade, but it might not be what you expected to get.<p>In a cash account, the broker takes your money&#x2F;stock and you live with the inconvenience.  In a margin account, the broker is effectively lending you money to cover unsettled trades and is taking on that inconvenience instead.  Given the high volume of trades going through a brokerage relative to the wealth of the brokerage, that inconvenience can become a real operational risk.<p>How real?  Well, Robinhood just had to get an emergency loan for a billion dollars to cover trades that are open and have not settled.  Why?  Your ability to execute the trades that you made depends on various counterparties all doing what they said that they would, when they said that they would do it.  But if they don&#x27;t, and you prove unable, Robinhood is still legally obligated to make sure that they are able to settle all of their contracts on the stock market which they took on on your behalf.')
