You&#x27;ll often notice the eyes, tongue, etc are missing.  Sometimes the corpse will look like a skeleton with skin but no organs.<p>These are circumstances commonly attributed to aliens or cuppracabra attacking cattle.  However it&#x27;s very common in roadkill when you start to look for it.  It&#x27;s pretty mundane, though I understand some people will find it startling the first time they see or hear of it.')
