Then I looked at the article, and realize that it opens with a link to Joel&#x27;s article and then lists a bunch of strained examples (editors vs IDEs).<p>I would recommend that everyone read Joel&#x27;s article[1] first. Note that increase in demand means &quot;the value to the consumers of each and every unit of your good increases&quot; or &quot;at each price more units will be sold&quot; ... That is, demand curve shifts to the northeast. Which is different from an increase in quantity demanded in response to changes in the quantity demanded.<p>Note also that while we tend to think in terms of individual companies&#x27; products, the demand for the output of the entire industry tends to increase when the complements become cheaper.<p>A great example of this is indeed Windows. Glossing over the details (such as Epson&#x27;s ESC&#x2F;P etc), prior to Windows, you knew that if you wanted to produce hardcopies with bar charts etc, you knew you had to have printer that worked with Harvard Graphics[2]. Post-Windows, you could make a printer and a driver for Windows and all software could use it. Which led to increase demand for both printers and software that uses printers. Harvard Graphics&#x27; real advantage was in being able to produce output on paper or physical slides. Once again, having Windows meant projectors could be used without worry that you needed to use a special version of the software with special support for the particular projector you had. That helped grow the projector industry and cut the hassle of having to have hard copies of the presentation (which you could not correct if you noticed a problem at the last moment).<p>So, when I read the linked post, I thought it is best to be avoided in favor of reading Joel&#x27;s post again. Joel&#x27;s post is not without flaws either:<p>&gt; If you can run your software anywhere, that makes hardware more of a commodity. As hardware prices go down, the market expands, driving more demand for software (and leaving customers with extra money to spend on software which can now be more expensive.)<p>As an economist, I would have noted that it is not just that consumers have more money and an individual firm can extract more of it ... it is that as a result of a complementary good becoming cheaper, they value the thing you are selling more and therefore they are willing and able to spend more on the thing you (or other firms in your industry are selling).<p>Next, we should think about monopoly power and availability of close substitutes. :-)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2002&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;strategy-letter-v&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2002&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;strategy-letter-v&#x2F;</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Harvard_Graphics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Harvard_Graphics</a><p>[^] For background, I am a Ph.D. economist, and taught micro at various levels, and I develop software for a living')
