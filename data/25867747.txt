As a key executive of a company, I am expected to call any CEO and say - you know what CEO Joe, that contract we signed 2 weeks ago, we goofed. Can we please re-cut ? And because Joe is interested in a mutually beneficial relationship that lasts a long time, that&#x27;s what usually happens.<p>Enter the FAANGS.<p>Clearly, it was Elastic&#x27;s mistake to operate on a open license that lends to FAANGS literally imploding Elastic market share. Elastic mistake, OK . However, it is not ethical for a FAANG to profit off errors, just as it is not ethical for a Bank to charge overdraft fees over overdraft fees from a grandma. They can, but they really shouldn&#x27;t. What is legal is not ethical.<p>In the middle east it is legal to stone a female adulterer to death. That&#x27;s not OK.<p>2) Tort. It will be argued in court that AWS misappropriated the Elastic TM. That&#x27;s where AWS is going to pay.  AWS clearly stepped over the line.<p>It is just a question of how costly that mistake was.')
