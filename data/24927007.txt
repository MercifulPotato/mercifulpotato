Most recently, some colleagues were very excited about Roam Research [0], so I took another look, and I was very pleasantly surprised to see that, among many great tools, the good old TittlyWiki [1] had evolved with the times, and now you have &quot;distributions&quot; tailored to apply the Zettelkasten methodologies.<p>I settled on Drift [2], and over a weekend, I moved hundreds of notes I had spread in several formats over to a small set of Drift files. I even moved my entire personal web site (mostly audio and foodie geeky stuff) into it, with close to 80 tiddlers by now [3].<p>Porting was phase 1. The fun part where the methodology becomes really powerful, is breaking down the monoliths, just like you would do with app modernization into microservices. Taking longer blog posts and decomposing them into discrete, reusable components that can hold meaning under different contexts. The more I looked at them, the more I could find I could break them down into more discrete ideas. And I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not done.<p>Several weeks into it, I&#x27;ve become more organized than I had been in years, and I realize it helps me structure my thinking, and how to connect ideas.<p>Regardless of what tool you choose (and there are plenty) it&#x27;s a great moment to look at what this methodology can do for you.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roamresearch.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roamresearch.com&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlywiki.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlywiki.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akhater.github.io&#x2F;drift&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akhater.github.io&#x2F;drift&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ramirosalas.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ramirosalas.com</a>')
