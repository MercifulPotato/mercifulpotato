You know there are bad apples in every race, right? How do we handle such scenarios? Seems unfair to me, myself being a person of color - I don&#x27;t want the world to treat me like some kind of a hero for being non-white &#x2F; minority. I want fairness and it is frankly offensive.<p>I am not pleased with the way we&#x27;re treating each other. It&#x27;s supposed to be equal opportunity.<p>I also want us to have scientific discussion about gender differences (backed by research) and other difficult conversations. Nature doesn&#x27;t give a fuck about any of this - if our goal is to uncover the way mother nature works, we&#x27;re going to have to meet difficult truths and not be afraid of it.')
