Have they had the same experience as average men, or have they fought through and survived discriminatory barriers?<p>Even if we suppose the answer is somewhere in-between,  it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising that women are highly sought-after. Because with these assumptions, the women in the industry are generally likely to be better on average.<p>Maybe we don&#x27;t observe discrimination against women in this specific context* (post-application and pre-salary negotiation), but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t occurring elsewhere.<p>*The summary data includes non-technical hires at tech companies')
