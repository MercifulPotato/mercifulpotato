Without a popular, legitimate, high traffic platform that allows them to influence a mass audience the cancer doesn&#x27;t metastasize.<p>I can&#x27;t banter my own mother into giving up whatever conspiracy theory crosses her path. There are so many people with equally poor fact-checking and critical thinking skills that they form their own festering bubbles on popular platforms. The bigger the bubbles, the more extreme they get, and now the end result is a confederacy of deluded, violent extremists sacking the capitol. We&#x27;re lucky it wasn&#x27;t worse, but this might be a dress rehearsal for far more violence if we don&#x27;t get a better grip.')
