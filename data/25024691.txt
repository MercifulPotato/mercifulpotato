As soon as you are talking batch processing, having this massively powerful, free, self-contained executable that is compatible with pretty much any video format on earth is a god bless.<p>I usually only use a handful of features repeatedly, so I tend to creat some UI for myself to generate the commands. For instance for editing movies I download, removing audio streams I donâ€™t want, adding subtitles, changing defaults, overwriting metadata (title, etc).<p>But dealing with all features would be a challenge. Handbrake is one attempt I can think of, but it is still kind of specialised.')
