I was looking for a font to use for a logo for a personal project. The site I was using (won’t name and shame, and I can’t recall the site now anyway) had no sorting options, items were ordered by whatever “popularity” formula they use. As I paginated, many of the fonts I’d previously viewed would appear on subsequent pages, often in a different order. It was frustrating not just because I could tell that I was probably missing fonts that were being bumped up to previous pages, but also because it made me doubt my mental model of my own browsing history: “Did I navigate back too far? Did I forget a tangential click and end up on a different search path?”<p>It’s not a great UX. And in some ways I suspect that <i>my own views</i> were at least partially causing it, which made me more hesitant to even click on anything unless I was sure it was worth the disruption.')
