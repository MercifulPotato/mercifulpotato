The most lucrative services, fittings, are not something every shop does or is equipped for. Maintenance is relatively cheap and 2020 waiting lists were sometimes months long given the spike in riders forcing many to DIY. Many will let you order parts through the shop but prices are almost always more expensive than going to the vendor site.')
