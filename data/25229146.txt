Hydrogen sucks as a storage system and the only reason we pursue it so much is that it has been the intellectual darling since &#x27;the hydrogen economy&#x27; came out.<p>Liquid Air, Liquid Metal, Redux Flow Batteries, LFP, traditional Li-Ion, Compressed air are all better technologies to invest in.')
