We&#x27;d love for you to be a part of our moonshot.<p>Our master plan is simple: Develop low cost broadband distribution technology. Prove it works by connecting one million people in one city. Once it works, deploy worldwide.<p>Step 1 done - We have built a low cost network stack and have lowered the cost of deploying a citywide broadband network from $50m to $5m. We use lasers and commodity components thereby avoiding the core expense at the heart of current ISPs - expensive underground fibre and its associated manpower, heavy capex and regulatory pains.<p>Ready for scale - We&#x27;ve run a beta network with thousands of live customers over the last 9 months and we know the tech works. We&#x27;re now ready to scale across our hometown of Bengaluru with its population of 11m people and less than 10% broadband penetration.<p>A killer proposition - We have a killer offering for the customer - 1gbps speed with no data caps at $10&#x2F;month and a free Wifi Dabba router. This is 10x better and cheaper than anything else on the market. This playbook has been executed successfully in the mobile 4G market in India by Jio, we&#x27;re applying the same playbook in broadband<p>Go where no ISP has gone before - We&#x27;re taking an AWS-like platform approach to our tech stack, our goal is to deliver deep APIs, network integration points, edge-caching and much more. We believe this approach will result in a whole new class of applications and services for users. We want to be the ISP that developers will love.<p>The ask - This is where you come in HN, buy a piece of our network and help shape the future of the internet. We&#x27;re offering minimum guaranteed revenue, naming rights to your region and a host of other benefits. There are only 66 of 100 regions available. Each region is $20,000.')
