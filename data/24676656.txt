For example, ReasonML [0] and OCaml are two bijectively text based syntaxes.  That idea could be extended to a NestedText like syntax being bijectively equivalent to a text based syntax.  Editors like Visual Studio Code infer that sort of information continually on the fly, but it sort of gets lost in the toolchain.  Compilers could operate at a higher-level of abstraction than lexing&#x2F;scanning.  Git merge might also work better if could operate at a NestedText like level of abstraction.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reason_(syntax_extension_for_OCaml)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reason_(syntax_extension_for_O...</a>')
