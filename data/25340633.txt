No disposable cups, no straws, no lids. They have mugs to use if you’re outside drinking coffee, but they encourage you to bring or buy a reusable thermos.<p>Which requires a very slight bit of adaptation, because you have to remember to bring your own mug, but you get used to it. <i>(Helps that they ran a “buy a thermos, get 4 free coffes” deal.)</i> I could easily get used to it at other take-out places.')
