Also the whole era of passenger rail may have been killed off by lockdowns.<p>Train services are basically always hugely subsidised by governments. They could not survive against cars, buses and trucks if they weren&#x27;t. The subsidies in Switzerland are eye-wateringly high for example. It&#x27;s effectively a form of government planning designed to boost city&#x2F;worker density as governments and others believe offices full of workers yields large benefits, and trains are the highest density&#x2F;capacity form of passenger transport by far. So if you want ultra-dense urban cores you need a lot of trains.<p>But do we actually need those? Governments sure haven&#x27;t acted like it this year. Now big corps are eyeing their expensive city centre HQs and wondering if the real estate is worth it, the workers are seeing how much they save when they aren&#x27;t being forced to pay for the very expensive rail tickets, the managers are seeing that many (but not all) workers are happier without the time sucking, cattle-car commutes ... and governments are basically having to give up on the fiction that rail companies were private in order to keep them from going completely bust. But how long can that be sustained, if travel patterns have been permanently altered? No dense urban cores = few commuters paying business rates for rush hour travel = even worse economics for trains.')
