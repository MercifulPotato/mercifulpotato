You do not have to be &quot;sedated&quot; for colonoscopy. I have had two and requested no sedation for the last one. It is mildly uncomfortable, but not painful.<p>The &quot;sedation&quot; is not really anesthesia, but rather a drug that messes with your short term memory (and makes you goofy). If you don&#x27;t like the idea of somebody messing with your brain circuitry, ask not to be sedated.<p>Do get the anesthetic though.<p>As a cancer survivor, paranoia saves lives.
