Only way is test on an actual application and check what fits best.<p>I think I can agree to that.<p>I should note that I designed this allocator to be used on the GPU. &quot;Size&quot; is shared between a wavefront &#x2F; SIMD unit. popcnt(exec_mask) determines how many items to alloc at a time. (if 200 threads call alloc, then they will collectively grab 200 pointers all at once, by doing size -= popcount(exec_mask)).')
