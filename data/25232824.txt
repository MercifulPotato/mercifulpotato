Thorne wormholes.<p>&gt; On yet another note, I read an unsettling sci-fi&#x2F;theory about how the expansion of space is perhaps being caused by whatever tech allows interstellar travel in lightspeed-like time. So whatever intelligent species that evolved first may have a monopoly on such tech, while inadvertently altering the fabric of physics to make interstellar travel gradually impossible for any younger species.<p>Do you have a link to read more about that? Reminds me of the FTL technology in the books &quot;The Dark Forest&quot; and &quot;Death&#x27;s End&quot; by Liu Cixin.')
