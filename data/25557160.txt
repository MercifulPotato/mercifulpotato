First by failing to investigate and accurately represent the subject, then by positing it to be useless under supposed and inaccurate hyperbolic conditions.<p>Unfortunately for you in this case your claim is not supported by the facts.<p>But i can say i felt it was pretty funny.<p>I mean ..Wow. I wasn&#x27;t attacking you, I was attacking the comment. And you could have acknowledged the mistake of the original lazy and skeptical comment, or owned your own inaccurate description, but instead you choose to doubled down and tried, and failed, to attack me. And others. Well played.<p>The &quot;I can&#x27;t stand being wrong. Ever&quot; look is not great for credibility. Just FYI.<p>And you do so, while pretending you are good and see something bad, while I attack comments and not people.<p><i>You could have contributed constructively, but you chose instead to bring down the tone. It is your comment that is not appropriate to a &quot;serious forum.&quot;</i><p>Unfortunately for you, this is not the case. I contributed constructively. Your choice was to project your own intense unresolved issues of feeling criticised onto this unrelated discussion, and are blind to my excellence of my contributions because of that.<p>So, it&#x27;s funny that, it&#x27;s you, not i, who brings down the tone. Your trying to attack people without justification, and make this thread some twisted outlet for your unresolved mess, are your contributions.<p>It is clearly your comments, not mine, that are grossly inappropriate, both for this serious forum, and for any good interaction between people. For 2021, please reform yourself instead of pretending others are bad and trying to attack them as an excuse to avoid facing your own issues. That will be the best thing for your path and your karma i think. Try to make 2021 the best, not the worst, year of your life.')
