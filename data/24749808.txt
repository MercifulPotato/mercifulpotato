There&#x27;s obviously no way to directly measure it, since it is simply a perception of something that does not actually exist.  I only &quot;hear&quot; it because I have either neurological damage or inner ear damage.  But I know musical notes, and it&#x27;s a D2.  A C#2 is too low, and a D#2 is way too high.  It might be more like a 72Hz instead of 73Hz (D2), but it&#x27;s close.  It&#x27;s a &quot;guess&quot; in the same way that any singer might sing any other particular note.  I can hum it, in tune with itself, although the sound of my own voice destroys the perception.  I can use that tone generator I linked above, starting it and stopping it, and compare until I hit the right note.  Just like tuning a guitar by ear.  I do have to have absolute quiet to hear it, but I can reliably hear it 100% of the time when in absolute quiet.')
