It only got traction because of the Google name behind it (it&#x27;s predecessors designed at other companies were barely recognized).<p>It&#x27;s ok for writing small tools or simplistic web servers. For complex non-trivial applications, it is very poor at modeling, which introduces a lot of friction when dealing with larger code bases. Performance is adequate and nothing to brag about (it sacrifices throughput for latency) and compiling speed took a hit when they rewrote the compiler from C to golang. Linking times are quite abysmal for larger projects.<p>Depending on what you want to do, there are superior alternatives. Java and C# are both better in almost every aspect (and keep closing the gap when it comes to low latency and small footprint), and Rust is also a potential viable option if you are running in a memory constrained environment.')
