The entire change of rules here is because companies were <i>not</i> paying market rate. Requiring them to not pay market rate defeats the purpose here entirely.<p>If you mean require that companies pay _at least_ the 75th percentile, then yes, I believe that is what the action that this entire thread is about is going.<p>I would also disagree that H1B destroys the feedback loop of jobs being needed. I don&#x27;t believe the number of H1Bs issued is any where near large enough to disrupt an entire industry.')
