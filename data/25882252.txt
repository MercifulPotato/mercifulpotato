Item(by='itamarst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611410378, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25879238, text='I do some consulting where I&#x27;m paid to fix specific bugs &#x2F; add specific features to various open source projects, often in Python data science world. Usually it goes something like:<p>1. Figure out what the project&#x27;s contribution guidelines are.<p>2. Check out code, figure out how to build it and run tests.<p>3. If it&#x27;s a complex task, might want to build some credibility with maintainers first, so might contribute tiny fix first.<p>4. If it&#x27;s a complex task, try to engage maintainers to see if they&#x27;ll accept it, and to get hints on how to approach it. They may be hard to reach, so this might take a few days or a couple of weeks, though I&#x27;m not working during that time, it&#x27;s just delay.<p>5. Do the actual work.<p>6. Go through whatever code review process. Sometimes I might need to gently ask for reviews if it sits for too long.<p>$80 total for all the above is laughable. And to be fair I ask for a good amount of money because I am good at what I do, and there are people who live in much cheaper places than Boston area and could charge less.<p>For $80, you&#x27;d have to both have an extremely low cost of living and already be an expert on the project for this to be in any way worthwhile.')
