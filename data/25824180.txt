In the data linked above, we&#x27;re told that the &#x27;inpatient and outpatient care&#x27; is significantly higher than in &#x27;comparable countries.&#x27;<p>I believe it.  But isn&#x27;t &#x27;inpatient and outpatient care&#x27; just about .. everything that goes into a health care system aside from the paper pushing and insurance pieces?  And are hospitals really breaking that stuff out ?<p>Someone in favor of the U.S. system would say, ah hah, that&#x27;s because we in the U.S. have access to better care, and more sophisticated technology, than in France or Germany, and also we don&#x27;t have long waiting lists.  I don&#x27;t know the technology claim, but I&#x27;ve seen the wait list claim and I do think it&#x27;s true when comparing the U.S. with Canada or the UK (the latter two have long waits for essential surgeries compared to the U.S.)<p>How would one counter this claim?')
