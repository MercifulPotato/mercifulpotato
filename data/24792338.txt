That was a problem for us because 1) we&#x27;ve never had a Mumbai office, and 2) we&#x27;d told potential customers that their data would never leave the United States and that all engineering was local. The last thing I wanted to deal with at that moment was having to explain to those same customers that it was all a big mistake and that we weren&#x27;t lying to them.<p>It took a rather undignified on my part Twitter rant to finally get someone from Glassdoor to look at the review and remove it -- not because it was bad, which it wasn&#x27;t, but because it was factually impossible in a way that could cause real issues for us. Since then I&#x27;ve taken all of their reviews with a grain of salt.')
