And yes, money is not the only factor in whether an employer is a good one. But for many it is the biggest factor.<p>This system is another push towards the ignorant idea that all people are the same. We&#x27;re not all the same. Some people invest more in their careers. Those people will bring greater value to their employers, and they should be compensated in line with their abilities.<p>Good luck, though. Let us know in five years if all the virtue signaling actually pays off.')
