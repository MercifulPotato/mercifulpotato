I like some of the concepts, but it&#x27;s insufficient to actually use for our apps. Instead my team built a component system on top of UIKit that gives us the benefits of easier to build UI, without the &quot;holy&quot; and incomplete design of SwiftUI. Having Swift has allowed this work to be easy to construct and extremely type safe, and gives us the benefits of being able to do more work with fewer people, which was sort of the goal of SwiftUI, but in a more compatible way.')
