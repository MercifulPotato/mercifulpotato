Why do you think you&#x27;ve been singled out and nobody wants to work with you?  Simply because you don&#x27;t excel at whiteboard coding or leetcode questions?<p>I&#x27;m honestly curious.  I have never had to really do either of those things in order to get great jobs that pay quite well.  Granted, I don&#x27;t work for a FAANG, haven&#x27;t even interviewed for one, but I don&#x27;t feel any less successful even so.<p>I&#x27;m tempted to think you come off as difficult to get along with, but this is entirely based on your writing style here and may be entirely unwarranted :).  I&#x27;ve always found that being agreeable helps an awful lot.')
