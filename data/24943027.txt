Instead, they’re saying what many others in the tech industry are thinking and doing: “misinformation” is simply what we decide it is, because we can.<p>Mailchimp is outright acknowledging that epistemically-sound, conclusive Truth is not a deciding factor, whereas Twitter, Facebook, etc (and much media reporting) hint&#x2F;imply that conclusive Truth is a deciding factor.<p>Secondly, if one is deplatformed from Mailchimp, one can move to another provider with little loss, particularly as it comes to the most important aspect: <i>attention</i>.  The commonly repeated meme that deplatforming or filtering are not(!) <i>in any way</i> free speech issues &quot;because you can &quot;just&quot; move to a new platform (or build your own)&quot; completely overlooks this aspect of the debate.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;free-speech-issue-tech-turmoil-new-censorship&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;free-speech-issue-tech-turmoil-n...</a><p>&gt;&gt; Here&#x27;s how this golden age of speech actually works: In the 21st century, the capacity to spread ideas and reach an audience is no longer limited by access to expensive, centralized broadcasting infrastructure. It’s limited instead by one’s ability to garner and distribute <i>attention</i>. And right now, the flow of the world’s attention is structured, to a vast and overwhelming degree, by just a few digital platforms: Facebook, Google (which owns YouTube), and, to a lesser extent, Twitter.<p>&gt;&gt; These tactics usually don’t break any laws or set off any First Amendment alarm bells. But they all serve the same purpose that the old forms of censorship did: They are the best available tools <i>to stop ideas from spreading and gaining purchase</i>.<p>&gt;&gt; Even when the big platforms themselves suspend or boot someone off their networks for violating “community standards”—an act that does look to many people like old-fashioned censorship—it’s not technically an infringement on free speech [1], even if it is a display of immense platform power. Anyone in the world can still read what the far-right troll Tim “Baked Alaska” Gionet has to say on the internet. What Twitter has denied him, by kicking him off, is attention.<p>[1] Here the author actually falls victim to conflating free speech (the general principle) with The First Amendment, but makes up for it well enough.<p>Another good article (with a John Stuart Mill basis):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felipec.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-fatal-freedom-of-speech-fallacy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;felipec.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-fatal-freedom-of-speech-f...</a><p>&gt;&gt; In 2020 the concept of cancel culture is rampant. The common argument is that the right to freedom speech doesn’t imply that people must listen to you, or that you cannot get canceled, or that you should be free from the consequences of your speech.<p>&gt;&gt; This is correct.  But did you spot the fallacy? The [right] to freedom of speech is not the same as the freedom of speech [argument]. That is an equivocation fallacy.<p>EDIT: It seems these ideas are unpopular - I would appreciate hearing any opposing ideas so that I can improve my stance.')
