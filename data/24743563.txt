The pushback from the hip hop community was equal parts the lies and the really bad music. He tried to compare Ice to 3rd Base who were respected MCs at the time. Yeah MC Serch is known as a bit of a goofball now but back then he was respected rapper.<p>Vanilla Ice was making songs like Ninja Rap at the same time classics like Low End Theory, Death Certificate, De La Soul is Dead, Cypress Hill and 2Pacalype Now were coming out. Again, of course he was going to get push back. MC Hammer had the same pushback but not as bad as Vanilla Ice.')
