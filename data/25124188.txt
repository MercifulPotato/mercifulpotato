I&#x27;m staying local, using Soverin as my primary e-mail provider.<p>The reason for using a token for authorization is that the user can revoke the token (e.g. when device is lost), instead of having to change their password. These are indeed not TOTP because they are not time-based, nor do they depend on another factor (ie. password); they <i>replace</i> that factor. It is indeed dishonest to call such MFA&#x2F;2FA.<p>Its perfectly possible to get IMAP to work with TOTP though. For example, you can use PAM to authenticate, and PAM can use TOTP or FIDO2 (ignoring the issues with PAM every major OS barring OpenBSD uses it). We use something similar for OpenVPN because of requirement of ISO 27k1.<p>I don&#x27;t trust webmail at all because I don&#x27;t audit the JavaScript. Nor can I verify that every visit. Same issue with OpenPGP.js. Then again, I also don&#x27;t trust e-mail authenticity because the protocol is broken by design, and nobody has come up with a suitable alternative. Which is why I wouldn&#x27;t pay much for it; as I would not and do not use it much, since its fundamentally broken. For example, at rest and at transit there is not enough data integrity&#x2F;authenticity.<p>A lot of people are using a weak password as first factor, btw. Do you protect against such?')
