The losing side is so devastated by the loss, that it still can&#x27;t accept that it&#x27;s their own compatriots who didn&#x27;t elect their rather questionable candidate, so they are desperately grasping any other explanation, why she lost.<p>Americans did the voting, not Putin. If $200k of ads did the job, well, Dems should have spent $201k to counter that.<p>Also, are you suggesting that any foreign power can cheaply puppeteer the feeble-minded US population? Of so, maybe you need some form of authoritarian rulership to protect the people. Or else, I&#x27;m sure, even Iran and North Korea will find a few million bucks to install their own presidents.')
