So maybe not coup, but terrorist attack or insurrection or whatever word portrays the gravitas but aligns better with the meaning of the action.<p>On a second note, I think we do this a lot in law as wellâ€”if I get into a tussle with someone and push them softly and they trip and hit their head and die, I will probably go to prison for much longer than if I repeatedly and angrily punch someone in the face and they don&#x27;t die. I guess I&#x27;m just curious about how that works in our psyche.')
