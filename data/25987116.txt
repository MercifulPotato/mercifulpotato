And so what?  It will always be the case that a lower variance approach will be better in the cases where the higher variance approach did poorly and worse otherwise.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s better to choose a less volatile asset allocation<p>These are not mutually exclusive. One can lump sum all into the lowest risk allocation and then risk on over time.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that right now there is not much freedom in asset allocation at all. Your choices are pretty limited to higher risk things and things with a negative real yield.')
