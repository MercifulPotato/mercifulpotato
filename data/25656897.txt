Basically, he said that if you treat a mathematical statement as a sequence of tokens, and then assign a number to each token, then you can transform the statement into a big number. Then, going one step further, if a mathematical proof is a sequence of statements then it can be too transformed into a really long number. Then you can come up with rules to manipulate these numbers to create new valid statements and proofs.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there was much work done on this idea beyond Gödel&#x27;s proof, but I think it&#x27;s a really neat idea that gives a way to manipulate mathematical proofs as objects and create new ones from a very high level view.')
