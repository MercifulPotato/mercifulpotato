The IT meeting is <i>supposed</i> to be about discussing what we&#x27;ve done and what we&#x27;ll do, sorta scrum-style, but management knows and allows it to run as long as we like while we socialize.  This was even the case <i>before</i> we went fully remote for Covid.  I believe the CSRs do the same, but I haven&#x27;t been to their meetings.<p>They tried a scheduled after-hours happy our with the whole company, but people showed up for a few weeks and then it died off.<p>We have Discord and have a few channels including #general and #random.  We haven&#x27;t found the need to get more specific since there&#x27;s only a few of us.  It might be nice to have those specific ones shared with the entire company instead of just the team, though.  I think I&#x27;ll suggest that.<p>The photography one in particular caught my attention because a few people on the team wanted to do a flat-lay photo contest with a prize, but CS just wasn&#x27;t into it.  We&#x27;re still considering doing it unofficially.<p>Thanks for the info!')
