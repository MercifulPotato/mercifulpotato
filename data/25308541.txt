Since it can be transmitted via blood transfusions, it&#x27;d essentially shut down blood donations (although if everyone had it, I guess that wouldn&#x27;t matter). Also just the fact that prion diseases can cause psychological symptoms make the implications different from something like a classical infectious disease.')
