It’s more comparable to how marketing manages its process of ad creation, connections in the industry, etc. Indeed human expertise is useful for having a starting point and determining what directions one should go in to fix things. But without data, how are you supposed to tell that your changes have actually had an intended effect? Gathering data around marketing would be more comparable to having monitoring on your software systems. Much like not having any way to know if the code changes you just made have actually fixed a performance issue you were seeing in the system, not having any data to judge whether a change you made to your marketing had the intended effect makes making such changes pointless.<p>Experts are wrong all the time regardless. The best of them tend to like being able to check their work against reality.')
