Item(by='seabird', descendants=None, kids=[25910470], score=None, time=1611616906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25909432, text='I haven&#x27;t redefined anything; your definition of &quot;long means that they&#x27;re holding shares or call options&quot; is completely in agreement with my statement that &quot;long just means not short.&quot; The parent seems to be conflating having a long position and believing in the long-term performance of the company. They&#x27;re asking about long-term changes in GameStop&#x27;s business when the person he&#x27;s asking about this could very well be planning on being long in GME for the duration of this squeeze (or the most extreme parts of it) and bailing in the next 1-4 weeks after it has played out.')
