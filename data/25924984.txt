The only way you&#x27;re going to get equal numbers in each bin is if your process is intentionally constrained to do that.<p>There are several CS shuffle&#x2F;Fisher-Yates algorithms that can do this. Instead of calling the usual rand() on a mathematical interval multiple times, they do selection over the remaining elements (ie. constrained.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;babak&#x2F;an-algorithm-for-picking-random-numbers-in-a-range-without-repetition-4cp6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;babak&#x2F;an-algorithm-for-picking-random-numbers...</a><p>But I would expect CS people to have awareness about that, not social scientists, unless somebody wrote a paper with examples for that field.<p>I&#x27;ve seen Fisher-Yates used in an SRE interview before, which is pedantic - it&#x27;s just whiteboard hazing, at a very high cost to your recruiting and interviewing staff.')
