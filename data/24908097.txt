When you contribute, you avoid paying taxes at your <i>marginal</i> rate and when you withdraw (for most people at least, who will fund their retirement primarily through 401k withdraw) you pay taxes at your <i>overall</i> rate. The article also treats tax uncertainty as if it only applies to income taxes while it&#x27;s completely plausible that taxes on capital gains could be increased in the future as well.')
