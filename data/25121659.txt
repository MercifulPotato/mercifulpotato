It explicitly models all of the concepts and operations that are relevant in that domain - branching, merging, my local changes, the server that my local branch is kept in sync with, rewriting local history, rewriting public history. Can you shoot yourself in the foot? Absolutely, because this stuff really is non-trivial. Could it be made easier? Yes, by limiting what operations you&#x27;re even allowed to make, and streamlining those (c.f. git flow).')
