I stayed that extra year due to loyalty to my colleagues ...<p>&gt;companies do what&#x27;s best for their business, and you should not feel bad for doing the same.<p>These two quotes struck me hard.  After I left school, I was appreciated at work, I felt great about myself, and I was learned a lot in the first 3 months. I stayed 3 months more to give back, 6 more months because they could not find someone to replace me, and then a year longer because I got promoted (more learning now?).  I stayed another 4 years in the industry with much higher pay than all of my classmates ... but now I was not learning anything, just working, just filling someone else&#x27;s ineptitude.<p>The work was not worth it! My education was.  And not realizing that cost me dearly.<p>Never think the work you are doing is worth more than your own education.  And never think the pay you are getting makes it a better job than a chance to learn a whole lot more.')
