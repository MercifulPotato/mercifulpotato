In addition to it just being straight up information overload at any given step, the feedback it does print out is often misleading or the opposite of helpful in some other way.  More from my notes on that day:<p>&gt; My use case is to deploy a static site.  I have a directory containing the pages.  I&#x27;ve installed the Netlify CLI (itself a stupidly fiddly process).  [And I&#x27;ve read the docs by now.]  I should be able to init and deploy, trivially, right?<p>Wrong.  Without even trying I ran into some crash bugs in the CLI, for what seems to be a bog-standard use case.  On a hunch, I decided to check what would happen if I moved the .git subdirectory somewhere else and re-ran.  And whaddaya know, I found that it worked reliably when there was no .git subdirectory anywhere to be found, and it reliably failed when it was present.  So even though the contents of .git&#x2F; are completely irrelevant for the use case, the CLI is evidently both (a) trying to do something with it, and (b) making some bold assumptions about what&#x27;s in there and failing hard.  My money is on &quot;Nobody at Netlify is even testing this.&quot;<p>(FWIW, no I didn&#x27;t report this.  The overall &quot;feel&quot; of their stuff leads me to believe it would be a painful experience with no upside.  Several years ago, I interacted with some Netlify folks early after their launch to give some feedback that was more of the sort &quot;I&#x27;m reaching out to inform you of a problem for your own benefit and help you resolve it&quot; than it was anything like &quot;I&#x27;m here to get you to help me with my problem&quot;.  The overall tone of the responses were pretty obnoxious under those circumstances, so I noped out and never gave them any serious consideration until this year, where I discovered the situation above.  I have to say it pretty much validated my early opinion.)')
