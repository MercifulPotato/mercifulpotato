Popular perception after seeing a video like this is to project capabilities into the robot that just aren&#x27;t there. Talk to the lay public, people!<p>People assume this is actual AI, that it could just walk into an unknown new kitchen and do useful tasks like get dirty dishes in the dishwasher or other general stuff.<p>The other thing is a conflation of this kind of robotics with deep learning. Most of the work by Boston Dynamics uses no fancy machine learning. It is &quot;just&quot; (for experts it&#x27;s not a &quot;just&quot;, but a &quot;just&quot; for the public) electrical and mechanical and control engineering plus lots of specifically programmed behavior.<p>Now, it is impressive sure, but the humanoid form makes laypeople think there is more to it than there is.')
