Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25663506], score=None, time=1609971186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25663254, text='&gt; That’s not how courts are supposed to work.<p>That’s exactly how courts are supposed to work.<p>&gt; If they worked as you say, there would be no reason to have hearings for the majority of rape&#x2F;abuse accusations.<p>No, accusations that someone has committed rape (whether by prosecutors or in civil litigation by the alleged victim seeking damages) are legally cognizable claims.<p>&gt; The courts are there to have a formal process which would determine whether provided evidence and witnesses have weight and elements of truth, and whether additional investigations are required.<p>No, they only exist to do that in the case of concrete disputes where there is a cognizable legal claim that the proferred evidence is relevant to resolve.<p>&gt; it would also be required to establish whether anyone who signed the affidavits had to be prosecuted for perjury.<p>It would only be required for that if a prosecutor was charging them for perjury. The mere signing of an affidavit doesn’t create a perjury dispute that a court needs to resolve if there are no perjury charges offered.<p>&gt; None of that took place, there were no hearings, and the filings were dismissed without the required due process.<p>There were plenty of hearings, the Trump team <i>deliberately, voluntarily</i> either withdrew fraud claims or did not include them, making any alleged evidence of fraud irrelevant to those legal cases.<p>Presumably, if they had evidence of fraud that they thought would hold up in court they wouldn’t have done that. And, given the success of the claims that they <i>did</i> make, it isn’t like the Trump team was afraid of advancing even marginal claims.')
