Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609869508, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644653, text='&gt; My claims are common sense and supported by the real life: regular people don&#x27;t know what ECC is, and those who do find the problem&#x27;s impact is too minor to get palpable benefits from fixing it. Why are you being pedantic if you aren&#x27;t actually going to bring arguments at the same level you expect from me?<p>Regular people aren&#x27;t given the choice!  The things you&#x27;re quoting about the real world to support your argument are incompatible with a scenario where someone is actually looking at ECC and LED next to each other.  And I&#x27;m not being &quot;pedantic&quot; to say that, it&#x27;s a really core point.<p>&gt; Isn&#x27;t this exactly the kind of claim you yourself characterize one paragraph above as &quot;useless&quot; because &quot;you have no related data, and logic could support multiple outcomes&quot;?<p>A claim of a specific outcome is useless.  &quot;you can&#x27;t assume&quot; is another way of phrasing the lack of knowledge of specific outcomes.<p>&gt; Sure, if people were more tech-educated then my assumption might be wrong. But people aren&#x27;t more educated so...<p>It&#x27;s the kind of thing that can go on a product page.  But first someone has to actually make a consumer-focused sales page for ECC memory, and the ECC has to be plug-and-play without strong compatibility worries.<p>And just like when LEDs spread over everything, it&#x27;s something that you can teach people about and create demand for with a bit of advertising.<p>&gt; Sell me ECC memory when my (actual real life) 10 year old desktop or 5 year old phone never glitched. Sell me ECC RAM when my Matlab calculations come back different every time. See the difference?<p>That&#x27;s a clear picture of one person.  But &quot;never glitched&quot; is a very dubious claim, and you can&#x27;t blindly extrapolate that to how everyone would act.')
