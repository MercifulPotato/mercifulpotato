The last presidential term showed what happens than, now repeat that for <i>all</i> levels of government <i>all</i> the time.<p>Worst of all, some very few people will actually give partial scores. Why is that bad? Well, what&#x27;s the most common way to calculate scores <i>today</i>? There are various single-issue and ideological organizations which put out scores measuring representatives.

So to get a high score, representatives are pushed to extremes.')
