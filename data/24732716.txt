Conventional dispatch (presumably implementation in the language?) is based on one of either functions&#x2F;types as categories, while multiple dispatch uses all of these inputs as tags to specialize on the appropriate implementation.<p>If this perspective is correct, I would like to understand <i>why&#x2F;how</i> the implementation conventional languages forced them into category-based single dispatch.<p>Thanks for a nice article :-)')
