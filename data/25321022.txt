That isn&#x27;t going to stop happening. If restaurants are closed, that might happen even more often, because there is nowhere else to do it!<p>Law enforcement in parts of the state have already told us that they won&#x27;t enforce curfews, or won&#x27;t use curfews as probable cause for stopping people who are out and about. So, stay-at-home orders won&#x27;t prevent private gatherings and travel from continuing to happen.<p>The only way to actually stop the spread is to prevent people from having physical contact with people from other households, and we clearly aren&#x27;t willing to do that. Orders to stop outdoor dining are going to kill businesses and cause people to lose their jobs for minimal public health gain.')
