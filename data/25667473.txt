Is the concern that corruption could occur either inside the CPU&#x27;s memory (registers, Caches) or inside the RAM module and hardware needs to exist in both? If so wouldn&#x27;t that still mean that having ECC RAM modules would still prevent the latter? I had the understanding that RAM is meant to function largely agnostic of the CPU using it.')
