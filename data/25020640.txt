Drug companies very much benefit from making products that work, but viagra isn’t curing cancer. On the older side, people don’t study quasar’s because that makes some billionaire richer. It’s easy to argue the first one is less pure, but it’s also more useful to more people.<p>Commercial science has many issues. It’s probably a net negative for humanity that advertising is using science to sell more stuff, or gaming companies to make more addictive games.  In the end science is used for all kinds of things from saving billions of lives to putting those same lives at risk.<p>Thinking of Science as good or bad is like thinking of Math as good or bad. It’s simply a tool used by humans doing human things, both great and terrible.<p>PS: As to drugs not curing diseases, that’s kind of a limitation on what drug actually are.  I think Vaccines really confuse the issue in people’s minds, but that’s not the drug that’s someone’s immune system at work.  Drugs can kill organisms, but they generally  can’t cause permanent changes.  Your body is constantly recycling material, breaking stuff down, and excreting it for a permanent change to occur they would need to cause long term physical changes even after being removed from the body.  Mimic a growth hormone at the right time or kill off some cells and sure that can stick, but that’s about it.')
