I disagree with him on that particular idea that people are divided so permanently into these classes of people. I definitely used to be a normie liberal&#x2F;progressive with many of those associated pathologies but I&#x27;ve always been very independent minded.<p>This is a very common idea though, closely associated with the idea of the importance of heredity. It&#x27;s such a common idea (think of the emphasis on genealogies in the Bible) that I can&#x27;t fully discount it.')
