I work on small, highly custom designed&#x2F;branded websites (like marketing product sites) often times with bunch of freelancers of differing skill levels that i might have never worked with before. We also often pass the site to someone else to maintain and upgrade after its finished. For my usecase Tailwind has been simply revelation.<p>If you look at CSS methodologies like BEM, ITCSS, CubeCSS they require developers to learn them and be very disciplined to follow them. These methodologies are probably very effective in orgs where employees work long term. In  my case it&#x27;s always just matter of time before they start to break down. It just takes too much time to onboard devs.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s not so much about Tailwind being better or the &quot;right way&quot; but about it making very clear how you should structure CSS (put it in html and tailwind.cofing). Other frameworks like bootstrap also enforced something but Tailwind is not UI kit. It infinitely more customizable it can have any look.<p>Tailwind creates less technical debt? Maybe that&#x27;s how to describe it? For others it will be the exact opossite.')
