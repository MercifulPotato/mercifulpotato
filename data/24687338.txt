I used to have slow machines where the Perl interpreter startup time would be significant, so rewriting the script around an fcgi loop made a huge difference. The script could stick around serving requests, and if you feared a memory leak, you could just exit() after a hundred requests or whatever, and the FastCGI spawner would restart them on the next request.<p>It wasn&#x27;t as fast as something like mod_perl [1], but much easier to integrate with quickly hacked scripts, as long as you were lexically scoping everything with my() and not screwing up your globals. Fun times.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.perlmonks.org&#x2F;?node_id=108008" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.perlmonks.org&#x2F;?node_id=108008</a>')
