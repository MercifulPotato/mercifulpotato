It might be different for people who come in via refugee channels (they&#x27;ve been forced to leave their home and may not have a valid and safe path to reunify if they need to) but, as an elective immigrant the only automatic ins I&#x27;ve got are nephews and nieces in the case of orphaning.  I&#x27;m pretty okay with that.<p>While the rest of my US family is freaking out a bit right now I think it&#x27;s a lot more just to bring in folks looking for work with skills to support them.')
