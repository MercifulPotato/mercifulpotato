I think he is wrong about the &quot;research&quot; that is happening though. There is a bull case but not a $25 bil mkt cap one<p>And that&#x27;s after you&#x27;ve already mentioned that you&#x27;re pretty pro WSB. Is he wrong though, WSB posters identified, correctly, that they could use the GME short interest in their favour by squeezing the folks on the other side of the trade. @chamath never mentioned there&#x27;s fundamental research to support a $25 billion market cap.<p>I don&#x27;t know the backstory on his time at facebook but from all the articles I&#x27;ve read on his VC fund, he returned north of 30-40% &#x2F; year while it was active. When commenters have pointed out his wins, you&#x27;ve discounted it as &#x27;oh, but it&#x27;s just one company&#x27; or something along the lines.<p>Additionally, Steve Cohen isn&#x27;t really a fair comparison - that dude&#x27;s company was literally shut down for insider trading - it&#x27;s a whole different ballgame that Steve Cohen pretty much got away without so much as a slap on the wrist though.<p>Also the world is littered with people who&#x27;ve made poor decisions &#x2F; decisions that are suboptimal to the external observer but I think given you don&#x27;t have a microphone into their personal stuff, it seems really disingenuous to use that to disparage him.')
