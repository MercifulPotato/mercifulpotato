Your experience sounds unusual, but bad college&#x2F;program + bad luck is statistically going to happen sometimes somewhere. I.e. I know plenty of people that were truly unhappy with their programs and switched or dropped out. (To be clear, not to be interpreted as a fault of those people, it just doesn&#x27;t work out for everyone, even in generally good places). I don&#x27;t have particular difficulty imagining a college I couldn&#x27;t stand at all either.')
