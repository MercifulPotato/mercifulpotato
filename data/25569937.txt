Name someone who went to jail over the content of the emails?<p>The emails do demonstrate that the party game is rigged (i.e. parties have favorites and tilt the scales in their favor). That&#x27;s not only legal, it&#x27;s intended---the point of parties is to coalesce political power.<p>The GOP demonstrates why the DNC is set up to tilt scales.
