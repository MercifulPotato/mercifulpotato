One set of trains in both directions that are express and another set with lots of stops when you only want to go a couple of miles up the road, say to work.  You wouldn&#x27;t have to tunnel, just dig a ditch.  Then have a park in place of the street, perhaps with bike lanes.  Any cars would be parked just outside the city but still within walking distance.  I personally think it&#x27;s an interesting idea and hope it gets built.<p>Detroit is rebuilding the city around neighborhoods.  The idea is you reinforce neighborhoods around the idea that most of what you need is no longer than a ten minute walk.  They&#x27;ve built greenways connecting places to make this possible.  Kind of ironic for the city of cars?')
