I&#x27;ve tried this from multiple locations on various devices, all with extremely good internet (one of them was in the UK with gigabit internet) and the lag was always there. I&#x27;m not ultra-snesitive to input lag either - I regularly use Nvidia GFN, which also has some input lag, but it&#x27;s actually playable.<p>* The overall experience is very unpolished. You&#x27;ll most likely get stuff to work but, if anything fails, you&#x27;re gonna have to post on google forums and hope someone will be able to help you. (It&#x27;s google, so no support). Also, none of the features promised at launch (join a game from YT, large MMO worlds etc) have been delivered.<p>* It&#x27;s google, so who knows how long the platform will be around for. (It&#x27;s a meme, yes, but it&#x27;s also a real risk, compounded by the fact that you&#x27;ll own the games that you buy solely on Stadia)<p>* You have to re-purchase games that you already own. e.g. if you own a title on Steam, you can&#x27;t play it on Stadia, you have to buy it all over again.<p>EDIT: if you like what Stadia is claiming to offer, I suggest you look at Nvidia&#x27;s GeForceNow, which has a couple of advantages:<p>* You can play the titles that you own on Steam<p>* (In my experience) gameplay is smoother<p>The one disadvantage is that games get removed from GFN based on the whims of the publishers (you&#x27;ll still own the titles on Steam, you just won&#x27;t be able to play them on GFN).')
