I&#x27;ve only used QWERTY. Thus I don&#x27;t think Dvorak or any of the other layouts has that much of an advantage.<p>However, I think the design of the keyboard&#x27;s switches makes a huge difference; I can only reach those speeds on the keyboard I normally use, which is a pretty generic one with rubber domes, but where ~2mm of travel is enough to register a keypress, and the keyfeel is very light and bouncy. Before that I used a mechanical keyboard with (very) clicky Blue ALPS (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deskthority.net&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alps_SKCM_Blue" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deskthority.net&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alps_SKCM_Blue</a> ) switches, and struggled to reach 120WPM. Other keyboards I&#x27;ve tried timing typing speed on include a Thinkpad X60 (can barely exceed 100, but quickly tiring), Apple low-profile (80-90, very tiring), and the famous IBM Model M (75-80, impressively loud and extremely tiring.)')
