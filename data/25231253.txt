Even if I solve all puzzles carefully and correctly, Google still fails me, gives me another round of new endless CAPTCHAs, and fails me again, another round, and finally grants access if it wants to. It takes literally at least 5 minutes to pass it, 10-20 minutes is possible. And even if you pass Google, there are still two failure modes: (1) The website may still think you fail the CAPTCHA even when Google said you pass, seems like a bug or an expiration timer, then you&#x27;ll have to solve another three rounds of nightmarish CAPTCHAs. (2) Google may ultimately fail you and also disqualify you from solving any CAPTCHAs because of &quot;suspicious traffic from your network&quot;, and this denial is often only triggered AFTER you&#x27;ve already solved all the CAPTCHAs. I have no problem if Google blocks Tor completely, but now Google is effectively playing a bait-and-switch game on the users, I&#x27;d call it a form of human right abuse.<p>Solving Google reCAPTCHA via Tor is a prefect game for masochists like myself... Well, to be honest, the only reason I&#x27;m doing it, is to get true pseudonymous online accounts.')
