Stated preferences are that everyone wants no tracking at all. People do not care about data collection in general unless it is egregious (don&#x27;t tell a teenage girl&#x27;s dad she&#x27;s pregnant) but those who do care about data collection care about it greatly. So there is a market for the high-privacy stuff but it is small. And there is a market for the rest that is big.<p>Any effort you make to go from the latter to the former nets you a dollar less. This is especially true because accidentally collecting data is easy (you build in sync between devices or something).')
