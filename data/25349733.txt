You need it to fix a car that won&#x27;t start, or to fix a toilet that won&#x27;t flush, or to figure out why your bread recipe isn&#x27;t rising well in the oven, or to understand why you fall off a boulder problem at the same spot on every attempt. However, it would be hard to teach debugging independently of another subject, as a general skill. Debugging relies on working knowledge of a system; you need to know a bit about how something works to figure out why it doesn&#x27;t work. Moreover, debugging requires self-direction and creativity. Debugging is a skill that can be learned, but that cannot really be taught.')
