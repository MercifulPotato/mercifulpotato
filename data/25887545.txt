The wave function gives you both a position and a momentum (and other properties).<p>I believe what you&#x27;re referring to when you say that it&#x27;s wrong to talk about &#x27;where particles go&#x27; is that it gives the wrong image of the particle moving continuously through space, occupying each point between its current location and its final one. You&#x27;re right that this model is wrong. But the wave function still has a position which evolves with time, which is what I would describe as movement (even though it&#x27;s not continuous).<p>Now, related again to identity - let&#x27;s take a real experiment: we fire an electron cannkn at some benzene gas. We configure our cannon such that it fires a single electron per minute. We then want to compute what happens when this electron interacts with an atom in the gas. If we could solve the Schrodinger equation for the system, it would give us some wave functions which would probably show 42 electrons whose positions is always very close to the 6 nuclei, and 1 electron whose position can be far away, then close, then far away again. Now, whether this is even &#x27;the same electron&#x27; between any two moments of time or not is more or less a philosophical question. But if it were a neutron instead of an electron, would you say it is not distinct from the 42 electrons? And if you wouldn&#x27;t, then why say that when it is an electron?<p>I do understand that moving towards QFT, where we see the electron as an excitation of the field, it does make a lot of sense to say that even in a system with a single electron it&#x27;s not &#x27;the same&#x27; electron across different moments of time.<p>But on the other hand, we reach again the measurement problem at some point: we know that classical objects have identity. We also know that classical objects, like balls, are ultimately composed of electrons and quarks. If the electrons and quarks don&#x27;t have identity, how can a ball?')
