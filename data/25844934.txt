In C for loop terms, it&#x27;s:<p><pre><code>  for (i=lower;i&lt;upper;i++) {}\n</code></pre>\nIf you are using 0-based indexing, lower is zero and upper is the number of elements for a full iteration over all indexes; with 1-based indexing lower is 1 and upper is one greater than the number of elements.<p>Now, despite the utility of half-open intervals, most peopleâ€™s intuition is around ordinal index ranges, so 0-based indexing is counterintuitive with half-open intervals because slices start at 0, and 1-based indexing is counterintuitive with them because they end at N+1.<p>This is because, useful or not, <i>half-open intervals</i> are counterintuitive, but they are worth developing the intuition for because they combine nicely.')
