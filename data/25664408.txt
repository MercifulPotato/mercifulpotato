Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=[25668505], score=None, time=1609976482, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25664212, text='&gt;<i>What&#x27;s with downvotes?</i><p>Didn&#x27;t downvote, but I think it&#x27;s the same as when people read a &quot;letter to the editor&quot; of yore, declaring that some person &quot;cancelled their subscription&quot; because of something in the magazine.<p>A natural response is &quot;Don&#x27;t let the door hit you on your way out&quot;, which on HN might be expressed through a downvote by some.<p>&gt;<i>I don&#x27;t care how good their hardware is. Moreover, good luck sourcing parts if the device has trouble. Apple will not sell you the parts. Even if you wanted.</i><p>Well, they repair all kinds of parts, and have guarantees and guarantee extension programs. But in any case, their allure was never &quot;can find parts to build my own &#x2F; repair damages forever&quot; or in their stuff being cheap to own or fix&#x2F;replace.<p>&gt;<i>A walled garden does not make their hardware any better.</i><p>Well, it does in a few ways. Mandating how the software is made, and what software is sold, when it should adapt new libs to continue being sold, etc, means that they can move the platform in different ways faster.')
