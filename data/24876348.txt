It is obvious that the primary purpose of youtube-dl is to download videos from YouTube. It is also obvious that most videos on YouTube are copyrighted, and the absence of a ‘download’ button protects the copyright holder’s right to prevent viewers from redistributing the videos. The contentious part is whether not YouTube has “effective” anti-downloading controls that youtube-dl “circumvents.” The fact that it needs to be continually updated to defeat attempts at blocking it suggests that this is a fair characterisation.')
