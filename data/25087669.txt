The reason you can&#x27;t (directly) consume gRPC from a browser isn&#x27;t because of protocol buffers, it&#x27;s because there are no browser APIs to permit client code to work with HTTP2 streaming.<p>Clients consuming protocol buffers does require some tooling, but it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> much more complicated than the tooling that is needed to consume JSON, which also requires a separate library for almost any language. Once you get past that, though, protocol buffers are relatively more language-friendly. The designers put a lot of thought into trying to ensure that it&#x27;s difficult to design a protbuf-based format that can&#x27;t be mapped onto the semantics of virtually any language. That is not the case with JSON, which, by being schema-on-read, makes it relatively easy to accidentally create an API that is fundamentally difficult to consume from many popular programming languages.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that it&#x27;s perfect, but one thing I do like about the protobuf approach is that problems have a tendency to stay solved once you solve them. JSON-over-HTTP seems to always lead to this chronic low-grade messiness that seems minor at first, but the cost adds up over time.')
