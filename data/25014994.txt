If I forward mail to this service instead of clicking the &#x27;unsubscribe&#x27; link, then how do they &#x27;unsubscribe&#x27; me on my behalf?  In order to complete the unsubscription process, the newsletter owner needs to receive an email (usually generated automatically by the mail client when clicking the &#x27;unsubscribe link&#x27;) that comes from the person being unsubscribed.  If I outsource this process, this means that &#x27;please-unsubscribe.com&#x27; will need to spoof emails from me on my behalf and send them the email specified in the List-Unsubscribe email header.  If spoofed emails are not used and they come from &#x27;please-unsubscribe.com&#x27; this won&#x27;t be very actionable to the newsletter owner.  From their perspective, they&#x27;re now going to get &#x27;unsubscribe&#x27; notifications that all come from an email at &#x27;please-unsubscribe.com&#x27; which never signed up to the newsletter in the first place.<p>This all assumes that the newsletter unsubscription process is using the email based method instead of the link based method (which is a good assumption email-based is more common).')
