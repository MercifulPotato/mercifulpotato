You might also want to see if people like a new feature, if the feature is well balanced, if it interacts with other systems well, etc. This is all useful information to gather before releasing a polished version to the general public.<p>If your alpha release is full of bugs, the type of feedback you&#x27;ll be getting from users of the alpha is &quot;this thing doesn&#x27;t work&quot; rather than &quot;this thing is too easy&#x2F;hard&quot;.')
