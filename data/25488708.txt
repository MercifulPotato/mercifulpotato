With everything Musk related, take the original deadline given and add 3 years. As no deadline for this was given, I assume this tech is not yet commercially viable.<p>Note that Panasonic, which will actually be making the batteries, has indicated in its own investor releases that it is working on developing the batteries but they aren&#x27;t anywhere close to production-ready yet.<p>The other announcements relate to making the batteries cheaper, but would not otherwise extend performance (and in some cases would reduce performance, but due to the reduced costs would come out ahead on a $&#x2F;kWh basis).')
