It&#x27;s interesting to compare something like how aws&#x2F;azure&#x2F;gcp (IaaS and up) commoditize snowflake&#x2F;databricks (data PaaS and up):<p>* free complement: drive to zero so you go up, and competitors relatively weak individually. A $T corp like aws doesn&#x27;t really care if any individual sw vendor (OSS, ...) gets big b&#x2F;c they&#x27;re still small wrt aws&#x27;s offerings. The few emerging big winners like snowflake&#x2F;databricks makes aws more useful to customers and helps the on-prem -&gt; cloud shift: aws and friends are focused on 30%+ quarterly growth, which is nuts at their scale. They can likewise slowly decrease the ISV margin at their leisure for the non-oss parts, and for now use them to keep juicing the growth.<p>* pricey moat: the hyperscalers keep reinvesting monopoly-margin-driven profits to be even more untouchable. $T corp building their own chips, HA, etc., layers. It&#x27;s tough for a YC startup to decide to compete w&#x2F; AWS head-on - hw&#x2F;sw codesign takes a lot of time &amp; $, and getting even just sw would be hard. it took huge amounts of VC $ for snowflake&#x2F;databricks to get where they are, and yet, it still probably doesn&#x27;t make sense for them to compete w&#x2F; AWS&#x2F;gcp&#x2F;az via custom hw etc. (TPUs ..), vs. riding commodity hpc (e.g., databricks achieving its AI vision by reselling GPU hw&#x2F;sw controlled by Nvidia+Google, unlike their past control of Spark). IBM buying redhat gives a sense of how hard it is to buy in at this point.')
