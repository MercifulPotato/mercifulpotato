Item(by='petertodd', descendants=None, kids=[24834516], score=None, time=1603168515, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24833273, text='&gt; That sounds good in theory but research seems to suggest that homeschoolers overwhelmingly perform better on every single metric.<p>Being homeschooled and unschooled myself, I got to see that first hand in other families. But I don&#x27;t think it actually means that homeschooling&#x2F;unschooling is universally better: plenty of people try it, find it doesn&#x27;t work for them, and quit.<p>My best guess is it increases the variance of results more than the average, with some kids doing very well on it, and some very poorly. While that&#x27;s good for society, it doesn&#x27;t mean one can entirely replace the other.')
