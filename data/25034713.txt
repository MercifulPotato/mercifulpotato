They should be long gone, but given that somebody pumped millions into them, it will take them years to go away.<p>Hell, even regular JS is bare metal today with all the complexity of JIT. I&#x27;m getting the impression that suggesting to go away from this realm is naive and a better solution would be to look at it from the perspective of &quot;OK, it happened. How can we make it more secure?&quot;.<p>After all, becoming an OS isn&#x27;t an excuse to doing less. In fact, browsers now have more responsibility to keep their security philosophy up to date.')
