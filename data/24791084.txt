It would be fairly easy to vet existing projects and codebases for their quality at a high level. Mostly at a binary level, with the goal to weed out total junk.<p>Like a license, I think it would be nice if projects adopted a development guideline, code formatting, the commit, code review, merge process, etc. So that everyone can have a common set of known operating norms around how that project is developed. It would be a lot easier for a funding organization to review if that were in place.  The Robert&#x27;s Rules of Code Review. Bonus points if this were all encapsulated into an automatic process.<p>I think there is a ton of value in funding projects (Apache,Rust,Blender,etc) as well as individuals.  It would be wonderful if someone could go on sabbatical, full or part time and get paid to work on OSS. Maybe you apply for a grant, show them the git repos (process above analyzes), one has a plan (fix bugs, new features, evangelism, tPM, etc) for the time and with time with the bare minimum of goals.  Like an agent can watch your activity log and do a roll-up.<p>I think 50k a year would be a number that many technical folks making much much more would jump at the chance to just work on OSS.')
