You must also allow your civil service to be an unaccountable branch of government controlled by the professional managerial class and unresponsive to the commands of elected leadership (unless they&#x27;re from the correct side). Furthermore, you must allow lawyers to use the judiciary to rewrite laws to suit their political preferences (e.g. your Constitution must be found to guarantee the right to gay marriage, an idea laughable to people who wrote it and to everyone until 15 years ago). Finally, you must protect all classes of people from unjust termination and unwarranted denial of service except for everyone whose political views align with the wrong half of the country. Thank God we live in a real liberal democracy.')
