Couple that with disinformation seen on facebook etc, and peoples desire to consume media that reaffirms their beliefs I expect a good portion of the populace to tune out media as it is mostly centrist&#x2F;center left, and look for right wing or left wing news. Couple that with excessive cord cutting and decreased returns from online ads I see a very large contraction in most media companies.')
