Personally I despise when UI&#x2F;UX changes to my daily software as my muscle memory is so honed in on how to do the work quickly.  Frankly I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s optimal or not because it&#x27;s completely suboptimal once the change is made and I have to spend the 2 weeks relearning it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the solution is to this problem.  Maybe some day we can treat any UI with a long availability promise and continuously version it. Then the user can stick with their current version as long as it makes sense to them and if they want to upgrade they can do so voluntarily.')
