The reason she quit is legitimate, but it&#x27;s pretty clear that she quit here.<p>If you say &quot;I quit unless...&quot;, and they don&#x27;t agree to the conditionsâ€”you&#x27;ve quit. If I&#x27;m running a business, I certainly have no use for an employee who has quit under fairly unfriendly conditions. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t want someone who has quit spending another month or so using corporate resources for what is now their own personal agenda.<p>I don&#x27;t think Google is in the clear here either, but don&#x27;t I think calling her a fired AI researcher is realistic. The story here is an AI researcher quit because Google wouldn&#x27;t let her publish.')
