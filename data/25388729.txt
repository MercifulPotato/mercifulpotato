The Trump Administration banned the device (angering quite a few of his base).  Is it difficult today? Not for someone who has some knowledge and connections.  The how-to videos and files are still floating around. It&#x27;s not recommended, obviously, because it&#x27;s now an illegal modification, but there are thousands of them already out there and it&#x27;s likely people are still making them in garage workshops.')
