When I was a kid&#x2F;teenager I was too focused on other things (which, surprise, didn’t pay off).<p>Since then, I’ve really just had miserable luck and am just never in right environment to meet meet people (not only romantically, but platonically as well). It’s rather difficult to explain what I mean by this, but it’s defined been made worse by COVID. I have a number of odd personal issues problems as well that unfortunately kinda stuck me in a “loser” category. Nothing my outwardly apparent, but enough that anyone who knows me more than just superficially will be turned off. Some of it is my fault, some of it is due to things that were out of my control at the time, but require money &#x2F; willpower to correct I just don’t have atm.')
