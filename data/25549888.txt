But if I maintain two tools, both using Docker, let&#x27;s say they&#x27;re both built in Python, they&#x27;ll both be in their own Git repository, and their build pipelines will come up with independent Docker images for whomever wants to use those tools, and it seems like frivolous maintenance, if not an anti-pattern, to make sure that these tools are always using the same base image. And yes, if bandwidth and disk space were constraint for me, I&#x27;d probably reconsider (even on the original premise), but they are not.<p>By the way, while I think you should run <i>more</i> stuff in Docker, I also think it is still totally reasonable to have your &quot;main language stuff&quot; installed &quot;normally&quot; (not in Docker). If I&#x27;m a Java developer, I&#x27;m &quot;happy&quot; to deal with Java&#x27;s dependency b.s. on my normal system. Meanwhile, if I ever have to touch Ruby, I do not want to deal with Ruby&#x27;s dependency b.s. on my normal system (rather run that in Docker). And vice versa, as I&#x27;m sure.')
