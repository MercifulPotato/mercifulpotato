That there was a wave of excess deaths? That happens in most countries in Europe, most years, just due to flu and other winter issues. Not every year: Sweden was running 10% <i>lower</i> excess deaths than the 5 year average until the first wave hit, so some of those excess deaths were over-due according to historical trends. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s misleading to point to month-by-month graphs and say for example, look, April is never normally that high, there&#x27;s a crisis. No, normally a wave much like that one happens a few months earlier. But so what? The exact timing of a normal-sized wave of excess death is no crisis.<p><i>the excess deaths that they&#x27;re looking to have will probably be...</i><p>Will probably be normal. That&#x27;s what this thread is about. There is no evidence of mass death of any kind of Sweden despite that this was supposedly guaranteed without lockdowns. September was one of the least deadly months on record in Sweden. They are on track to experience a basically normal year in terms of deaths.<p>As for motivated reasoning, it&#x27;s relevant to this discussion because the thread is full of it.  Many of the talking points are absurd. There are people arguing that the Swedes are naturally anti-social and don&#x27;t meet each other (!), that they&#x27;re incomparable to other countries due to population density (Stockholm has similar density to London), that they should have locked down because their economy only did a bit better vs other countries (compare against the UK or France and their GDP looks good), and all manner of other things that are either wrong or irrelevant to the reason their death stats are interesting: they didn&#x27;t lock down and their total, all cause deaths are nothing remarkable. The implication is obvious: lockdowns were pointless, the damage they caused was avoidable, the academic advisors to governments were wrong (except in Sweden), and other countries should unlock ASAP.')
