Good ideas mean nothing unless it leads to a marketable product. And for one smart janitor with business sense there are thousands of people who will just cost the company money.<p>The CEO here managed to notice that among thousands, this is the janitor to listen to.<p>As for CEO being well paid, it is simply because their decisions can make the company lose or earn a lot of money. If a $500k salary earns the company millions, it is well deserved. And when things go wrong CEOs do get kicked out.<p>So yeah, we can say that spotting talent in a janitor and turning into a lot of money for the company is a CEO&#x27;s job and the reason he is paid so well, but it doesn&#x27;t mean he shouldn&#x27;t be praised for a job well done.<p>And sure some CEO don&#x27;t deserve their position, golden parachutes are a thing, but I have a feeling that most CEOs have merit.')
