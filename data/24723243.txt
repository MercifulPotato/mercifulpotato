Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[24725325, 24723750], score=None, time=1602187349, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24722372, text='If there is a legitimate threat of someone making nuclear weapons &#x2F; WMDs, then there is 100% legitimacy for this kind of request - as for the constitutionality, under EU&#x2F;US&#x2F;Canada Constitution, it would pass, hands down, without question.<p>The reason I use the &#x27;nuclear weapon &#x2F; WMD&#x27; argument is because it&#x27;s fairly extreme, and it&#x27;s to get people to snap out of the default anti-government&#x2F;dystopian mindsets to remind us what the law is effectively there for.<p>While such situations are rare, they do exist, and they demonstrate the length at which we have to go to keep civic order - and very legitimately so.<p>So it would be &#x27;authoritarian&#x27; to conduct such searches when looking for someone not paying their taxes, and definitely unlawful for politicians using this on their opponents.<p>But it would be &#x27;practical and lawful&#x27; in this scenario.<p>But it&#x27;s all moot - in reality, if there were a &#x27;real threat&#x27; - the National Guard, Police, FBI etc. would be doing full searches of everyone&#x27;s home, block by block, helicopters, dogs, SWAT Teams, Firemen, the whole thing. There wouldn&#x27;t even be popular outrage, the ACLU wouldn&#x27;t be putting up a fuss, everyone would be at home, in fear, watching CNN, until the &#x27;found the guy&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s basically false to suggest that warrants or information can&#x27;t be used legally in pursuit of a crime - it&#x27;s a knee-jerk reaction I feel by the anarcho&#x2F;privacy ethos common here on HN.<p>It entirely depends on the situation - risk, proportionately, oversight, tactics of execution etc..<p>And it&#x27;s never perfectly clear, that&#x27;s why civilization is hard.')
