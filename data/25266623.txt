That&#x27;s why the different client developers had to coordinate their work. This is not the case with Bitcoin. There, the official client is the de-facto spec you have to comply with if you develop another client.<p>The bigger problem is that the current narrative of Bitcoin heavily discourage hard forks.<p>Transitioning to PoS would be a social task with Bitcoin, not a technical one. Also note that Ethereum was promised from the beginning to transition to PoS, they just didn&#x27;t expect to take this long.')
