Sampling based approaches scale badly with data so, although there are a few exceptions, if you&#x27;re tackling the problem as a hierarchical Bayesian model - which is most often what Stan is used for - you&#x27;re working with a dataset with a small number of features and fewer than 10k rows.<p>Stan fittings can be made parallel, some models will scale linearly with the data, but in the main you won&#x27;t find many big data use cases here.<p>You also can&#x27;t use Stan for online learning.')
