Shared delusions are delusions, but the important part was that they&#x27;re shared. Unfortunately, science doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;shared&quot; part - by itself, it doesn&#x27;t build communities. In my experience, if you ignore the particulars of faith, most religions are essentially community construction kits.<p>We&#x27;ll probably figure this out at some point - we need to, if we are to survive. Right now, the alternative community glues to religion are national identities, supernational identities (e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m a citizen of EU&quot; vs &quot;citizen of country X&quot;), and a wide variety of little identities we create for ourselves as we join groups we&#x27;re interested in. But the problem with most of those is that they&#x27;re detached from geography - so they&#x27;re not particularly useful for building geographically-defined communities.')
