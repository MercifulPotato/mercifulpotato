I’ve been putting my phone down more and it makes a huge difference. If I’ve done all those things (or feel incapable of doing&#x2F;changing any one of those of things) and I’m still feeling symptoms for two weeks then it’s probably time to talk to somebody. Working remote and not being able to get out as much has really messed with my normal routine of getting dressed, eating breakfast, going to sleep at a normal hour, so it’s something I’ve had to get better about and forgive myself for not being better about and remind myself that it is still different than normal and that is why I don’t necessarily feel normal.')
