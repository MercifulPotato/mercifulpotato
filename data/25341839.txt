For this reason, I would recommend that San Mateo county hire a public relations &#x2F; social media expert to do some editing on this and future posts. It lacks the structure and coherent message that a public notice needs. I read it from start to finish and I’m not sure exactly what purpose it served beyond Dr. Morrow justifying his decision to the public. Which I’m not sure anyone asked for.<p>I think this could be cut down to a few salient points:<p>(1) Social distancing, mask wearing, and staying at home are the best ways to keep you and others safe.<p>(2) Based on the best available information about hospital capacity, San Mateo is not issuing a Stay at Home order at this time. This means outdoor dining, take out, full capacity  grocery remain open at the retailer’s discretion. San Mateo will comply with a Governor’s order if and when that order is issued.<p>(3) Schools will remain open in San Mateo with appropriate sanitation and distancing measures as appropriate.<p>The other 11 points are not needed and should be eliminated. There is also a significant amount of hedging that is not appropriate for a public official &#x2F; medical professional. He’s a leader and an expert, he should state his opinion as one.')
