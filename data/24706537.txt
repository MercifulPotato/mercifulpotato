It was against the rules, and worse he got it right, so under groupthink that makes him partially responsible.<p>Under all the attacks he <i>seems</i> to have gone fk it and started actively fighting the opposite.<p>But he&#x27;s pretty meta, he&#x27;s always talking about propaganda, and to me he seems to be trying it out on his twitter.<p>He has a lot of titbits of really interesting stuff at times and a few misses. If you don&#x27;t groupthink these days and are somewhat smart you&#x27;ll get a lot of hits.')
