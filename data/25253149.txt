Anybody that has control over your iCloud account (e.g. a malicious third party) can potentially do this. See [1], this happened to a lot of companies (customers) that had problems with malicious third-parties getting access to their network.<p>So a security feature? Hardly Apple acting maliciously, is it. Regarding iCloud being compromised, this is inarguably down to lack security policy on the part of business or the end user. iCloud now enforces 2fa by default as a result, largely because (and I&#x27;m speaking from experience here) most businesses can&#x27;t be trusted to do this themselves.<p>&gt; How come that they could only prove that by having more than 18% of devices that were sent to be trashed with active GPS antennas, and active remote iCloud software tracking? [2] Also, recycle is defined as re-cycling, not re-abandoning. The definition of recycling among the population seems to be a different perception than yours.<p>Had Apple sold the lots to the company, you&#x27;d be right, but that&#x27;s not what happened. Apple <i>paid</i> the company to destroy, recover and recycle. The company acted in bad faith and against the terms of the contract they had with Apple. With regards to you claim that Apple tracked active devices - when a business has any kind of electronic equipment destroyed, they are required, <i>by law</i>, to record certain information about the devices like serial numbers, etc. Unsurprisingly, some of the devices turned up at Apple stores for repair. The article that you linked to has the following from Apple: <i>“Products sent for recycling are no longer adequate to sell to consumers and if they are rebuilt with counterfeit parts they could cause serious safety issues, including electrical or battery defects...”</i>. Devices that can <i>and meet the requisant standards</i> to be refurbished and resold are.<p>&gt; Literally a couple months after PayPal and other payment providers were banned by removing the headphone jack in the 8th gen iPhone, Apple Pay was introduced. You&#x27;re making it sound like 2 or 3 tiny low-voltage wires are harder to implement than a Bluetooth antenna wiring... c&#x27;mon, really?<p>This is noting more than a conspiracy theory! Do you really believe that they removed the headphone jack to fuck with Paypal? This is utterly ridiculous. I&#x27;m not, by the way, suggesting that wires are are a pain in the ass from an engineering perspective, rather a <i>user</i> perspective.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re making it sound as if bash was only inside macOS for a short time. bash, for the sake of argument, has been in use since macOS 10.2 which was released in 2002 [3], whereas 10.0 was a public beta and 10.1 was released the same year in 2001. The argument of a tcsh being in use for 9 months, and bash being in use for over 19 years is quite the opposite way around than you seem to perceive it.<p>Your link shows that bash was <i>included</i> with 10.2 (it was included with 10.0&#x2F;10.1 and NeXTStep too), not the default. tsch was still the default until OS X 10.3 (bash-2.05a-release) - not 9 months, 2.5 years. bash 4.0 was formally released in 2009, with a change to GPLv3. Apple had updated bash to 3.2 and stuck with that as it was licensed in a way that was acceptable to them for distribution. I know this to be the case because I actually <i>used</i> these OS&#x27;s on a daily basis. As I said originally, Apple should have switched to a different shell at this point. The wornderfull thing about UNIX shells is that the user can change the default and use what they want, <i>including</i> updating the pre installed one, so suggesting this as Apple being user hostile is well wide of the mark.<p>&gt; Again, my arguments were to counteract the argument that &quot;Apple is acting in good faith for the people&quot;, because I do not think that anything innovative can happen on a crippled platform.<p>That&#x27;s your opinion, and a perfectly fine and valid one to have, but...<p>&gt; Apple actively shuts down innovation, every time it could be seen as an alternative to their own product, which they will release only once market adaption has been done by pioneers. This was happening a lot of times with hardware, and a lot of times with software.<p>...is simply not accurate in the way you are framing it.<p>&gt; I personally would choose repairability over anything, always, because I&#x27;ve learned my lessons the hard way with financial burdens.<p>That&#x27;s fine. Others wouldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d suggest <i>convenience</i> is top of the list for the majority of people that use Apple products. It&#x27;s the same argument that goes against the customisation camp.')
