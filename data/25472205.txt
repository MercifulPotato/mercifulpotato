For a customer a game not working as intended is no different than an electric shaver not working as intended. You don&#x27;t need an understanding, or a modicum of interest in inner workings of electric shavers, you expect them to work.<p>Insult to injury, people also tend to be more emotionally invested in games than electric shavers, just like any other entertainment medium. Hence they won&#x27;t just toss one out and get the other, without generating some buzz about it first. I don&#x27;t see how this is more &quot;spoiled&quot; or &quot;entitled&quot; than customer reviews on Amazon on electric shavers. It&#x27;s nothing crazy if you feel entitled to things you&#x27;re actually entitled to, which in this case, an entitlement to a working product gained by paying for it.')
