Something that wouldn&#x27;t make my muscles grow in wrong balance and wouldn&#x27;t make my back problems worse (working on it with a doctor, but I still need to use the computer for 8 hours 5 days&#x2F;week at the very least).<p>I remember some people using a dental chair, and other stuff like that, but I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s actually ergonomic. Is there any research about that?')
