I run a small game company in San Francisco, and we constantly are donating to help fund projects like Blender and Godot because they&#x27;re amazing projects that deserve funding to keep them afloat.<p>But would I invest in an open source company? Eh, that&#x27;s a different story. I love them for what they are, it&#x27;s amazing they exist, but I don&#x27;t see them as an investment that pays you back dividends. Rather, I see them as a useful tool you can make money with and is worthy of your donations.')
