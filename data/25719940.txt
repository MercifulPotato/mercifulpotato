Like, I remember once having to maintain this guy&#x27;s code where he just went crazy on C++ templates. And like, he proved that he&#x27;s very smart and clever, but it made his code practically unusable since nobody could figure it out, and trying to debug a template masterpiece is like the hardest thing in c++ coding because the errors are impenetrable.<p>Coding isn&#x27;t about proving your smartness it&#x27;s about making something people can use and work with.')
