Pay the flow provider (i.e., Robinhood) some amount per order&#x2F;share<p>2.  Provide price improvement over the prevailing market price to the end customer (which the provider can then use to market themselves as providing good execution).<p>Ultimately both of these are coming out of the broker-dealers bottom line, so the unit economics have to work - (1) and (2) have to leave a positive profit margin on average.  Typically a firm like RH would be monitoring execution quality and negotiating price improvement requirements with the broker-dealer.  This order finds that RH failed to do that, and likely as a result of their demand for high payment for the order flow, (2) was below their peers while they were stating otherwise in their marketing materials.')
