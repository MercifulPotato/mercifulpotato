Heavy abstractions won&#x27;t help another reader of your code understand what&#x27;s going on. In most cases it means it will take them much longer to understand.<p>Concise code with heavy abstraction can help eliminate errors, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t make reading it easier. It  also doesn&#x27;t make solving problems any easier. Solving problems is all about algorithms and data structures, not the language you are using.')
