(Rare exception, Californian &quot;hi-speed&quot; rail! But that was politics.) Thing is, none of the money is wasted, as such: <i>somebody</i> gets every single dollar. The higher the costs, the more they get. So long as that <i>somebody</i> spreads enough of it around, everybody actually involved (the paying public not among them) benefits.<p>That model applies to any big-enough multi-year construction project, whether it&#x27;s a nuke plant, a subway line, or a fleet of bombers. So, it&#x27;s nothing to do with nukes, as such, except that for nukes there are always enough pigeons convinced that <i>the next one will be cheap, for sure</i>! And around we go.')
