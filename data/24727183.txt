I hadn&#x27;t been aware of Michels (although I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find out Orwell had been. <i>Wit komante bosmang kom.</i>) and I guess he, like Pound, demonstrates the relative ease of coopting public intellectuals via promising them a pulpit. Looking back on fascism, we tend to focus on its elites, but it appears that at the time it attracted broader support by its promise to disenfranchise[1] the traditional elites[2].<p>One might hope to break a chain[3] of oligarchic transmission via transparency, democratisation, and restructuring, but Gorbachev&#x27;s recent experience suggests any current oligarchies would be very wary.<p>As far as consent manufacturing goes, I&#x27;d claim Orwell&#x27;s <i>crimestop</i> is exactly congruent to the &quot;internalized assumptions, and self-censorship&quot; of Chomsky et.al.

The <i>FT</i> and <i>Le Monde</i> often betray strikingly different assumptions as to the immediate viability of the EU, for example.)<p>[1] Compare the &quot;cynical&quot; circumlocution in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24689867" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24689867</a> for the english word &quot;revolt&quot;. (a geeky circumlocution: <i>du tu tawu</i>, &quot;2 tau&quot; as a verb, assuming that by that time Ï€ has been dethroned.)<p>[2] to what degree is the G7 Barnett&#x27;s &quot;Old Core&quot; and the E7 his &quot;New Core&quot;?<p>[3] <i>1984</i> is subtler than popular culture gives it credit for. In principle, Oceania is a pure meritocracy, with inner party admission by examination. (I take Goldstein&#x27;s &quot;in principle&quot; to mean that on the whole selective school students make it to the inner pary while comprehensive school students wind up in the outer.)<p>PS. Ellul I will have to explore. <i>Mogut fo to pensa ere da belek amash to bang kapawu ong?</i> (better to think of the cosmos yet steer one&#x27;s own ship)<p>The most recent papal encyclical <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24684152" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24684152</a> seems to echo Ellul in places...')
