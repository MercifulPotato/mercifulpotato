Perhaps the modest increase of 8 registers for x64 didn&#x27;t cause compiler developers to ever start considering registers as a generally abundant resource, thus constraining their designs.<p>&gt; If more registers could be used by compilers, the Itanium would have been a success.<p>I kind of feel the Itanic never made it far enough for its register count to have mattered to anyone. I wonder if SPARC would be a better comparison... it was somewhat popular in the 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s, and was a RISC chip with oodles of registers, wasn&#x27;t it?')
