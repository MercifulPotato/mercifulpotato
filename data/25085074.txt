The overall cost is more than cooking at home, it&#x27;s less healthy for you to eat at restaurants, fast food in particular has a bigger environmental impact, and to top it all off, these corporations are warping the political landscape with lobbying, never mind what other concerns there might be (much like the oil lobbies).<p>I find it funny that you claim that &quot;we didn&#x27;t have millennia of home-cooked tradition built up before the restaurants arrived&quot; as I&#x27;m pretty sure the exact opposite is true. So it would appear that as with all victors, restaurants are re-writing history, too.<p>Take all of these observations and apply them to software, and it fits, perfectly. What&#x27;s the commonality? It has to do with certain unchecked forms of certain economic engines . . .')
