At ~ 300 songs almost all recommendations I didn&#x27;t like. At current ~ 400 songs all recommendations I don&#x27;t like and Spotify gave up with a passive-aggressive message sort of &quot;I give up, add more songs if you want better recommendations&quot;. (Note that I have a wide variety of styles in the playlist; too lazy to break up in genres and also I kind of like the &quot;surprise&quot; factor)')
