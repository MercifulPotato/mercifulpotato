If somebody keys it up and down both sides, it&#x27;s totaled and gets a salvage title, because that&#x27;s more than $500 worth of paint damage.<p>In some cases a car gets stolen, the insurance pays out because they can&#x27;t find it, then later they do find it and there is nothing wrong with it but the policy is already paid out so now it has a salvage title.<p>It has nothing to do with the safety of the car.')
