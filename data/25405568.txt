A modern classic, since followed up with many other works. The author&#x27;s perspective is notable both because of his academic credentials and his predisposition for anthropology in Papua New Guinea (a still surviving geography of many traditional tribes) where he was resident for many years.<p><i>The Sea Craft of Prehistory</i>. Still an authoritative tome with respect to the overall nature of watercraft in global prehistory and their fantastic capacity to transport our ancestors vast distances. In some ways I would place more faith in the contents of this book than conventional prehistoric narratives.<p><i>Ancient Religions of the Austronesian World: From Australasia to Taiwan</i>. A syncretic prehistoric prespective on one of the more interesting groups of prehistory.')
