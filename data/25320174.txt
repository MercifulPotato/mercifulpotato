The Chinese have CryptoYuan, the EU central bank is releasing a currency likely by late 2021, and the Federal Reserve is also planning to create a new currency. That&#x27;s how they beat Bitcoin.<p>Fiat currency is likely going to be slowly phased out as cryptos take hold, like an old iPhone.<p>States will absolutely gain power if they adopt cryptos, because they can implement currencies that can always be tracked and disseminated much faster and easier than fiat.')
