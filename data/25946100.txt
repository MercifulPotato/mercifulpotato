That&#x27;s an unreasonable,  unhealthy, and frankly disrespectful expectation from your employer whether it&#x27;s explicit or hidden. I&#x27;d encourage you not to try to justify or excuse it. I can&#x27;t imagine that losing the job is easy, but<p><i>it&#x27;s not your fault</i><p>that you were subjected to that, or that you did not match their terrible standards.')
