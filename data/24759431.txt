Spectrum in Los Angeles hands out &#x2F;56s, and I understand many other residential IPv6 ISPs do as well. You get your own 8 bits worth of subnets on top of &#x2F;64 for easy SLAAC address assignment. This works &quot;for free&quot; not only because the IPv6 address space is large enough to do this, but more importantly because IPv6 does NOT have any fixed subnet sizes - routing is hierarchical and subnet assignment is transparent. &#x2F;64 is just the size used by SLAAC address auto-configuration, another bit of IPv6 magic.')
