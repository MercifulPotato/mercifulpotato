Some financial incentive might be there to be corrupt, but a bribe it is not.  The whole world isn&#x27;t a corrupt wall street bank, and academia certainly isn&#x27;t.<p>Companies can give explicit or implicit incentives but that doesn&#x27;t make those bribes.  Plus, academics list the sources of their funding.<p>To think it through even more.  If Intel did communicate the above incentive to universities, then surely all research universities would devote very significant funds to researching room temperature superconductors.  But would they publish other results, or even theoretical impossibility results (We show that under the standard model, it is impossible to ...)  If it were a bribe, they would not, but clearly in practice they would.  Likewise, if a cigarette company gives a similar incentive to show that cigarettes are good appetite suppresants and make you thinner, and somebody did the research and found that cigarettes reduce your inhibition and make you fatter on average, would they publish their results even though they&#x27;d get grants for the opposite results?  I think they surely would still publish them.  They wouldn&#x27;t just put them in their drawer like a null result.<p>So I think it is really unfair to call it a bribe, and your comment goes too far.')
