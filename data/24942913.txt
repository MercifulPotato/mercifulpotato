Item(by='rcxdude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604069957, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24938594, text='&quot;part-time&quot; is not something I would ever describe teaching as. All the teachers I&#x27;ve seen take huge amounts of work home with them, even on vacation. There may be a slight lull in the summer but it&#x27;s filled with training, learning changes in the curriculum, etc. It&#x27;s not uncommon for teachers to pay for classroom materials out of pocket because the schools are unable or unwilling to pay for them (this would be utterly ridiculous in many other industries). Teaching is something you go into because you enjoy it or it satisfies you on some level and you can put up with ridiculous workloads, not because it pays well.')
