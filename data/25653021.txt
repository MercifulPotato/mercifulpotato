I understand where you are coming from but there is one factor missing in your analysis: this situation is literally life and death. That changes the math a bit to something more akin to &quot;better safe than sorry&quot; in my opinion. We have found a guaranteed path out of this mess. There may be other faster paths that save more lives, but it could also end up killing millions more too. I&#x27;m all for experimenting but I take issue with making the experiment the policy when lives are on the line.')
