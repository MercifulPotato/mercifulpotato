It&#x27;s not like we could&#x27;ve known beforehand which type of vaccine would be more effective. Some tried mRNA, other tried other techniques, and they all have to go through a lengthy phase 3 trial. This is a novel virus, and if everyone just did one kind of vaccine, and that kind failed, they we would&#x27;ve been fucked.<p>Hell, it&#x27;s even more complex than that, because even given a type of vaccine, even subtle stuff such as dose size and time between the two doses seem to play a huge role, and this is again something that needs to be tweaked over time, using long phase 3 trials. I would attribute it much more to luck than actual skills here.')
