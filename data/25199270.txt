I hate to say it, but byoung2 hit the nail on the head when talking about the need for &quot;cookiecutter&quot; websites. Most small businesses are looking for basically a 5 to 10 page website, with some basic information that looks pretty - they don&#x27;t need&#x2F;want&#x2F;care about anything custom.<p>Therefore, I think the key is adding value to these &quot;cookiecutter&quot; websites to justify your rates. Can you bring in a photographer to get some pictures of the business for social media and website use? I often find small business owners know they should be engaging on fb&#x2F;ig more, and are stressed about the fact that they have nothing to post. Are you a hosting reseller? That could be an avenue for increased revenue as well.<p>I know my &quot;adding value&quot; spiel does not help with your &quot;finding clients&quot; question, I think byoung2 covered everything i&#x27;d recommend - walk into a ton of small businesses with mock-ups of their new websites and quotes for how much they&#x27;d  cost.<p>Your website looks great btw.')
