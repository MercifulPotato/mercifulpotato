Practically all of the leads and recurring characters were cast out of New York City.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a thing here. DC and Baltimore actors will take jobs in New York to get NYC credits on their resumes. They&#x27;ll sometimes get post office boxes in NYC just so that casting directors won&#x27;t write them off, then drive up for the actual audition. Only then will they find it possible to get cast for major projects being filmed in the city where they live.<p>The locals will get background work, hoping to be noticed, and occasionally it even happens.<p>It&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s resentment to The Wire or Homicide, which really kick-started the local television industry. But there&#x27;s a bitter irony of playing second-fiddle (and third-fiddle) to so many out of towners in a city with a thriving industry and a lot of local talent.<p>Acting is, of course, a crummy line of work to be in regardless. It&#x27;s not like your Broadway dreams come true just by moving up I-95.')
