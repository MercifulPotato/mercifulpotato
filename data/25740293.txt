This is fine if pricing accurately reflects value, but that&#x27;s not the same as allowing a market to set the price. You lose a huge amount of detail in the process that can&#x27;t simply be captured in a price signal moving up or down.<p>You may end up with things that have infinite price, at which point I think we&#x27;re begging the question.<p>There&#x27;s also a question of how commodified the things we&#x27;re talking about here can actually be - If you can sell it one day and it&#x27;s impossible to &#x27;buy back&#x27; tomorrow at any price, then it&#x27;s a fundamentally different kind of trade that doesn&#x27;t really fit the framework as neatly as first appears.')
