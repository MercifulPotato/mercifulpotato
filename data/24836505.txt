The 20% who had a 2-5 Mbps connection and could do 720p got downgraded to 480p.<p>Obviously it&#x27;s not clear cut, there&#x27;s a continuous spectrum where things will load much slower and start having breaks in playback until you really have to drop the resolution.<p>Well, we should also consider households having more than one person. Two people watching YouTube requires double the bandwidth, going into 12 Mbps+ territory. Truth be told, this is affecting more than 40% of the population.')
