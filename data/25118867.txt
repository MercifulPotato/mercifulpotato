My surname&#x27;s probably evident from my username.  The more common variation has two L&#x27;s.  All was well until I moved to Ireland, where no matter how many times I tell them, they spell it with two L&#x27;s.<p>I even got in an argument getting my public service card issued, where she told me quite sternly &quot;It has to match your birth certificate&quot;.  Except I&#x27;ve seen my birth certificate and she hasn&#x27;t.<p>So the taxman, drivers licence, public service cards all have one spelling.  And my passport has the correct one. I&#x27;m not entirely sure if I&#x27;m two people or not.')
