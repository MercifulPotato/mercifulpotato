Maybe it&#x27;s good but on the spectrum of customization AirTable seems closer to Excel or Google Sheets than Access or something custom-made.<p>Another important aspect is data protection. For my last &quot;just CRUD&quot; project I had to implement at-rest encryption where PII is only accessible with the user&#x27;s password[1]. Something like that would be possible in JavaScript in an ugliest.app but if I&#x27;m not mistaken not in AirTable. Most businesses would probably be fine with it but I&#x27;m always a bit uncomfortable entrusting someone else with any unencrypted customer data, especially PII. (But I&#x27;m not saying AirTable doesn&#x27;t do its job protecting customer data.)<p>[1] It just so happens that this was part of my undergrad thesis project so you can read up on the encryption scheme: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;T0astBread&#x2F;thesis&#x2F;releases&#x2F;latest&#x2F;download&#x2F;thesis-paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;T0astBread&#x2F;thesis&#x2F;releases&#x2F;latest&#x2F;downloa...</a> (section 4.4.2 &quot;Personally Identifiable Information&quot;).')
