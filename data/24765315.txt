You keep saying this but the numbers don&#x27;t reflect what you&#x27;re claiming.  The middle class in the US is SHRINKING, their wealth is decreasing, and it has been since the 70s.  All those jobs are going to other countries or disappearing entirely.  You and everyone else on HN can keep parroting the same &quot;it&#x27;s different jobs&quot; until you&#x27;re blue in the face, but until you can show me some actual DATA to backup the claim, you&#x27;re literally just making up a reality that doesn&#x27;t exist.  You&#x27;re 4 responses in yet without a single citation to back up your claim that there are new jobs to replace the old, and I&#x27;m willing to bet if you replied 20 more times you STILL wouldn&#x27;t have any facts to back anything up you&#x27;ve said.  Going from a manufacturing job making $60-80k+&#x2F;year to driving Uber making minimum wage isn&#x27;t a &quot;replacement&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;wgbh&#x2F;frontline&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-state-of-americas-middle-class-in-eight-charts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;wgbh&#x2F;frontline&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-state-of-amer...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thestreet.com&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;what-is-middle-class-14833259" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thestreet.com&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;what-is-middle-cl...</a>')
