The alternative to FB if banned, for people in that category is hard to find.<p>On Parler, the moderation was basically non-existent, the amount of well behaved users is small (although still a majority even on Parler obviously) and the available alternatives to those users are readily available, such as Twitter, making the damage to those users smaller.')
