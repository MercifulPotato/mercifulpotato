Why?  because the color and formatting outputs all kinds of escape characters. Guess what happens when Jenkins or other build systems try to render spinning ascii characters? What happens if color and spinning punctuation is allowed then developers who use configuration files for things like npm promote them to build with color escape character output enabled.  It creates a mess of configuration files keeping separate build and development just for escape character configuration.  My advice is\nno color and no escape characters if your CLI will ever be part of a build chain or is intended to output to logs. All it takes is for one usage to a log that doesn&#x27;t have &#x27;--no-color&#x27; and the binary characters will trip up diff and other tools that only work on text.')
