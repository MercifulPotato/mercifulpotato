I&#x27;m learning Elixir currently and the subtle semantics around the &#x27;traditional&#x27; assignment operator (=) are quite cool. It means you can ditch most if blocks and provide a list of pattern-matchable functions (matched on their arity) to define logic which helps deal with edge cases a little better.<p>I&#x27;m curious how such a declarative paradigm _may_ help with the wacky usage of software old mate Mr. Null endeavours in. No one paradigm solves all problems I feel but perhaps some allow us to harvest some low hanging fruit for free?')
