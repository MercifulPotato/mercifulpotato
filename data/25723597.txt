But two things:<p>1) I wasn&#x27;t saying that an app that use nib-less techniques couldn&#x27;t do the right thing - it could. It could appear totally native if someone just does the work.<p>2) There are several pro creativity apps (Logic, Mainstage being the biggest) that are actually Apple products but they do not adhere to Apple guidelines. They use non-standard widgets, do not fully follow desktop interactivity guidelines, use the keyboard in non-standard ways. So even within the set of Apple&#x27;s own applications, there are things that are about as different as a Qt or GTK application might be.')
