What sounds crazy is &quot;people have always died of pneumonia, we don&#x27;t understand the reason, but that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s always been, and so that&#x27;s how it will always be, and even trying to understand why it happens or change it is against nature and crazy talk.&quot;<p>Involuntary death is obviously a problem.\nSure, overpopulation is too, and there&#x27;s a conflict, but there may be other solutions than letting people die against their will.')
