The responsible thing to do is to do both. Just like my responsibility is to both take care of my family and my community and the world, all at once. If I sacrifice one, I&#x27;m irresponsible and failing. I would be (and sometimes am) ashamed that my government fails at those responsibilities.<p>The parent assumes a zero-sum tradeoff, but that&#x27;s not how trade, peace, and freedom work - they benefit everyone. Thankfully, I have great solutions internationally. Globalization and the democratic world order have been the most successful international policies by orders of magnitude. Name any point in history, any approach to international trade or international relations, that has yielded the success of the post-WWII era? Not only in economics, but in peace and freedom.<p>We need to do better. What better option do you offer, that will improve the lives of the next generation')
