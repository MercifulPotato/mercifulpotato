Actually it will not teach you how to code but it&#x27;s more a currated list of coding concepts shared by other developers in your tech stack. you have a direct access to coding concepts in your tech stack, of course not all of them will be new to you but you will be able to learn coding tips :)\nI have added a button to support Stanza here on HN because I thought that people will think to upvote Stanza if they like it instead of just passing through. Getting upvotes on HN is a nice chance to get more developers on the website and with this button you can directly upvote the project :)\nI hope I have answered your questions, feel free to ask me more if not ! :)')
