Accounting for the crop factor, it&#x27;s similar to a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera. Wide-angle, for sure, but not &#x27;fisheye&#x27;.<p>I agree it&#x27;s not amazing as a lens, but it&#x27;s passable and cheap. Certainly better than the tiny webcam lenses on the majority of sub-$80 MSRP webcams.<p>I also have a Tamron 8mm f&#x2F;1.4 C mount lens that is a bit sharper, and also renders things a little nicer, though it&#x27;s a little tighter framing. Not bad if you can put the camera back a few feet, but would be cramped in a tight space.')
