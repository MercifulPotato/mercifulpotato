Basically every request spawns a &quot;cron&quot; request (literally a HTTP request to itself over localhost) to be processed asynchronously if it&#x27;s been long enough since the last. And since a &quot;proper&quot; wordpress install can self-modify, it can thus self-update.<p>My knowledge is about 5 years old at this point, but the idea still scares me silly.')
