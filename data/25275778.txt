If they&#x27;ve got an agency tasked with looking after their servers, in my experience that&#x27;s not a great situation; you might get a little more personal attention than you would from a PaaS vendor, but you&#x27;re always a client rather than a colleague, and you&#x27;re pretty much paying for the same product that a PaaS would sell you; they might be cheaper, but the worst-case downtime is much longer. If you&#x27;re outsourcing the whole package of software development and deployment then it&#x27;s not really your problem any more. But in my experience a surprisingly large number of companies - especially those &quot;family business&quot; sized ones - fit into that window where a handful of in-house developers make sense, but an in-house sysadmin doesn&#x27;t; sometimes they&#x27;ll get lucky and one of those developers is happy being a part-time sysadmin, but if not then a PaaS can be a good tradeoff, even if on a per-unit basis it looks expensive.')
