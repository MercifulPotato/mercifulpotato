In that scenario, RH still has to pause buy trades to save their own ass because they&#x27;re running out of cash they need for the collateral that&#x27;s required.<p>Do note that RH is not the only one that paused buy trades.<p>What I find more suspicious on RH&#x27;s part is the timing of this all. RH should have known well before this week that GME was going to be a highly volatile stock. They should have already reached out to investors and banks for credit. They should have already had over a billion lined up to take on the volatility. I can understand other brokers like TD not being prepared because they might not be used to this Reddit-driven WSB volatility. RH, on the other hand, should have been ready. They&#x27;ve been aware of WSB and their antics since its inception. Yet they waited until Thursday to pause trades. That&#x27;s where I start to go into conspiracy mode.')
