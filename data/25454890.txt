I found it <i>much</i> easier to learn than C++. There were a few new concepts to learn, but:<p>- There were far fewer than C++.<p>- The Rust Book provided a free and very approachable resource for learning them.<p>- The Rust compiler gave me immediate feedback if I was doing something wrong (no unexpected bugs in production)<p>- Most of my JS skills translated pretty straightforwardly<p>- &#x2F;r&#x2F;rust has a very helpful community which filled in any gaps that weren&#x27;t covered elsewhere.<p>C is simple when you&#x27;re working with toy examples, but as soon as you try to do anything moderately complex the complexity quickly jumps. e.g. If I wan&#x27;t to use something as basic as a HashMap this is a trivial import in Rust or C++, but a non-trivial task in C. You either have to build&#x2F;import a library (which is not that easy in C), or write one yourself! Same for string operations!')
