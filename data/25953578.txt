Having this since 25 (37 now), my genetics sadly puts a cap on my life expectancy (all other vitals normal, HBP runs in family).<p>All this to say, I hate measuring my BP and follow this space closely. It&#x27;s a chore that takes minimum 10 minutes twice a day and I have to largely stop what I&#x27;m doing.<p>I would give so much to a device that could measure my BP as easily as O2, but this device is not it. That picture does not inspire confidence.<p>All the current &quot;continuous&quot; measurement devices are bulky and inaccurate compared to their larger non-&quot;continuous&quot; counterparts. One day I hope the apple watch can do it, but given the physics of BP doesn&#x27;t seem realistic.')
