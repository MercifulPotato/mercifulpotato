That&#x27;s the whole appeal.&quot; and if you say we can&#x27;t make those deals, you are more or less saying &quot;We can&#x27;t do business with those nations and should treat them all like <i>charity cases</i> where we can only send aid out of compassion for how much it sucks to be them while actively denying them the chance to participate in the world economy and improve their situation.&quot;<p>Having been offered that same deal for a number of years as a homeless person, I can assure you that no one provides you a secure middle class life out of the goodness of their hearts and denying someone the opportunity to establish an earned income because of some kind of stated high ideals while also failing to take care of them in the manner to which you believe the entire world ought to be accustomed amounts to a big fat &quot;Fuck you and the horse you road in on. Not my problem. I don&#x27;t actually care about you. At all. And never will. I just like virtue signaling while being horrible to everyone poorer than me on some bullshit excuse or other.&quot;')
