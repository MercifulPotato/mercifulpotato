Maybe we&#x27;ve been lucky all along, but every one of them have provided similar experiences like the one described in the OP. Purely anecdotal but maybe there&#x27;s a trend in Lexus to have great customer service at dealerships. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to discover that there is a crappy Lexus dealer, but my experience in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts,  and Florida indicates otherwise.')
