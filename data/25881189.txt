You mute alerts about things being down. Then look at ways to drop the biggest &#x2F; isolated types of traffic. Then analyse what is affected and start logging the impact. I don&#x27;t believe anything would be missed: security monitors would alert different people &#x2F; channels than service ops, post-incident review would look at alerts raised, any weird traffic would be looked at during &quot;isolate and kill traffic&quot; stage.<p>Volume is not the only way to notify about anomalies. Poisoned data entries &#x2F; canaries, outbound traffic which should never exist, unexpected DNS queries, and many others will trigger regardless of DDoS.')
