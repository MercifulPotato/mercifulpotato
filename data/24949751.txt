It was the best decision I ever made for that side web-dev career I&#x27;m entertaining.<p>Jekyll, to me, is a DIY tool; it&#x27;s clunky and obscure and you only make it happen with your pliers and your hammer -- you can achieve nice little projects quite fast, but once you go for a more elaborate structure your work starts falling apart.\nHugo is more like a construction company with very-well organized architects. Its logic is relentless, yet it is an incredible powerful tool once you master it -- and honestly the video tutorials by Mike Dane and documentation at gohugo.io are really well-made and if you&#x27;re switching to Hugo, you should dedicate one day to watch the courses and RTFM.<p>The quality of the template from which you start might indeed be very determining of future success&#x2F;frustration. Just don&#x27;t rush it, you&#x27;ll get there.')
