Click buttons for answer, it plays sound if answer is wrong. I use it with eyes closed to concentrate on sound. Guess visual indication would be a good start. I&#x27;ve changed it so it marks wrong button with color until next &quot;Test&quot;.<p>The idea is not to guess but to start with one sound, make it familiar, add another, etc.')
