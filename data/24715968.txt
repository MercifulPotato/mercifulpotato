It&#x27;s not that nerds care about intelligence more than popularity (trust me most aren&#x27;t) it&#x27;s just that the nerds have already lost the popularity race by being socially awkward individuals that can&#x27;t hold a conversation about any topics other than very specific subjects to save their life.<p>This passage makes me think you missed the points of the essay.<p>PG isn&#x27;t saying &quot;people hate people who enjoy computers and want to shove them into lockers.&quot;  Rather, he&#x27;s saying that status competition in middle&#x2F;high school is a brutal Darwinian struggle, and those who have <i>anything</i> stopping them from optimizing solely for status, will lose the race.<p>Your comment about awkwardness&#x2F;inability to hold a conversation doesn&#x27;t strike true either.   Rather, I felt like no one <i>else</i> could hold a conversation.  Time has born this out; many of my nerd friends have gone on to people&#x2F;verbal professions, and I&#x27;m one of the more gregarious developers you&#x27;ll meet.  I played a lot of sports and so had substantial intercourse with my school&#x27;s popular crowd---I would not list &quot;conversation&quot; as one of their strengths.<p>Now, one caveat here: The idea that &quot;nerds are just awkward weirdos&quot; isn&#x27;t entirely without base.  I think there are two types of people who get labeled as &quot;weird&quot; --- actually-messed-up people, and <i>also</i> people who are interested in something out-of-context.  The trouble with school is that, because your actions don&#x27;t affect the world, it&#x27;s impossible to distinguish between the two---like how you couldn&#x27;t tell Einstein from the Time Cube guy (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timecube.2enp.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timecube.2enp.com&#x2F;</a>) if you couldn&#x27;t do experiments.')
