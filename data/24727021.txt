Sure, there&#x27;s also ways to split or reduce the cost, but those also require things to be done. How long do you think it takes Waymo to get their stuff ready for a new vehicle model? Last I heard, it was between 6 and 12 months.<p>The beauty of the Tesla model is that they&#x27;ve already made tonnes of the cars that should eventually be able to do this. Furthermore, instead of each vehicles being a cost for them, the vehicles are a source of revenue.<p>I acknowledge that it does all hinge upon Tesla reaching a point with their autonomy where it can be unsupervised. Some people say they will never get there, but I think that&#x27;s pretty shortsighted. The data collected by their existing fleet is a massive advantage. Let&#x27;s not forget that it&#x27;s been more than 11 years since the first video of what became Waymo, and they can pretty much only drive a small area in Phoenix, with high likelihood of needing to train extensively for every new location as they&#x27;re now doing in California. Tesla are doing most of the world in (more or less) one go.')
