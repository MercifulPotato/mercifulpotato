Many web developers likely do their best to build to whatever standards&#x2F; best practices they can. Management, design specs, clients, etc... rarely if ever care about those standards and don&#x27;t pay&#x2F; allocate time for conforming to them.<p>There are a fair number of web developers who are lazy too, but I suspect web developers care about best practices more than most other stakeholders.')
