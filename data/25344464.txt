We&#x27;ve been playing with the gitlab functionality, and was thinking it would be good to support a fellow open-source project financially, since we can.<p>But to move to one of the licensing models on their pricing page requires us to start to pay per-user.  How many seats should we buy?  I have no idea.  Right now, if someone who&#x27;s given one or two drive-by patches wants their own space on the project, we just give it to them.  If it cost us an extra $50&#x2F;year (or $240&#x2F;year or $1200&#x2F;year depending on our tier) for such users, what&#x27;s the cut-off for who gets to be part of the project?  It just changes the whole calculus.')
