Item(by='dijit', descendants=None, kids=[25374375], score=None, time=1607611257, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25374003, text='Anything I say to this is speculation, but making an engine like Snowdrop is a very-many year effort and usually quite tailored.<p>PS4 (OpenGL) is possible because there are shims provided by Sony which make OpenGL have similar behaviours to DX11.<p>Smaller studios don&#x27;t have a legacy, usually they&#x27;re highly targeted or they&#x27;re using an engine provided by someone who can produce builds on multiple platforms.<p>Engines are simultaneously the most liberating and the most restricting thing in game development.<p>Obviously the Engine was ported to Linux to support Stadia, which is where the major investment would have been if we ever saw a Linux release of that particular game. Since that&#x27;s done the only conclusion I can come to is financial back-pressure (PC sales are honestly not worth the headache, cheating, piracy, support issues; but are still provided, Linux support would likely be many times that effort again), and there&#x27;s also Ubisofts platform distribution systems (which is intermixed with entitlement and authentication systems) and does not provide linux support.<p>In all, it makes me sad, because I&#x27;m a linux enthusiast and adamantly refuse to use Windows. But I&#x27;ve seen how the sausage is made and I have high sympathy for people making games.')
