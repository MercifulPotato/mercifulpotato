No memory of switching, but all of my contacts were moved over. My accounts were using Fastmail aliases.<p>I called up my siblings and asked, &quot;where did you get this email address, why are you emailing me here?&quot; And they just said, &quot;what are you talking about, you&#x27;ve always been on Fastmail.&quot; I have no idea what&#x27;s going on. Sometimes I&#x27;ll go to update my system, and I&#x27;ll be using Pacman instead of the normal Debian package manager. Then the next day it will switch back. Sometimes I&#x27;ll search for things online, and I won&#x27;t find the result I&#x27;m looking for, but then a day later I&#x27;ll get a physical letter in my mailbox with the answer to my question written on it.<p>So anyway, long story short, I decided to switch Bing instead and so far that&#x27;s had only minor side effects.')
