If you call a function that has a return value but you don&#x27;t actually need it, like invoke-webrequest, but you use an explicit return statement right thereafter things go haywire. I have yet to produce a proof of concept to illustrate this issue, but I came across this and it actually overwrites my return statement with the orphaned return value from the invoke method. Took me ages to figure out what was wrong, because debugging the application I could see inside the function that the variable I was returning had the expected value, but what was being bound to the outside was something completely different')
