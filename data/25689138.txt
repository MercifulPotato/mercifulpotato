Basically I&#x27;ve been dealing shorter screens for fifteen years. It&#x27;s nuts.<p>Even now, my laptop defaults my 4k display to 1080p Retina mode. So I get 5 more lines of terminal on my old display, but the text is not as easy to read. I get the same number of lines on the new display if I go down one font point, and it&#x27;s still more legible. But I&#x27;d really love to be able to scroll logs in an 180x160 terminal window, instead of 200x75.')
