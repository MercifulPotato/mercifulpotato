Each device there specifies memory regions it supports. These memory regions map to a large number of configuration registers and on-device memory the GPU supports. Since GPUs are really complex most of its behaviour is actually not directly controlled but instead predetermined by its firmware (basically an operating system in its own right). Finally GPUs really execute multiple instruction streams with proprietary instruction formats and can independently load data from main memory with their build in DMA engines. These operations are typically kicked off by pointing various registers on the GPU to memory regions in main memory to tell it where to fetch instructions and data from. Everything else happens for the most part as consequences of instructions executing on the GPU.')
