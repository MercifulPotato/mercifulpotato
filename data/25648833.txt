Even foreign subsidiaries are held accountable to US laws and regulations if the US parent has sufficient control of the company.<p>Bigger companies get a little bit more leeway to negotiate with the US Federal government on this but if the US decides that something is illegal or prohibited, the Justice Department doesn&#x27;t really care what country the prohibited activity occurred in, it&#x27;ll walk the executive chain to pick people to prosecute.<p>The only way a company could complete avoid this scenario is if it licensed its product or service to an independent entity outside the US.  And even then the DOJ would likely attempt to force the termination of the license agreement if it results in a product or service being offered in a prohibited jurisdiction.<p>None of this is new, or due to Trump, or even partisan.')
