By default a given firing pattern might activate other patterns because neurons tend to be a part of multiple potential pattern groups, and so left unchecked it could result in an unstable, random walk type of sequence.  To stay in the attractor of one memory though, inhibitory neurons are used to turn off everything that isn&#x27;t a part of the memory, thereby allowing it to remain in a more steady state.')
