Your shopping cart, for example, depends on them. Without cookies, the server would have to send the entire state of the session in each response, and the client would have to send that entire state back on every request. Cookies allow the client and server to exchange only a small token that the server can use as a key to state storage.<p>Even if you could shrink that state down to something reasonably small, it still introduces the problem of the client and server getting the state out of sync.')
