Item(by='mikem170', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609981796, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25654887, text='I can&#x27;t speak for the HN crowd, I imagine opinions vary, but I can say what has caught my eye. I pay attention to what I can walk to in a neighbourhood (beer? live music? park? supermarket?), location in the city (near other things), and cost (not crazy expensive)<p>I&#x27;ve been mostly around Jacksonville, and there are spots that I like. The three blocks along the beaches if you can swing it! Or on the beach side of the ditch (inter-coastal). Or the hipster neighborhoods near downtown (Riverside, San Marco, Springfield, Murray Hill, maybe uptown proper). I would be impractical to live on the beach and work downtown. Cost of living is a good deal. It&#x27;s got everything, you just might need to look for it a bit!<p>I&#x27;ve been through St. Pete, and some spots, including some of the small towns on the coast of the peninsula, left a good impression (Tarpon Springs, for example). As long as you avoid the sprawl on 19 and don&#x27;t have a killer commute off the peninsula.<p>I thought St. Augustine was interesting, I&#x27;ve been there multiple times. It&#x27;s a small city, and has a lot of tourists - and a lot of the things that tourists like to do. I lived in a similar tourist town, and you find the good stuff and learn you way around. I haven&#x27;t lived here but know people that do.<p>I&#x27;ve been to Gainesville. It&#x27;s a college town. The unique and interesting stuff is tied to that. But I do like small cities, it&#x27;s easy to be close to everything and not have the hassles of a bigger&#x2F;busier place.<p>I&#x27;ve been around Orlando. Nothing I saw caught my eye. Avoid I4 during rush hour, during the day if you can! I&#x27;ve been though some of the suburbs south of Miami, didn&#x27;t like the traffic, nothing I saw caught my eye.<p>I&#x27;ve visited Key West and South Beach Miami. Both were interesting and unique in their own way. I&#x27;d spend more time in Key West if I had the chance. (and money!) My visit to South Beach was a while ago. Neat place to visit. I stayed at a hostel that had valet parking :-)')
