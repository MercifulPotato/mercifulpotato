However, it would be interesting to compare these two things against better system calls.<p>&gt; the data referred to by these pointers must be copied into the kernel<p>Modern OS kernels avoid that when they can. The article is about Linux, modern ones have io_uring: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unixism.net&#x2F;loti&#x2F;what_is_io_uring.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unixism.net&#x2F;loti&#x2F;what_is_io_uring.html</a><p>In short, that thing allows to setup these pointers in advance, and make the memory visible to both user-mode code and OS kernel at the same time. This way no need to copy the data.<p>Unfortunately, implementing that thing is way more complicated than calling read() or setting up memory mapping. For optimal performance you gonna need to zero-copy all the way up to whatever code is consuming the data read from these files.')
