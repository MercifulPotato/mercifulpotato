Mysterious as in they’re obfuscated, and there isn’t much detail besides commit history. This is blocking if you wanna try out, say, the TypeScript 4.1 beta and the patch isn’t ready yet. But more importantly um... I do not want my dependency manager mysteriously patching stuff with obfuscated code?????<p>- it applies these patches even if you disable pnp, so same objections to the entire yarn 2 approach (currently)<p>So I’m back on yarn 1 and apparently gonna need to look at npm 7 at this point.')
