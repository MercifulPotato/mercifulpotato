Does he object to vaccine makers&#x27; pockets similarly being filled as a result of the pandemic. Bezos is ultra rich only because he offers a superior service for consumers who make a conscious decision to use Amazon. If it wasn&#x27;t superior they wouldn&#x27;t use it. Many criticisms have been levelled at Bezos, many of them probably valid but his getting very rich by offering a service that huge numbers of people want to use, should not be one of them. Don&#x27;t most startups want to succeed in this way?')
