The Harvard administration -- exaggerating only a little bit -- said &quot;Yes, we took a bunch of money from Epstein, yes we gave him an office, and by golly, we&#x27;re not giving any of it back and if we had a mulligan, we&#x27;d do it all over again just the same way.&quot;<p>Of course, they used more erudite, PC language to say that, but that&#x27;s in effect what Harvard did. Perhaps you might not like it, but it had the virtue of being honest.<p>They did pull back a little bit from that stance, upon taking flack for it, but at the end of the day, not a lot.<p>MIT, in contrast, bullied, covered-up, and intimidated.<p>It&#x27;s a different type of corruption, but I prefer the open and honest Harvard type of corruption.')
