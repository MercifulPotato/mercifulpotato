Prior to that I was a Slakware adherent.  I do dread the update&#x2F;upgrade process of FreeBSD.  Beyond the need to deal with the diff editing, I often need to rebuild&#x2F;install packages.  Maybe I&#x27;m doing it all wrong (likely!) but I can&#x27;t recall the last time I needed to get an update to an application because of any changes to Windows.<p>But beyond that, I do love FreeBSD')
