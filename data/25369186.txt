You&#x27;re not looking because you want to see someone crash, you&#x27;re looking because it&#x27;s horrifying.  Same with avocado-less guacamole.  The concept is horrifying so I need to know.<p>And yes, I would absolutely love to see the recipes for orange juice that don&#x27;t include any oranges for the same reason.<p>Either way though, I think it&#x27;s just because `avocado` and `avocados` are counted as different ingredients.')
