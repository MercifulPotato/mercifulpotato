If it&#x27;s just a tiny fraction, or none, it isn&#x27;t worth the trouble. Like, if you&#x27;re the only kosher person in a workplace it shouldn&#x27;t make it necessary to partition food according to kosher law in the office kitchen, but it may be if the majority are keeping kosher.<p>A &quot;significant fraction&quot; is of course in the eye of the beholder. But maybe we can agree that it&#x27;s somewhere between 1% and 50%.')
