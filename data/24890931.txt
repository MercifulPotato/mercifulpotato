This is good news.&quot;<p>Not any laptop but some do. It even does it while driving its own built-in monitor but I do not really use it.<p>&gt;&quot;your laptop setup is indistinguishable from a desktop&quot;<p>you got that part right<p>&gt;&quot;your setup is even less portable than a desktop&quot;<p>Nope. When I am out of my main office for whatever reason I unhook said laptop from all the cables and it works off-site including all my development environment. If my stay away is extended (working for a month in ocean side cottage for example I also would take one of those monitors). I just do not run production servers&#x2F;databases&#x2F;etc on my laptop ;). Btw my laptop soon transitioning from 32GB RAM to 128GB RAM as to give me more flexibility with the databases.<p>Worth case I can still access my workstations&#x2F;servers remotely using SSH or NOMACHINE if SSH does not cut it. Since I have very fat internet pip it works just fine.')
