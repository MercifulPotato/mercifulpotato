If you have a feature like Boot Guard enabled then the Management Engine will verify the firmware bootblock with a key that&#x27;s flashed into the chipset, but that&#x27;s not required by the UEFI spec and has nothing to do with PTT. Under no circumstances is the TPM used. On ARM the initial firmware validation will be carried out by the SoC, but there&#x27;s no TrustZone involved.')
