WSL was OK when I tried long back, so hadn&#x27;t bothered. But for the last few months I was forced to try WSL (now WSL2) again due to some Windows work, and have been using the Ubuntu app. I&#x27;ve got to say I&#x27;m now a believer and don&#x27;t scoff anymore. I can now do ALL my work without problems on WSL2: mainly Go&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Dart, containers (podman&#x2F;buildah), Flutter, GRPC, etc. The added beauty is that you can go seamlessly between Windows and Linux apps: e.g., you can just run an .exe from the BASH command line in WSL2 just as you run an Linux command. It&#x27;s insane how they did it, and you have to try it to experience it.<p>There are some issues still: GUI apps are still a pain to set up (but they&#x27;re fixing this), there are some networking issues (e.g., accessing servers running on Linux), file path issues on some apps (like I guess git here), etc. I never personally experienced any of the git issues cited, and I use it regularly from the Ubuntu command line. Overall, I very highly recommend WSL2 now, Microsoft hit a home run with VSCode with devs and IMO WSL2 is turning out into another.')
