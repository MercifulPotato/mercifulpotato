Because that would almost definitely crawl.<p>In general, unmapping expensive, much more expensive than mapping memory, because you need to do a TLB-shootdown&#x2F;flush&#x2F;whatever to make sure a cached version of the old mapping is not used. A read&#x2F;write does a copy, so no need to mess with mappings and TLBs, hence it can scale very well.')
