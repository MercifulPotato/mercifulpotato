It might have struck a nerve in a group of people who make money off of the sale of software.<p>I&#x27;m not discounting how valuable open research is to society as a whole. I&#x27;m not even arguing that, as a moral right, the research should be freely available! I&#x27;m just not seeing a <i>technical</i> path there that doesn&#x27;t retroactively unassign publishing rights to all past papers. And I don&#x27;t see how a change in political administration makes it any easier to convince rich people to give up money.<p>I&#x27;m not even convinced the government <i>should</i> take action here - CS work is done on arxiv, so it&#x27;s not even as if Elsevier provides a useful service in distribution. Why are authors continuing to publish in Nature when they could put a PDF up anywhere? <i>that&#x27;s</i> what we need to address.')
