In my experience, there are <i>two</i> things to understand about any declarative language: what it expresses, and what it <i>actually does on the machine</i>. The latter is often considered an implementation detail, but - at least for the people with imperative programming experience - it&#x27;s actually crucial to gaining full understanding.<p>I remember my final breakthrough in grokking Prolog was realizing that the engine hides a glorified DFS that walks a graph of concepts for you. Suddenly, all the reasoning and non-deterministic features wasn&#x27;t mysterious anymore, and performance-related implications became clear. Similarly, for people who struggle with async, it&#x27;s beneficial to understand that async means somebody hid an event loop from you.')
