A 10x engineer doesn’t deliver code 10x faster but rather delivers 10x value to the company. They are more than an engineer who plugs code in an IDE. They are a company man&#x2F;woman who understands the business, business processes and the customer. A 10x engineer can anticipate the needs of the sales and finance teams. They understand how technology can impact the customer or how the business generates revenue. A 10x engineer isn’t always the person who places 1st in a coding competition or knows how to write every sorting algorithm without reference.')
