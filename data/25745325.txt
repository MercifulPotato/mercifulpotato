Comparing the privacy card on the Apple App Store for WhatsApp and signal is very instructive. WA collects as much data as it can from your phone, signal collects your phone number and that’s it. There is no reason for WA to do that other than mining the shit out of the data. But it’s true, it can’t see your messages. Except that’s only part of the issue. WA and FB refuse to address this because selling their user data is their lifeblood.<p>I’m glad they’ve changed their privacy policy and force users to accept or delete. I have tried for years to tell people to drop WA with very little effect. In the last week, many have created a signal account. So thanks WA-FB, keep up the good work!')
