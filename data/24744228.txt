If I don&#x27;t use NodeJS, then I&#x27;d have to (1) call it from a script, eating the startup time (2) run a daemon of NodeJS workers running in parallel to my web server or (3) use an &quot;embedded&quot; JS engine, hoping I don&#x27;t run into compatibility issues. All three options have performance costs + adds more dependencies.<p>If KaTeX were written in C, for example, it would be no problem FFI&#x27;ing it into just about any language. Plus whatever perf benefits there are of not using JS.')
