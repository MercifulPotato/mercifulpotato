Hundreds of merge&#x2F;squash commits pollute the history almost as much as thousands of normal commits, so after a large feature set is done, one should just squash all of it into a single commit.<p>That way, you can have &quot;nice&quot; development history where tags for the old versions are redundant since they match commits one for one:<p><pre><code>    $ git branch\n    main\n\n    $ git log --oneline\n    abcd000 (HEAD -&gt; main) version 5.2\n    abcd111 version 5.1\n    abcd222 version 5.0\n    ef01234 version 4.7\n    9876543 version 3.4\n    fedb123 version 2.12\n    dedc456 version 1.128</code></pre>')
