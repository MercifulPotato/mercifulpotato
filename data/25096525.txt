It is really crazy how groups within organizations are often unable to see that collaboration is massively more in their interests than minor empire building. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re trying to building a wooden fort a moat filled with mudaround it when they could be building Camelot.<p>(Well, Camelot minus the whole thing with Lancelot giving it to Guinevere, Arthur to his sister, and his estranged son coming back to kill him. Not quite <i>that</i> Camelot.)')
