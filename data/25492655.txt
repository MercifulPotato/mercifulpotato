But there is a worldwide surplus of car factories. There is no way that Elon will take more than 25% of the world auto market. There are too many national interests which will prevent his dominating this industry. Yes he will be a big player in the car biz, but that will only be worth so much. Electric cars are easy to make. It&#x27;s a battery, motor, controller, and chassis basically.<p>Elon has bungled the Solar City firm. SpaceX which is his pet project, is filled with great engineers stolen from Nasa and other aerospace firms. He is doing great work there. But that is a separate company, and as it is his pet project, he will give it more attention and his car firm may stumble.<p>Elon&#x27;s dictatorial management style has its limits. In Germany, Tesla 3 is down to #3 in the EV sales charts. The other countries of the world will conspire against Tesla and limit his market share. You are delusional if you think his success in Calif. is going to be repeated everywhere. The NIU company in China will likely become a bigger firm than Tesla. The have the Chinese govt backing; Tesla will never be permitted to take big share in Asia, due to politics alone. The auto biz is the jewel of Japan&#x27;s industrial empire, do you honestly think that they will just roll over?<p>So if you consider their endgame to be 25% of the market, their current stock price is not justifiable at all. Tesla currently has 3% of the global passenger car market and about 18% of EV market. Have you seen the Ford electric transit van? the VW ID Buzz?<p>Regardless of how good an US product is, it is discriminated against across the world. I lived in Brasil, and foreign cars there have a 100% import duty. By the end of 2021 Tesla will have 3 factories: Berlin, Fremont, and China operating, with Texas under construction. In the meantime there will be probably 20 competing factories operating by end of 2021 by his competitors. Kia Soul, VW Id.4, Buzz, Ford transit (2022), Mercedes, Porsche, etc.')
