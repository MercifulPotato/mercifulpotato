Something needs to do that work, and unless your GPU can it&#x27;s going to be the CPU.<p>The only way around it that I know is a &#x27;remote desktop&#x27; type protocol where you send drawing primitives to reconstruct the desktop on the other end. That is obviously a much more complicated thing to get working and is better for different use cases.')
