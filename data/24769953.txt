I&#x27;m really excited for when someone figures out concurrently trained models, say, alternating between training passes of GPT-3 and iGPT, such that the very same attention layers deal with both language and and visual&#x2F;spatial conceptualization. I expect common sense reasoning capabilities to take a huge leap, at that point.')
