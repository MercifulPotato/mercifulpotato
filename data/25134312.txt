Item(by='ethanwillis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605687533, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25133860, text='I&#x27;m a native English speaker who works with mostly non-native English speakers. And in my experience written English is much closer in similarity(and basically indistinguishable) to a native speaker&#x27;s written communication than spoken english is to a native speaker&#x27;s.<p>I think the reason is as someone else in the thread said, it gives you more time to formulate your thoughts and there is tooling to support cleaning up your thoughts (spellcheck, more time to look up words, translation tools, etc.)<p>I think this is also true for the language I&#x27;m trying to learn right now, Ukrainian. When I try to speak it the problem is that I don&#x27;t have enough time to think about what words I&#x27;m looking for. I don&#x27;t have time to think about my grammar&#x2F;declensions(very hard for me as an English speaker). But when I interact with Ukrainian speakers online in a written format I can actually formulate sentences that don&#x27;t sound like I&#x27;m 5 years old. Instead I get to sound like I&#x27;m maybe 8 years old :)')
