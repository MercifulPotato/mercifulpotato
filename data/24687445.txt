If the BRANCH is a fast-forward (i.e. it&#x27;s been rebased to master&#x2F;main &amp; tested before merge) then you get both benefits of a clean history and an easy revert, for little downside.<p>Keeping the history of each incremental change, even in a branch, is IMO too useful to give up.<p>Note I&#x27;m not advocating keeping those &quot;fixed typo in previous commit&quot; fix-up commits: those should be properly fixed up _before_ merge, by judicious use of git rebase.')
