You can make arrangements that fit what you want. Kids don&#x27;t have that option. They often don&#x27;t even realize that they themselves might&#x27;ve put too much on their own plate and might not know how to handle it. They just don&#x27;t burn out the same way adults do.<p>As an aside, if school was preparation for adult life then it really should teach you to drive, cook, and an understanding of the law.
