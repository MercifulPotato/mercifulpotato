But we&#x27;re talking about massive numbers here. If that &quot;100&quot; is 1,000,000 tons of soot, reducing human-produced soot from 12 to 8 is taking 40,000 tons of soot out of the environment. And that&#x27;s likely not uniformly distributed across the country: you&#x27;re far more likely to have hot spots of human-produced soot, which adds up to tens of thousands of kids who don&#x27;t end up getting (or are affected less by) asthma, thousands of adults whose lifespans are materially lengthened, and greatly reduced healthcare costs.')
