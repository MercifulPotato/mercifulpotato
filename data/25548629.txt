I tried to jail break my PW2 and it lead to nowhere after 3 hours of attempts. The newest firmware (which it automatically updated to without asking) has blocked the downgrading to an older firmware, making the jailbreak unsuccessful.<p>NB: if you plan on jailbreaking an old Kindle, put it in airplane mode as soon as possible. If it upgrades past 5.10+, you&#x27;re done.')
