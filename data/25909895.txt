Out of my group of friends that I talk to almost every day and bet on &quot;meme positions&quot; (all fairly similar to each other in terms of which positions we pick), it is all over the place.<p>Just for this year alone:<p>One person in a significant negative this year.<p>One with a small negative.<p>One with 45%+.<p>One with 77%+.<p>One with 110%+.<p>One with 247%+.<p>It is less about which specific &quot;meme positions&quot; you enter, but when you enter them and when you exit them. As well as predicting certain &quot;meme positions&quot; before they show up on WSB, but that one had a very small effect on our portfolios, given it is something really difficult to predict correctly. And mine you, none of us went full yolo wsb-style. None of us bet our life savings, we were just betting fairly consistently and on a lot of different things. And even the highest gainers never went full yolo and dropped more than 5-7% of their portfolio on their biggest bets')
