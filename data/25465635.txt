And that&#x27;s exactly what we do using classes or using a css framework that provides for better abstraction than vanilla css. And as the original article demonstrates, there usually is one best practice that checks all the boxes.<p>It&#x27;s not that vertical aligning is buggy or that it doesn&#x27;t work or that it&#x27;s not possible. There was never a tag for it as if the need wasn&#x27;t acknowledged, even with the browsers fully capable of doing it as demonstrated by every webmaster that did it since css1.<p>And to add, complexity is never a reason when you&#x27;re capable of abstraction. The main issue with CSS and HTML is there is no &quot;let&quot;. You&#x27;re always forced to deal with the specific tags directly. Instead, javascript is provided as a tool for abstraction. So again, it&#x27;s all possible. We just have to do it ourselves as opposed to there just being a &quot;let&quot;.')
