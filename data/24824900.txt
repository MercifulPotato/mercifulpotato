AirPods are a <i>marvel</i> of modern engineering! They&#x27;re incredibly, astonishingly <i>packed</i> full  of fantastically miniaturised parts. This is absolute bleeding edge stuff.<p>A screw, no matter how tiny, would absolutely be a problem. You&#x27;d also have to make the battery &quot;loose&quot; and not glued in, add a connector for it -- but not one that could work loose from normal shaking.<p>This is a borderline physically impossible problem that&#x27;s <i>just not worth it</i> to solve.<p>What volume do you think all the AirPods in the world take up in rubbish tips?<p>No, seriously. Let us sit down and compute this:<p>At least one site is claiming that Apple sold 60 million AirPods in one year.<p>The charging case is 44.3 x 21.3 x 53.5 mm and together with the two AirPods weighs 44 grams.<p>That&#x27;s 2,640 tons annually: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=44+grams+*+60+million" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=44+grams+*+60+million</a><p>... or about 20% of the trash produced by New York <i>daily</i>,<p>And in terms of volume, it is a little more than the volume of an Olympic swimming pool: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=44.3+mm+*+21.3+mm+*+53.5+mm+*+60+million" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=44.3+mm+*+21.3+mm+*+53...</a><p>You&#x27;d also have to factor in that adding a screw doesn&#x27;t mean that 100% of all AirPods are recycled in perpetuity, but that more like 20% might have their lifespan extended one or two years at most before the owners lost or broke them.<p>Now keep in mind that Apple sells over <i>half</i> of all wireless headsets globally, so the sum total annual e-waste is double those numbers above, roughly speaking. Not exactly the end of the world.<p>Or to put it another way, I own a set of AirPod+case that weigh 44 grams. I bought them a year ago. The 4g airpods got replaced after 1 years, generating 4g of e-waste in the first year of ownership. I intend to keep these for at least one more year, generating twenty-something grams of waste in annualised terms.<p>I just took out the family garbage today, it was several kilograms. I have a small family.')
