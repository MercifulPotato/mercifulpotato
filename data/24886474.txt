Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=[24887037], score=None, time=1603635592, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886303, text='In a lot of cases there are no comparable free alternatives to proprietary products, so the comparison is not &quot;perpetual functionality vs time-limited&#x2F;restricted functionality&quot;, it&#x27;s more like &quot;<i>no functionality at all</i> vs restricted functionality&quot;, and in this case, restricted functionality is still the more pragmatic choice.<p>To expand on my earlier comment, my point was that free software will not succeed until it competes with proprietary software on user experience and functionality, and the only way to compete is to focus their (limited resources) where it matters instead of making <i>yet another</i> distro, desktop environment or init system.')
