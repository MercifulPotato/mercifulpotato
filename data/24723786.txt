Item(by='defen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602190062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720843, text='My understanding is that QWERTY was developed to solve a mechanical problem with early typewriters in the 19th century (frequent jams). According to wikipedia the inventor spent 5 years developing it. I don&#x27;t see why he shouldn&#x27;t have been able to profit from that invention. The only reason we use QWERTY now is due to the fact that early non-mechanical keyboards were designed to be used easily by people who had trained with mechanical ones. If &quot;licensing fees&quot; for QWERTY back then had been an issue, manufacturers would have just used a non-copyrightable ABCD... layout, or paid for QWERTY. I don&#x27;t see it as a disastrous outcome.')
