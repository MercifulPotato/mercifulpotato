Much quicker than dragging a pointer around everywhere.<p>* Cooking dinner, greasy fingertips, want to skip songs: tap Skip with my knuckle.<p>* Looking at pictures, maps, reading a website, etc with family or looking through numbers with coworker: quicker and more engaging to zoom in on something with a touchscreen than a touchpad.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s not a game changer, not something I use every day, not something I would <i>want</i> to use often, but there&#x27;s lots of times when it&#x27;s super convenient.')
