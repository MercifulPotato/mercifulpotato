Much quicker than dragging a pointer around everywhere.<p>* Cooking dinner, greasy fingertips, want to skip songs: tap Skip with my knuckle.<p>* Looking at pictures, maps, reading a website, etc with family or looking through numbers with coworker: quicker and more engaging to zoom in on something with a touchscreen than a touchpad.<p>* Perusing Netflix at night, I find it nicer to keep my laptop in my lap and swipe though things.<p>There&#x27;s no awkward &quot;gorilla arm&quot; thing involved: you pull the laptop in closer for a bit and your elbows stay on the table. When you&#x27;re done you move back.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s not a game changer, not something I use more than a couple times a day, short durations each, but there&#x27;s lots of times when it&#x27;s super convenient to have a laptop with a touchscreen. I think Apple really missed the ball on this one, and continues to do so.')
