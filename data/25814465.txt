If you were interested in government cybersecurity work, you could do something like SFS (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfs.opm.gov&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfs.opm.gov&#x2F;</a>) and get a MS with a pretty much guaranteed gov&#x27;t job at the end of it. It&#x27;s also a good program if you want to get working for FFRDC&#x27;s.<p>edit: They also give a ~$25k-$35k stipend plus tuition, security certs, books, etc. It&#x27;s a pretty solid deal IMO.')
