My first Baofeng was well behaved as far as RF interference, but it was so shoddily built that it literally fell apart on me a couple of years into ownership (the battery latch, belt clip, and TX button all broke within a week of each other).<p>My second Baofeng was more physically sound but had issues with RF harmonics on UHF so it was useless on the band I wanted it for.<p>I&#x27;ve since gotten a Radioddity DMR handheld and it&#x27;s both physically and functionally sound. It cost the same as four Baofengs but it&#x27;s worth it, not to mention the ability to talk on DMR groups.')
