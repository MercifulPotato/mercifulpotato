Because there&#x27;s no place to go and see several different products, shoppers just order them all online, and return the ones they don&#x27;t want.<p>It&#x27;s interesting. The online marketplace (Amazon) controls the return policy, but the sellers control the pricing. That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s distorted (particularly in the case of Amazon) by the proliferation of fake brands. And by fake brands, I do not mean fakes of well-known brands...I mean meaningless brands that do not exist, that attempt to create product differentiation that does not exist.<p>It&#x27;s turned Amazon into the crap-pile of last resort, for me.')
