We have Microsoft Office. Then we have its lacking competitors. There&#x27;s also InDesign for professional creatives.<p>There&#x27;s a huge gap for LaTeX to fill, or to potentially fill, but it&#x27;s not happening. The other day I saw it described as &quot;a neckbeard knitting circle, not viable software&quot;. As a LaTeX &quot;fan&quot;, that hurt but it&#x27;s the truth.<p>Over the past months, I had to collaborate with various different people across various different organizations. Everything in MS Word. I don&#x27;t even hate MS Word, it&#x27;s useful and its dominant position isn&#x27;t entirely undeserved. But holy cow was working together a gigantic pain in the behind. I really started to loathe it (Excel is far worse and did its part too).<p>This was all with technical people. They could potentially grasp WYSIWYM approaches like LaTeX. Slap git and CI&#x2F;CD on top and you&#x27;re where software developers have been 10 years ago. But my industry is still light years away.<p>Part of it is how Word &quot;just works&quot;. But it takes 5 seconds of using it until it doesn&#x27;t. If LaTeX was more modern and also approachable (very ugly syntax&#x2F;language. Could learn from Markdown here), technical folk could ditch Word and really upgrade their workflows. I&#x27;m sick of Word templates from 2004.')
