I thought this was for specifically for &quot;Professional Engineer&quot; status. If not, myself (3 year college program grad) and many, many others are not what our current titles are as given by multiple employers.<p>I&#x27;ve asked many times even on these forums and have yet to get a credible source on this. I&#x27;ve been officially &quot;called&quot; sw engineer as per job title for roughly over a decade with 4 different large employers. I&#x27;ve never given this premise much credibility because of that, and perceive it to be wishful gatekeeping. I am hoping for some kind of clarification however.<p>I&#x27;d like to retire one day being able to say I&#x27;ve built a 40-50 year career while being a living, breathing lie. That makes me chuckle. =)')
