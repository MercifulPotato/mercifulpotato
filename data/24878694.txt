It is highly suggestive that at least one developer wanted to consider cases where the rights holder may be more assertive (e.g. with potential protection mechanisms), which implies intent.  Granted, I don&#x27;t know what the actual intent was.  Only the people who added that text and accepted the commit can know that.<p>Intent is important when laws are broken.  In the minor instances, it may determine whether the law is even enforced.  In more significant violations, it may be considered when evaluating legal recourse or damages awarded.  While I am uncomfortable with the law being fuzzy, I am also uncomfortable with it being absolute.  The latter is especially true when you consider that it is far too common to create laws that protect singular interests.')
