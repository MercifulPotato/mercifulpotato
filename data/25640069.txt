Not all of us, especially hiring managers, are still in their 20s and can read these tiny fonts. I measured it with a ruler and the text is 1mm tall.  Also, the font is gray on white, which is pretty but hard to read. In contrast, Linkedin is three times bigger and black on white, much easier to read.<p>Second, after looking at the example, I have almost no idea what you&#x27;ve done.  All I see are job titles.  I don&#x27;t see any accomplishments or even job duties.  It looks like I could add those things when I create my own profile, but having them missing on the example isn&#x27;t a good look.<p>Third, the face circles.  I see face circles under each job, but they aren&#x27;t clickable nor are there tooltips.  I have no idea what those are.  I assume they&#x27;re other people who worked at the same place?  Maybe connections of yours who have worked at the same place?  That&#x27;s a cool idea, but it needs to be more discoverable.  At the very least a tooltip would be good.<p>Overall, when I&#x27;m looking at a professional profile, I&#x27;m usually doing it because I want to hire or work with someone.  The main information I want to know is 1) Do we have anyone in common I can ask about you?  2) What did you accomplish at your previous workplaces or otherwise?  3) Have you worked anywhere that I recognize and when, so I can ask my other friends who worked there if they know you?<p>The face circles accomplish #1, so that&#x27;s great.  #2 looks possible, but the design seems to minimize the accomplishments, as opposed to Linkedin which sort of puts it in your face.  And #3 seems to be covered but again the design minimizes the information I want most.<p>I would say a good place to start would be asking yourself, &quot;Why does Linkedin look the way it does?&quot;.  A lot of their design comes from customer feedback, and their main customers are recruiters and hiring managers.  Steal their good stuff and leave their dark patterns behind.')
