Pretty much all communication&#x2F;text apps (except video) could easily run on a device spec&#x27;d far lower. The web is ridiculously bloated and full of ads and crapware. Just rendering pages of decent-looking text shouldn&#x27;t take so much power. Even manipulating maps for navigation is mostly a 2d graphics scaling problem that can&#x27;t possibly require that much horsepower.<p>But yes, my point about development does pretty much rely on having an external keyboard and mouse.<p>Here&#x27;s a pic of the logic board of an iPhone 11:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net&#x2F;igi&#x2F;UNjifVHATsvaagZB.full" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net&#x2F;igi&#x2F;UNjifVHATsvaagZB.f...</a><p>The miniaturization of tech is absolutely astounding to me, even today. We&#x27;re pretty unappreciative and wasteful, IMHO. 20 year old me would have been absolutely astounded that that much power was packed in that tiny space, and yet what it delivers is just marginally prettier and not more usable than back then.')
