If I could auto-export all my data, I might give it a whirl.<p>I had a similar experience looking into anchorFM - looked neat - like what I was needing exactly (like this maybe) - checked the terms and checked out.<p>With today&#x27;s cancel culture what it is, I can&#x27;t see buying into a SaaS that will punt so easily - I don&#x27;t know if export is an option - I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a lockout kind of thing like google does - or if you have time to get your content like wordpress.com does.. but I can build this and not worry about it, other people may want to know.')
