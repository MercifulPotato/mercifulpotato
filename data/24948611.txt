Item(by='eric_b', descendants=None, kids=[24949383, 24948915], score=None, time=1604110241, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947498, text='I had chronic, severe, debilitating pain for years until I read the book: The Mindbody Prescription by Dr. Sarno [1]<p>Someone on HN suggested it in a &quot;carpal tunnel&quot; thread.  I didn&#x27;t have carpal tunnel. I had a completely destroyed knee.  No more cartilage.  Bone on bone with every step I took (confirmed by MRI).  Cortisone didn&#x27;t make a bit of difference. I couldn&#x27;t walk 20 feet without mind boggling pain.<p>That book changed my life.  I can walk 10 miles (mostly) pain free now.  I still don&#x27;t have any cartilage.  I never had surgery or did PT.  The book explains it all, but the TLDR is that it&#x27;s the brain that&#x27;s causing the issue.  You can have incredible structural issues.  Herniated discs in the back.  Zero cartilage in the knee.  And the reason you feel pain isn&#x27;t the structural issue, but your brain&#x27;s response to it.<p>I wager that book would be life changing for 90 percent of chronic pain sufferers if they gave it a chance.<p>(Yeah, a lot of people are going to chime in and say that their pain is different or an MRI confirmed their structural issue or whatever.  Yeah, I get it.  I was there too.  Frozen shoulder is almost certainly a manifestation of TMS, at least for some large number of people. For those who understand the mechanism, it&#x27;s clear that 2020 is going to be a bad year for people in terms of chronic pain.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00FOTRPJQ&#x2F;ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00FOTRPJQ&#x2F;ref=dp-kindle-redirect?...</a>')
