These are a great, gentle intro to powerful tools.<p>One recommendation: Add a &quot;What?&quot; accordion entry that just states in plain speech what exactly you want done, without giving away the how. For a few of these I read the prompt and was like &quot;uh...&quot; then clicked learn and was like &quot;oh all they want is find -type f&quot;.<p>Also, small nit, &quot;find .&#x2F;place-for-pipers -type f -name &quot;<i>piper</i>&quot; | xargs grep -i &#x27;piping&#x27;&quot; wasn&#x27;t accepted due to the filenames being prefixed to the output. I feel like this is one of the benefits of piping it all through a single grep (grep, knowing the context of multiple input files, gives you useful output). Obviously you can massage both solutions to give the others&#x27; text output, but I just felt a little cheated that my response wasn&#x27;t marked correct.')
