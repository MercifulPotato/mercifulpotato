California (especially SF and possibly a few other cities), Switzerland, and a few other places have a large number of referendums on their ballots and they generally go alright in my opinion, even when some of the details have not been hammered out. I say that as someone that has lived in both of these places. I think the benefit to social acceptance and trust in a government because of the mandate provided is worth it by itself, and while one may not agree with many of the outcomes, the decisions rarely yield unforeseen consequences which (to me) feels like democracy in practice. Also, it provides an incentive for the public to value widespread quality public education and meeting basic living standards a bit more if immediate governmental policies depend on it.<p>Obviously, there are occasional problems, like the Swiss EU referendum which was approved but widely viewed as watered-down in practice, but it&#x27;s worked very well in my opinion in other instances such as (in case you&#x27;re curious about Swiss history) the formation of the canton of Jura.')
