Which is to say, Google was honest 5-10 years ago, and Yahoo was honest 15-20 years ago. Apple is honest today, but whether it&#x27;s honest in 5-10 years is TBD.<p>This document is a little bit better than the general privacy policy, but I&#x27;d still want to be asked. &quot;By default, iCloud automatically keeps your Health app data, including health records, up to date across your devices.&quot; This is different from your interpretation (opt-in versus opt-out).<p>Call me a cynic, but I read this as &quot;We might upload your data to Apple if you miss something walking through configuration screens, or if you an app somehow gets your data before you&#x27;ve toggled a setting. Our next default update might include a default-insecure setting for new types of data you&#x27;ll never find out about without navigating our screens.&quot; Google does this all the time; they start collecting new information, and provide an opt-out, but by the time I opt-out, they&#x27;ve scarfed a ton of my data. I assume it&#x27;s in a backup somewhere.<p>Apple says they do end-to-end encryption, but key exchange is an honor system. As I understand, Apple could set up a new iPhone in-house connected to my account, and have it sync up my data (with end-to-end encryption), scarfing up all of my data. Apple could be compelled to do this with a court order, or might change privacy policies in 5 years.<p>The nice thing about open source is that I don&#x27;t need to trust. I trust Apple today, but it&#x27;s not an ecosystem I&#x27;d buy into right now. The upsides of monitoring my health are far outweighed by the downsides of privacy and security risks that brings. That goes for Chinese companies too. Hardware can be compromised, but open source + CCP is more trustworthy than Apple.<p>I&#x27;m actually surprised there aren&#x27;t more CCP companies doing open source. I&#x27;d gladly pay double for an open source mouse, keyboard, or other device.')
