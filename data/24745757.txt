I personally have tried this with my own segment of industry domain, not that successfully. The issue was tunnel vision that comes with knowing too much about your own segment or falling into “insider trading” zone.<p>Most of the success came from adjacent segments. You have enough knowledge and experience to make an educated guess on the adjacent segments but you are not involved enough to be knee deep into it and can’t see the forest from the trees.')
