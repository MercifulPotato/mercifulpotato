The rules and problem type issue is a direct result of uninspired math teaching. Teaching arithmetic for the sake of arithmetic is boring and uninspired and leaves a person incapable of doing both the arithmetic and math. You don&#x27;t need arithmetic if you have nothing to apply it too. Arithmetic is a tool but a tool without a problem to apply it to is easily forgotten.<p>Take this from someone who could get through advanced complex analysis but who is also bad at arithmetic. Time plus checking solves all arithmetic issues but arithmetic never solves a realistic problem. Even balancing checks(not that is useful today) if you only know how to computer you&#x27;ll be at a lost until you know what to compute.')
