They are automating environment builds and so that is more efficient right?  In my career, I have seen a Fortune 100 company&#x27;s core system down and out for a week because of hubris like this.  In large companies, data flows downstream from a core system.  When you have to restore from backup, that cascades into restores in all the child systems.<p>Similarly, I once had to convince a Microsoft Evangelist who was hired into my company, not to redeploy our production database, every-time we had a production deployment.  He was a pure developer and did not see any problems of dropping the database, recreating the database, and re-inserting all the data.  I argued that a) this would take 10+ hours b) the production database has data going back many years and that the schema&#x2F;keys&#x2F;rules&#x2F;triggers have evolved during that time-- meaning that many of the inserts would fail because they didn&#x27;t meet the current schema.  He was unconvinced but luckily my bosses overruled him.<p>My bosses were business types and understood accounting.  In accounting, once you &quot;post&quot; a transaction to the ledger that becomes permanent.  If you need to correct that transaction, then you create a new one that &quot;credits&quot; or corrects the entry.  You don&#x27;t take out the eraser.')
