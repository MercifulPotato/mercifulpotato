Those four first moves cover about 99% of all games. If you look at black&#x27;s responses, 1. e4 c5 and 1. e4 e5 dominate, with 1. e4 e6 being the next most popular option, while 1. d4 Nf6 strongly dominates that opening move for white (with 1. d4 d5 the next most popular option).<p>So, from the perspective of the first move (on each side), given that you can describe almost all games with up to 4 moves out of a possible 20 suggests that there actually is a dominating opening, albeit one a single-move long.')
