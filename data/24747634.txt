The first answer is &quot;I&#x27;ve used Julia for 3 years and I don&#x27;t need a debugger&quot; whereas searching for similar questions on the Rust discourse tends to find answers.<p>This isn&#x27;t a complete investigation, it might just be me generalising from my small number of interactions with the Julia and Rust communities.')
