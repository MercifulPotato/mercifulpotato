They&#x27;re reaping now what they sowed a long, long time ago when they killed the family-owned business on main street.<p>Well, you understand that a mall is just a covered street you can&#x27;t drive on, right? With some shared infrastructure? In the rainy wastelands of North America, it turns out that people like that kind of thing. It&#x27;s appealing to not worry about cars when your children are scurrying about. It went more upscale than anyone needed - the prototypical &quot;bazaar&quot; turned corporate - but it&#x27;s hard to argue in the big flat commons the occupies much of this country that it&#x27;s really a waste of space.<p>Time was there were a lot more mom-n-pop style stored in the mall. It was an easier place to start one, you just lease your space and all the facilities are provided for you!<p>Malls may have damaged Main Street, but it was the big box &#x2F; department stores that really did that, and it was through efficiency and better logistics pushing prices down, and corners being cut every which way, that they did so - not just by virtue of their size and location. Nobody gave a shit that Main Street was dying because they could get their own needs for less than before.<p>Now, imagine if we could keep the logistics, but force the profit back into the communities where the spend is happening. Paying retail workers a lot more is a good way to look at doing that.')
