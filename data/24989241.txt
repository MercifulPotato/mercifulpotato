The materials in the reactor become radioactive and need replacing frequently, diverting the heat out is tricky, but not impossible, as it is essentially a sealed ring.<p>I certainly agree that fusion would be the biggest thing to happen to civilization.  It would help us to clean this planet, and get to others.')
