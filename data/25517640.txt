So rust alone won&#x27;t solve many problems, but it would let you say &quot;this code can&#x27;t do these things itself&quot;, which is still a useful distinction.  It also doesn&#x27;t allow you to deal with misbehaving hardware that changes memory underneath you in ways it said won&#x27;t happen.  Hardware sucks.')
