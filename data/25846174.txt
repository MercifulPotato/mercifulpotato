It&#x27;s like saying &quot;I think the word &#x27;spoon&#x27; is stupid, let&#x27;s all call it &#x27;scooper&#x27; instead.&quot; This is our language now, it is what it is. Vendors offering serverless solutions have to call it &quot;serverless&quot; whether they like it or not because that&#x27;s the word customers understand. You can keep complaining about it, but it won&#x27;t change. You might as well accept it and move on.<p>&quot;Cloud&quot; is a stupid term too, your servers aren&#x27;t really floating in the sky.
