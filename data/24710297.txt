The key difference is that Linux is an independently developed system.  The extent that wine copies Windows  code is limited to a compatability layer.  It doesn&#x27;t transform Linux into just a copy of Windows.<p>In contrast, Google didn&#x27;t have their own independently developed programming language.  They needed one so they copied the Java api and created one from there.  They did not use the Api to create a compatability layer. It was used as a starting point to make their own copy of Java.')
