I would like a 20% discount?&quot; Amazon kinda does this with smile and donations, even though I don&#x27;t use amazon anymore.<p>I go out of my way, with link strippers, cookie removers, adblockers, to the point of often manually copy and pasting links into a private window if necessary, to avoid affiliate links. When I do this I usually feel like I&#x27;m supporting the online store, but there are some cases (e.g. I&#x27;m looking for an oversized mattress) where I know the whole industry is corrupt and I just want to pay as little rent as possible.')
