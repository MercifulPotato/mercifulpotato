It&#x27;s far more interesting to know how they are going to make the 35 ton weights.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about the construction industry but some googling showed that 1 m^3 of concrete weighs 2.4 tons. You will need 15 m^3 weights. 1 m^3 costs $200 so each weight costs $3000.<p>35000kg×9.81m&#x2F;s^2×100m is 34335000 Joules or 9.5kWH. $3000 &#x2F; 9.5kWH is $315 per kWH.<p>I&#x27;m generous and assume that the tower is 100m high. I haven&#x27;t seen a real number on the website.<p>It&#x27;s possible that they are using a cheaper material mix but that&#x27;s the entire problem. What materials are they using? They never say so on the website. This is not rocket science. We are merely talking about how to build the cheapest 35 ton rock on earth and yet these people are silent about that.')
