Plus Apple wouldn&#x27;t be going down this route if it didn&#x27;t expect to grow market share - and although people don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s M1 or i5 they do care if the experience is better.<p>Then Apple&#x27;s success with the M1 will spur others - I would not be surprised if Microsoft follow them down the same route.')
