As each side focuses more on winning even at the expense of public good, the other side has to ratchet up to match it to get any input at all.<p>I sort of feel like we&#x27;re in that old tale where king Solomon says they should cut the baby in two, and both sides are like &quot;ok, I&#x27;ll take my half of the baby, then.&quot;<p>Ultimately, though, I personally blame the extreme right wing, mostly. I think they&#x27;re dying, and they&#x27;re not going down without a fight, like, you know, disinformation, bullying, holding the country hostage metaphorically, whatever. If they&#x27;re going down, the whole system&#x27;s going down with them.')
