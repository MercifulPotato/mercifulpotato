(not like I had any time or buy-in for it) BRILLIANT. There is always a faint sense of jealousy and vindication when I see an idea being executed so close to what a person has been pushing for.<p>Congrats ! I think you&#x27;re onto something.<p>I would readily pay for this if I could get my entire team to adopt it. (which I&#x27;d say is nearly impossible)<p>I might sound like making a deal with the devil, but if you could integrate your service into MSFT teams, you might be able to get a huge user-base quite fast.')
