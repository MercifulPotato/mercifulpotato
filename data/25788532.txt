Super early stage and so stuff won&#x27;t necessarily make sense at the outset .. or possibly ever. Thoughts welcome though.<p>&gt; A big advantage is it makes the semantics of composing GUIs a lot more reasonable &quot;replace this leaf of my tree with this other process&#x27; tree&quot; ...<p>The &quot;dom&quot; service in Inai pretty much feels like that. I felt like an idiot to try and (for lack of a better expression) REST-ify the DOM, but it seemed to work to my surprise.<p>&gt; An application could also &quot;proxy&quot; for a widget, including over a network link, so you get fairly simple network transparency this way too.<p>.. yeah due to the &quot;REST&quot; nature, this becomes pretty straightforward.')
