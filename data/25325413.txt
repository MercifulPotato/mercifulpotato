Giant man. Basically said &quot;don&#x27;t be like me kids&quot; and comically fumbled through 20wpm. For some bro kids back in the 90s having someone like that mock your typing was very effective. (He was nice to non jocks).<p>College football coach cemented it a bit more saying he had to pay someone to type his master&#x27;s project in for him. By that time I had started coding classes and that&#x27;s what really upped my wpm.<p>I think not being able to type is one of the more ironic reverse sexisms currently. Many schools didn&#x27;t allow boys to take typing or home ec, nor girls to take shop. Now you see granddad&#x27;s struggle to communicate (my uncle doesn&#x27;t even have a phone my aunt does), and the grandmother&#x27;s being quite fluent.')
