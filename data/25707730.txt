The stance that has led China to deepen trade relations with Pacific nations, European nations, African nations, South American nations, because the US sanctioned, broke off agreements, ignored, and insulted those countries. The stance which had him imposing sanctions on all his allies so when it came time to find support in sanctioning China no one was willing to join? The stance which led to China basically taking over Hong Kong and the US responding with “if you do that then we will treat Hong Kong as if it’s part of China?”. The stance which had Trump threatening China with sanctions, but not imposing them first because they gave his daughter some trademarks and had a beautiful dinner with him in Mar A Lago and then they convinced North Koreas Kim to write him some love letters? The stance which had the US finally impose sanctions, which cost the US more than it did China and led to a trade deal that was barely different from the situation before the tariffs, besides the fact that China had now found alternatives to American agricultural exports in South America. The stance that had Trump too busy screaming Wuhan flu to actually do something about the virus which has led to the entire world losing any respect they still had for the US and hurting its relative position vis a vis China in the eyes of the entire world?<p>Has the EU a been cowardly? Absolutely. But not a fraction as pathetic as the US, and a large part of their cowardly response is Trump threatening and taking steps to undo the EU-US alliance on which the EU has been dependent.')
