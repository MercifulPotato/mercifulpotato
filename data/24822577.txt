Any place that has a compartment needs to have that area waterproofed off of the rest of the device. When it&#x27;s a thing that can be removed, it may not provide as much structural rigidity, so it can&#x27;t be trusted in as part of the foundation of the device.<p>If the same form factor was to be maintained, then, since you need a compartment to store the battery, that takes up extra space that can&#x27;t be used for more battery, so battery life would suffer, too.')
