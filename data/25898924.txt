I grew up near an airport with planes frequently overhead, and used to read Flying in high school. I attended Embry Riddle as an undergraduate, but didn&#x27;t take flying lessons. Some people were decent, others yelled &quot;f-gg-t&quot; at my long hair. At this point, I&#x27;m never going to be a pilot due to medical requirements.<p>The pilot in my extended family can afford to own and maintain a small aircraft because he sold a tech company that he founded, so he has no intention or need to work for an airline.<p>People talk about &quot;environmental justice&quot;, it&#x27;s a thing, right. People who live in the vicinity of airports and presumably are breathing the lead, are often, I think, not the same socioeconomic class that takes a lot of commercial flights, let alone flies private planes.<p>So what I&#x27;m saying is, I don&#x27;t hate private pilots, but if I was dictator, I would ban leaded gas, with the understanding that there would be consequences and screaming, and be indifferent to it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a hard choice as to what would be better for society even if there are tradeoffs.')
