Reducing the power going to the wheel is the other half.  I accidentally demonstrated this to myself many years ago when my car suddenly was almost completely ignoring my throttle input for a reason I couldn&#x27;t explain.  It turned out I still had the parking brake on and when I went over a patch of ice and the car lost traction, adding more brake wouldn&#x27;t do much, so it simply ignored my throttle.  Because I wasn&#x27;t moving more than about 5 miles per hour to begin with, it felt like the car just refused to move, like a stubborn mule.')
