The trouble with house wiring is if you run a phone line parallel and close to an A&#x2F;C line, it will induce a 60 cycle hum in the phone line, which will drive you utterly mad.<p>The electrician was installing the cat3 phone wires in the same holes as the A&#x2F;C wires. It was guaranteed to induce a hum.<p>The correct approach is to keep the low voltage wires as far from the A&#x2F;C as you can, and if they cross, keep the crossing at 90 degrees. Don&#x27;t run them in parallel unless they are separated by feet (plural). If you have to, you can run them in grounded metal conduit as a shield.<p>I probably went overboard on this, but doing it inadequately meant 60 cycle humming on the phone lines and an utterly ghastly bill to rip the walls up and fix it.<p>He also was installing cat3 (POTS cable) and R59 cable (1970&#x27;s cable TV stuff). I pulled that all out and threw it in the trash, putting in cat5 (cat5e and cat6 are better, but weren&#x27;t available then) and quad-shielded RG6 cable.<p>Getting the best cable available cost maybe 20 or 30 dollars more, so it&#x27;s crazy not to do it. The network and cable speeds have all increased dramatically since I installed it, and the cables have all worked like a champ.<p>Even the cat5 cables are happily carrying gigabit Ethernet.<p>I have a couple plugboards in the basement where all the wires terminate.<p>I did the whole thing for less than a grand. If an electrician had done it, it likely would have been 10 or 20x more.')
