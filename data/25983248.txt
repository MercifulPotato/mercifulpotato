Item(by='jaycroft', descendants=None, kids=[25983720, 25987882], score=None, time=1612132242, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25983194, text='I borrow your car (and you even give me the title!), promise to return it to you (but not necessarily the same car, just the same make and model), and then I sell what is truly now <i>my</i> car to someone else.  That new owner could then find someone else to lend the car to, transfer the title on a promise that they&#x27;ll eventually transfer the title back, and then let the new borrower sell it, transfer the title, etc.  There&#x27;s only ever one title and one car, but there are a lot of promises to return the car back later.  When you explain it with goods it becomes obvious that a fraud was perpetrated if the buyers don&#x27;t realize that the car might be owed to someone else.  Yay for financialization and long impenetrable terms of service agreements with your broker where you automatically allow your broker to &quot;lend&quot; and re-title your shares so that they can earn interest on the lending.<p>This is a simplification though, there&#x27;s actually like a parking garage involved (broker) who says to trade on his exchange that the broker will keep your title safe for you - it&#x27;s better than a paper certificate to hold in your safe at home because it can&#x27;t get lost!  But this allows the parking attendant to sell your car hoping you wont notice, and hoping that he&#x27;ll be able to buy another similar car back before you actually ask for yours back.  And of course insurance companies, auto dealerships, etc, but you get the idea.<p>Robinhood&#x27;s genius is hiding this complexity from their users behind a slick &quot;gambling is fun&quot; style app.  TD Schwab ETrade and other &quot;adult&quot; brokerages also don&#x27;t make it obvious, but at least they make you &quot;read&quot; some documents that explain the details before you get an account.')
