I&#x27;m pretty active on gitter right now, and I&#x27;d like to choose a homeserver to have an account on so that my messages from the gitter client (logged in with gh) and the messages from a matrix client are from the same user. Would github login allow that?<p>Edit: also, what&#x27;s the plan for private&#x2F;invite-only gitter rooms?')
