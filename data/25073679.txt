I never locked the patch version (e.g. 2.7.3 vs 2.7.5) though that is definitely possible.<p>It apparently requires a specific workflow - explicitly editing the requirements.txt file, rather than freezing it - which is not harder and which I was doing since day 1 but is apparently uncommon.<p>(And it worked well across a few tens of machines, some running windows and some running Linux, with a mix of os versions and distributions. So I know it worked well already in 2013, and I’m sure it works better now).<p>Speed is not good, but I never had it take more than a minute for anything. Some people here are reporting 15 minutes resolution times - that is a real problem.')
