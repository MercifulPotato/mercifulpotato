Specifically, he appears to believe that Joe Biden winning the previous election is a harbinger for a leftist totalitarian state in America. This is patently ridiculous - he doesn&#x27;t deploy rhetoric of the radical left, his policies and record are far to the right of democratic leftist parties in Europe and elsewhere, etc. On its face it is a ridiculous thing to assert.<p>I don&#x27;t believe, however, that I can convince the poster of their delusion. Therefore I wanted to present the best evidence for it: reality, as I expect it to be, in five years.')
