I recently received a summer internship offer starting in May 2020, however I would like to enter the U.S. in January.<p>(1) Could entering the U.S. while the J1 application is being processed (in January) cause issues (e.g. due to an updated I-94 for instance)? (2) Could I get the J1 visa to start in January so I donâ€™t need to return to the border come May 2020?<p>Thanks<p>Edit: grammar &amp; organization')
