This is despite spending 12 years as a competitive swimmer (ear infections are common for swimmers, <i>probably</i> because they let gross public pool water fester in there instead of using a qtip!)<p>Datapoint of one... but why should I change what I&#x27;m doing if it&#x27;s working?  Some times I&#x27;ve gone on trips without qtips and the resulting sensation after a few days is distractingly unpleasant.  (Incidentally a little rolled up toilet paper works alright in a pinch.)')
