From what I gathered from the rant:<p>* Linus made clear to the FSF that he wanted a license for the Linux kernel that did not include the anti-tivoization clause. His desire as I understand it is that his project gives a licensee the code, they give back changes to the code, and that is as far as he wants the license to go. GPLv2 is a perfect fit for that. (Aside from whatever legal desiderata is required for such a license to be practical&#x2F;sensible in the first place to achieve this, and I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s what those two clauses you quoted are about.)<p>* Linus claims the FSF told him he could &quot;invalidate the tivoization clause&quot; as a solution to his stated goals. But, according to Linus, that would create a mess since someone could fork and write drivers under the full GPLv3 (which is compatible with the version that doesn&#x27;t contain the tivoization clause), and as Linus states, &quot;Where does that leave me?&quot; He could end up in situations Linux is unable to accept the changes without asking the driver writer to re-license the thing under GPLv3-minus-tivoization for upstream inclusion. (Furthermore, the more popular GPLv3 becomes, the worse this problem would get!) But his whole purpose in GPLv2 was to make a simple &quot;code-goes-out-and-changes-come-back-in&quot; deal with other developers, end of story. So that clearly doesn&#x27;t fit his use case.<p>* His central claim isn&#x27;t that GPLv3 is bad, or even that GPLv3 doesn&#x27;t fit his needs. Rather, he claims that FSF misrepresented the license and its compatibility with the GPLv2 in their discussion with him behind closed doors.<p>Of course that&#x27;s just his allegation, and I haven&#x27;t seen an email chain to confirm anything. But that allegation alone is enough to call into question the idea that the history of GPLv3 adoption is only scary due to FUD from companies.')
