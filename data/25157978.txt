That&#x27;s an ancient application: first version was 1993, the latest version (3.0.4) dates from 2012, but it still runs on Catalina. It doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;English-ish&quot; features of numi, but for simple, sequential calculations, it looks very similar. Apart from that, it can read files, plot in 2D and 3D, and read files.<p>But I&#x27;m definitely going to take a look of the two you mentioned.')
