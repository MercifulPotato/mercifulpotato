The technology can&#x27;t be quite as primitive as portrayed, since AFAIK there is absolutely no way you can spoof someone&#x27;s number in CID and have something billed to them, such as a long-distance call from a landline (which still have LD plans). Telco is always going to know where the money is coming from for every volt and bit on their wires.<p>It&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m clueless, but <i>that&#x27;s</i> where I feel enforcement should be focused: on the money side.')
