Yes I read a bunch -- perhaps half of that number -- in graduate seminars decades ago so that helped, but if you tried to read them all at once you&#x27;d be overwhelmed and miss a lot of the significance.<p>Also almost all were published before 1980 which implies the faculty might have been in school around then too.')
