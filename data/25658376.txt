And most of them do. The user of the gift card isn&#x27;t the purchaser, so they can use it without (much) fear.<p>People can also abuse return policies. Most places will give you a gift card if you return unused merchandise without a receipt. So people will shoplift small, high-value items from one store and return them to another. Get a gift card, and then sell the gift card. The cash isn&#x27;t traceable, and the broker gets a tidy profit.')
