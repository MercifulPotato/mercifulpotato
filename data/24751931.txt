I&#x27;m just a doer.<p>You are at least 2 decades late to having kids. But that&#x27;s ok, better late than never.<p>But I&#x27;d absolutely recommend partitioning some part of your 60 hour work week and late night Googling, and allocating it to exercise, sleep and relationship. Stuff like heart attacks, brain diseases and divorces tend to wipe out gains made over 30 years.<p>At the end, any amount of hyper productivity makes sense only if its beneficial and sticks to us in some way, like on the longer run.<p>I&#x27;ve been delaying learning ML for a while now, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter, basically delaying doing lots of things without payoff many of which will be irrelevant in 5 years. I can&#x27;t say the same for exercise though.')
