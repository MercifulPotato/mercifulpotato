Your claim is that this information should make me increase the odds that my initial pick was a car. That sounds right. In the normal Monty problem, Monty doesn&#x27;t give me any information about my original pick, just about the remaining door.<p>Alright just working through your logic here. Let&#x27;s say I pick the first door always. I&#x27;ll write out all the possible configurationss with both possibilities for Monty.<p>CGG &gt; Monty reveals mid (Goat)<p>CGG &gt; Monty reveals right (Goat)<p>----<p>GCG &gt; Monty reveals mid (Car)<p>GCG &gt; Monty reveals right (Goat)<p>---<p>GGC &gt; Monty reveals mid (Goat)<p>GGC &gt; Monty reveals right (Car)<p>So there&#x27;s 4 worlds where Monty reveals a goat.  In two of them, I picked a car initially. In the other two, I get a car by switching.<p>My prior post is mistaken -- thank you!')
