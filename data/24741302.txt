The closest you can get is likely an Uber or similar, but all they&#x27;ve outsourced is drivers and janitors; they still employ many thousands of engineers, salespeople, etc.<p>Also, the management chain still exists, it&#x27;s just at a different company. But from the worker&#x27;s perspective that&#x27;s irrelevant; just as many people still have bosses.')
