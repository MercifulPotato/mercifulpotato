There have been years where Nate Silver&#x27;s model has called <i>every single one</i> of the 50 states correct as far as which POTUS candidate they&#x27;d vote for.<p>Well, this certainly isn&#x27;t how you&#x27;d go about evaluating model quality. Calling which candidate a state will vote for is not a good task; it&#x27;s too discrete to be a good evaluator. For the same reason, no political model produces this output. You predict the vote share given to each candidate -- a nice continuous variable -- you don&#x27;t predict who will win. Calling the state is a gimmick on top of that (since victory is a function of vote share, it&#x27;s easy to degrade your model&#x27;s output into victory predictions) which serves only to make the statistics worse.')
