Moreover actions of China in Hong Kong are supported by majority of people in China. This tyranny of majority exists in democracy too, what happened in Kashmir is 100 times worse than HK.<p>Given the way US president pardoned people who committed genocide in Afganistan and killed scores of kids and unarmed civilians. There is hardly any ground left for them to teach others.<p>No real death in over an year of violent protests by police firing in Hong Kong vs 5 deaths in capitol building siege speaks volumes about the professionalism with which Hong Kong police handled the protests.<p>China is built by hard work of its people not by CCP [1].<p>May be work there for a while and than you can see why Korea, Japan and Greater China did so well not others in growth. Itâ€™s easy to talk rhetoric, but hard to do hard work to bring about transformation.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danwang.co&#x2F;2020-letter&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danwang.co&#x2F;2020-letter&#x2F;</a>')
