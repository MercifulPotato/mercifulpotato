This means databases don&#x27;t have the latest features typically enjoyed within application development environments.<p>However I believe you CAN tolerate some level of failure and defects in your app code, knowing the more battle hardened database will - for the most part - ensure your data is safe once committed. Yes, there will always probably be bugs and yes some of those bugs may cause data loss in extreme cases, but if you&#x27;re saying you perform the same level of testing and validation on a product hunt style app as you would on a safety critical system, or as postgres do on their database, I find that extraordinary and very unrepresentative of most application development.<p>I&#x27;m not saying defects are good or tolerated when found, but from an economic perspective you have to weigh up the additional cost of testing and verification against the likely impact these unknown bugs could have. Obviously everyone expects any given service to work correctly - but when is that ever true outside of medical, automotive and aerospace which have notoriously slow development cycles?<p>Personally I&#x27;d pick rapid development over complete reliability in most cases.')
