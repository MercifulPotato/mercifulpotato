The primary reason for choosing Debian back then was the large number of packages Debian had in its repositories. Over these 18 years, I have used Debian for frontend servers, backend servers, personal laptops, personal virtual machines, team virtual machines, etc.<p>What I have realized in these years is that its stable branch is extremely stable. I have never ever faced any issue with dependency management or package installation with the stable branch. Yes, the packages can be sometimes a couple of years old but the whole system is exceptionally stable. I believe it sets a benchmark for stability.')
