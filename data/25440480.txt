The best solutions are likely to come exactly from technology because technology solutions are systematic. The impact of government policy and individual action just doesn&#x27;t scale in the same way.<p>Asking people to consume less meat, won&#x27;t do anything - creating lab-grown meat and making it cheaper than the alternatives will phase out most factory farming by itself. Regulations on fossil fuels won&#x27;t reach every country and won&#x27;t persist with every change of government - making cleaner fuels more economically viable than fossil fuels will scale over the entire planet. This isn&#x27;t an argument against regulations - until the tech catches up, regulations might be the best we can do but better and cheaper technology is always a more persistent option.<p>It&#x27;s very similar to what is happening with coronavirus - you can have the government impose some measures, you can ask people to make responsible decisions but that is just buying time until technology actually solves the problem - invent a vaccine and you have the problem as close to solved as possible. I think the same goes with climate change, the difference is that for climate change we need a large number of really good technology solutions instead of just one.')
