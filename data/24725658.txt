Item(by='borroka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602205457, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24724569, text='&quot;The practical reality that a lot of people will have a suboptimal experience until we (both &quot;we Stripe&quot; and &quot;we the industry&quot;) figure out more scalable ways to assess people.&quot;<p>It is not inevitable and there are company that do recruiting better and other worse. For example, asking for a cover letter at Stripe and then ghosting people liberally even after multiple rounds of interview does not sound tremendously good to my ear. That is a not a sub-optimal interview experience, like being in a coma is not a sub-optimal life experience.<p>I understand that working with recruiters is hard (who ever said: I know a recruiter who is a genius? Or even the lesser: I know that recruiter, they are brilliant), but respecting candidates should be a priority of any organization.')
