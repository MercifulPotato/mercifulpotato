When I took a class on personal finance, I, too, wondered why it wasn&#x27;t taught in high school.  Personal finance gives you a basic grounding in:\n- How the economy works and how it affects you\n- Income taxes\n- Employee sponsored health care plans&#x2F;FSAs&#x2F;HSAs\n- Life insurance&#x2F;annuities and health insurance\n- Budgeting and cash flow\n- How stocks and bonds work<p>So yes, there is coverage of the stock market, but it is a very narrow slice of the pie when you&#x27;re talking about an entry level personal finance class.')
