Their recent security issues with that hack were devops management and governance problems, no new science involved, they just dropped the ball on some solved problems.<p>Speculating on what kind of problems Twitter would need that calibre of person for, maybe detecting inevitable AI driven botnets and deepfakes?<p>Could also see how they need leadership with that tangible cred as a decider function, e.g. the personality cult around Jack might make delegation and scaling their management team a challenge if everyone is trying to find a way to compete for his attention, so they need someone with enough weight that he can legitimately defer to on security issues.<p>Congrats to all involved. Interesting times.')
