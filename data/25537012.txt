They&#x27;re just not very complex, or large.  Which is probably not a coincidence, and suggests that ageing is not (in humans and other complex species, anyway) only normal entropy, but rather an adaptation.<p>Telomeres, for example, put an upper limit on how many times a cell can divide; much of the anti-aging work is focused on getting around this limit.  But, telomeres are an important anti-cancer adaptation.  The fact that they limit how many times a cell can divide, and thus how long the cell line can persist, is not a bug, it&#x27;s a feature, and in fact the primary feature.  If you managed to disable them, you would not become immortal, you would probably die sooner (of cancer) than you would otherwise.<p>It&#x27;s also not uncommonly the case that changes in society come from the younger generations, who get power as the older ones die off.  If Stalin&#x27;s generation had lived forever, the Soviet Union might still be shooting people who tried to leave.  Actually that wouldn&#x27;t have happened because we would probably still be living under the god-emperors of the ancient empires.<p>But, a society next door that did NOT have agelessness, which was therefore more able to innovate, would eventually come across the border and kill off the ageless.')
