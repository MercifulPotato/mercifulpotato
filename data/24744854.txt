Any such document kills the &quot;I didn&#x27;t know&quot; defense. And parking violations are crimes. If they have a DA that doesn&#x27;t like them ...<p>So yes they do. In theory they risk their job if they don&#x27;t. Now I&#x27;m not stupid. No precinct commissioner will fire an agent for this. However they will strongly discourage making a habit out of that. And if there is even a slight appearance that they&#x27;re neglecting to report it because they&#x27;re friends or family of the &quot;perpetrators&quot;, then it becomes a LOT more serious.<p>The same goes for private individuals by the way, except your job is safe (unless it requires strict no convictions, like healthcare positions). However, this is still one of the reasons for you tell the police &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I haven&#x27;t seen a thing&quot;, because if you had seen it, didn&#x27;t report it of your own accord and they don&#x27;t like you, you&#x27;ll be paying a fine.')
