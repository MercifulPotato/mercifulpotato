Hell, Firefox can even afford to cannibalise its own market with two versions of Firefox (FF, and FF Focus).<p>Furthermore all the big name browser makers sell their offering at &quot;free&quot;. In my view, this makes browsers an outlier in any discussion of Apple&#x27;s anti-competitive behaviour. It doesn&#x27;t shut down the conversation, just takes browsers out of it.')
