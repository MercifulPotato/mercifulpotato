Someone who just wants less government interference in their own property isn&#x27;t necessarily suffering from any kind of phobia. And those views tend to be fairly popular in rural America, because it&#x27;s just more compatible with that particular way of life. There&#x27;s probably self-selection going on; people who want to be more socially connected are going to move towards the cities and people who want to get away are going to move towards smaller towns.<p>The connection between disgust and conservatism likely only influences certain specific parts of the GOP tent. It can only explain why someone might spend ridiculous amounts of time complaining about, say, the fact that trans people exist. It wouldn&#x27;t explain why someone would be opposed to, say, large government spending projects or feel like immigrants bring crime. We call all three of these &quot;conservatism&quot;, but one is a technical complaint about how government should run, another is naked tribal otherism with no hint of disgust language, and and yet another is the &quot;pineapple on pizza&quot; meme as applied to whether or not a certain group of people should be allowed to exist.')
