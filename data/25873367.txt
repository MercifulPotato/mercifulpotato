Each approach has its pros and cons. Physical replication logs tend to be larger than logical logs but I agree that you avoid a lot of issues if you do physical replication.</i><p>Hmm. Not having dug into your solution much, is it safe to say that the physical replication logs have something like logical checkpoints? If so, would it make sense to only keep physical logs on a relatively short rolling window, and logical logs (ie. only the interleaved logical checkpoints) longer?')
