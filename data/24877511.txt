Ethically I agree with you: copyright law regulates distributing copies to other people, and YouTube is the only one doing that in this scenario.<p>But I&#x27;ve been told in other internet discussions that courts don&#x27;t see it that way. Basically, that the point of the law is to allow big companies to stop people from accessing media without paying, and the interpretation is stretched as far as it needs to be in order to enforce that.<p>So I don&#x27;t know what to believe here.')
