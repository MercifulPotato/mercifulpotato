But it&#x27;s like saying that before teaching a kid addition and multiplication they should understand the Dedekindâ€“Peano axioms -- it&#x27;s simply overkill and more likely to discourage them than anything else. (But it depends on age and aptitude, of course, so obviously YMMV).<p>FWIW I started with K&amp;R, but times have changed and I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a pedagogically sound way of teaching programming.')
