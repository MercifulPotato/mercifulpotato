Perl+CGI + all the server setup for a simple dynamic page? It&#x27;s just unimaginable to many today&#x27;s developer.<p>I started off with PHP3 and have a very great and hated time with it till v5. PHP for sure is difficult to maintain and very painful to debug, but it&#x27;s not my reason leaving it. It&#x27;s because JS began to pick up and started to do many tasks that requires no server rendering. The server sides started to become just API server, which no longer generate html on the fly. It&#x27;s much scalable and easy to maintain.<p>Time flies, now I see the release of PHP 8 and I realise I have ditched it for a decade. Do I miss you? No.')
