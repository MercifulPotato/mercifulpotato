It felt like that: intuitive bank app, no fees for most services, checking accounts, a nicely designed debit card (VISA), US-based customer service reps, no brick-and-mortar branches. They lived up to their name in their app and service.  Hopefully, the Simple employees move over to BBVA.<p>[I only used their checking and savings features. I never used eBills, paper checks, etc, which some people weren&#x27;t happy about.  Certain companies also could not transfer money from the Simple checking account, like Robin Hood. However, I still kept the account open because for my limited needs (debit card and savings), the app was great and so was service.]')
