So let&#x27;s say a screwdriver vs an electric screwdriver.<p>&gt; But if Python is objectively better than these other general purpose languages, does that imply that there are areas where Python is not superior to these languages?<p>Yes. There are a lot of areas where Python is inferior. In fact I&#x27;m using Rust right now for a project despite having over 15 years experience with Python. Programming languages are tools and they&#x27;re better or worse suited to different tasks. There is no one language to rule them all - yet anyway.<p>&gt; Would it suggest that folks who&#x27;ve been successful even when choosing Python in those cases objectively made the wrong choice?<p>Yes. That you were successful does not fully validate your decision about choice of programming language. It just means it wasn&#x27;t that bad. It does not mean it was the optimal choice.')
