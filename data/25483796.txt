It will even sync automatically with whatever git repo you store the settings in.<p>No you cannot. Note I was being very precise in my wording. While you can now export your Jetbrains IDE&#x27;s config as a git repo (or zip file) of text files, you still cannot configure the IDE <i>through</i> text files (like in SublimeText) because 1) the text files&#x27; format is not documented anywhere and likely to change in the future without further warning and 2) Jetbrains also <i>writes</i> changes to the git repo automatically. I want to be in control of my config, though. (Sure, I could roll back any changes but I think that&#x27;s very sub-optimal solution.)<p>&gt; This is a problem with relying on the IDE host to also be the host of your applications. Your repo should contain build settings, not your IDE.<p>Well, yes, we do have all our build scripts etc. in our repo but that doesn&#x27;t keep people (myself included) from running and debugging things from within their IDE because it&#x27;s a lot more comfortable.')
