Is it a actual single framework or a standard syntax that compiles to React, vue, .. component syntax? This talks about compiling JSX to bindings avoiding vdom diffing but as far as I know that is near impossible to do due to the variable nature of JSX..?<p>And just a wall of unhighlighted fixed with code is very difficult to compare the differences. And would rather see bundle size comparisons rather than 6 lighthouse screenshots.')
