They want to use a convenient service to do things. To post pictures of themselves, to see what their friends and frenemies are up to, what&#x27;s the new cool thing etc etc. Login should just work, nobody cares what is displayed where, and which site knows what. Normal people (outside the HN) bubble don&#x27;t care about these things, like privacy and what data they share. It doesn&#x27;t get them closer to the things they want to do online, that is post things and consume content.')
