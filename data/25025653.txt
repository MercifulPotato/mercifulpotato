Walls are built by governments, tariffs are protectionist measure. They want neo-mercantilism, which Trump is embodiment of.<p>&gt; but Trump didn’t really DO anything to help them.<p>Oh, he started a big trade war with the gravest enemy stealing their jobs. I think he also imposed more strict immigration policy, but I&#x27;m not sure.<p>&gt; capturing and hoarding all of our productivity gains over the past 40 years<p>I think that&#x27;s wrong. Your productivity gains are mostly due to technology and rise of Asia. Asians and tech companies reaped the productivity gains accordingly. I mean, even eastern europeans like myself saw an extraordinary increase in standards of living.<p>&gt; middle class America is being disenfranchised<p>&gt; I think there should be common ground in wanting to get rid of the part of the government that serves the interests of the wealthy<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s your problem, and I don&#x27;t expect american future to be good.<p>First, I think your political system is broken due to Duverger&#x27;s law. Hence you have a political system where people have to adjust their views according to politicians&#x27; stances, and not vice versa. Lack of competition leads to corruption, regulatory captures etc etc, and I doubt that such system would find a will to reform itself.<p>Second, your wealthy already pay quite a lot of taxes, unlike Europe, where there is regressive VAT and high income tax for the middle class, and middle class is the main fiscal contributor. Hence your politician more concerned about well-being of those who affects budget the most. There is nothing strange here, and this kind of corporatism wouldn&#x27;t heal itself as well.<p>I think that the root of your problem is not malicious rich whom Americans like to demonize so much, but broken beyond repair political system and unfair tax burden: politicians are more free to act as they will facing no pressure and competition, politicians strive to please big biz which is the main contributor to the budget. I&#x27;m really curious how you&#x27;ll deal with that, if you&#x27;ll manage to.')
