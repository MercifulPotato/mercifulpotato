I&#x27;ve also come across similar sentiments as yours, which leads me to think it&#x27;s a proximity to the DC issue.<p>E.g., my RTT to my ISP&#x27;s gateway, on average, fluctuates between 8-11 ms (currently ~14 according to pfSense) and a ping to google&#x27;s closest response is usually about the same. I&#x27;m sure others have it better, but I am quite impressed, given a little bit of this latency would probably be eliminated by not having a virtualized router as is the case with my setup.<p>Twitchy MP shooters and twitchy platformers are the 2 subgenres that aren&#x27;t suited for this arrangement. Most everything else is perfectly fine (under the aforementioned ideal conditions).')
