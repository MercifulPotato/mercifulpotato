It&#x27;s still ink and not oil paints, but it is on canvas.  The result isn&#x27;t glossy like a photo print, but it also doesn&#x27;t show brushstrokes like a real oil painting, although I guess you would still see some if you sent a picture of an oil painting.  They love sending out coupons that make it reasonably affordable.  The canvas comes mounted on an internal wooden frame.<p>You&#x27;ll probably get copyright questions if you submit an professional artwork, but if you can show it is in the public domain they might do it.  I&#x27;ve never tried.')
