For the private companies where I had options, most never worked out as being worth anything so not acting on them was the actual money-saving move. For the public companies, act on them if they&#x27;re worth something <i>when they vest</i> and take the profit over to a mutual fund; I have had some options vest at 2x the current stock price making them useless, so you just play it vesting date by vesting date and hope for some profit on each chunk.')
