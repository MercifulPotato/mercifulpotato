And even then, there are lots of people in many cities and online willing to play just about any system out there.<p>My friends and I still play AD&amp;D (run by a couple of the guys), or OSR systems if run by myself and the other guys. I&#x27;ve <i>played</i> 5e and 4e, but never felt like it was forced on me, because, you know, I own books for other systems and so do my friends. And since I didn&#x27;t enjoy 4e, I just dropped that game. I haven&#x27;t played 5e since the playtest days, but with OSR systems out there that already covered the same terrain, it held no appeal to me or my group.')
