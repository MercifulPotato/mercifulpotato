But to me a one night stand with actual sex is less of a betrayal than months of texting, saying sweet things to each other, and establishing true emotional bonds without any physical element. Sex is something that happens, itâ€™s an activity. Love is an emotion and using her time to love another person emotionally is much worse than a brief sexual act. My two cents.')
