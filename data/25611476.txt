Therefore, you need to already have an F# compiler to build it. That GitHub repo mentions that &quot;You will also need the latest .NET 5 SDK&quot;, which looks like it includes F#. (Presumably, when the language was first written, there existed a compiler written in some other language. However, that compiler is almost certainly not maintained anymore, so it wouldn&#x27;t be able to compile today&#x27;s compiler, which probably uses language features added since then.)')
