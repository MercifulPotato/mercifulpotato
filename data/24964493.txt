I still own few fountain pens now and I love writing with them at home. My current favorite is Muji&#x27;s Aluminum Fountain Pen[1] -- a not-so costly but fantastic fountain pen.<p>I can get used to any of fountain pens pretty quickly, even the worst and the cheapest ones. The advantage of growing up using hand-me downs during school, is that you learn tricks. Here is one, for the bad fountain pens, I slant it to &quot;my angle&quot; of writing and sand it (very gently) against either a very fine stone&#x2F;rock or go a carpenter&#x27;s shed and sand it against their finest sandpaper.<p>I have been trying to teach my daughter to write more, especially with fountain pens but she seems to not like it so much yet. She does like having few around -- perhaps seeing me line up my pens nicely on my table inspires her.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Muji-2724644690738-MUJI-Aluminum-Fountain&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00MDRZLHA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Muji-2724644690738-MUJI-Aluminum-Foun...</a>')
