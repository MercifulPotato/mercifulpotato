Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610363633, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25725185, text='&gt; Can the surname Tong itself signify any sort of association?<p>Not really. Members of a 堂 (Mandarin Pinyin: táng, Cantonese Jyutping: tong⁴) might be of the same family and share a surname, but it would be rather unlikely for that surname to be 堂 as well. There&#x27;s another surname with the same pronunciation — 唐 — which is more common and might actually be Winston Tong&#x27;s surname. Of course he could have left that ambiguous in an oral conversation.')
