Factoring in the population difference, China’s overall GDP (PPP) was almost 4 times that of India. Hardly “roughly equal”.<p>I’m using 1800 as a reference year since it’s easier to find data for it.<p>And GDP (PPP) in 1980 (IMF estimates): [2]<p>China’s GDP (PPP) in 1980: $305K<p>India’s GDP (PPP) in 1980: $381K<p>India’s GDP in 1980 actually surpassed China: 4-5 times growth compared to China! (from 1800 to 1980)<p>This proves the grandparent comment that “IMHO, the root of our previous poverty is arrogance and one man in power (see Mao&#x27;s policy which had led nation wide famine just because he want to surpass US in a short time”.<p>India’s population growth nearly doubles China’s (from 1800 to now) . Not surprising that, on average, more Indians are poorer than Chinese.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualcapitalist.com&#x2F;the-population-race-a-300-year-look-at-china-vs-india&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualcapitalist.com&#x2F;the-population-race-a-300-y...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4-2nqd6-ZXg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4-2nqd6-ZXg</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_GDP_(PPP)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_past_and_...</a>')
