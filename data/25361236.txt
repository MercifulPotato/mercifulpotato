Besides, what are the other options?<p>Europe is in this strange place where collectively account for enormous wealth and power but individually no country is a match to the big boys like USA&#x2F;China when simultaneously are super unoptimised  due to cultural&#x2F;lingual differences.<p>The younger Europeans I met were all very eager to learn English, so who knows, maybe as the UK is out of the EU the English language can become the lingua franca with less resistance as it is no ones language(Well, there are the Irish but it&#x27;s a small country).<p>At the end of the day, those large Eurpoean projects bring a lot of good.
