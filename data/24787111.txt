Youtube&#x27;s ineptitude specifically has been painful to content creators in the past. Censorship of a &quot;public&quot; forum is always immensely painful, and heavy handed attempts by Mega Corporations at controlling public discourse always feel dystopian.<p>The most painful aspect of it all is that I have come to personally agree with these measures, purely as an immediate firefighting response.<p>But this is not a solution. As a society, our mental immune system is weak against disinformation and even the most obvious unscientific propaganda. These traits are even welcomed by the powerful in other contexts, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s such a big deal that the people who started those fires are so closely related to those putting them out right now.')
