I&#x27;m not even a &quot;pro&quot; WhatsApp user: I use it strictly for the one social group that didn&#x27;t think SMS was good enough. Meaning I didn&#x27;t have to know the secret incantation. I&#x27;m sure I was asked about contacts, to which I assume I said &quot;FB? Hahaha, no way!&quot; And if I go to the Status tab, it sho&#x27;nuff complains about me not uploading contacts and if I want status of all my WhatsApp peeps, I need to upload contacts.')
