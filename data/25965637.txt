The production of DNA using E. Coli isn&#x27;t new, but everything else is, including how physically fragile the end result is.  If you shake a thawed out vial of Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech&#x27;s, you&#x27;re directed to throw it out, of Moderna&#x27;s, call them.<p>And I&#x27;d say with the exception of Sanofi&#x2F;GSK&#x27;s complete failure with the elderly, and AZ&#x2F;Oxford&#x27;s mess, we&#x27;re getting about the results we should have expected.  J&amp;J&#x27;s ambitious only one dose is not super good, but not bad, on the other hand it&#x27;s also relatively new technology, which I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;ve ever made in bulk in a hurry. Novavax&#x27;s 89% is quite fine from a protein plus adjuvant vaccine (Sanofi&#x2F;GSK&#x27;s was the same), and uses old technology like Protein Sciences&#x27;, they should be able to make it quickly, and only requires refrigeration.  J&amp;J should be about ready to make a FDA Emergency Use Authorization application, the Phase III US trials for Novavax and J&amp;J&#x27;s two dose 8 weeks apart are still in progress.<p>But, yes, in speed to market mRNA is new technology that&#x27;s very very fast.  Moderna literally developed their vaccine candidate over a weekend, although that was based on a lot of their prior work, and others in SARS like coronavirus vaccines.  Whereas they had their first batch made in weeks, then had to wait a couple of weeks for the results of sterility tests.')
