It&#x27;s broken.<p>When you live with flatmates or family, you&#x27;re getting crazy load time and erratic pauses now because of the contention. \nThere&#x27;s not enough headroom to buffer ahead with the bandwidth use increasing 50% overnight. The video is dropping as soon as somebody else opens something, it&#x27;s effectively broken.<p>The algorithm will see contention and downgrade the quality, only to upgrade it again a minute later when it sees a bit of headroom, only to fail again. There&#x27;s a lesson here on network contention. Worse case is with 2 people browsing youtube, the 2 players are fighting each other for bandwidth.')
