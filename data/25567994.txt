I probably think though that the industry needs to be disrupted, ie. prove that you can monetize at scale without relying on user data. I think this is something very hard to change because the industry and its large customers are actually quite conservative. It is understandable because newspapers are not exactly a fast growing sector.<p>I wish that newspapers at least, etc. would instead consider working out their subscription models a bit more. I like to read stuff from multiple papers but can&#x27;t justify multiple subscriptions for the occasional thing I want to read from them. The Internet opened new ways for people to access news and information but it just feels like the business model of newspapers hearkens back to pre-Internet times where you would buy the paper either at a newsstand or through home delivery.')
