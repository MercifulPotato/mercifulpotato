[…] Our boss Matthias was beyond furious. After that office meeting, he told my colleague “there will be consequences”.<p>Under German law you are not only allowed to talk about your salary with your colleagues, it is expressly illegal for your employer to try and stop you from doing this. I’m surprised a German boss would warn of “consequences” for doing that, and if FSFE had a union I doubt he would have gotten away with it.')
