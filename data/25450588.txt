A car whose catalytic converter has broken and which has engine trouble produces even more.  And diesel produces more than gas.  (Though new vehicles of both types are about equal.)<p>Thus a single badly maintained diesel car can produce as much pollution as thousands of legal new cars.  Smog truly is a situation where a tiny majority of vehicles produce the vast majority of the problem.')
