It&#x27;s been a real eye opener.<p>Yes, it absolutely is locked in, and will never run on anything but AWS. That doesn&#x27;t surprise me. What surprises me is all of the unnecessary complexity. It&#x27;s one big Rube Goldberg contraption, stringing together different AWS products, with a great deal of &quot;tool in search of problem&quot; syndrome for good measure. I am pretty sure that, in at least a few spots, the glue code used to plug into Amazon XYZ amounted to a greater development and maintenance burden than a homegrown module for solving the same problem would have been.<p>NIH syndrome is certainly not any fun. But IH syndrome seems to be no better.')
