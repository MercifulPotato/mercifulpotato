A lot of people may wind up charging at work because that&#x27;s the only place that could really make charging points accessible with no worries. At least 5% of people work third or swingshifts too, so thats a load that has to be compensated for.<p>You also need to worry about fleet vehicles charging, and other uses. So the off-peak capacity isn&#x27;t always possible.')
