Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[25219382], score=None, time=1606344471, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25211819, text='Thank you for these references; it&#x27;s great to see some logical arguments here rather than knee-jerk responses.<p>But I do question how much of some the things you reference are actually <i>problems</i>.<p>We have plenty of fresh water.  Distribution is often our problem when it comes to getting that water to humans everywhere, but stopping livestock production will not fix that.<p>Does it really matter how much of the USA is used for livestock grazing?  Are we missing out on using that land for other things that are important to us?<p>I have no opinion on soybean production, but, again, does it matter that the lion&#x27;s share of soybean production goes toward feeding livestock?  And if soybean cultivation really is that bad for the environment, are there other things we could be feeding livestock that don&#x27;t have such bad effects?<p>The carbon emissions suck, but are there ways to reduce these through better process?<p>I don&#x27;t think any of these problems are unsolvable, but likely they&#x27;re expensive, and there&#x27;s no political will to tax the bad behavior to the point that it becomes financially better to do the right thing.  Getting around that is likely easier than getting a significant chunk of the world to go vegan.<p>And that&#x27;s the issue I have with most logical arguments around veganism.  Meat production and consumption has a lot of problems, certainly, but vegans seem to believe that the only way to fix those problems is to throw the baby out with the bathwater, when there are almost certainly solutions or at least mitigations to those problems.  I get that as an <i>individual</i>, you aren&#x27;t going to fix those problems, so personally going vegan is a way for people to avoid being a part of the problem.  That is a satisfying route for some people, but not for everyone.')
