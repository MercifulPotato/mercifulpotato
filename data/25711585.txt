Item(by='throwaway2021a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610261344, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25710785, text='&gt;I&#x27;m distressed and saddened at how many of the free speech proponents on HN are treating the events of January 6 as if it was just another protest\nIf I&#x27;m honest, maybe I&#x27;m just a little inured to the events of this year? We had events like the CHAZ where groups of armed protesters declared American soil autonomous, numerous people died, and it took authorities <i>a month</i> to shut the protest down.<p>I agree... the events of 1&#x2F;6 &quot;feel&quot; different (certainly the response has been), but I&#x27;m struggling to understand why, and that alights in the skeptic in me. Is it just that one cause is deemed righteous, and the other is deemed not?<p>Just as happy as most to see Donald go, but it&#x27;s hard to not see this reaction formation on behalf of the left &#x2F; big tech as manufactured outrage and advantage seeking.<p>(Genuinely conflicted -- feel free to correct me.)')
