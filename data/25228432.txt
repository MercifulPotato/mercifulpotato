Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606482886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227057, text='As listed by others, popular crossing types in this group (the UK has a set of rules for how this should work and then local government can do paperwork to get something else appropriate if none of the existing designs are suitable)<p>Zebra has striped road markings, with flashing yellow marker lights so that vehicle users have plenty of advance warning of the crossing. Pedestrians have right of way on these crossings at all times, other road users should slow until they can discern whether any pedestrians are trying to cross and if necessary stop.<p>Pelican is an older design, though still used in new crossings in London and some other places. The pedestrians controls are in a box at hand height but the signals are on the far side of the crossing. These trigger road signals in a pattern with an extra flashing amber phase meaning &quot;road vehicles may cross only if there are no pedestrians using the crossing&quot;.<p>Puffin is a replacement for Pelican with two innovations. Firstly the pedestrian signals are with your controls on your side of the road and they&#x27;re placed so that to face towards them you&#x27;re also facing oncoming traffic (this will most often be the right side of the crossing since the British drive on the left, but not in every situation). Secondly there is no flashing amber phase, the Puffin has infrared detectors so it can discern whether pedestrians are still on the crossing and extend the red phase slightly if they are.<p>The Toucan and Pegasus mentioned elsewhere are variants of Puffin rather than Pelican.')
