If you cannot, it&#x27;s likely you&#x27;re just trying to encode your own subjective personal dictatorial preferences into the law, which is contrary to the values of a society that believes in the rule of law.<p>It&#x27;s possible that you just don&#x27;t like McDs, or do like AI. That&#x27;s fine, but trying to shape tax law based on your own personal value judgements is contrary to the ideas of equal application of the law to all members of society.  This is sort of the &quot;I know it when I see it&quot; approach, and it&#x27;s, in my view, a somewhat dishonest way to try to legislate personal morality into the public sphere.')
