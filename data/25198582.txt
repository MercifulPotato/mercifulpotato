Item(by='labcomputer', descendants=None, kids=[25201550], score=None, time=1606227325, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25197241, text='The dirty little secret is that other studies have found that these low-range PHEVs (the three cited above have a useful electric-only range of &lt;10 miles), unlike the Volt, are not often charged by their owners. And, even when they are, the short range means that most miles are driven on dino juice.<p>So, emissions when not charged are <i>extremely relevant.</i>  That’s not editorial bias. It’s reality.<p>The Volt (and Clarity PHEV) are almost in a different class. Their large batteries make them more similar to an i3, and a 5-8 year old Volt has more range than a similarly-aged Leaf (unless the owner was extraordinarily lucky and lived in a cold climate)')
