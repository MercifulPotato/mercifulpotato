I&#x27;ve greatly appreciated how much more civil the conversations tend to be when compared to reddit. I have noticed, however, that news submissions, especially those which do not inherently have a technological aspect to them, tend to digress into what I can only assume are strongly held, but not adequately supported, opinions on the topic.
