Here in Sweden which is also not a euro country the exchange fee is roughly 0.5% at my bank and they charge 3 euro for non-SEPA transactions and 0.15 EUR for SEPA transactions. So I would need to pay 50 EUR to transfer 10k EUR from my SEK account and just 0.15 EUR to transfer from my EUR account.')
