Or with only clone of themselves coworkers.<p>Well considering my assertion is the dev is just fast and producing the same quality as others. Carry on working.<p>&gt; What happens when one of those fast-dev quit?<p>The company would need to replace them or have the team produce less work due to less works?<p>&gt; Final last thought: imagine you are actually a good fast-dev like you describe, and your colleagues are less good, but imagine a case where the whole organization would actually benefit from you slowing down a bit and working on developing better way to work more efficiently with others or making them improve, overall yielding even more business value at the end. This can happen too.<p>This seems like &quot;What if, it is better that you don&#x27;t do the job you were hired for but do a higher job without getting promoted and recognised for your skills?&quot;. Well one, is if a company wants their fast dev to teach others they should make them a coach or something along those lines. Secondly, just because they&#x27;re fast doesn&#x27;t mean they can teach, sometimes the reason they&#x27;re fast is they have less interactions with people and therefore able to continually code without having to stop to talk to Jenny from Admin about how important a bug is (not actually a devs job, there should be product&#x2F;project management for this).Maybe fast dev is fast because they&#x27;ve been there for longer and understand the system, then it&#x27;s just a case of other devs need to ramp up. Lastly, maybe the fast dev doesn&#x27;t want to do this other role and just likes programming.')
