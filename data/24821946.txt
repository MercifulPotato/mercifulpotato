Item(by='FullyFunctional', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603063417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24817218, text='True, but wasn&#x27;t my point with &quot;expensive machinery&quot;.  By that I was referring to<p><pre><code>  * discovering which instructions are executed (tracking  control flow),\n  * mapping x86 code addresses to translated addresses,\n  * discovering the shape of the CFG and finding loops,\n  * purging translations that get invalidated by overwrites (like self-modifying code),\n  * sprinkling the translated code full of guards so we can make assumptions about the original code\n</code></pre>\netc.  All this is unnecessary for WASM and you can in fact make a quick and dirty one-pass translation for the 1st gear.  I don&#x27;t know, but it seems reasonable that they would keep the same FP-&gt;Int semantics as JS, but you rarely do that in non-JS code.<p>EDIT: fail to make bullets, oh well.')
