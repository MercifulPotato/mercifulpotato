I used to always be on reddit, consuming, not really contributing much.<p>Then I realized I spend way to much time, reading, which itself, is not a bad thing, but then I realized the communities of the people who may post in them may not be the best or really useful&#x2F;smartest and then some communities turn into a &quot;selfie&quot; parade to whomever has some small budget can easily swing conversation.<p>Then I stopped going, and missed nothing. Once I realized the people online wouldn&#x27;t be the ones I would normally want to be &quot;seen&quot; with or socialize with, it helped break the distinction and neutrality of a screen with words on it.<p>Now I&#x27;m more careful of whom I read articles from online, and forums, it&#x27;s pretty much hit or miss, good for opinion swaying but any true info I make sure to verify and not rely solely on Google&#x2F;AMP links, but if they are published and which vector of publishing are they on (from New York Times to Dailymail for example.)<p>And even then it isn&#x27;t enough, all news suck and really does not matter to <i>you</i>.<p>Stoicism is best.')
