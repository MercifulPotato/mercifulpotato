Your suggestion is a miniature version of that. If one state sets no min. wage, most factories will be based in this state, and much of unskilled labor will be forced to move to this state as the other states won&#x27;t be competitive because of the higher cost of labor. Isn&#x27;t this similar to the US&#x27; predicament with regards to global labor (like Chinese and Indian factories) being much cheaper, thus many US made products aren&#x27;t competitive on price?')
