It&#x27;s the same reason we add &quot;k&quot; to the word traffic to form words like trafficking; we would interpret the &quot;c&quot; softly (&quot;s&quot; sound) if it was followed by a vowel. But in this case we replace it with &quot;k&quot; instead of adding &quot;k&quot; to maintain the long &quot;i&quot; which would shorten if followed by more than one consonant.<p>Mic (noun only) is great as a truncation of microphone, though.')
