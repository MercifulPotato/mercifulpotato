We can criticise them for their rabid focus on consumers and end-users at the expense of developers and technologists without finding ways to rationalise away anything good Apple does.<p>Attributing the positive aspects of M1 to the ARM micro-architecture is contemporary revisionism. If micro-architecture was the key differentiator, Microsoft Surface RT would have been a runaway success and Qualcomm would have taken over the notebook CPU market by now. Little of what makes the M1 so impressive has anything to do with the ARM instruction set. The impressive parts are things like the entirely in-house GPU and the mild hardware acceleration of Rosetta 2.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that Apple has been deeply involved in ARM since the late 1980s. They were a co-founder of <i>Advanced RISC Machines Ltd.</i> along with Acorn and VLSI. Apple were deeply involved in development of the ARM6 architecture and the Apple Newton was one of the first major commercial applications. So even if you limit your amazement to the ARM architecture, a portion of that credit goes to Apple anyway.')
