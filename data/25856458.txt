They famously used the term ‘tired and emotional’ to mean drunk but that’s banned now too. Yesterday at prime ministers questions Johnson used terms like Captain Hindsight, which many believe should have been dealt with at the time by the Speaker. One who says these rude words by a very low bar is the focus of attention for a minute as the Speaker tells them off and the obligatory apology happens. If you could implement all that I’d have a look in. \nMaybe you were thinking of parliamentary privilege? They can say things in debate that are banned outside for being trade or some state secrets, like the existence of the BT tower.')
