An engineering manager should make sure their team gets things done. It isn&#x27;t enough to &quot;follow along the deliveries&quot;.<p>Sometimes that is things like setting standards and communicating. But it&#x27;s also things like firing underperformers and hiring for open headcount. It&#x27;s making sure you have enough budget and support from other teams to get the job done. Whatever it takes. It isn&#x27;t enough to say &quot;Well, communication was great, I gave the team a lot of support, but we didn&#x27;t make very much progress.&quot;')
