Specifically:<p>&quot;Don’t be naive&quot;: that&#x27;s just talking about storing the UUID wrong. You could design your schema badly and store your integer primary key as a string type too, but the post doesn&#x27;t mention that.<p>&quot;UUIDs are a pain&quot;: so just don&#x27;t memorize primary keys?<p>&quot;Planning for real scaling&quot;: ok, each record uses 16 bytes instead of 8. But their proposed solution, &quot;Best of Both&quot;, uses <i>both</i> 8 and 16 byte records.<p>&quot;Primary keys get around in normalized databases&quot;: finally a real problem.<p>&quot;It’s really hard to sort random numbers&quot;: also potentially a problem—I&#x27;m not familiar enough with clustering so I can&#x27;t offer any thoughts.<p>&quot;My keys will never change (until they do)&quot;: they never explain why they needed to change PKs when migrating DBs')
