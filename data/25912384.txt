Meanwhile, the average HN user probably made somewhere around 200k. I made 1.3 million last year. I know it&#x27;s not a lot because I know people several orders of magnitude richer than myself, but I also know that there are risks worth taking in life, and no one becomes Elon Musk, Ken Griffin, DeepFuckingValue or even myself by calmly working a desk job. You have to have balls to really succeed in life.<p>There&#x27;s an argument to be made that it&#x27;s not worth it, that you are happy enough with your low 6 figure existence, but the sentiment here clearly shows that&#x27;s not the case. The sentiment here shows that people are not happy in their FANG and other engineering jobs, and they are in fact incredibly jealous of Musk, Griffin and the newly rich WSBers, and instead of admit that jealousy, they make up lies claiming that the WSBers aren&#x27;t winning, when it&#x27;s clear as day they are in this moment and big hedge funds are the losers.<p>I&#x27;m not saying WSB will continue to win, I think hedge funds will get their shit together and not get themselves into a GME-like position again in the near future. However, let&#x27;s call a spade a spade while it lasts. DeepFuckingValue and his WSB brigade have scored a HUGE win, many becoming overnight multi-multi millionaires, and instead of bash them, why not celebrate them for a day.')
