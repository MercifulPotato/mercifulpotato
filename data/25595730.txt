All the other problems like showers at work, rampant bike theft even from secure storage behind multiple keyed doors at fancy tech companies, excessive spandex are secondary.<p>Cycling as an activity has gone way upmarket in the last 30 years, as there aren&#x27;t many new people in the sport and the main demographic is wealth older guys who spend obscene money on bikes.<p>The classic case is &quot;Fat bikes&quot;, which were the unexpected success story a few years ago, and took over the industry by storm. All the sudden a ton of guys are getting another $4k bike, and people like me who always bought used aluminum or steel frames for racing (won&#x27;t explode like carbon- have seen this happen multiple times, won&#x27;t cost much to replace). The number of wealthy men in their 50s I know with $20+k of bikes is amazing. Sure, it&#x27;s better than buying a fancy car, but it&#x27;s a change from when I was a kid and most guys just had their commuter bike and road bike.')
