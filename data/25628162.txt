I can&#x27;t ask Siri to show the contents of my directory. I can&#x27;t ask Siri to run anything on the command line at all. These voice assistants just do a number of predefined functions, they don&#x27;t offer 1:1 control of your device the same as traditional inputs. Yeah, that&#x27;s true that most people use a GUI, but the point still stands. You have to remember these distinct workflows to do something readily explained in person. An old person might have to take a computer class because they want to send an email, whereas an intutively designed system would take that persons input, &quot;email jake&quot; and do all the behind the scenes stuff we do ourselves to compose emails for us. An ideal computer is a secretary that can do everything you can think of since you are both versed in the native language. Siri is not a perfect secretary, Siri is like an elevator man only able to press one of the couple dozen buttons on the wall for you.')
