Does anyone else remember these? I remember them being built into the <i>back of the monitor</i> (or maybe just below, on the keyboard chasis), so that when you grasped the laptop in both hands near the natural balance point near the monitor, your right thumb would naturally sit atop the trackball.<p>Suddenly, I&#x27;d love to see a micro-computer that had a joystick on the front right and a chording keyboard on the <i>bottom</i>, with meta-keys on top. So you type with 8 fingers on the back (and one left thumb on top), and perform mouse actions with your right thumb (clickable joystick seems about right for the form-factor).')
