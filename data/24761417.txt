I think during the few times I ever cared to really test myself I hit over 160. Also won my spelling bee every year eligible (4 years) and placed pretty well at states my final year. Never touched a study book or really even cared to compete - parents bribed me to enter. All from MMORPG&#x27;s... Probably not something to be proud about haha.<p>I really think a portion of kids that grew up playing RuneScape got a bit of head up over peers. I know it&#x27;s led to me never having been scammed more than once and starting a successful business at a very young age. Shame what happened to the game, but I guess all good things must die.')
