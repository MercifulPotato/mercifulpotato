People have been able to get cheap engineering labor from India for decades and wages have still been climbing. Businesses choose who they hire for a variety of reasons and price is only a single factor.<p>Additionally, labor has a say in what they&#x27;re paid as well and knowledge of what the average pay is for a given job in their country, region, or city. They can also talk to their fellow employees when they&#x27;re hired and then push for a hire wage when they find out they&#x27;re making less then everyone else doing the same job. Just because someone lives in Wisconsin doesn&#x27;t mean they just accept any offer at a discount simply because HR has a bar chart says they should be paid 35% less then someone else.')
