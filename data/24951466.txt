I was in the business center on the Internet (this was the dark ages before ubiquitous hotel WiFi and personal devices.)<p>Someone comes in, and then a few minutes later says in a completely unmistakable voice<p>“Excuse me, do you know how to print this?”<p>I immediately jumped into parental IT support mode, it was a pretty easy thing to do, he said, Thanks, and (this is the awkward thing) continued to stay in there on the computer while I had to do the whole “pretend to be normal around Sean freaking Connery” for the next 20 minutes. I couldn’t even bring up the courage to mention my childhood favorite, Darby O’Gill and the Little People …<p>PS the reason I was there was to film an episode of Jeopardy, and I told Alex what had transpired (he loves those skits) and he was pretty pumped, he asked if I’d pop him in the mouth and tell him “that’s from Trebek” if I saw him again.<p>RIP Sean Connery, a great actor!')
