Item(by='joe_the_user', descendants=None, kids=[25319218, 25320824], score=None, time=1607208045, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25317896, text='I think the problem with land-value taxes is that objective valuation of raw land value is actually difficult and even arbitrary. If you say a parcel of land is valuable because there&#x27;s a building on it, you wind-up with just a real estate tax. If you value all land the same, people will just abandon ownership of large parcels, probably with paradoxical results.<p>Almost automatically, the assessment of just land has to be harder than the assessment of land plus the property that&#x27;s there. And assessing land for taxes tends to be politically hard. For example, the overall process of real estate taxation in California was politicized into a disastrous mess years ago with proposition 13. Just undo prop 13 would be a simpler matter and even that likely isn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>Further consider, the objective land value of a parcel in Mountain View is probably less than the assessed value a lot of homeowners pay their taxes based on. I&#x27;d be in favor of measures that force more intensives use of that land but taking on home-owners with vast political influence is going to be a challenge.')
