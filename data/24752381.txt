An &quot;x [unit] ago&quot; is much faster for me.<p>The absolute timestamp is probably more handy when I have other dates to compare it to, because I could line them up vertically and visually diff the digits.<p>I think it boils down to the fact that I don&#x27;t have enough working memory to precisely memorize all numbers in a complete timestamp.')
