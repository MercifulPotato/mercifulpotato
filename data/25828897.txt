Where property owners can decide what their property is used for, and utilities are &quot;common carriers&quot;.<p>In this spectrum, Twitter seems more towards private property, while AWS seems more.like a utility.<p>The law hasn&#x27;t caught up to addressing the changes of the last decade in this respect, but I think we&#x27;re about to see it happen, either legislatively or in the courts.')
