It is doubtful that many people would want to do chip level repairs due to the expense.  People may want to replace things like keyboards and screens, which are easier to work with since they are independent modules.  If people started using their devices for longer periods of times, the battery would likely be a candidate.<p>Similarly with design.  People may desire thin and light, but what is the point where no one will care or notice (short of bragging rights based upon advertising literature rather than utility)?<p>It is also worth noting that thin and light does not imply that easy repairs are impossible.  Companies may try to convince people that the interiors of our devices are bursting at the seams with sophisticated electronics, but the reality is that the screen often dictates the size while the internal PCB uses a fraction of that space.  (I have seen thin phones that are screwed together, have user accessible batteries and microSD slots, and even had a snap on panel to hide all of that.  Laptops aren&#x27;t all that different in this respect.)<p>Sure, they may be able to trim half a millimetre here and there by throwing repairability out the window.  On the other hand, it is a high price and less of a trade-off than many will suggest.')
