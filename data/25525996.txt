Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608799694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25523111, text='&gt; Discovery, recommendations and shuffle are at the heart of what made Pandora a thing... it&#x27;s literally what Pandora was built on back when it was purely a seeded radio of sorts. Whereas Spotify more-or-less bolted on these features later in the product life... and it shows.<p>Pandora wants to get rid of those features. All their advertising now is &quot;if you pay for a premium account, you can play whatever music you want, on demand&quot;.<p>This reminds me really strongly of how eBay decided that (1) customers prefer to buy things at a fixed price [completely correct]; so that (2) they should try to prevent people from listing ordinary auctions, because customers don&#x27;t like those. [No!] Instead, the goal was to just be the place where people would go if they wanted to buy something online.<p>Except of course that that completely undermines the concept of eBay. They were an established auction site that <i>intentionally drove auctions away</i>. And then they complained that people preferred to buy things from Amazon.<p>In both cases, it looks like a popular company with an established brand sees a rival that&#x27;s even more popular, and concludes that the only path forward must be to implement features the rival offers <i>while discontinuing or discouraging any features where they&#x27;re doing better than the rival is</i>. How does this make sense?')
