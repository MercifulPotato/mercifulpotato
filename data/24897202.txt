Currently I&#x27;m doing this using hacked together code, but it feels very brittle&#x2F;hacked together.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if there is an &quot;Orchestration system as a service&quot; that can help me solve this. I&#x27;ve looked at things like Airflow, but it still seems too low-level. I&#x27;m looking for the equivalent of something like Algolia, Airflow, etc... i.e. a SaaS product. Kissflow seems interesting, but I&#x27;m hoping to have multiple options that I can evaluate before deciding.')
