A theory is something you can research and come up with a result based upon evidence.<p>Therefore &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is just just wrong. A &quot;conspiracy myth&quot; fits perfectly since it&#x27;s a myth with a conspiracy in it&#x27;s core.<p>So saying that some fascists spread &quot;conspiracy myths&quot; about the holocaust makes sense while it legitimises their bs saying that they spread &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;.')
