If you know that your ISP is doing that, you change to one that is not doing it. It&#x27;s not ubiquitous. Besides that, what makes you think that your DoH provider (if not your ISP) is also not selling that data?<p>You think that DoH&#x2F;DoT is somewhat a replacement for DNSSEC but it&#x27;s not. Both are independent. Doesn&#x27;t matter how much domains have it.')
