Being a constant voltage supply, the load should only draw as much current as needed, and it should work with no problems (which is the usual expectation of 90% of consumer electronics with a USB port). The warning of &quot;only use 1 A charger&quot; notice is suspicious because it may suggest that the product doesn&#x27;t include any internal overcurrent protection by itself (like a $0.1 polyfuse), and solely depends on the current limiting of the USB charger for its safety. While it&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s not inherently wrong, but it&#x27;s certainly a bad design practice.')
