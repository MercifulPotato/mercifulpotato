I&#x27;m pretty sure they were coaching their candidates, but we couldn&#x27;t break away from that agency for some reason (<i>cough</i> kickbacks <i>cough</i>). The answers were suspiciously similar.<p>But I don&#x27;t know how much better I could have described what I wanted:<p>&quot;I want a class for holding a queue of items in memory. The queue will only need to hold a few thousand items, and you don&#x27;t need to worry about persisting it in case of a power failure or anything. The only wrinkle is that when an item is added to a queue it has a priority. Higher priority items need to come out of the queue before lower priority items, but items with the same priority should come out in the order they were inserted.&quot;')
