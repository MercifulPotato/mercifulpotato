I removed the bit you quote because I didn&#x27;t want my comment to come across as an attack or defamation attempt against anyone.<p>I remember EvilDragon - you say he was &quot;transparent&quot;. He was. He was also fundamentally incapable of finishing the project he took on in any reasonable amount of time, despite repeated assurances that everything was going to go swimmingly from now on. In the end of the day, you take up a project, you take forever to realise it, it&#x27;s just a bad result and there&#x27;s nobody else to blame.<p>&quot;The second guy&quot; (Craig Rothwel, according to wikipedia) fucked up in a different way. Clearly, his company took too many preorders without having any hope to ever fulfill them. But that&#x27;s just another nail in the coffin- not an excuse for EvilDragon to fuck up his own part of the project.<p>Sorry, I&#x27;m speaking harsher words than I want to speak. These guys really came across as visionnairies - at least they did to me back then. I was very disappointed by their failures.')
