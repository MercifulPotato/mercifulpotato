This tells us two things:\n1. Petri nets are a calculus of resources. The marking is not telling anymore &quot;what state you are in&quot;. A state is an allocation of resources to each vertex in the net.\n2. Petri nets are concurrent: you don&#x27;t have to move stuff around by walking one edge at a time: Two different hyperedges in two different places of the hypergraph can &quot;act at the same time&quot;, since the &quot;what state you are in&quot; thing makes no sense anymore.<p>Anyway, this paper is pretty complicated and for sure there are waaaaay easier places to start.
