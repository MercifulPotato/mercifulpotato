I think you can get away with knowing the tables for 2, 3, and 7 really well. The rest is just tricks:<p>4: 2x twice<p>5: add a zero and divide by 2<p>6: a 3x followed by a 2x<p>8: 2x three times<p>9: 3x twice<p>Beyond that, itâ€™s repetition of those tricks, plus the distributive property of multiplication over addition.')
