But you&#x27;ll soon be able to get a Zen 3 CPU that&#x27;s just as good.&quot; Which may or may not be true</i><p>Even if it is, I doubt there will be a Zen 3 laptop out that has the screen, keyboard, trackpad, and case quality of the MBAir.  Even if it were <i>slower</i>, literally no one is building machines of that physical quality.<p>Some are attempting to compete, like the Dell XPS, but they&#x27;re still falling short.  They&#x27;re high quality laptops, yes, but people who think they&#x27;re &quot;just as good&quot; need to take a better look at the current MBAir - and this has 0% to do with the chip.  <i>Nobody</i> is making laptops this nice.<p>I&#x27;m actually thinking about picking up an <i>Intel</i> MBAir (the one that <i>just</i> got discontinued) as it&#x27;s likely the single best Linux-able laptop (no longer) on the market, even if it needs to do an opaque, closed-source, online activation each time you wipe the disk (to reactivate the T2).')
