When my mom passed after brain cancer took her memories, she survived for so long with no idea who or where she was that her body dying was a relief and the grieving had mostly occurred a year before.<p>Well, I’ll never finish grieving that loss I guess. I realize all the time that there’s more to grieve. But the shock was certainly not there. The sense of loss wasn’t. That was difficult in itself; to tell people she passed away and not be as sad as people expected. I felt like something must be wrong with me at the time. In retrospect, she had just died much sooner than her body did.<p>It’s an especially strange human experience I think.')
