Support for managing keys varies by board; some, especially older ones, don&#x27;t let you do much, if at all, especially from within Linux.<p>With modern firmware, you can add a self-generated key pretty easily, and it&#x27;s not hard to do secure boot dual boot with Linux (or even macOS if you&#x27;re using OpenCore, I think!). It does require a bit of reading up though. :)')
