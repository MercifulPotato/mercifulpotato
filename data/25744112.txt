Most of my peers brushed it off as dumb, racist white people, but I really wanted to understand.  Especially since I had family who had voted for him who I don&#x27;t consider to be dumb or racist.<p>I&#x27;m from the coast and live in the city.  When taking a road trip through the Midwest, it hit me that people from the rust belt and rural areas had to vote for his message.  Honestly it was depressing to see the decaying factories and poverty stricken areas.  He was giving them hope and was going to fight for them. Anyway, I may be wrong but that&#x27;s just my perspective.<p>Someone posted this video here yesterday with Steve Bannon explaining the populist movement and how Trump came to be president. There are multiple parts and this video is over two hours long but worth the watch. I&#x27;m not normally one to watch a video over half an hour and especially not Steve Bannon, but it&#x27;s quite fascinating to hear this story and perspective.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pm5xxlajTW0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pm5xxlajTW0</a>')
