In the last ten years I have had Macbooks, a Surface tablet, a Surfacebook, and am now on a XPS 13. I found that Microsoft&#x27;s surfaces had great build quality, IMHO on par or better than the Apple laptops. Like the author of the article, though, what did them in was Windows. I switched to an XPS developer edition and have not looked back. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - macos is pretty, but Linux makes coding and data science <i>easy</i>. I also ended up using PopOS, which I found to give an extremely good user experience. Perhaps I am too much of an old school 90&#x27;s Linux guy, but I still find having a single repo system for 99% of my needed software amazing. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get tired of apt-get.')
