The vast majority feel that there is enough evidence to rule it out.<p>I mostly mention this because I don&#x27;t like that fact that popular science magazines (or at least their content that I see posted here!) has a bias towards &quot;new and possibly exciting&quot; or &quot;controversial&quot; research. Which I understand - revolution is more interesting that &quot;physicist reduces error bars by 50%. Big picture unchanged&quot;. But, if all you read is these articles, you will get a very skewed idea of what the consensus is.<p>Just so there is no confusion, modified gravity as an explanation for Dark Energy is very possible, as an explanation for Dark Matter, the consensus is that it is ruled out.<p>Edit: I clarified my point below but will do it here too so everyone see it. I don&#x27;t have a problem with this paper, I&#x27;m glad people are writing papers with alternate explanations to the consensus, that is how science is done. But, your conclusion from reading this article <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be, &quot;ahh damn, I guess MOND is right and LCDM is wrong&quot; and I think that is how pop-sci articles tend to frame these things.')
