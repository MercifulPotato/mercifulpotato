Item(by='jbotz', descendants=None, kids=[24968692, 24968958], score=None, time=1604323513, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24967538, text='I was pretty clear in what I said: Gitea and Gitlab are centralized.<p>Git itself is neither centralized nor decentralized by design, it merely provides an infrastructure for <i>replication</i> and is agnostic about whether or not there is a &quot;center&quot; to the space of replicas.  It depends on how you use it... but in practice the way it is used in nearly all projects is that there is one &quot;main&quot; (authoritative) upstream repo for a project, and that creates a point of centralization unless you put that repo on IPFS.<p>Yes, you could also completely forgo having a &quot;main&quot; repo, but how are the users then to find the &quot;latest version&quot; of your project?  Who are you going to fork from, how do you discover collaborators?  Git does not provide mechanisms for solving these problems; they&#x27;re outside its scope.  But some of the P2P and federated technologies such as IPFS do.  With IPFS you can have a main upstream repo that&#x27;s advertised without there being a host &#x2F; person &#x2F; org that can be hit with a takedown request.  And other federated projects mentioned in this thread address other questions around collaboration that Github (as well as Gitea and Gitlab) address in a centralized fashion.')
