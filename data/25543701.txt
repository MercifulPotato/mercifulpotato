Now I feel like I&#x27;m fully off it and only use it to consult with niche groups that don&#x27;t have dedicated forums.<p>Reddit went from a fine slashdot&#x2F;digg remake to no better than facebook. I know reddit has always been a groupthink upvote downvote machine, but it&#x27;s never been as bad as it is now.
