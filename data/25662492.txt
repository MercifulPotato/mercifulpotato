They paid their way to that exclusive right through TSMC.<p>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll still come out ahead in benchmarks, but the numbers will be much closer once AMD moves to 5nm. You absolutely cannot fairly compare chips from different fab generations.<p>I don&#x27;t see many comments hammering this point home enough... it&#x27;s not like the performance gap is through engineering efforts that are leagues ahead. Certainly some can be attributed to that, and Apple has the resources to poach any talent necessary.')
