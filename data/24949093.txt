Because of the speed of the training, I suspect they are doing feature transfer learning.<p>While the UI is quite nice (thanks to Mike Matas, I am sure), I don&#x27;t see a strong advantage to using this on MacOs, when CreateML is available. CreateML doesn&#x27;t have the simple interface of Lobe, but the UI is quite accessible and gives you access to additional classifies, like sound, text and tabular data. If you need ever more power, you can use TuriCreate if you want to stay in the Apple ecosystem.<p>The simplicity of the UI is a feature, but also a disadvantage when you start having more than a handful of labels and training images. I totally see how Lobe could be a nice intro into the world of labelling and classification.')
