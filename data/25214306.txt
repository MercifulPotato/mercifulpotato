If your AP is set to share access, then as a Comcast customer you get a sort of &#x27;roaming&#x27; access through any other Comcast AP that is also set to share.<p>As I recall, it was turned on by default and opt-out, but you were on your own so far as actually finding an AP you could mooch off of. Guest access is always prioritized below the owner.<p>Also from memory, which may be faulty, out of date, or both: There is some reasonable limit to the total bandwidth you can use as a guest from sharing APs each month (I think it was maybe something like 50GB), and other customers&#x27; guest use of your AP doesn&#x27;t count toward your own data cap.<p>I also vaguely recall some sort of upsell for your account to remove your data limit as a guest, or at least increase it.<p>I would guess that if other ISPs start offering their customers the same sort of setup, the next step would be peering agreements between them.')
