With an MPW, you don&#x27;t get a whole wafer of your chips -- they cut up the wafer and send the chips with your design to you, and the chips with other peoples&#x27; design to the other people.<p>So ordinarily on an MPW if you want WLCSP, you have to pay the fab to run a whole second &quot;boat&quot; of wafers just for you, so those wafers can be run through the packaging process before they are cut up.  This often costs more than the MPW booking does!')
