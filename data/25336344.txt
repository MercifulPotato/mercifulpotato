The linked article here is not actually that interesting, and arguably ruins the image of Tailwind a little.<p>After dealing with a sea of generally pretty junk libraries and patterns for a while now, I know what I like and what I think works well.<p>Tailwind is nice. It provides utility css classes to help you write css faster. Trying to do responsive work in regular css is a pita with media queries - tailwind improves on that dramatically. It’s proper regular css, just like you know and love. With a bunch of classes that let you a) tidy things up so the design is a bit more honoured b) give you utilities for common patterns and c) allow you to be more expressive without having to reach for more clumsy css nesting. It’s just css. Old school css. You can give classes your own names like you always did before.<p>If anything, tailwind is the pendulum swinging back to how things used to be. It’s just being misrepresented here.')
