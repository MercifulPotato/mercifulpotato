I&#x27;m sure a lot of people who knew him thought that and still do. He had a similar story where he got kicked out from his own company. Investors didn&#x27;t like him either.<p>I don&#x27;t think she was deceiving anyone. She had a vision and really wanted it to work. She might have oversold the idea before it had come to fruition and dressed it up (and herself for the matter) to appear appealing to the investors and the public. If you&#x27;ve known any CEO-type person or marketing people, you know that&#x27;s going on.<p>So, why is every other CEO and marketing person &quot;doing their job&quot; and she&#x27;s a fraud? Why did they create a spectacle with documentary and a media trial before anything was proven in the court? Now she has to say things her lawyer recommends to get out of it as easily as possible... and Bloomberg is here to tell us &quot;Do you remember the fraudster? Do you know what she said, ya&#x27;ll?&quot;<p>I mean, it&#x27;s understandable if people don&#x27;t understand how this whole thing works... but it&#x27;s pretty ridiculous what&#x27;s happening to her. I hope this gets sorted well in her favor and she finally gets to tell her side of the story.')
