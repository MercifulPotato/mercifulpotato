Item(by='avisser', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612196982, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25989627, text='&gt; if i borrow a share from you and sell it<p>I think some of the confusion is people talking past each other.<p>I think some people latch onto the whole concept of &quot;borrowing&quot; as the supply inflation. In the housing market, when I buy a house it is OFF the market. There is no &quot;borrow someone&#x27;s house &amp; reintroduce it into the supply and gamble on the direction of the market&quot;.<p>Can you comment on how that interpretation is wrong?')
