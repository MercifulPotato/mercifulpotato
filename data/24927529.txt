Of course when you don&#x27;t have a committee or a CoC however is in charge can still treat people arbitrarily, in fact much more so than when you actually have agreed on conduct and have a process to resolve things.<p>There&#x27;s a good piece called the <i>Tyranny of Structurelessness</i> about radical feminist movements, where wanting to ditch all formal rules actually lead to even worse informal treatment, because officially leaders don&#x27;t even exist, so there&#x27;s nobody to blame.<p>You can look at this case also another way, at least there is an actual committee the author can blame and a CoC that he can argue he wasn&#x27;t treated fairly by.')
