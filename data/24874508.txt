Ethical criticism can&#x27;t be &quot;positive&quot; in some feel-good sense. All you can say if you think X is wrong is &quot;Don&#x27;t do X, please&quot; or &quot;how do you justify X&quot;.<p>Edit: the parent said <i>&quot;I would be more than happy to answer any questions here&quot;</i> and I asked a question. Now, the unstated assumption might have been technical questions about the project. But if we were operating by smart contracts and the overt request was &quot;any questions&quot;, then the system would have to accept the comment. Something to thing about.')
