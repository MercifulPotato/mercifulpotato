I mostly have up days so I can go 10 hours without losing interest a week and a half at a time.  But this comes with the downside of having a handful of days a month where I legit couldn’t churn out a couple hours worth of work no matter how hard I try.  Luckily the places I’ve worked don’t care too much as I can make up for it the next day in one of my super sprints.\nThis isn’t good for my mental health in the long run, probably, but tbh I’d deal with it anyway so I don’t think I could handle a normal 9-5: when I was younger and I worked those types of jobs my down days would be depressing for sure I don’t know how I managed other than maybe it’s gotten worse with age.')
