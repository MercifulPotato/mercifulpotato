And aren&#x27;t some versions of RedHat still on 2.7 too?<p>But I class this as a packaging issue more than a 2.7 vs 3.x issue: you see the same problems with (as a random example...) different versions of OpenCV - people not using virtual environments have problems even if they are all on 3.7.<p>When I think of the &quot;2.x vs 3.x problems&quot; I was thinking more of the language and core libray level incompatibilities.')
