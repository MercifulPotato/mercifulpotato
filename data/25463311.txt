However, they were happy to do a (cheaper) paid trial without it.<p>A service like SuperTokens works well here because its costs and complexity scale with my requirements. Unlike Congnito it is literally free and completely under my control at the start, but there is a reasonable forward migration path that doesn&#x27;t involve a complete auth rewrite going forward.')
