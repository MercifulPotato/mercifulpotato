I don&#x27;t want journalists that I read to avoid the appearance of impropriety, I want them to tell me about the world in ways that I can&#x27;t find out for myself. And I want them to vote.<p>I&#x27;m actually generally disgusted by meeting journalists who claim to not have opinions about the things they report on. I would hope that their opinions would be <i>complex</i>, because when you know enough about most things in the world, you realize that most things are pretty complicated and there generally aren&#x27;t simple answers. But this BS of &quot;I just try to report on what I find out, I don&#x27;t really have an opinion&quot; is, for me, a shorthand for &quot;I&#x27;m too afraid of drawing conclusions about anything, which means I can&#x27;t help my readers to do that either&quot;.')
