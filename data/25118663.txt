Item(by='ReidZB', descendants=None, kids=[25118735], score=None, time=1605570846, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25114577, text='Fun fact, that inscription also contains of the few continuity errors in published Tolkien material. It starts with:<p>&gt; The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria<p>but as the Tolkien Gateway explains:<p>&gt; The name Moria means &quot;Black Chasm&quot; and was a derogatory description of the place which the Dwarves did not like, and was given <i>after</i> Durin&#x27;s Bane took over the city in the Third Age. It is therefore a mystery why that name appears on an inscription made in the Second Age, and made in consent with the Dwarves.<p>The most common &quot;mitigating explanation&quot; I see is that Tolkien, the &quot;translator,&quot; perhaps used the name the reader would be most familiar with (Moria) instead of the city&#x27;s real name (Khazad-d√ªm) when transcribing the door&#x27;s inscription.')
