Item(by='NOGDP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605452778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25101526, text='&gt; Any code which you do not know how to structure within Java&#x27;s type system can be written with some Objects&#x2F;Maps&#x2F;Collections and a bit of runtime logic\nYeah, but that means jumping through hoops because of the lack of the typesystem. And that&#x27;s what many people don&#x27;t like, hence the whole thread. For you that might be fine, but please understand that there are other people out that who are not okay with it so easily.<p>Not jumping through hoops... the point is that you can write untyped code in Java similar to JS with similar complexity. If you really think JS is somehow better in this regard then writing horrible poorly-typed Java is not very different.<p>&gt; Rather the opposite.<p>The opposite as in Java is arguably the most relied-upon language for enterprise-grade backend code, because it lacks 99% of features people would want? Okay.<p>&gt; Every big project that uses reflection&#x2F;introspection or annotations or some kind of code generation tooling shows that the typesystem is not sufficient.<p>Annotations and reflection are a feature of Java, they are not external to the language. Annotation and code generation are separate features from the type system - Rust&#x27;s code generation and annotations are very commonly used. Reflection is equivalent to runtime typechecking that is common in JS. How can you say Java is worse then JS in this regard when the poor parts you point out are basically what JS does?<p>&gt; And then Java does not even have proper sumtypes or union types (enums only work when the structure is identical and I mean... we could count some strange workarounds with static classes and private constructors that pretty much no one uses due to horrible ergonomics). And these literally appear everywhere.<p>First of all JS and Python do not have these either, so saying that Java is somehow worse in this regard is ridiculous. Furthermore the usefulness of sum types is fairly limited - what problem are you trying to solve with sum types in Java? Implementing an Either&lt;A,B&gt; is trivial in Java.<p>&gt; I diagnose that you are suffering from the famous <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?BlubParadox" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?BlubParadox</a><p>I think that applies to you a lot more. You&#x27;re criticising Java for giving you a whole bunch of features which don&#x27;t exist in Python or JS, while also saying the language sucks compared to Python&#x2F;JS because it doesn&#x27;t have features of Haskell. The fact that you think JS is somehow closer to Rust than Java makes me think you have very limited experience with these languages.')
