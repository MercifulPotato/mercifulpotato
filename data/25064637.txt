So it&#x27;d take a lot to fill in those blanks.  What I can say in a more short form is that I started out thinking it was best to be a generalist and work on any software project I could get hired for.  Not sure if I was ignorant, arrogant or maybe a little of both, but that is a quick way to fail.<p>In the end what I found worked best was to specialize in a niche area that is large enough to grow but specific enough you can find ways to stand out. Part of what made us successful over time was we defined our ideal clients, our threshold clients, set up minimum project values, moved away from hourly billing, and focused as &quot;generalist&quot; within the niche.  The final key for us was we were selling our services to bring a product to market, not only write source code for a project.  There is a huge difference in value to clients and profit to the company.<p>Happy to be more specific if there is something I can share my experience from that might be more helpful even if it was a failure for me.  FWIW -- my primary niche areas when I exited consulting was marketing automation and distributed systems to solve large data problems (ecommerce, healthcare, ads and direct marketing were the &quot;industries&quot; we played in).')
