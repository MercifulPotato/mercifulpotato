It&#x27;s a simple, beautiful desktop app for organizing and sharing reusable code. It&#x27;s been in early access mode for a while now, with just a handful of users, but now it&#x27;s open for all.<p>Here is the backstory:<p>Initially, I built it as a Slack app with DarkLang, which I wrote about in detail here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@tair&#x2F;snipy-built-with-dark-no-code-no-servers-no-deploys-e5b02c961723" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@tair&#x2F;snipy-built-with-dark-no-code-no-se...</a> (whoa, been almost exactly a year ago ;)<p>But that solution ended up being rather limiting in terms of functionality I wanted to get out of it, usability, and complexity on the backend.<p>So, during the lockdown, I started from scratch with Electron, React, NextJS, GraphQL, and good olâ€™ Rails stack in the backend. I have got a full-time job and a family, so I could only work on it for a few hours a week.<p>I have a bunch of ideas of what to work on next: tighter VSCode integration, bringing back my Slack app, and of course, adding support for Windows &amp; Linux as my first priority (sorry it&#x27;s only available for Mac users now).<p>Though, I&#x27;d really love to hear what you think I should be working on next?')
