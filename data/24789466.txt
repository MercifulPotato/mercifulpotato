The physical &quot;factory reset&quot; button doesn&#x27;t seem to work anymore, but it&#x27;s in a ready-to-be-configured default state (I got it there by connecting it to a network via Ethernet).  It would need the old version of Airport Utility, but I&#x27;m assuming your dad knows that already, if he&#x27;s looking for the old ones.<p>If he&#x27;s interested, please let me know.')
