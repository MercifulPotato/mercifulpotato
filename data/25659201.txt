Item(by='dandelion_lover', descendants=None, kids=[25659505], score=None, time=1609950717, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25658821, text='&gt; That may be counterintuitive, but it&#x27;s a mis-extrapolation from the fact that being poor really sucks.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is so simple. Consider a totalitarian country. The people in the government have no skills which would help them achieve anything in a democratic country, but they are loyal to their leader and therefore are paid very well and do whatever they want. In a world without a meaning, such people chose the best path, because nothing else would make them (and their families) live so well. The oppressed people are suffering and revolting, but the police is also paid well and keeps them from changing the political situation.<p>In a world without a meaning, the best strategy here would be to join the oppressive government and get the profit, but some people still choose to revolt, even endangering their own lives. Are they stupid? (This is of course just one example of many similar ones).<p>&gt;  All I can offer is to note that you haven&#x27;t given up already and therefore have some intution that there is some emotional state you might look for -- even though I assert that &quot;meaning&quot; isn&#x27;t actually it.<p>Actually, I believe in the meaning of life, see my other post here. I cannot imagine why I would struggle through life otherwise...')
