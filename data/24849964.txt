If Google uses Android to cement Chrome&#x27;s as the only browser engine, consumers are harmed because they lose access to potential competing browsers that might e.g. respect privacy more. And the fact that iOS exists doesn&#x27;t much help because they&#x27;re even worse -- Chrome is the default on Android but at least you can install real Firefox, whereas on iOS they&#x27;re all skins over Safari. So a third party has nowhere to take hold.')
