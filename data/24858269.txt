General anesthesia as being completely unresponsive to external stimuli and potentially needing supportive measures to make sure you maintain your airway.<p>What they tend to do is &quot;conscious sedation&quot;.  Basically load you up with a sedative and painkiller - midazolam and fentanyl as an example.  You&#x27;re not completely out of it, you can breath on your own and will show some response to stimuli.  But you won&#x27;t remember any of it due to the amnesia from the sedative.')
