The DOJ has opened hundreds of investigations, arrested or put out warrants for dozens of people, and are still gathering evidence.<p>There is little doubt that some of the MAGAs intended to harm or kill civilians in the Capitol building, including the Vice President. They repeatedly said so on tape, shouted it to the public, bragged about it to each-other, etc.<p>Whether some groups of them constituted &quot;kill squads&quot; per se (whatever that means precisely) has not yet been proven out.<p>&gt; <i>you see nothing wrong with setting fires at a federal courthouses</i><p>Nobody said that. Literally every comment you make moves the goalposts and makes unfounded accusations, and you seem fundamentally incapable of admitting repeated misstatements.<p>I just said that &quot;starting a fire inside the fence&quot; is categorically different from your previous characterization that they &quot;set the building on fire&quot;.<p>To be honest this conversation is going nowhere. I recommend you find some other interlocutor if you want to keep going.')
