The 4850&#x2F;4870 launch left me with trauma. I&#x27;ve mainly used my cards on Windows. Since I&#x27;ve been using my 980 Ti and 2070 Super - I&#x27;ve not really had any issues with Nvidia. I&#x27;ll get a 3080 instead of a 6800 XT - presuming supply is available. I&#x27;m super hesitant to go back to AMD. Been burned too many times!')
