If there were only a handful of such people then they would all get infected relatively quickly and stop contributing to overall spread. And that may be the case in localized outbreaks, but I see their role overall as &quot;seeding&quot; individual hot spots. In other words, people who disregard basic social distancing protocols may not spread COIVD until it actually becomes prevalent in their local area. And when that happens they become the super-spreaders which cause new local outbreaks to fire up.')
