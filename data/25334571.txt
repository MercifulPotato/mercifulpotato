However the basic infrastructure and problems with SF are well known and have been documented.<p>I can&#x27;t see at this point how the former plusses of SF outweigh the latter negatives and frankly I see no inherent plusses to the Valley.<p>It seems that people (technologists mostly) literally only value the valley because of technology companies and even more pointedly - because that&#x27;s where the big VC money lives.')
