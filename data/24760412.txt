For the most part we are talking about a bunch of people ages 22-30 that function by responding to specific feature requests or JIRA tickets from their team leads. There are of course exceptions, but by and large this population of engineers do not do well with unstructured environments, such as the type created by a sudden shift to WFH. I am wholly unsurprised that productivity at Goog has dropped. At my large tech company (where we work with consultants from FAANG) there&#x27;s also a similar drop in productivity due to aforementioned lack of structure.<p>&gt;10 years remote and I couldn&#x27;t get in at Googs.<p>FAANG interviewing has very little to do with skill level and a lot more to do with mastering the very specific interview process of that particular FAANG. It&#x27;s a lot like taking the LSAT. You could be a genius but still not ace the LSAT because you don&#x27;t know the very specific strategies needed for the test. On the flip side, just because you ace the LSAT doesn&#x27;t mean you are a savant, it just means you studied the specific things necessary to ace the test.')
