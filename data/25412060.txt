Is &#x27;falls&#x27; related to &#x27;falsch&#x27; at all? The English &#x27;falls&#x27; is used quite differently, though you can start to see the relationship. For example something like &quot;this falls somewhere between the two&quot;.<p>Language is fascinating! I love learning about how the colloquial meanings of certain cognates between languages sometimes have rather different meanings, especially between German and English since English is a Germanic language. It illuminates the interesting path some of my everyday words evolved from, and it&#x27;s often rather different than one might guess.')
