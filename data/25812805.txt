Batteries get hot when charging due to inefficiency, meaning it takes more than 90Wh to charge a 90Wh battery. Subtract the power demand while in use and your well over an hour to fully charge.<p>By comparison a quick charge to 80% in under 20 minutes while under full load should be possible assuming sufficient cooling and power.  That’s not a huge deal most of the time, but it’s still plenty useful if your sharing a single outlet etc.')
