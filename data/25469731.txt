There are some businesses (small or big) preying on uninformed people. This is the part facebook and google were pushing to advertisers for years.<p>Hypothetical scenario, imagine you want to sell &quot;overpriced&quot; bike jackets, auto targeting will give you women&#x2F;men whose spouse has bike but they don&#x27;t own bike, on xmas time. Cause they are buying as gift, and have no idea what actually it costs, they will have very good ROI for your ads.<p>Also this is only for their ad network parts, (basically ads you see on other applications), on facebook or google properties you still have same kind of targeting (as they are first party)<p>On overall this is very pro-consumer.')
