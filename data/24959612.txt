Most people are far more likely to have a productive discussion when at least one party goes out of their way to be nuanced and careful in how they word things as well as the discussion not taking place in a performative environment (online or in front of other people.) It is definitely a lesson I have learned over time and through my own biases and misbehavior causing myself unneeded problems that were&#x2F;are quiet foolish in hindsight.<p>With that said, all of these topics are not worth getting too into, since even 100% agreement on HBD or esoteric human rights philosophy topics doesn&#x27;t really accomplish much. I have arrived at a sort of internal understanding that it doesn&#x27;t matter if most people would disagree with me on this stuff. Also, if I find the common perspective to be ridiculous or stupid that doesn&#x27;t really matter or entitle me to pressing the issue when it doesn&#x27;t matter. What genuinely matters is finding common humanity&#x2F;shared goals that are mutually beneficial and not getting bent out of shape over stuff that doesn&#x27;t really matter, which in this case is trivia pertaining to generalized (which is practically useless individually) racial outcomes. Hopefully I&#x27;ve explained myself clearly and shown that I don&#x27;t have any ill will intended towards you or anybody who has different opinions or may even hate or take offense at how I see the world. Have a nice Sunday :)')
