Their conclusion is just looking back and assuming future is same as before, with little to no reasining.<p>What very high valuations mean is lower ROI in the future, only that. I&#x27;m 99% certain that Total Return (TR) from stock markets 2010-2020 &gt;&gt; 2021-2030. SP500 TR is 13.97% annualized for last 10 years (price return 11.64%). I&#x27;m  surprised if it&#x27;s above 5% annualized for next 10 years.<p>That does not necessarily mean rapid decline in valuations (as bursting or crash). It can be stagnated stock market. It can be market boom that continues next 5 years and then fall back little above 2020 levels.')
