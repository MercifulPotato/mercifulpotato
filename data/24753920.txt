Or you pick up a domestic abuser and take them to jail to get them away from their victim while collecting evidence and statements...<p>Those are all people that are presumed innocent under the law...  They may spend only minutes or hours in jail as police gather and verify their information... Run their prints to see if their given name is false and their a criminal with a warrant for their arrest... Etc....<p>So the commenter saying the stats might be misleading is very accurate ... Jails have revolving doors, and that&#x27;s probably a good thing. It would also be a good thing to eliminate cash bond, without changing jails otherwise -- because jails serve a very real and practical benefit to society for less-than-a-day holding off individuals while their identity is verified and their information&#x2F;case is reviewed to determine if a bond of any kind will be even offered.')
