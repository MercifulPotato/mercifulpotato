I purchased a Razer Blade Stealth 13 and put Linux Mint on it end of 2019. I have been really pleased with the entire thing. I don&#x27;t do anything crazy (web browsing, simple budget spreadsheets, watching videos, viewing family photos) and it works perfectly. I was an avid mac user for many years because of bash&#x2F;BSD but the march toward locked-down hardware and software really pushed me away. The only thing I miss are the glass trackpads and the fantastic gesture support.')
