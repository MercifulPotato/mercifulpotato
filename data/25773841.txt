This attitude pisses me off to no end because it forces everyone into the subservient employee rut. I don&#x27;t trust or want to rely on the government and pensions especially. Higher education and healthcare I like but at a primary and secondary school level they force you to go to school but the schooling they provide is not at an acceptable level. I would never pay for it if it wasn&#x27;t free. Everything in Europe is designed around keeping the wealthy wealthy and the proles under the thumb. It&#x27;s a deadend road.  I support your right to choose this path but I don&#x27;t agree it should come at the expense of the intellectually curious and entrepreneurial types.')
