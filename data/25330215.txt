I&#x27;m not sure that I understand exactly what you think I&#x27;m right about or why that requires you to gently explain it as a good thing. But thank you?<p>I don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s anything fundamentally objectionable about generating music algorithmically. It just tends to be disappointing and not as engaging as more traditional forms of composition at this moment in time. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be really exciting once it matures.<p>I like Brian Eno&#x27;s idea of records someday being programs that you purchase instead of recordings that are frozen in time. Something that you can play and hear a different version every time that it generates. In theory that sounds really lovely.<p>Sometimes I do think of music as something mechanical, or procedural. A lot of artists do stuff like this with pleasing results. Steve Reich&#x27;s &#x27;Come Out&#x27;, &#x27;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&#x27;, or &#x27;Clapping Music&#x27; are prominent examples for me. Granted, those three pieces probably resonate more with the academically and musically nerdy types, but they&#x27;re powerful if you keep an open mind going in and submit to it.<p>But right now I think the most compelling generated stuff still has an element of human input to steer it&#x27;s development and isn&#x27;t quite ready to run on it&#x27;s own.<p>I think some of the most interesting stuff today is music that&#x27;s composed by hand but borrows the affect of procedural music. Stuff like minimal techno that evolves very slowly. I&#x27;m particularly fond of the work of Ricardo Villalobos:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OZWdWzMdndc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OZWdWzMdndc</a>')
