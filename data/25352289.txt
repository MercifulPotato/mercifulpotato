Regarding ear wax, I have a friend who is a musician. Since he was frequenting loud rehearsals his hearing begun to deteriorate but it was so gradual that it took him a while to realize he was loosing his hearing somewhat so he decided to got to an ENT. The ENT removed a large ball of wax from each one of his ears and his hearing went back to normal after that. It is possible that the ear wax was building up to protect his hearing from the loud environment he was in.')
