But it doesn&#x27;t need them, I think, because it does not send email, it prints an email from a template and a mailing list, then uses mailto[1] to send that to your email client, and you send the templated email from your regular mail client.<p>Mailto is an protocol like (tel or sms) that invokes a secondary application to send the mail. The way this works depends on how your machine is set up.<p>For example, on mine it will open my GMail. Before I let GMail handle mailto, it would open my Outlook.<p>What mail2merge does is take an email template, and a mailing list, and create a mailto link for each one in turn. In order to send that email you need to click the &quot;Do Next Mailto&quot; button, which will open your mail client with the email ready to send. You then need to click send in your email client to send the mail.<p>I don&#x27;t know what features Outlook, or GMail, (or any of the other mail clients that you can hook up to mailto), have to prevent spam but presumably they have some. I feel a little scared to say, &quot;the responsibility for spam is with the mail clients, and senders&quot;, (because I know how spam is a painful topic and also there&#x27;s plenty I don&#x27;t know about how span and email works), but that&#x27;s how I think about it in this case.<p>I created this because... I wanted a simple way to send mails from a list, without the complexity and rigmarole of the different mail merge providers. I tried a few GMail add-ons, browser extensions, and &quot;list managers&quot;, but they were all too complex. Personally, I also kind of like that I get a &quot;final say&quot; on each mail.<p>It might be an issue if your list has 20,000 people, but then I guess you can split it and get a couple of people doing it for you.<p>A slower mail merger, for a more civilized age.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mailto" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mailto</a>')
