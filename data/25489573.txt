The sad fact is that the market process is actively interfered with by the political process.<p>The history of the US and Canada is one where well-meaning individuals have been duped into giving powers to politicians who in turn create &quot;reasonable&quot; regulations that have the effect of protecting select firms from the market process.  And when the costs of these anti-competitive regulations emerge (higher prices, worse service), those same well-meaning individuals demand those same politicians to &quot;fix&quot; things, but only in ways that further entrench those monopolies rather than removing the source of their monopoly power at the root.<p>Plus ça change, plus c&#x27;est la même chose.')
