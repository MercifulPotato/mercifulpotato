Item(by='TheCabin', descendants=None, kids=[25493458], score=None, time=1608543867, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25488887, text='Very interesting article, thanks for sharing the information.<p>FWIW, I used to be very happy with the Gnome environment but 2 recent (nautilus related) changes frustrate me incredibly:<p>* Copy &#x2F; paste file paths from nautilus to terminal is broken. (You get this extra meta information in the path starting with `x-special&#x2F;nautilus-clipboard`)<p>* Type ahead is gone. Previously you could type the first letters of a file &#x2F; folder and select it this way. Now typing automatically triggers a search (equivalent to ctrl+f), which is much slower.<p>These might be minor things but I hit them so often that I was driven away from Gnome.')
