I put a down payment on this place, paid for equipment and upgrades and have to pay property taxes, utilities and mortgage. If nothing happens there, I lose money out of my own pocket. I intend for it to be a music venue. I meet the definition of a music venue owner.<p>Some musicians have contacted me and would like to have a concert there.<p>Should anyone pay anyone? Who should pay whom?<p>How is this for logic: &quot;A house isn&#x27;t a home without a family! If you want me to move into this house with my wife and three kids to make it a home, you&#x27;re gonna have to pay me!&quot;')
