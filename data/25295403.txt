Most planes only get cursory garbage removal between flights. Thats it! They are only cleaned every 24 - 48 hours. But a plane might make 4-12 flights between cleanings, and even these cleanings aren&#x27;t serious. They do a vacuum and spray sanitizer on main surfaces, but that&#x27;s it.<p>In fact one of the reasons that diseases spread so much on planes is not because of people on your flight or the re-circulated air as most people assume. But often disease spreads from people that sat where you are sitting on a flight 1-3 flights ago.<p>And of course allergenic have similar characteristics to viruses and bacteria. So they follow the same pattern.')
