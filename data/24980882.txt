I depend on one being there.  However as I already said charge at home means refueling places become uneconomical and  they out out of business meaning that even though it isn&#x27;t hard to put a charging station anywhere that doesn&#x27;t mean they will exist.<p>Of course what I&#x27;m lacking is knowing how much this will affect things long term.  Right no charging stations are being installed on hope they are worth it, if this turns out to be false owners will start to tear them out.')
