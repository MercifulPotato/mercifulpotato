There are so many details to deal with that should never bother you under normal circumstances (the core problem of using Rust where it&#x27;s not necessary). It&#x27;s admirable that you have such an easy time with it. However, for most people, using Rust for these purposes is absolutely not recommended.<p>Java&#x2F;Kotlin paired with reactive streams makes these tasks super easy to read, once you get the hang of reactive streams. Also there are complexities in there, you just simply can&#x27;t brush all the intricacies of network programming and multi-threading under the rug, but at least you are dealing only with the complexities that are necessary for your problem.<p>With Rust you are dealing with tons of additional complexity that doesn&#x27;t matter to 99% of people &amp; problems. I love that Rust exists and it has its uses (browsers, hypervisors, drivers, kernels, etc). I just find it very alienating when people compare this to Python and do everyday tasks with it.<p>No, you really don&#x27;t want to deal with borrowing, memory management and life-times, unless it is part of the problem you are trying to solve (and there aren&#x27;t too many for which that applies).')
