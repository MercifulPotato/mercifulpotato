And reCAPTCHA is usable without being logged into Google’s identity system. The profiles it builds are clearly not associated with Google’s primary identity database, and its trivial if you don’t need to preserve identity to one-way hash every piece of data that GDPR considers user-identifying at the entry point to the system and store only the hash. The EU isn’t shy about handing out billion-dollar fines to Google, so while Google can match a user to a stored profile there’s no reason to suspect that Google has a way to reverse that mapping.')
