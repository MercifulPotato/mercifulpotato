Most of the cost is bandwidth, but it&#x27;s worth more to me to keep everything in one place and not have to worry about learning another PaaS system. From the other offerings I&#x27;ve seen, Azure is usually only more expensive at the most lowest of tiers. Once you start scaling up, the other vendors get just as expensive. So I&#x27;m fine with shelling out a few more bucks here and there to avoid having to use something else.')
