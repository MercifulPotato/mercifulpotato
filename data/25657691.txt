In the browser JS is good enough. On the server Docker + your typical Linux program is “good enough”. In time things like KVM will offer great sandboxing to containers.<p>Another issue is that server side programs depend on system interfaces of Linux, which are battle tested, observable and trusted. With WASM you need to replicate that with some message passing system.')
