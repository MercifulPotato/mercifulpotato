And since we&#x27;re in January, early enough for new year resolutions to still be kept, here&#x27;s my first project.<p>Smigster[1] lets you type a few words and composites them onto a random royalty-free photo in an attempt to match the contents of the text to the photo. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.<p>It uses compromise[2] to extract topics, nouns, etc. from the text and runs a search on Unspash[3] based on a random term to get a photo. It&#x27;s a toy more than anything else, but it&#x27;s been incredibly valuable for me to go through this process.<p>I hope you enjoy it, and if you have any feedback, comments, or feature requests, I&#x27;d love to hear about it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smigster.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smigster.com</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;spencermountain&#x2F;compromise" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;spencermountain&#x2F;compromise</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unsplash.com&#x2F;developers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unsplash.com&#x2F;developers</a>')
