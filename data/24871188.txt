In the last 4 years, I&#x27;ve heard the following sentiment often: &quot;I don&#x27;t like the guy and his rhetoric, but at least Trump has caused fewer deaths in international conflicts than Obama did&quot; (and with a belief that Hilary would have been worse on this metric). I do not know how true this claim is, and it&#x27;s hard to get concrete numbers, but a concern over foreign policy is usually much greater amongst 3rd party voters than for Democrats and Republicans.<p>Don&#x27;t assume everyone who didn&#x27;t vote for Hilary shares your perspective, and rhetoric like yours continues to alienate independent voters.')
