And most missions support a huge variety of outcomes depending on decisions you made earlier and how you behave.<p>I&#x27;m about 15 hours into a second playthrough and this is just patently not true.  There isn&#x27;t much variety in character building outside of combat mechanics, you pretty much always play the same V as far as narrative and dialogue goes.  I was doing a second playthrough just to see how different things could be and intentionally looked for dialogue I hadn&#x27;t seen the first time, my experience was that it showed how on-rails 99% of the experience is.  At this point, I&#x27;ll pick it up again in a year or two when they&#x27;ve added some content and hopefully fleshed out the open world somewhat.<p>&gt;I see people going on a murder rampage in cyberpunk and then complain that the police chase that spawns isn&#x27;t sufficiently realistic. Like......I don&#x27;t feel like that&#x27;s how this game should be played<p>I mean, then why are you able to go on a murder rampage and get in a police chase?  It&#x27;s just a basic level of competence that the game doesn&#x27;t have.  Park your car in the street and come back after the mission to find a huge traffic jam because the AI is incapable of driving around your car.  Accidentally hit a civilian during a shootout with the local gang? Cops will just spawn 10 ft away from you and continue spawning until you die unless you get in your car and drive for 15 seconds.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re lucky and the way you play doesn&#x27;t expose you to a lot of the things people are complaining about but it seems kind of silly to dismiss complaints of game mechanics as &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong&quot;.')
