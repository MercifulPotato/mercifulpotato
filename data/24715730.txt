I need to go get some sleep, but very briefly:<p>I would say that the focus on race is a real problem over there - there&#x27;s discrimination, hate, taboo topics and excessive PC, affirmative action, it&#x27;s a political talking point, you have to identify as one of a few races in all kinds of forms (which is ridiculous - is a Portuguese person white or hispanic? What if they are black or mixed?)... The list goes on.<p>Minorities are generally of a lower socioeconomic status than the majority. People of a lower socioeconomic status are less likely to get a proper education (particularly in the US where university is super expensive). People without an education don&#x27;t get white collar jobs, and thus have more trouble moving up the societal ladder. Therefore, there&#x27;s less role models. I think you see where I&#x27;m getting at - it&#x27;s a vicious cycle and I think ensuring everyone has access to proper education should be one of your top priorities.<p>Real racism is also a problem there, of course. But I fear that quotas will not help with that and just compound the problem instead.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll blog about this stuff one day.')
