Uses less memory, yes, but it&#x27;s about the same speed in real world applications.  I also would not call it a system language since it doesn&#x27;t give you fine grained control over memory like rust, C or C++ give you, which is necessary to build an OS or anything with some sort of time guarantees, like audio drivers.<p>Also the guy is showing his lack of experience with a bunch of these languages, and doesn&#x27;t talk about build speed or how IDEs &amp; indexers handle large code bases or how well build speed scales.  It&#x27;s an infamous problem with haskell for example and he doesn&#x27;t mention it once.')
