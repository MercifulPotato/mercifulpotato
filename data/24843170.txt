It’s of course easier to work with than C++ but not the panacea that seems to be implied in a lot of the comments.<p>In terms of deployment, you essentially have to have Julia installed wherever you want to run, which frequently ok, and if not there’s always PackageCompiler except it’s not that easy to get a working  shared lib.<p>There are other things I find complex but probably because I’ve used Python too long so Julia is different etc. I think Julia is a great choice for HPC generally except for challenging SIMD codes where it’s hard to vectorize without an explicit ILP model.')
