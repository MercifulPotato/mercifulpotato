For example, a d100 can be composed from two 10-sided dice, both read from 1 to 0, side-by-side, the first being the &quot;tens&quot; and the second the &quot;ones&quot;. e.g. &quot;3&quot; and &quot;4&quot; reads as &quot;34&quot;, &quot;0&quot; and &quot;5&quot; reads as &quot;5&quot; etc. Two &quot;0&quot;s read as &quot;100&quot; so the range of the composite die is 01 to 100. Alternatively, the dice can be read from 0 to 9, yielding a range from 00 to 99. More ten-siders can be added for higher base-10&#x27;s, for example 6 ten-siders can be read as a number from 000001 to 000000 = 100,000.<p>The problem with that of course is that polyhedral dice are normally made for gaming and are not, shall we say, entirely fair. I remember someone making an exhaustive evaluation with a machine made with Legos (obviously) and there was a lot of bias especially for some brands of polyhdrals than others.<p>Edit: One can also generate numbers in, e.g., base-16, etc. in a similar way, composing a d10 and a d6, although this is more cumbersome because each digit now needs two die rolls. I think it&#x27;s possible to find actual 16-siders though.')
