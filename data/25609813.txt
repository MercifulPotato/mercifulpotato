My main profession is a dentist and I worked with various 3D and CAD&#x2F;CAM system. I have intra-oral scanner that would capture 3D-colour model inside your mouth. The sad thing is the entire system is a walled garden. It uses its own 3D format (.dxd) and would only offer STL as an export format, which doesnâ€™t contain any colors information. \nI worked around this by first exporting to a 3D PDF file. Then I use Sumatra PDF [1] to MANUALLY extract the 3D model in u3d format. \nU3D is a very obsolete format that almost no 3D authoring program can read it. So I have to use (yet another) proprietary software [2] to convert it to a common 3D format like PLY or 3DS or even to WebGL [3].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sumatrapdfreader.org&#x2F;free-pdf-reader.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sumatrapdfreader.org&#x2F;free-pdf-reader.html</a>\n[2]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.finalmesh.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.finalmesh.com&#x2F;</a>\n[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;khoadabest.surge.sh" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;khoadabest.surge.sh</a>')
