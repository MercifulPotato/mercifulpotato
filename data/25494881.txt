MS&#x27;s fortunes are tied to Intel and Qualcomm for the time being, both of whom are falling behind on performance and performance&#x2F;watt, so they need to do something to remain competitive.<p>What would throw the world for a loop would be if MS secured an x86 license from Intel and developed their own chip with the performance&#x2F;watt of the M1.')
