Don&#x27;t distort.<p>2. Don&#x27;t otherwise hurt the user (there were cases of earbuds and over-the-ear headphones where the maximum volume would damage the wearer&#x27;s eardrums, for example).<p>3. Easily and reliably connect them to the desired device.<p>4. High quality enough that the product lasts years.<p>5. Trusted by users that 1-4 apply.<p>Most audio brands are obscure for the average user. If I ask someone random on the street about Sennheiser they won&#x27;t know about the brand.')
