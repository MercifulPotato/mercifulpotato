There’s no “cost”, it’s just a shift in market, the wage may go up a bit but business would also adapt, either by being more efficient or shifting budget, etc.<p>I’m not really putting together where your questions are leading. They don’t feel like they have a coherent point, and they don’t seem to be pointing in any way.<p>This is an incremental improvement, one that absolutely will reduce H1B which is a good thing for Americans. There’s no shortage of Americans able to take these jobs, and if there is ever at times, the increased demand will solve itself - companies will raise wages, Americans will respond to higher wages by filling the jobs, America will grow stronger with more white collar jobs going to our own citizens.<p>And it will help win elections because it’s what citizens want, are you claiming any other way it helps win? It’s a popular policy and this is an effective change to it, if it wasn’t effective I doubt you’d be arguing about all these downstream effects you’re worried it will cause - you can’t say it won’t be effective but also it will be effective in a negative way. Tell me how raising wage requirements + requiring higher education does anything <i>but</i> lowering H1B usage and force companies to only get more qualified people on the visa. Win win.')
