There has been no downwards housing price &quot;correction&quot; since the early 90s. The 2008 bubble-pop never happened here. Interest rates remain at record lows and the COVID-19 crisis seems to have led to massive _increase_ in housing prices rather than a decrease. It&#x27;s a huge distorted market with real estate, construction, and renovations etc. being the largest part of our Ontario provincial economy with primary industry, etc. declining every year. It all feels just insane.<p>My little hobby farm has probably &quot;doubled&quot; in the 8.5 years I&#x27;ve owned it, but I don&#x27;t feel great about it -- where will my kids live? Where will I retire to? When will this all blow up in our faces? My 70 year old father in law would love to retire, and sell his place and somehow reduce his costs and move closer to us... but my area has become completely unaffordable as Toronto money is suddenly blowing up the market out here with bidding wars and no-conditions offers and the like, stuff we never saw before.<p>So yeah in that context I can&#x27;t even imagine being working class and trying to make a go of it. It was bad before, but it is only getting worse. Rents are absolutely mental even in outlying areas that should be cheap.<p>And most importantly given that these outlying areas around Toronto (Hamilton, Oshawa, London, Cambridge, Woodstock etc.) are often where the few remaining manufacturing sector jobs are, what happens to the manufacturing sector when their employees can no longer afford housing near the factory?')
