I don&#x27;t have these kinds of expectations for recent college grads. The breadth of the document is impressive to me, and as someone with decades of technical experience, I see plenty that I could brush up on. And the Linux basics section seems to do a pretty good job of starting from foundations. It&#x27;s a bunch of the things I had to figure out myself starting at a command line with little to no help.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t treat this as a course to be completed. Think of it as a guide, or a map, on your journey to getting smarter about tech. And it&#x27;s a lifelong journey. Don&#x27;t let anybody here convinced you that you&#x27;re supposed to know everything, because technology is so complex at this point that nobody knows all of it. Just keep broadening your skills, and deepening them where you are passionate, and you will build yourself an enjoyable and productive career.')
