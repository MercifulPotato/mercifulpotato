We&#x27;re so suspicious to see order where we expect chaos. But 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 is as likely as any other combination. Order is a subset of chaos, not its opposite. In other words, even chaos produces order occasionally. And unless you believe in Creation, that&#x27;s precisely the thing you owe your ass to. But it doesn&#x27;t &quot;seem random enough&quot; to us. Seems like our experience&#x2F;conception of randomness is kind of limited. Because we go around ordering things, we associate order with our intention, and extrapolate that if order arises frequently from our intention, therefore ALL order must be the result of human intention. Or going further, that all order has &quot;meaning&quot; encoded in it. But it&#x27;s not true; order can exist &quot;accidentally&quot; without intention or meaning.')
