Item(by='ryandrake', descendants=None, kids=[25787094, 25788425, 25788115], score=None, time=1610679455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25784294, text='&gt; Levels.fyi is heavily biased toward companies where tech is their primary business.<p>They are also (AFAIK) based to a large degree on self reporting which you have to imagine would skew high. If I had an amazing salary I’d want to self report it and tell levels and HN all about it. If I have a normal salary, maybe I keep that to myself.<p>Anecdotally I’ve worked at two companies featured on levels.FYI and my total comp was nowhere near what they were reporting for similar roles... like 50-66%—they were waaaay off. Either I am consistently grossly underpaid or levels biases high.')
