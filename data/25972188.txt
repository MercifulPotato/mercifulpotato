I wouldn&#x27;t say I <i>oppose</i> a $15 minimum wage, and I don&#x27;t think the author would either, but we do desperately need to start thinking about our transition to a post-work society and I worry minimum wage debates are sucking up a lot of the energy towards that. We risk getting stuck in a terrible equilibrium, where many people can&#x27;t get jobs but all our social safety nets are built on the assumption that they can. (There&#x27;s a serious argument to be made that we&#x27;re already there.)')
