You start by saying &quot;You might be seeing sexism where there is none.&quot;. To me, our comments are summarized with:<p>You: &quot;it might not be sexism because people often assume heterosexuality, but the statement could apply to a partner of any gender&quot;<p>Me: &quot;well then that&#x27;s heterosexist&quot;<p>You: People can make the heterosexual assumption without bad intentions, so it&#x27;s not heterosexist either&quot;<p>And that is true only for a narrow definition of sexism and heterosexism. Do you want to give a different name to the assumption that people are straight? Do you want to give a different name to the assumption that someone&#x27;s wife isn&#x27;t on board with his technical pursuits? I already have a name for those patterns, heterosexism and sexism, and I can grasp the nuances and subtleties of different forms. What is YOUR intent? To reserve those words for cases where there is ill intent?')
