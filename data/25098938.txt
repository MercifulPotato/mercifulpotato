This is just ridiculous, and won&#x27;t stop until there&#x27;s real consequences for filing invalid requests. As far as I know, there&#x27;s currently no penalty whatsoever for it, which allows these companies to just open the flood gates and spray in every direction with zero fucks given about destroying people&#x27;s livelihood.<p>I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s any possibility for a counter-lawsuit against these companies for mass filing invalid DMCA requests. Maybe once they get burned a few times they&#x27;ll at least try to be smarter about how they file them?')
