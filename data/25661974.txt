You can generally assume that the `monospace` and `serif` fallbacks are different, so if you have one layout box with text in `font-family:FontToDetect,monospace` and another with the same text but `font-family:FontToDetect,serif` and they both come out the same width, it&#x27;s good odds that the user has that font. [EDIT: originally got that backwards due to brainfart]<p>Nowadays the existence of `@font-face` makes that particular problem mostly obsolete, but the same general principle applies all over.')
