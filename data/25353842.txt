Certainly that&#x27;s been the case so far.<p>To do so in 2020 is to legitimize Trump&#x27;s assault on the country, and I just don&#x27;t see the courts doing that.<p>It&#x27;s better to just dismiss every case regardless of the merits. Republican voters aren&#x27;t going to do anything about the election result once Biden has been inaugurated in January.')
