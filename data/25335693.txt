Guy literally told me to just accept any change suggested to ease the review process and it&#x27;s not worth debating any comments. We had very different opinions.<p>He always claimed he was &quot;not nit-picky&quot;, but then he let reviews turn into exactly what you said, while loops versus for loops and what-not, and allowed the rest of the team to comment on low-value things like style rather than answering the important questions.<p>Why pushback at using a built-in function that does the same thing as some little helper your team wrote 8 years ago, when your helper function doesn&#x27;t even handle special cases? There&#x27;s literally no point other than someone has NIH syndrome. Why are the source files all 5,000 lines long and not broken into a logical project structure? Why is the back-end data-gathering and transforming code inter-mangled with the front-end templates (Django) so far as to be written as template filters and template functions?<p>It did not take me long to realize the development culture there was not aligned with my values. The lead developers came up in a different world and refused to see the positives and benefits of any modern development workflow involving a separate back-end API and front-end application.')
