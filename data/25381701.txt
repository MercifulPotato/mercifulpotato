I was about to convert it from a personal project (I used it to get rides on both services for a few years) to a &quot;real&quot; one open to customers, etc and then ran into snags with both APIs at around the same time. Uber&#x27;s API changed to potentially require a web flow to confirm surge pricing (IIRC - now it&#x27;s scheduled to be disabled entirely very soon) and Lyft&#x27;s API was basically shut off entirely (there&#x27;s a way to apply but I was unable to make any progress even through internal contacts at Lyft). I&#x27;ll try and keep an eye out for any changes...')
