Item(by='reissbaker', descendants=None, kids=[25581405], score=None, time=1609328898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577968, text='&gt; private investment (i.e. capitalism)<p>I think this definition is the root of our disagreement. Private investment doesn&#x27;t necessarily equate to capitalism. Even feudal lords spent their own money on their own property, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they were operating in capitalist economies. It stretches the definition of capitalism to the point of basically irrelevance to use it to refer to literally anything done for personal profit.<p>Wikipedia has a pretty good definition of capitalism:<p>&quot;Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Central characteristics of capitalism include capital accumulation, competitive markets, a price system, private property and the recognition of property rights, voluntary exchange and wage labor.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Capitalism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Capitalism</a><p>Notably, &quot;competitive markets&quot; and &quot;recognition of property rights&quot; are exactly the issues the article brings up with Amazon: there is little competition, and Amazon has (thus far) been able to steal intellectual property with impunity. This article is not exactly a takedown of capitalism! Its complaint is that Amazon is violating central characteristics of capitalism, and that it would prefer Amazon to not violate them.<p>I think your other point re: firms requiring profit motive and thus competition being impossible, is a little bit of a strawman. No one said <i>perfect</i> competition is something that markets have at a single point in time: just that monopolies without any option for competition are antithetical to a functional capitalist economy, and that capitalist markets are defined by the ability for firms to compete with each other. I think most economists would agree with me on that point.')
