It wasn&#x27;t like they were a bunch of evil people that wanted to do evil. They always were given the justification, the &quot;good reason&quot; for doing evil. They thought they were doing it for a good reason. They were never able to disconnect themselves from the brainwashing and really just actually look at what the factual reality of what they were doing was.<p>I don&#x27;t care how much &quot;good reason&quot; you think you have, it doesn&#x27;t make censorship not censorship, or racist policies not racist policies, or rewriting history anything but something straight out of 1984.<p>&quot;We are not in the business of rewriting the past, but we want to update the record&quot; - stuff like this just oozes doublespeak.')
