However, I&#x27;m not really convinced by Cloudflare&#x27;s analysis of the processing overhead:<p>The blog post only discusses how the proxying and encryption affect latency but not the processing at the server. In contrast to plain DoH (or DoT), where only symmetric cryptography is used after the first set-up, ODoH requires asymmetric cryptography (which is several orders of magnitude slower) for <i>each individual request</i>. The &quot;less than 1ms&quot; that they claim for the 99th percentile is no problem for the client but it is a problem for the resolver. \nAsymmetric cryptography is also used for verifying DNSSEC responses, but this is only necessary for records that are not cached.<p>On the other hand, an ODoH resolver may require to set up and keep track of a lower number of TLS connections as the number of proxies is likely smaller than the number of clients.')
