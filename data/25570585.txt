Hear me out.<p>When you build a pipeline, it&#x27;s good for exactly one thing. An LNG pipeline won&#x27;t do for anything else, not even other types of oil products. But building a railroad on the other hand, that&#x27;s good for just about anything from transporting bulk grain to truck frames to solid rocket motors. Even though they built the original rail network 150+ years ago, that doesn&#x27;t define the limits of what it can be used for today (other than the physical dimensions of the carriage etc). If we stop shipping oil by rail we can just build new rail cars and ship other stuff.<p>Obviously we have to consider safety. There are serious drawbacks of both ways to transport LNG, it&#x27;s just inherently dangerous. Many people remember Lac Maganetic a few years ago, where a series of technical failures caused a high speed derailment that devastated a small town in rural Quebec. Many also remember the poorly maintained pipelines all over the world that dribble oil into the ground water 24 hours a day. The difference is that trains are comparatively very cheap and easy to inspect and retrofit with sensors. Rail transport is very visible when it goes wrong, but pipelines are far away and far under ground, most of the time buried beneath the &#x27;under class&#x27;.')
