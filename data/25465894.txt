That inconsistency drives me nuts - aka defeats the whole purpose - you do something right or don&#x27;t do it at all right?<p>I see the point with documentation, yes it is nice to have, but more important like I said before is proper onboarding readme file and docs + willingness of other devs who are working on the codebase to handhold when necessary.')
