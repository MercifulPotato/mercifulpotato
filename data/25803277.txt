But when you call e.g. the\nmentioned `cat` command as a user you don&#x27;t care in what\nfunction it encountered an error and the context leading up to\nit, you just want to know what went wrong, unless maybe you&#x27;re\nabout to file a bug report.<p>Also the Rust compiler&#x27;s output quality isn&#x27;t due to the length\nof the output, it&#x27;s just formatted very well and has often very\nuseful hints thanks to the compiler&#x27;s insight into types and\nownership. In the world of NodeJS, TypeScript etc. I&#x27;ve seen a\nfair share of verbose error messages, mostly consisting of\nworthless but colorfully formatted information that only makes\nit harder to find the actually useful part.')
