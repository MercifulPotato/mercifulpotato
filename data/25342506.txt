They’ve been literally running build needs for at least half of GitHub.<p>However; I don’t think anyone needs to be grateful for Idera Inc, an American company, which has done nothing so far but ruining Travis CI for the rest of the world but themselves.<p>Thankfully the world has organically moved on to things like GitHub actions, but this personally will impact me as I have many repos out there that get 1 contrib&#x2F;year, which would use maybe 2-3 minutes&#x2F;yr. Lesson of the story here: There’s nothing such as free, even if there is, it will not last forever.')
