As I tried to do what I needed I found most examples in the manual are JSON only, and the JS API docs weren&#x27;t helpful.<p>It took a while to work out how to make a log-scale axis, or how to customise the tooltip content (I could see in the JSON how to do it easily) and I gave up trying to work out how to provide a custom colour scale via JS - or to change to another pre-defined one.<p>The second is around toggling on&#x2F;off the data in the chart. I had ~20 series on one scatter plot, and being able to highlight other members of a series, or turn series on&#x2F;off would make it easier to explore the data.<p>I found a JSON example of doing this; but not one with the JS-API. It was also more complicated than I hoped, wanting to use Vega-Lite as a better Excel to explore this data, and not to write my own chart-app if that makes sense (different purpose).')
