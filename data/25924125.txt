Why in God&#x27;s name would you use it to &quot;chronicle history&quot;?<p>I don&#x27;t understand this argument at all. The entire Fourth Estate in the US has always been primarily paid for by advertisers, and just saying YouTube is an &quot;entertainment website&quot; seems like a poor attempt to say it can only be used for cat videos or something.<p>YouTube is the largest video distribution network on the planet. Of course I think someone would use it to chronicle video history.')
