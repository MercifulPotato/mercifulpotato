Item(by='yebyen', descendants=None, kids=[24877339], score=None, time=1603505128, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24876242, text='The mention of the copyrighted work eg. &quot;Taylor Swift&quot; does not lay out a case of infringement. Merely possessing a copy does not indicate infringement, you could be in pursuit of your fair use rights, with no intention to share. Given the cost of bandwidth and predilection of media conglomerates to meter and limit it, I would argue that there is actually no likelihood of facilitating any substantially infringing use.<p>The person who took a copy has no substantial reason to share it with anyone, as it is freely available through the content providers. Anyone with a copy of youtube-dl can get it, (does youtube-dl enable the download of any paywalled content? If so, that might be a fact that changes the game. But if so, does the RIAA claimant have standing to make that argument?)')
