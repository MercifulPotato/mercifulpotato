But I certainly <i>do</i> remember the feeling that China is trying to seek influence in Serbia. If I remember correctly, there was a gigantic billboard right outside the main station in Belgrade which showed the futuristic utopia a Chinese company wanted to build in the surrounding quarter after demolishing the old (and beautiful) station.<p>PS: if you are European and looking for a great 3-4 week trip, buy a train ticket to Belgrade via Ljubljana (stay there 2 nights) and Zagreb (stay there 2 nights). Stay in Belgrade for 2 days, take the trans-balkan express train (a beautiful and spectacular ride) to Montenegro, stay in Kotor for a week, take a bus to Dubrovnik, stay there for one week, take a bus up coast to Split, stay there for one week, and then you can either take the night train back to Zagreb and from there back home, or continue up coast via Rovinj and Piran to Triest, and take a train back home from there. You will not be disappointed.')
