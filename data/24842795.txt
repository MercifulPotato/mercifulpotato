Item(by='crpatino', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603231441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836805, text='&gt; Why should any of these people be considered &quot;unemployed&quot;?<p>In general, because governments around the World use doctored Unemployment Rates to claim their economic policies are more effective than those really are. It is practically the same as Principal Skinner taking Bart Simpson and all the other School&#x27;s idiots to a field trip the very day the Standardized Test is due.<p>How do we know the measure is doctored, you say? Because they <i>changed</i> it, and they have been comparing old figures to new figures. Sure, they put a tiny note in illegible print at the bottom of their charts. You know what an engineer does? We give the damned new thing a new damned name. Then in the damned chart you clearly see one line stops one year and then another line of a different color starts that very year. If anyone gets fooled by that, it&#x27;s because they are willfully ignorant.<p>&gt; We spend a lot of time criticizing journalists and politicians, but how many people bother to look at the data themselves if interested?<p>Journalists are paid to report, and if they cannot report accurate figures, why should we pay them?<p>Politicians compete to get into, what in theory is called, Public Service. Servers are expected to provide accurate reports regarding the service they are providing. If their reports are self serving, why should we trust them with anything more important than window dressing?')
