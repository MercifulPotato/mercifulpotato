I have to cook out of necessity, but I don&#x27;t enjoy the art at all.<p>What makes it fun is that I make it a game of optimizing concurrency.<p>I just love thinking ahead and planning what operations go in what order, how, when, how few trips to the same cupboards and drawers I can make, etc.<p>I can make scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and some fruit or yogurt for a family of four in six minutes without leaving a mess.
