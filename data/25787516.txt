I understand the inertia in introductory courses, and the simplicity of MIPS, but hopefully the course is eventually ported to Aarch64 or RISC-V.  Presumably a spim-like simulator for Aarch64 or RISC-V is the biggest missing component.<p>6.004 was one of my favorite classes at MIT, and the DEC Alpha AXP was a fine architecture to simplify for the pedagogical Beta architecture.  However, I&#x27;m glad to hear they&#x27;ve moved to RISC-V.  I presume they&#x27;d been avoiding porting the course to Aarch64 (or a simplified version thereof) due to intellectual property issues.')
