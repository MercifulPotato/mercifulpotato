And they produced a wonderful OS that I’m sure people still have very fond memories of. It didn’t have a lot of new features, compared to 10.5. Steve Jobs even said that publicly a number of times, during that year. He said — and I’m paraphrasing — “that we will work on PERFORMANCE.” All my Macs since 1998 have suffered slow downs on Mac OS updates after say 10.6. 10.6 was the pinnacle of performance.<p>Every upgrade since 10.10 has had a NOTICEABLE slow down on my MacBook Air 2013, and my 2012 Mac Mini, and more recently my MBP 2017 is showing signs of slow down and reduced battery life as well with each update. They can even be point updates, not major ones.<p>These happen man, and I can’t see the real benefits that I’ve gotten from say 10.10 -&gt; 10.15 that would outvalue the degradation in performance I’ve seen. Ok you say, a MBA 2013 is ready for the pasture, but a maxed out (RAM, SSD) MBP that is 3 years old is really just entering midlife.<p>It’s not a random mistake.')
