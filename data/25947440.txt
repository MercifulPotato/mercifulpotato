What however riles up people (legitimately IMO) is that larger funds making equally suspect trades are basically let off with a slap on the wrist.<p>A strong argument could be made that Tesla&#x27;s stocks last year have been pumped up irrationally by funds last year too, and if a market correction comes the funds behind it will face zero to minimal consequences.
