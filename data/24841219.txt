I chose it because I got it up and running quickly, but over time, I&#x27;d keep running into issues that should have been simple but required digging through their source and sometimes making my own patches. It also doesn&#x27;t specify dependencies very precisely, so I constantly had issues installing it when its dependencies changed out from under it and broke everything. I tried hard for a while to get my patches merged upstream to prevent others from re-doing my work[0], but the project has effectively been unmaintained for the past 2+ years, save for a few brief spurts of work every few months.<p>If I were starting from scratch, I&#x27;d use a static site generator like Hugo or Gatsby to just generate thumbnails and URLs for each clip. You&#x27;d have to write a little custom code, but I suspect it&#x27;s less time overall than you&#x27;d spend getting MediaGoblin to work.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issues.mediagoblin.org&#x2F;ticket&#x2F;5574" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issues.mediagoblin.org&#x2F;ticket&#x2F;5574</a> (their bugtracker is currently down, which should give you a sense of the state of the project)')
