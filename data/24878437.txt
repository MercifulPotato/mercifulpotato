Teams can self organize and self govern around business problems they feel like solving. The best teams are the ones that produce the services that product owners rely on the most to get things done.<p>Have you considered handover, people moving on, new hires, etc? One guy running one service sounds like entrenchment to me. You need, as a company, to ensure people are replaceable. One way to do that is to for example stick to one or two programming languages.<p>You cannot, as a company, afford to have your services be written in a dozen different languages by a dozen different people. That&#x27;s a huge risk.')
