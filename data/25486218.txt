Rather, it is an introduction to DDD, an explanation of CQRS and Event Sourcing and an implementation guide. Also, it is not explaining how to approach and model complex domain problems. I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself experienced in that. Everything I worked with so far was rather trivial.<p>I can very much relate to your experience with projects that applied CQRS and Event Sourcing. In fact, the longest project I worked on was a negative example. The patterns were used as part of the system architecture. Their use was never justified with any reason specific to the domain or the business. In the end, some parts of the system would have been better off with a completely different architecture.<p>I already have convinced project teams to not use Event Sourcing when they thought they needed it. Also, I often hear it being conflated with Event-Driven Architecture.')
