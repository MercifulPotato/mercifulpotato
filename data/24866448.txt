Then the kids come home, I can help with their homework and keep working for a bit more.<p>I can even assist colleagues in different time zones, since my computer is near me at all times. Just a quick chat during my evening (their morning) will speed things up immensely by unblocking their tasks right away.<p>I&#x27;ve even spent parts of the week at the family cabin and at my in-laws. No one cared, my productivity didn&#x27;t change a bit.<p>But I think I&#x27;m privileged since my company only tracks my productivity and are smart enough to not overwork anyone on purpose. And I&#x27;ve had one burnout already, so I can see the symptoms of overworking and relax well before I run into any issues.')
