The ideal should always be &quot;given what we know of each candidate who is expected to deliver the most value in this position?&quot;. I don&#x27;t see how anyone can disagree with that. And in general it seems like companies and countries with more meritocratic systems tend to do better, so as a system it seems to work great.<p>&quot;Meritocracy&quot; as a word is sometimes used by corrupt people, but that is like North Korea calling itself a democracy, it isn&#x27;t a problem with meritocracy.')
