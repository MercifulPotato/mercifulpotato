Noise is the other stuff.  In common use though people mentally (and literally) drop the first word from &quot;<i>modulated</i> signal&quot; and seize upon signal.  It&#x27;s normal and writers should make an effort to use <i>unmodulated</i> or, probably better, <i>natural</i> in such descriptions.  Emission isn&#x27;t a bad word for this context, but it&#x27;s still all encompassing and easy to mentally go the wrong direction when reading it.')
