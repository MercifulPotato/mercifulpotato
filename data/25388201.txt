Even if they can&#x27;t compete on quality with existing headphone makers, they&#x27;ll undoubtedly make more money.<p>Some people are going to buy a new pair of AirPods Max every year for $550. It hurts me deep down to know this fact, and it offends me on a level that&#x27;s hard to describe with words.<p>But as long as other headphone manufacturers continue to sell quality and serviceable products, I won&#x27;t be directly affected by it. I just hope Sony, Sennheiser, etc. don&#x27;t follow Apple&#x27;s lead. If they do, maybe I&#x27;ll have to start looking at cheap Chinese brands.')
