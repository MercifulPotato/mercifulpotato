Humans do not manually re-order lists with more than a couple hundred elements in them in general, and I&#x27;d submit by a 1000, if you&#x27;re supporting extensive manual reordering you shouldn&#x27;t be. (For example, the JIRA board we use nominally orders any of thousands or 10,000s of bug in the backlog in total order, but the orders are honestly meaningless past about 50 or so, because we humans simply do not have that detailed of a total order in mind! So it mat initially look like an example, but it really isn&#x27;t... it&#x27;s just an accident of implementation.)<p>A DB schema with an ID for the whole collection and a linked list is basically optimal here. Various obvious extension present themselves at that point, such as multiple orders by moving the linked list to an external table or adding reverse links. You don&#x27;t need a complicated CTE, in 2021 you just query the whole list by the collection ID and assemble in memory.<p>By the time this solution doesn&#x27;t scale, you&#x27;ve almost certainly got other problems where your data structure no longer matches the true nature of the data. Humans do not generally have total orders on 10,000s of elements. In those rare cases where for some reason you do, which I have encountered 0 times in ~25 years, by all means use some other solution. But don&#x27;t expect it to come up often.')
