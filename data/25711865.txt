Item(by='jasonlotito', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610263247, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25710877, text='&gt; I think the critical component to this conversation that its important to stay focused on is not Apple&#x27;s removal of Parler, but their continued insistence on maintaining exclusive control over what people install on their devices.<p>This has been going on since the App store first launched. I remember speaking up about this years and years ago. There were two sides, and well, we know which side one: people just accepted that Apple gets to dictate what goes on the iPhone.<p>So at this point, I have no sympathy for anyone who suddenly realizes: &quot;Hey, what are we doing? What are we allowing?&quot;<p>Every cheered when Apple prevented Flash from running on the device. And then porn apps. And then cheap &quot;flashlight&quot; apps. Or apps that did nothing except cost $1000 for a JPEG of a red gem. Guess what? This is the end result.<p>So I always look for sincerity when people propose fighting back against this now. Because now that it affects them, they want a change, but do they really want change, or are they just being selfish. And it&#x27;s always selfish. People are fighting for their piece of the pie.<p>The &quot;fuck you, got mine&quot; attitude.<p>&gt; No one in these comments is talking about Google.<p>Google I can side load apps freely. Others can operate stores and do this. Google does not have this problem.')
