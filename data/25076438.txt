The old CLI overrides don’t work in Catalina anymore. I’ve only ever owned Mac laptops and I’m seriously considering switching to a Linux&#x2F;arm on the next laptop. I’m fine with the lack of ability to run random apps on my iPad, but not on my computer. Big Sur apparently won’t let me run the ZFS extensions or my vpn software (or I gotta hope the vpn has an upgrade). Apple has gone too far, from improved security defaults to whittling away the ability to override those options at all and run my own software.')
