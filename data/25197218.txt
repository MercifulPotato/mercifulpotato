To reduce this category, you need to travel less and if you need to travel, go by foot, bike or public transports.<p>- Food. To reduce this category you need to reduce you meat consumption, 2 or 3 times a week is enough, buy less transformed goods, ie cook more, and buy local grown food.<p>- Consumption. To reduce this category, follow the 5 R: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle.<p>- Public emissions. This one is tied to all the public services we get. It can only be reduced by reaching agreements as a society.<p>As for the children, obviously if we all stop having children, this is all of no use. In developed countries we already have stabilized our demographic growth, so I don&#x27;t think there is a need for limiting oneself.')
