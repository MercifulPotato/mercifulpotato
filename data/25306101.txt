That&#x27;s not great customer service! They sent you a defective product, and then made <i>you</i> pay for returning it! WTF? Good customer service would be paying to ship the defective product back and then, once they have the laptop, selling you the laptop that you want. Or better yet, shipping you the one you want immediately.')
