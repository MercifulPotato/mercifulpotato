It&#x27;s an S&amp;P 500 fund, but each of the 500 is equally weighted.</i><p>Note that an equal-weighted index will tend be more volatile, have higher turnover (<i>i.e.</i> more trading costs and short-term tax effects) and be sensitive to value over momentum in comparison with a market-cap weighted index like the S&amp;P 500. The former have outperformed the latter over the last decade (EDIT: no, it hasnâ€™t. I was looking at a biased source.)')
