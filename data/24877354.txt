Solar companies also aren&#x27;t going to be held liable for the social costs of grid disruption which will inevitably cause outages or require additional countermeasures by other parties to secure their electricity supply.<p>Nobody is going to protest when solar company employees get skin cancer. Nobody is going to protest solar power when toxic sludge from carelessly-disposed heavy metals waste (or indeed solar panels themselves) contaminates drinking water in some rural town. Groups won&#x27;t be organised to phase out solar installations  in response to accidents in foreign countries.<p>And I think solar is perfectly fine, I just don&#x27;t see why we impose all these silly restrictions on nuclear when it is a measurably superior form of energy.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m surprised it takes 50 mines for uranium, that&#x27;s far far more than I had expected.<p>Sounds like you might be in for a nasty shock when you find out how many coal mines the world has.')
