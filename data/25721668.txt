I have the opposite experience, I&#x27;m generally an anxious person and feel stressed going into meetings, especially with groups of new people. I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m much more relaxed on zoom calls than in person, I think because it feels like there is much more of a buffer between me and the people I&#x27;m talking to. Seeing faces on the screen does not provoke the same feeling as a real life meeting.<p>(Incidentally, I really dont like working remotely and want to get back to real meetings as soon as I can, even if it will make me more anxious in the moment)')
