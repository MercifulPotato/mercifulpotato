Item(by='ryan29', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607401009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25325984, text='&gt; There&#x27;s questionable billing policies&#x2F;pricing policies.<p>I blame ICANN.  A few years ago Uniregistry changed pricing for a bunch of TLDs <i>including</i> existing registrants and ICANN did nothing.<p>All of the other registries routinely reclassify domains as premium when they drop and it&#x27;s really short sighted IMO.  Domains would make an incredible, pseudo-anonymous, collision free web identity system, but many of the registries (AFAIK) are owned by private equity and can&#x27;t see past the next quarterly earnings report.<p>It&#x27;s really sad.  The new domains could have been an opportunity to expand the market by convincing regular people to buy domains for email, identity, etc., but instead we got a bunch of short sighted price gouging :-(')
