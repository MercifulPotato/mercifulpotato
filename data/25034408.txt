What&#x27;s the point of open source if companies just steal it, build billion dollar industries on top, and then lock everything down?<p>To nitpick: They are not stealing it, they&#x27;re using it per the license terms. Don&#x27;t like that? Well, choose a different license.<p>That being said, I think there&#x27;s an underlying point here. The &quot;business-friendly&quot; open source movement co-opted the idealistic free software movement. It was no longer about making the world better in terms of having a software ecosystem that respects the four freedoms etc., but about reducing wheel reinvention, minimizing transaction costs, attracting good developers to come work for your corporation, and so on.<p>One could argue that the idea of causing social change by coding free software in your basement was always an impossible dream. If you want to see political change, join a political movement and get out on the street protesting or something. And vote!<p>&gt; Yes, it&#x27;s managed, but you&#x27;re forever a renter.<p>Welcome to 21st century tenement farming.<p>&gt; Remember when the Internet was actually pleasant? When it was nice to build stuff for others to use?<p>I started hanging around on usenet in the early-mid 90&#x27;ies. Let me tell you, it was already a cesspool then (maybe it was better in the 80&#x27;ies, but I was too young then, sorry). Of course, back then it was mostly just people being assholes, not billion dollar corporations weaponizing assholes and hatred to drive clicks.<p>&gt; Stop giving your work away for free when the companies only take.<p>I think so far open source has worked out pretty well for programmers, because there&#x27;s such a huge demand for (competent) ones. If you want a glimpse how it&#x27;ll look when demand starts to match supply better, take a look at your friends with liberal arts, sociology, politics etc. degrees.
