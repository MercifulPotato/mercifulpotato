Item(by='SmokeyHamster', descendants=None, kids=[25377351], score=None, time=1607615924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25360948, text='&gt;These claims are being slaughtered in ongoing court cases, and many of them are objectively batshit,<p>The Mike Kelly case in PA, arguing that the law allowing mail-in ballots was illegal, was ruled by a judge as completely legally valid, but was thrown out of the state supreme court because &quot;they waited too long to complain&quot;.<p>So, no, not objectively batshit. If the GOP had filed that case in January, Trump would have won PA...assuming the same supreme court didn&#x27;t throw out their case for some other arbitrary reason like &quot;filing too soon.&quot;<p>The Democrats outplayed Republicans. Democrats passed an un-Constitutional law that helped them stuff ballot boxes with ballots that were almost certainly harvested or bought. If we&#x27;re to believe the election results and voter turnout in, say, mostly black Philadelphia, Joe Biden is a more popular politician than even Barack Obama. Only an idiot would believe that. But still, it serves Republicans right for underestimating the extent to which Democrats would cheat.')
