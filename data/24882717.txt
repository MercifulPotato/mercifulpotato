TileCode and the example games appear to target programming beginners and even children, but the lingo here is unlikely to be comprehensible to anyone but CS majors. And it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re describing a complex idea here, it&#x27;s just the language they use to describe it seems almost willfully arcane.')
