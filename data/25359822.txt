They are in place to force manufacturers to leverage local sales people instead of their own.<p>It blew my mind when I went to a dealership that had radio ads about their great lease deals on a Chevy Volt. I walked in, told them I&#x27;d like to lease a Chevy Volt and that I was very excited about the deal.<p>They spent an hour trying to talk me into other cars and the sales people didn&#x27;t know the first thing about what made the Volt so special.
