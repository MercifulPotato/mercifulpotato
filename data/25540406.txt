There&#x27;s a lot you can say about the failure of the justice system, the failure of its policing system, the yawning generational failure to address race and poverty in this country. Of course black people are going to be disadvantaged to breaking. So we demonstrate for our black sisters and brothers. We rally our voices and let out our primal screams that are heard around the nation.<p>No screams will be heard from the Tibetans and Uyghurs. No reporters in China will tell their story. They will be broken and forgotten in silence.
