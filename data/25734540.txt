I think gay people should be able to get wedding cakes from literally any baker as a protected class, but the law disagrees with me. The end, unless new laws are passed.<p>Parler is not a protected class, their users posts are not protected speech. The only leg they will have to stand on is the terms of their AWS contract, which AWS will likely have had lawyers craft with steel vault level protections to shield the company from liability in cases like this. It would be shocking if Parler wins this injunction (and based on time sensitivity, we&#x27;ll probably find out later today) but even if they do long term they&#x27;re going to have to build&#x2F;buy new server structure.')
