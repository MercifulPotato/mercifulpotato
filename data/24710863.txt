If you pack a watercooled PC as tight as possible including the radiators it&#x27;s maybe 70% of volume dedicated to cooling.<p>This things run for hours and hours, it&#x27;s hard to understand if you just use your computer to do cloud things or maybe compile something every once in a while. I&#x27;m into photography and I&#x27;ve been learning Ableton and my Mac wasn&#x27;t doing it anymore, after an hour the fans go super loud and the CPU underclocks and Lightroom or Photoshop become super slow and Ableton starts clicking. I got a Thinkpad T where like 50% of my laptop is now cooling and I can work on it for hours and everything runs fine.')
