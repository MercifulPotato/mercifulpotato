We don&#x27;t make a screw, use it to build something and then discard it once we disassemble the thing.<p>For the last point, I&#x27;d definitely want to see examples where taxes are more efficient than bans. Everything I&#x27;ve seen and read (and I like to read a lot), points the other way around.<p>So I&#x27;d definitely want to read some studies that says that tax increases are better than bans.<p>As a single counterpoint, we&#x27;ve been taxing cigarettes a ton for several decades.
