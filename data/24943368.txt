So when the government says that you can&#x27;t protect your property if the thing killing it is a wolf, then farmers get very frustrated because they feel like their freedom&#x2F;rights have been controlled or taken away from the government.<p>To put the farmer&#x27;s perspective another way:<p>Everyone has a right to self-defense if you are being harmed. But imagine if the government says &quot;actually, if the person harming you has blonde hair, then you can&#x27;t defend yourself because we are protecting people with blonde hair right now. But don&#x27;t worry we will make it worth your while if you just let the blonde person hurt you.&quot;<p>I know this sounds like a crazy example, but if you have ever spent time around farmers who deal with this issue, it feels exactly as crazy to them.')
