But I think this article goes a bit too far in assuming that a significant number creators deserve an audience and an income that aren&#x27;t getting it now, enough to create a creator middle class. I wish that was the case, but in the time I spent working in arts and entertainment I can’t support that view of the world.<p>Many people create art for the wrong reasons. Their goal is to be the center of attention, but they don’t have anything interesting to say, haven’t put in very much work, haven’t really considered why what they created is in the best interest of the audience, not just in the best interest of the artist.<p>If a platform goes too far in recommending content that isn’t very good, and taking resources away from its successful creators and redistributing them to its less successful, their viewers and talent will leave for another platform. For most of the long-tail creators, their best chance at a middle class income will be a day job off the platform, or in a job as support system for a successful creator that hires staff (crew, marketing, props, editing).')
