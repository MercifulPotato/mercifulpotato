Fifty years ago Levene and Dobzhansky [18] showed that head lice could be trained or adapted to become the rather larger body lice by attaching them to the body in small pill boxes.\n[...]\nBody lice, and <i>occasionally head and pubic lice</i>, transmit bacterial diseases: typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii) [29], trench fever (Bartonella quintana) and relapsing fever (Borellia recurrentis). The lice themselves succumb to typhus infection but pass the Rickettsia in their feces, which the human then scratches into the skin. Typhus is known as &#x27;war fever&#x27; and &#x27;jail fever&#x27; because it appears in conditions where lice thrive. At the end of Rats, Lice and History Zinsser [1] wrote &quot;Typhus is not dead. It will live on for centuries and will break into the open whenever human stupidity and brutality give it a chance.&quot; Sadly, Zinsser&#x27;s words were prophetic. Within a few years, typhus became the major slayer in the Nazi concentration camps; typhus broke out among Rwandan refugees in Burundi in 1994, in Bosnia in 1995 and most recently in Goma.')
