Item(by='ddevault', descendants=None, kids=[25922060], score=None, time=1611700934, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25921880, text='Adding features because they solve a specific use-case is grossly irresponsible. Solving a specific use-case is only one of many criteria that needs to be met for a feature to be justified. Others include &quot;is it in scope?&quot;, &quot;is it a maintenance burden?&quot;, &quot;does it make existing features more unreliable?&quot;, &quot;will its bugs affect people who don&#x27;t need it?&quot;, &quot;can it be done in a separate tool?&quot; Anyone can come up with a use-case. It&#x27;s often the maintainer&#x27;s job to say &quot;no&quot;.<p>If doas doesn&#x27;t cover your edge case, then the responsible thing is to make a new tool which covers just that, and not to shove your complexity into a critical security component that the other 99% of the userbase doesn&#x27;t need. Remember Heartbleed? The entire internet shat its pants because of a vulnerability in a feature that no one uses.<p>Failing to uphold that principle over and over again leads to broken, unreliable, insecure programs. This is why everything is on fire. Not C.')
