Up to a certain number of users (like 1 million) you are free. But over 1 million and you get categorized as a national infrastructure and you loose your right to censor the public.<p>That is, the right of the many outweighg the rights of the few. Surely even the Silicon Valley socialists can unserstand the concept of &quot;the many&quot; outweighing &quot;the few&quot;, right?')
