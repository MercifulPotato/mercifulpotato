He said there are acoustic versions and electromagnetic versions of such weapons&#x2F;devices. Apparently, the sonic versions work both inside and ouside the range of human hearing. Similarly, the electromagnetic version of the device apparently also works on a wide variety of frequencies.<p>As for defense, it seems that detecting full spectrum weapons requires highly specialized and expensive equipment. It may not be practical to deploy such equipment in the field.<p>As for treating the inflicted officers, it seems strange that our premier front line agency would not err on the side of caution and allow these patriots to receive treatment from Walter Reed. Could there be more to the story than DCI Haspel remaining skeptical as justification to decline such treatment?')
