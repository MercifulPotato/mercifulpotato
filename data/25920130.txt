Ted Cruz has a Harvard law degree but thinks, well who really knows. Being educated didn&#x27;t stop millions of college graduates from believing that Dominion voting machines &quot;flipped&quot; votes to Biden or that tractor trailers full of &quot;Biden&quot; votes were dropped off but only in the states that Trump had more in person votes initially because the US Mail bad or fraud. I saw people reposting stuff on FB that X state had more votes than registered voters or even citizens but if you did a single Google, you would see that it was for the population of state X in 1980 or some shit.
