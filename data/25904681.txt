As the sole arbiter of what is and is not constitutional, including how to read and interpret existing language - they can do what they can get away with.<p>For instance, the text of the 10th Amendment makes it pretty clear that the original intent was that states were sovereign except for those powers explicitly carved out to the Federal gov&#x27;t - &quot;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.&quot;<p>[<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_...</a>]<p>Since WW2 (and a bit before that, including rulings &#x27;reinterpreting&#x27; the commerce clause to cover things like growing wheat on your own land for your own consumption within an individual state to assist the Executive in enforcing price controls over the economy), the supreme court has ruled that essentially Congress can regulate anything it wants, city, state and federal level.
