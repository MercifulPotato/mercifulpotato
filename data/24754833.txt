All of the backend&#x2F;technical&#x2F;systems of our company is done from Indian company where i hold 29% of shares; remaining shares have been acquired by company as part of the parent company deal. The parent company got sold at valuation of $45M. I owned just 2% of parent company. I had no say in negotiation price in parent company deal.<p>Question is what should be fair valuation of my 29% should they chose to buy my shares ? Our Indian company only has staff and knowledge as assets. I have been like a co-founder for this business(including parent company) and still hold lot of value knowledge-wise for the company. We have been doing this since last 15 years. Thanks in advance.')
