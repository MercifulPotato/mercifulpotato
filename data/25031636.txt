Item(by='rndgermandude', descendants=None, kids=[25032604], score=None, time=1604898377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25031074, text='&gt;No, California [...] always vote Democrat<p>Except 1988, 1984, 1980, 1976, 1972 and so on. Aka in my lifetime (yes, I am old).<p>Georgia always votes Republican, except in this election (probably) or when Carter is running.<p>An acquaintance who hails from Indiana recently told me Indiana always votes for the Republican candidate, and was surprised to find out Obama took Indiana in 2008.<p>The Rust belt is deeply blue, except in 2016 when it was more purple with a tint of red.<p>Kennedy defeated Nixon in Georgia and New York and Nevada, but not in California. (And New York had more electoral votes than California until 1972).<p>The South used to be Democrat. The West used to be Republican. Except again when Johnson, Nixon, Reagan took essentially the entire nation.<p>Another example: Support for gay marriage between 1996 and now went from 68% opposition to 67% support. Proposition 8 in 2008 banning gay marriage in California was accepted by Californian voters just 12 years ago with 52% voting against gay marriage, and only 5 years later in 2013 that opposition had dwindled to 34%.<p>Even parties change: Republicans went from the party of Lincoln to the party of Trump with many stops in between. Demoncrats went from the party in favor of slavery and segregation to the party that claims to be all about racial&#x2F;gender&#x2F;sexuality justice.<p>Demographic and ideological shifts do occur regularly, often at a sluggish speed but sometimes quite quickly.<p>My point: don&#x27;t say always.<p>(That isn&#x27;t too say that I am in support of the electoral collage or the first-past-the-post voting system resulting in a defacto two party oligarchy; both are bad in my humble opinion).')
