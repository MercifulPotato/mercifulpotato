I&#x27;m in Canada and the Globe &amp; Mail has the same process. It&#x27;s similar to phone companies; you say you want to leave, they offer a discounted price to get you to stay.<p>That&#x27;s fine by me. The call to cancel has never been too onerous, and the CSR reps never did this kind of back and forth. Don&#x27;t want the discounted offer? No problem, your subscription is now cancelled.')
