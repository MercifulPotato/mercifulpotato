They want the data one stores or transmits to be ultimately decryptable by them one way or another. Most services that use secure transports merely use it to transmit cleartext and store it as such. With E2EE messaging even if you have the server tapped you&#x27;ll only capture encrypted binary blobs and perhaps some metadata. That&#x27;s what the governments don&#x27;t like.<p>With backdoored E2EE you&#x27;d still need to hack the server AND have the key to access the data.')
