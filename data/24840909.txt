You can know what makes something good, but you don&#x27;t quite have the muscle memory or skill to reproduce it and it&#x27;s frustrating.<p>You might know what a good painting looks like, but you can&#x27;t move your arm in the right way to create those strokes. You don&#x27;t know how to mix the paints to get the colors you want. When you are sketching out a scene, you&#x27;re not quite adept at positioning elements of a scene on the page to have the aesthetics you&#x27;re aiming for.<p>Another thing this reminds me of is learning how to dance. It&#x27;s easy to watch someone walk through steps and mentally you know exactly how they are moving, but you just can&#x27;t quite move your body in the same way. Super frustrating! What&#x27;s worse is the first time you watch a video of you dancing. There&#x27;s a huge disconnect between how you think you look and how you actually look and it&#x27;s quite discouraging.')
