The Beatles were popular. But that’s not why they are remembered. There were other popular bands completely forgotten.<p>Things become popular for various reasons.\nSometimes it is because it reflects a truth of the time, or it was simply good, or beautiful. Other times it is because it’s something that feeds a craving. Mass produced food isn’t necessarily good, but it is popular.\nI think the things that are good beautiful and true, can be the popular things, but they often aren’t.\nHowever the things that last are often good beautiful and true and the things that don’t aren’t.<p>Then again our memory of Hitler lasts, and he wasn’t good, but he did reveal what good was, because it shone so bright against the dark evil of his way of thinking that permeated that culture so well.\nIf you think of Hitler’s murder of Jews, then think of the stories told about those unknowns who risked their lives hiding Jews. The stories show that an utterly unknown person is a vastly better person than Hitler, and his name will never be celebrated the way that unknown person is.<p>We’d do better as a society if we told less stories about Hitler, and more stories of the unknown, courageous, good sacrificial man, who saved the lives of many Jews.')
