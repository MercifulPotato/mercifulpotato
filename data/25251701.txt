I mean, you won&#x27;t be able to just buy Apple&#x27;s components and assemble a computer. If you were, it&#x27;s really just a Mac, isn&#x27;t it? I imagine they&#x27;ll support x86_64 based systems for a few more years, but there won&#x27;t be new drivers or support for new cpus, etc.<p>I wonder if it occurred to someone at Apple, if it&#x27;s somewhat an added benefit to them.')
