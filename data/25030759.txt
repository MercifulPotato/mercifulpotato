The CADR test usually makes separate measurements for dust, pollen, and smoke (particulates). It looks like they adapted the normal test procedure to measure the reduction in live&#x2F;viable microbes.<p>However, in a few minutes of looking at their homepage I don&#x27;t see anywhere they list a number in CFM of purified air, which is what CADR measures.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cfpub.epa.gov&#x2F;si&#x2F;si_public_file_download.cfm?p_download_id=498206" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cfpub.epa.gov&#x2F;si&#x2F;si_public_file_download.cfm?p_downl...</a> [Appendix A]')
