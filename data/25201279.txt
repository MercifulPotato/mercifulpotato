I just have too much experience in the industry to throw away my time and play with toys.<p>Rust doesn&#x27;t throw away that corpus. Rust draws <i>heavily</i> on that corpus. It leverages LLVM (used to compile C&#x2F;C++), integrates with C libraries, integrates with GDB, draws a ton of design decisions from actual experience using C++, and so on.<p>It&#x27;s a tool that runs inside Firefox, AWS, Microsoft, and a lot of other high-reliability, high-performance areas. It may be young, but it&#x27;s quickly building (IMO compelling) evidence that it&#x27;s very much not a &quot;toy.&quot; ;)')
