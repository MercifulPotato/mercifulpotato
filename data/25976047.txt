Item(by='moron4hire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612068366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25975110, text='The problem with Deloitte is that it&#x27;s massive and organized as a partnership.\nA massive company requires several layers of management to be able to organize, and a partnership expects billable hours out of everyone. So you have this massive, sickly, distended torso of middle-management whose only purpose in life is to recieve decrees from on high and push the thumb down on the people doing the actual work. And the only way they keep their jobs is to figure out how to stick their hours on the client&#x27;s bill.<p>So you quickly see large numbers of leads, directors, managing directors, managing partners, and partners show up into meetings with 1 or 2 SMEs to make a show of &quot;managing the project&quot;, whose only purpose in life is to suck the oxygen out of the room.<p>And I mean literally suck the oxygen out of a room. The meeting rooms are tiny--cuz real estate isn&#x27;t billable!--so when you get more people than chairs in a room like that, the CO2 levels literally start to put you to sleep.<p>I spent a year and a half at Deloitte, building Augmented Reality projects. Every single project I worked, I was only brought in during the last 10% of the project time. The time was always not enough to do a good job. The one project that I cared about--incidentally also the only one that got any traction with any actual clients--got canned during a restructuring from working within Deloitte&#x27;s &quot;government&quot; division to it&#x27;s &quot;industry&quot; division. Except we always worked blended across industries and the app was targeted at industry, not gov. To this day, I really think the entire point was to just waste money, and my app getting traction edged too dangerously close to one day having to show efficacy.<p>I&#x27;m now the head of VR (yeah, I never actually wanted to do AR, and didn&#x27;t even get hired for it, but that&#x27;s where Deloitte stuck me) at a small company that does foreign language instruction for gov. A year and a half in and we&#x27;ve got an exciting project that has tested well with some limited number of students and is soon deploying company-wide. Barring some natural disaster, I&#x27;m extremely happy to never change jobs again.')
