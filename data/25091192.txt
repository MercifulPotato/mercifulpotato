I have less confidence in supporting libs though.<p>RE linux: Argh, sounds like we&#x27;re of similar backgrounds and this is my fear to be honest. I&#x27;ve heard good things about dell&#x2F;lenovo hardware so I&#x27;d probs have to swing that way for the next refresh, but yeah i suspect it won&#x27;t be as painful as I&#x27;d like.')
