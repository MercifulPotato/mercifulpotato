If a group of average men and average women are thrown into the ocean and left to their own devices, after a few hours more men will be left just because of physical strength.  Nothing to do with sexism.<p>Also, it seems like the authors are going out of their way to say that chivalry actually doesn’t happen much, that men didn’t want to help women, etc, so that makes me think they have an agenda and I’m less likely to believe their conclusions that are counter to my intuition and experience.')
