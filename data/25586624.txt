I would advocate that the extra spacing should be handled at presentation time.<p><i>Extra</i> space between sentences is standard in English typesetting (spacing in printed text is language-specific BTW) precisely for readability: it lets you, in general, read by sentence.<p>The problems with deferring it to presentation are 1 - &quot;raw&quot;=ish text often <i>is</i> the presentation (consider just long text in a code comment -- and almost anything in the terminal) and 2 - you don&#x27;t always write in text that is undergoing any kind of presentation processing in realtime (e.g. you&#x27;re writing TeX, or Markdown for that matter).  You want to be able to read it easily.<p>The inverse is not a problem: a typesetting system can just coalesce spacing and make its own inter-sentence spacing decisions.')
