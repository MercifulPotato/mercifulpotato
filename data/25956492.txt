Item(by='gus_massa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611922514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25956033, text='Yes, but the dupe detector is weak, so articles can be resubmitted after some time when they didn&#x27;t get enough traction. The rues are not very clear (How much time? How many upvotes? How many comments?), it&#x27;s art of the secret sauce and perhaps the mods change the details from time to time.<p>So, here we usually link the previous submission if it has a lot of upvotes or comments. But in this had one upvote and one comment (and the URL is wrong?), that is clearly too few.<p>As always, there are exceptions, when the previous post has a very good comment. I like to link to the comment and perhaps copy a small part.')
