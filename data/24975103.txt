If you want to lose weight, you eat less and burn more and that is it. Not losing enough weight? Don’t quit. Just run more and eat even less. Or run even more and maintain your diet.<p>There is no human that won’t shed weight like water off a roof if given energy expenditure coupled with restricted intake. And its easy to overwhelm yourself with energy expenditure if you wanted to still eat like a pig: start running up and down bleachers until you are on the verge of puking and watch the pounds fly off.<p>The reason why so many people are overweight is because they spend their life sitting in bed, sitting at work, sitting in their car, burning tens of calories. Then they try cutting out a 300 cal muffin from their daily intake and wonder why it takes 6 months to lose 5 lbs. You need activity, especially if you don’t have activity in your life. It’s who we are as animals. Early humans would walk game down until it was exhausted and sitting down no longer able to even stand.
