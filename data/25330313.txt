It requires more commentary to explain here and depends on pointer manipulation above and beyond understanding the structure of the list and the actions of the algorithm. It may be easier if you think about pointer manipulation all the time, but I would consider such code a land mine, just waiting for someone to accidentally change something without enough understanding.')
