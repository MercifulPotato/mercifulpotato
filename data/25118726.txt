I do try to read all sides, but this did not come on my radar (Though I did not, before you posted this, google DKIM+Biden, I did read tens of articles about those emails mostly from republican leaning outlets, and it wasn&#x27;t mentioned in any of those I read).<p>But it does support my thesis that DKIM or no DKIM is not what gives (or doesn&#x27;t give) any credence to the authenticity (or lack of it) -- here we have a high profile case, with DKIM validation (which a lot of people on this thread cleim &quot;is considered proof by people who don&#x27;t understand it&quot;) and it seems to make no difference even in the court of public opinion - those who accepted it, accpeted it without DKIM, and those who rejected it as russian disinformation, rejected it even with DKIM.')
