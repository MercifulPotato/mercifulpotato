I can manually find the lowest price by sorting by price but I can&#x27;t seem to reverse it to show the highest price first...<p>Anyway, it seems that there are orders of magnitude differences for the same service.<p>The service &#x27;MRI Lumbar Spine With &amp; Without Contrast Material&#x27; has a lowest price of $210 while the closest and highest I personally could find was ~$4109.<p>How can there be such a large difference in price for something that, I believe, is legally &amp; medically the same procedure?')
