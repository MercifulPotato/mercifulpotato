The new rules seem incredibly restrictive. My current salary puts me at the level 3 prevailing wage for software engineer in my area. The new rules would require a ~30% raise in order to qualify for the H-1B. Can my employer re-classify me to a level 1 prevailing wage worker before my H-1B application so that I can qualify? For context, I graduated with a bachelors degree in computer science from a US university in 2018.<p>I ask, because I work for a startup that would struggle to justify such a large raise.<p>Thank you')
