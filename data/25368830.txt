It&#x27;s not even as bad as &quot;This car was driven by a little old lady only to church on Sundays.&quot;<p>The usual startup seed round pitch deck predictions are worse than the bible quote.<p>If you want to find an actual lie, maybe you can.  I&#x27;m surprised the media apparently has not tried.  One place to start is what he has said about spending money to rebuild the US military.  IIRC he has mentioned some $trillions.  I&#x27;d like to see the INCREASES over what the DoD has been getting right along, and those might not be $trillions.  I.e., a significant fraction of the DoD budget, maybe his $trillions, went for just on-going, routine expenses and not rebuilding.<p>Even if I&#x27;m correct here, I still don&#x27;t call that a 100% lie -- it&#x27;s more like bending some definitions in budgeting and accounting.<p>But, again, much of the mainstream media seems eager to find Trump lies, so if Trump was wrong here the media should have gotten some headlines about it.<p>&gt; The idea that Trump hasn&#x27;t told a single lie in 5 years is so comically false that one doesn&#x27;t even know where to begin.<p>I&#x27;m still willing to hear, wanting to hear, waiting to hear about three good lies.<p>I get it: You don&#x27;t like Trump so attack me because I do like Trump.<p>So, why do I like Trump, a lot, regard him as by far the best POTUS since Washington.  The main reasons are his policies and results.  Here are some examples, from typing quickly:<p>He got a really good start on peace in the Mideast (a) among the Islamic states and (b) between Israel and some of the more progressive Islamic states.<p>He has Iran&#x27;s international mischief calmed down.<p>Assad was really slow as a chemistry student, and Trump gave him a good chemistry lesson and a good repeat of the course.  In this, no US people were harmed.  For the second lesson, no US or Syrian people were harmed.<p>Trump got some US military leadership that used mostly existing US forces in Iraq to lead a joint US-Iraq attack on the ISIS land holdings.  The US did the intel, operated the artillery and airplanes, and trained the Iraqis.  Some ISIS fighters are still loose, but basically the ISIS landholdings have been cleaned of ISIS power.<p>Trump got head of ISIS, al Baghdadi.  No US blood was shed.<p>Trump got Iran terrorist leader Soleimani. No US blood was shed.  IIRC O. North said that the vehicle was hit by 4 Hellfire missiles -- IIRC one can kill a tank!<p>Supposedly the US was on the way to a shooting war with North Korea.  Trump had some sit downs with Kim Ding Dong Dung Jong Un in Ping Pong Yang, and since then no nuke tests and no long range missile tests.<p>The US is energy independent now with quite a lot more energy on the way from the Permian Basin, offshore, various fracking sites, ..., ANWR.<p>Supposedly Foxconn will be building plants in the US after some state level politics settles out.<p>Trump seems to have slowed US companies and jobs moving out of the US and workers and products being shipped into the US -- that is all good for US workers.<p>The economy seems to have low interest rates, high growth, low inflation, high stock market.  I&#x27;d like to see more details about the macro economy, but it looks good.<p>The Opportunity Zones sound like a good idea, but I don&#x27;t know how far they have gotten so far.<p>The Warp Speed Covid vaccine development looks to me like some terrific, unique, world class Trump leadership.  Also the early shutting down travel with China, where apparently Trump was the only one in the room ready to do this, looks like a prescient masterstroke.  The attack that he was being xenophobic was dirty pool -- that looks like a lie.<p>Trump has gotten some really big rallies, truck parades, boat parades -- maybe CNN, NBC, NYT, ... and the Democrats don&#x27;t like him, but a LOT of citizens do, a lot.<p>I like that Trump does emphasize Christmas again.<p>Trump gave long term funding for the Historically Black Colleges.  I&#x27;m not Black, but that funding sounds like a good idea to me, better use of money than rushing to lock up Biden&#x27;s &quot;predators&quot; and Hillary&#x27;s &quot;superpredators&quot; -- details in<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;07&#x2F;politics&#x2F;biden-1993-speech-predators&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;07&#x2F;politics&#x2F;biden-1993-speech-pr...</a><p>Trump worked hard, did what was necessary, and made a great start on The Wall which will help a LOT keeping criminals and illegal drugs out of the US.  That illegal drug situation is big stuff, e.g., 72,000 US deaths in 2017 as in<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drugabuse.gov&#x2F;related-topics&#x2F;trends-statistics&#x2F;overdose-death-rates" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drugabuse.gov&#x2F;related-topics&#x2F;trends-statistics&#x2F;o...</a><p>E.g., those illegal drug deaths in a few years exceed the Covid deaths, maybe over the whole time of the Covid pandemic the illegal drug deaths will exceed the Covid deaths.<p>Trump got a lot of the NATO countries to put their ante in the pot.<p>I&#x27;m not Jewish, but I approve of Trump moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and getting the deal with the UAE, etc. done.<p>Apparently he has responded well to the various natural disasters, hurricanes, tornadoes, forest fires (maybe from poor forest management), etc.<p>Trump claims to have rolled back a lot of excessive, absurd, wasteful regulations.  I haven&#x27;t seen a good list, but the anti-Trump mainstream media, e.g.,<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f1ab6uxg908&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f1ab6uxg908&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><p>which is eager to criticize him doesn&#x27;t seem to contradict his claim on regulation rollbacks.  His claim sounds good to me.<p>Apparently a LOT of voters like him:  IIRC so far in all the House <i>toss-up</i> races, the Republicans have won them all.  A bit amazing.<p>Boeing got into deep sticky stuff.  We need Boeing.  Apparently somehow Trump helped Boeing, and now their Max is about to fly again.<p>Trump wants to tweak FCC or some such Section 230 or some such.  If Facebook, Twitter, Youtube are <i>publishers</i>, then they can be sued for libel, slander, etc.  But if they are just <i>a straight wire with gain</i>, then they transmit nothing of their own but nearly everything their users send.  Or some such.  I suspect he is correct that 230 needs tweaking.<p>The US was in deep smelly stuff with our most important ally, England.  Trump patched up the problem, got the bust of Churchill back in the Oval Office, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not a woman, but I like the idea of women leaving behind the pearl necklace twisting, the smelling salts, the delicate flower that needs to be cared for, etc., and Trump has a lot of very capable women around, Melania, Ivanka, DeVos, Kelly Conway, etc.  Those are good examples for girls and women everywhere.<p>I typed this quickly.  There&#x27;s a lot more I like that he&#x27;s done.<p>The list of policies and results I care about.  The list of <i>lies</i> you gave don&#x27;t bother me at all.<p>My reading of his intentions is that he really cares.  Certainly he doesn&#x27;t need the job.')
