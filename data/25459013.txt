That&#x27;s called thinking for yourself and one benefit of doing so is that when other people tell me I&#x27;m not thinking for myself, I know that they&#x27;re wrong because I know that I have direct access to the truth. People who don&#x27;t think for themselves rely on others for access to the truth.')
