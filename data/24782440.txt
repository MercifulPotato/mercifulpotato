I&#x27;m curious if there are reasons not to use a .env file though?</i><p>Because often that .env file will get checked into source control (sometimes intentionally, sometimes accidentally), and then you have secrets in your git history that you need to rotate.<p>In general the best thing to do is store your secrets in a place&#x2F;service specifically designed for secrets, and either fetch them directly into the container in your entrypoint, or pull them into a location that you mount as a volume in the container.<p>&gt; <i>I&#x27;d prefer to trust the container system isolation rather than playing with users and permissions.</i><p>Don&#x27;t.  Containers don&#x27;t give you full isolation.  The &#x27;root&#x27; user inside the container is the same &#x27;root&#x27; user as outside, and container escapes may be possible.  A good defense-in-depth strategy suggests that you should run things using the least privileges possible, and that doesn&#x27;t change just because something is running in a container.')
