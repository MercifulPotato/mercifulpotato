It wasn&#x27;t until I was relatively successful and making ~$80k &#x2F; year that I felt like it was reasonable to invest in a nice mattress, and even then, I came to the conclusion that the &quot;mattress store&quot; beds were way overpriced and had little to differentiate them.<p>I ended up with a memory foam bed off Amazon. It was ~$200 for a queen and I&#x27;ve had it for about five years. The biggest issue I have with it is that the fabric seems to take stains more readily than my previous mattresses. Comfort-wise, I&#x27;d put it on part with a $1,500+ &quot;mattress store&quot; brand, so I&#x27;m happy replacing it every few years and passing my old one on to someone who doesn&#x27;t have a decent one. In fact, it&#x27;s getting to be about that time...')
