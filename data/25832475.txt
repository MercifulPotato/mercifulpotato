Item(by='lookalike74', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611056603, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25832275, text='For almost a year, I have worked for a forward-thinking doctor who started funding the development of an app after he realized that many of his patients receiving chronic care management by phone could be better served. He also realized he could sell it as a turnkey service for other doctors without any remote care solutions of their own. So the advent of the pandemic saw a brief layoff period of two weeks, then a hiring spree that has remained more or less constant since then. The problem, however, is that the doctor tries to run this app company on his own - and he&#x27;s still a doctor all day, too. So organizationally we&#x27;re a wreck. We have no formal onboarding process, no formal training process, no clear rules on handling patients, and from what I can tell there are still no clear plans to develop any of those. So we&#x27;ve grown the number of clinics, doctors, and patients we serve, plus we&#x27;ve developed a glitchy but very useful app. But I think we&#x27;ll be out of business within a year unless someone experienced in tech development can convince the doctor he has no idea what he&#x27;s doing.')
