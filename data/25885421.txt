If you expect relatively quick responses, that&#x27;s unlikely when I&#x27;m in the zone. Should I turn off Slack and turn it back on when  g You&#x27;ll have about 2 minutes to catch me about once every 20 minutes.<p>Usually I&#x27;m quite responsive, but sometimes I might be head down for an hour. Toggling my Slack status on and off 5-10 times per hour for that doesn&#x27;t make sense.')
