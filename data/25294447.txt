It sounds like Gebru and her co-authors were not given an opportunity to respond to the criticisms to stave off retraction. If you&#x27;ve experienced peer review, you know that such reviews are by no means a definitive analysis of a paper, and one usually gets the opportunity to respond. Here, it sounds like anonymous internal peer review was used as a hammer to retract it. Dean&#x27;s descriptions of the criticisms sounds rather pedestrian to me, as a researcher, and I&#x27;m sure Gebru and her co-authors would push back on these characterizations.<p>Honestly, it sounds like the paper was attacking some sacred cows internally. And Gebru&#x27;s work probably threatened other researchers on other teams. Not unlike traditional peer review mind you, but at least one can usually post in on arXiv without worrying about this.')
