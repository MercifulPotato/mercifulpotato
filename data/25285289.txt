As of now, I am a maker of tiny products, you can say I build products within 24 hours and try to sell it. I still believe this works as I had 1 sale. (But, the problem is that... it is still 1 sale). I don’t know if it is due to my small followers (22 in Twitters plus a few in Product Hunt) or simply the products I built didn’t meet the needs of the community. I would appreciate your thoughts and suggestions. Thank you.')
