In reality for every successful flipper of the sort you&#x27;re picturing in your head there will necessarily be many suckers who have a cargo-cult understanding of the problem. Please don&#x27;t take it the wrong way but I am seeing a little bit of that here as there seems to be some magical thinking going between &quot;I&#x27;m young&quot; and &quot;I should be able to hustle successfully just by taking the time to learn a bit about it&quot;<p>If there was a reliable (the keyword here)and&#x2F;or freely accessible way of just doubling your money like this, we&#x27;d all know about it. In reality, you will have to observe your current environment and find opportunities there. Usually people will either not be aware of the opportunities available to you or will not spend time educating you about them instead of pursuing them themselves. If they do, it means that the opportunity is in the teaching (think pick-axe salesmen during the gold rush).<p>In the end, keep in mind that you might also be successful or not for reasons entirely beyond your own strategic choices.')
