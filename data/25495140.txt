I don&#x27;t like many of the existing bolt-on type systems for Ruby and the whole thing feels so much more kosher when it&#x27;s official.<p>The concurrency stuff is cool but I can&#x27;t really comment on it, my rule is &quot;if you&#x27;re going to even think about threads, just use Java or go&quot; since concurrency is so nice there.<p>I really wish ruby had won over python as the &quot;general purpose scripting language&quot;, I like it better. For example, I wish all the &quot;big data&quot; tooling was written in Ruby. But python is just the lingua franca. PySpark, Pandas, Airflow, etc are all python. I&#x27;m not really going anywhere with this, just lamenting I don&#x27;t get to do more Ruby in my day job. I recently switched to writing python at home just because my productivity is so much better because I&#x27;ve memorized the standard library better from using it for years at work.')
