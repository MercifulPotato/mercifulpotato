If you are a reader playing the fast-story slot machine game, it&#x27;s just noise until you jackpot. The big question is what is the effect of all that noise over time, and what does it make you deaf to?<p>If the social platforms were just imposing costs on being wrong that would almost be a service, but I get the impression from all the ban stories that they&#x27;re staffed mostly by people who aren&#x27;t equipped to be that judicious.
