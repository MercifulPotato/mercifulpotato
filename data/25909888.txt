I genuinely appreciate the feedback and advice, and 100% agree with each of your points.  I am the first to admit product &#x2F;= business and project &#x2F;= startup, but the terms do definitely get interchanged a lot now.<p>my comments above fail to clarify that &#x27;hunkering down&#x27; is not the only aspect of building something successful, nor do i think the &#x27;12-, 24-&#x27; hour hack sessions  (regardless of what you&#x27;re building) are a good formula to success, i&#x27;ve been very guilty of putting in the work but not doing so smartly in the past. I guess i was just trying to nail home the fact that if you want to start something on the side it IS going to take extra work, and that might be uncomfortable in the beginning, but some work is necessary.<p>And i also definitely agree with the fact that many of my ideas don&#x27;t lead to community, and agree that a vibrant community is a great means to success, most of these are &#x27;scratch my own itch&#x27; type projects. But my primary point was , good or bad, ideas surround us daily.<p>Thanks for your advice and feedback.  I genuinely appreciate it!')
