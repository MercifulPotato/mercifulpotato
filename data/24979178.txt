Builds sporadically failed for years, they took forever to add any kind of MFA at all.<p>Docker also has been a business since day 1. They didn’t write open source software because it was a “nice thing”, they saw a market for an open source container solution. I’m thus not worried that using non-Docker-operated registries will impact the future prospects of open source.')
