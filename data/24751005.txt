Drum kits in particular are among the most complicated instruments and can have anywhere from 3-16 channels dedicated to it. It&#x27;s not uncommon to use three microphones to capture different aspects of the kick drum alone: 1) Inside the kick by the beater, 2) outside the kick by the resonant head and 3) a mic that captures the subby &quot;chest&quot; frequencies that you only feel in your body.<p>Additionally, certain groups of instruments have interdependent relationships that react to one another. For example when the kick drum hits, the bass might &quot;duck down&quot; out of the way (temporarily) so that they aren&#x27;t occupying the same sonic space. This dynamic relationship between instruments helps to make a song groove more and have greater impact. Any given song could have numerous dynamic relationships like this that are set up by the audio engineer. Some of the magic or &quot;vibe&quot; of a given recording can go away when you selectively mute or disable certain instrument groups.<p>Sometimes the only option you have to preserve that exact balance between the instruments is to print the stereo buss. Printing the instruemnts individually can kill the vibe.')
