What did the states actually agree on?<p>Among other things, that each state is responsible for it&#x27;s own elections and just as Texas can&#x27;t set Tennessee&#x27;s tax regime or state penal code, they also can&#x27;t tell PA, MI, GA and WI how to run their elections.<p>Actually, it goes even further than that.  The US Constitution (ratified by all fifty states when they <i>joined</i> the union states (Article II, Clause II):<p>&quot;<i>Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct</i>, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.&quot;<p>In each state, <i>sole authority</i> for selecting electors is vested in the legislature of that state.<p>In fact[0], <i>the Constitution provides that the settlement of presidential election disputes first happens within the state legal system</i> under powers granted by Article 2, Section 1. In a 2016 analysis of presidential election disputes, the Congressional Research Service said that <i>“under the United States Constitution, these elections for presidential electors are administered and regulated in the first instance by the states, and state laws have established the procedures for ballot security, tallying the votes, challenging the vote count, recounts, and election contests within their respective jurisdictions.”</i><p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;constitutioncenter.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-constitution-and-contested-presidential-elections" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;constitutioncenter.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-constitution-and-con...</a>')
