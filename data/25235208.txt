I just bought two eBikes in the last six months and I love them so much. One thing that I really hate though is how hard it is to change flat tires and dealing with the bike shops. I can&#x27;t imagine an older person being able to change the tires on either of my eBikes. I swapped out one pair for a pair that is somewhat easier to work with but it can still take me 20 minutes to put on a new tube. \n The bike shops in my area are horrendous. There are three that I just don&#x27;t visit anymore. I&#x27;m trying to find good ones to use but they are so slammed right now due to covid that it can take 2 to 3 weeks for a large repair.  \n And they have told me they won&#x27;t do anything for my eBikes if I didn&#x27;t buy them there. \n I love riding bikes but there is so much about the bike industry that I find infuriating.')
