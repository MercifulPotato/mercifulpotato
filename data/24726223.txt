Selden precedent.<p>Contemporary judges, including on the Supreme Court, aren&#x27;t interested in reconciling Oracle&#x27;s argument with Baker v. Selden; there&#x27;s no love for Baker. Courts may pay lip service to the notion that ideas can&#x27;t be copyrighted, but the prospect of ruling as a matter of law that specific, concrete categories of works are categorically not copyrightable (especially if they&#x27;re not patentable) seems illogical to them. Previous hard exclusions, like those related to automobile designs, textiles, and databases are already on the way out, unfortunately, just like the idea that entry into the public domain is a one-way street. The case law has been slowly moving in this direction for at least 20 years, but it&#x27;s too painful for many to admit despite judges (e.g. Ginsburg) being crystal clear about the direction they want to take things.<p>Judge Alsup&#x27;s original opinion declaring APIs not copyrightable is brilliant and the best argument anyone could possibly make. It <i>is</i> the best argument, period, IMO. But the basic premise is just anathema to the majority perspective on courts&#x27; role regarding the application of copyright law.')
