Since you had a video rental store, you might&#x27;ve had a location actually suited for it, but for the rest of us kids, it was a tall order to find another friend who had:<p>- Another PSX<p>- Another copy of Bushido Blade<p>- A spare TV that they could bring over<p>- A room big enough to have two TVs and consoles setup within a few feet of each other so that the cable could reach.<p>After taking the time to set all that up, simply playing the game in POV mode felt like a disappointment.<p>But I agree, Bushido Blade 1 was the superior entry. BB2 fell into the common trap of &quot;fix up the kinks and &#x27;polish&#x27; the sequel, but lose what made the original feel special along the way&quot;. The other thing that most people don&#x27;t know is that while each character can <i>technically</i> wield any of the weapons, everyone has a preferred weapon, and wielding it unlocks unique moves for that character. This wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the manual, nor in any of the online FAQs back in the day, so unless you had shelled out for the Strategy Guide, that whole dimension of combat was unknown to most people.<p>The original developer behind Bushido Blade went on to make the &quot;Kengo: Master of Bushido&quot; series, which was something of a spiritual successor, but IMO all of them were garbage. The closest thing it ever got in my mind was the original <i>Way of the Samurai</i> for the PS2 (another game which got a bunch of sequels, all significantly worse than the original).')
