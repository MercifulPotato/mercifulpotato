I&#x27;ve owned a <i>lot</i> of IKEA furniture and I think it&#x27;s really durable.  I have a bedroom set (Hemnes) that I&#x27;ve hauled around to six different places over the years and it still serving well in the guest room.  I never bothered to even unload the dresser full of clothes, I just wrap it up in shipping plastic and haul it on a dolly.<p>However, even their crap can be really rugged.  I have this $5 side table that I&#x27;ve been dragging around for a decade now that just won&#x27;t die.')
