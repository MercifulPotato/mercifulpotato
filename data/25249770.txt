Middle school kid just didn&#x27;t look and stepped into the road about 35&#x27; in front of me. I slammed the clutch and brake and the deceleration was very rapid. No contact or injuries - plenty of room. Not sure how he didn&#x27;t hear the loud(ish) car coming up the hill prior to that.<p>Old car (60-0 in 120&#x27; when new, more likely much longer at this point): Doing about 35 mph. High school kid wearing earbuds decides to step out without looking about 20&#x27; in front of me. I feather the pedal and it wasn&#x27;t looking good. At least the kid heard the right front lock-up an got back on the side of the road. If he were walking on the correct side of the road, this wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue since you can see the oncoming traffic close to you (no sidewalk).<p>What is it with people not looking before crossing the street? They teach this in pre-K&#x2F;Kindergarden.')
