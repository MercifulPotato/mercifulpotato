County sheriffs only have direct jurisdiction over unincorporated areas, which are typically rural and are unlikely to be a significant source of spread.<p>2. These orders are likely intended to give local governments stronger authority to shut down gatherings, should they choose to use it.<p>3. Even if local authorities refuse to enforce the orders, there are no explicitly COVID-19 liability protections for businesses that I&#x27;m aware of. If an outbreak occurs that can be traced back to a business that was operating against regulations, that in and of itself would make the business operators jointly (if not entirely) liable, and would give insurance companies a defensible reason for not paying out claims.')
