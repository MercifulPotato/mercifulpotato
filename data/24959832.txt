Hoare logic and the predicate calculus are entirely adequate for formal derivation in any language with well-documented semantics. Lamport himself has contributed significantly to the field. Unfortunately the American dominated programming industry has a strange phobia about mathematical reasoning[1]. The irrationality is exposed by patently ridiculous statements like that formal derivation doesn&#x27;t scale. If you believe that, then you can&#x27;t believe any nontrivial results from the hard physical sciences or pure mathematics. The actuality is that formal derivation makes building nontrivial constructs considerably easier. It is a tool, and like any tool when used properly it acts as a capability multiplier.<p>[1] This is doubly confusing to me because it&#x27;s not a matter of difficulty. Anyone with the mental horsepower to learn a modern programming language is easily capable of gaining proficiency in the predicate calculus.')
