Item(by='jsinai', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606403901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25220424, text='Dear troll&#x2F;hacker(??)&#x2F;intelectual(you must be interested in learning something, else why would you be here?) of the internet, here is some data to show why your viewpoint may be wrong:<p>Africa is on a rapidly developing trajectory, and in some ways is developing faster in the last 50 years, then European countries have developed in the last 100 years. Consider for example that Africa leapfrogged landline telephones and adopted mobile phone technology right away. Or that mobile banking was a thing in Africa long before apps like Monzo launched in the UK.<p>Now to address the specific issue of birthrates per woman. Look at the following chart [1] showing a handful of countries from around the world. Some countries only started collecting data in 1950 and some have collected data long before.<p>You will see that 200 years ago, developed countries such as the USA, UK and Sweden all had birthrates per woman of around 5-6, and this slowly decreased over the last 200 years to the current rate of about 1-2.<p>Now look at Nigeria, Tanzania and Kenya and you will see that all of them are on a rapdily decreasing trajectory and that their birthrates are at or below the USA, UK and Sweden 200 years ago. Furthermore if they continue to decrease at their current rates, it won&#x27;t be long before African countries have caught up with the rest of the world.<p>Indeed birthrates are on a downward trajectory everywhere[2].<p>Finally it is generally believed that the earth is approaching a stable population of around 9bn people [3]. If birthrates are going down globally then what is driving the increase in human population especially over the last 100 years? The answer is increased life expectancy. You can see this by looking at the official UN projections [4], and of course life expectancy over time [5].<p>I hope you learned something today. You&#x27;re welcome.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;children-born-per-woman?tab=chart&amp;time=1822..2016&amp;country=GBR~SWE~NGA~TZA~KEN~KOR~CHN~USA~OWID_WRL&amp;region=World" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;children-born-per-woman?t...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;crude-birth-rate?tab=chart&amp;stackMode=absolute&amp;time=earliest..2020&amp;country=~OWID_WRL&amp;region=World" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;crude-birth-rate?tab=char...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;16493-people-planet-earth-support.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;16493-people-planet-earth-suppor...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;historic-and-un-pop-projections-by-age" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;historic-and-un-pop-proje...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;life-expectancy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;life-expectancy</a>')
