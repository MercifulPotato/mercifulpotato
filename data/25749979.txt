He&#x27;s simply saying &quot;free speech means the government cannot arrest you for what you say&quot;, nothing more, nothing less. He furthermore argues that the right to free speech doesn&#x27;t mean everyone else can&#x27;t criticize you, have your shows&#x2F;books&#x2F;whatever canceled, shout you down, etc. He says &quot;[free speech] doesn&#x27;t shield you from criticism or consequences&quot;.<p>Now, you may or may not agree with his position (I certainly don&#x27;t agree with some key aspects of it) but Randall is explaining what free speech is, not arguing for censorship.<p>The alt text is pretty thought provoking, too.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1357&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1357&#x2F;</a>')
