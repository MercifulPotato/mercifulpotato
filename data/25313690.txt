Sometimes it&#x27;s just &quot;hey, we had this question we wanted to know the answer to and so we did some investigation and some math and figured it out.&quot;  As long as they&#x27;re questions that some other people somewhere are asking, there&#x27;s no reason why a respectable conference or journal wouldn&#x27;t accept such a paper.  It&#x27;s up to them and the reviewers to decide whether the content is a good fit for that venue.  If it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;ll get rejected; no reason for Google to involve themselves in the decision.<p>How rigorously the authors treated these questions in the paper is something we don&#x27;t know without being able to see the paper itself.')
