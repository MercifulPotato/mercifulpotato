One one Zoom, one on Meet. Both streamed from American Airlines&#x27; Go Go Inflight on an A319. The Meet worked. A few moments of dead air, but mostly streamed live audio and slides, complete with transcription. Zoom failed to connect over app and multiple browsers. At this point I&#x27;ve been trying Zoom for 15 minutes and will probably give up.')
