What self driving tech today would you trust to achieve the same today? Sometimes you don&#x27;t care about averages, because they are skewed by drunks or stupid people showing off on public roads.<p>And stats being by miles covered is generally useless: if it was accidents per number-of-performed-manouvres, it&#x27;d be useful.  Getting on an empty highway and doing 100 miles is pretty simple compared to doing 2 miles in a congested city centre.')
