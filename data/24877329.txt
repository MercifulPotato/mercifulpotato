Item(by='tomnipotent', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603520123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24876737, text='&gt; about 100 people die each day in car accidents<p>I fail to understand how this has to do with anything. There are considerably more people driving cars than interacting with the police, probably more than 10000x. Which means, you&#x27;re statistically more likely to be killed by police than in a car.<p>No other developed &quot;1st world&quot; country even comes close to the number of deaths per capita by police than the U.S. This is 850 lives and many thousands of family members affected each year by gross negligence, of which most deaths could have easily been avoided.<p>Guess what other countries share similar police killing rates as the U.S.? Iran and the Philippines.')
