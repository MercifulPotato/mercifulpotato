That’s why I think it’s a bad idea to tell someone that something they are responding to isn’t present.  Avoiding bulverism is a good step to avoid bringing things into the psychological realm.  Knock it off!<p>I get that you have a different understanding which is reasonable, but that can be expressed without telling someone they are misunderstanding.<p>“If you&#x27;re going to accuse someone of gaslighting, then do everyone the favor of actually paraphrasing their arguments correctly.”<p><i>I didn’t paraphrase anyone’s arguments.  I copied and pasted.</i>  Unless you have edited your comment in the meantime, what I said you said is literally a copy and paste from your comment.<p>I also didn’t accuse you - I asked if you were doing it, because that’s what it looked like.  I see a lot of casual gaslighting of this kind in public discussions.<p>The GP clearly is arguing that Scandinavian counties are run better.  They are <i>also</i> arguing that NZ is run better than most of the US, <i>and</i> that the US is more poorly run than other countries.<p>You read the GP’s comment through the concept of a ‘core’ argument, which excludes some parts of what the GP said as simply examples.  I think the parent reasonably doesn’t use that concept, and sees more than one argument being made.')
