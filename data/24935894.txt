Quite frankly I already have HBO and Netflix. If I also pay for YouTube and maybe even Disney Plus, it feels almost like paying as much as I paid for cable, except I also have to pay for faster internet — so at the end of the day, I’m not sure if I’m really better off as a consumer.<p>I’ve stopped using YouTube because of the crazy ads. And we tried Hulu but the forced ads were enough to have us immediately cancel the free trial. Thanks but no thanks.')
