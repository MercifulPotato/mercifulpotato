Any such error would be coming from the upstream application server.<p>If the API itself was not found that’s one of 502, 503 or 504.<p>200 responses with an error property is an antipattern precisely because of things like reverse proxies. They have no way to unpack and interpret every developers pet error format. They _do_ understand http status codes and can act accordingly, like retrying requests, not caching responses, etc as appropriate.')
