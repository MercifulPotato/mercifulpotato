Item(by='FeepingCreature', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603776101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24897226, text='&gt; I can&#x27;t imagine why your view of utopia requires that people with money get to choose who they transact with but people with goods and services must transact with anyone who has money. Can you explain why that&#x27;s fair or equitable?<p>This is not entirely an accurate description of my view. I think that also, people with money should not get to choose who they transact with on the basis of not directly related properties; the difference is not &quot;buy vs sell&quot; but one of scale. That is, I also think that for instance a large corporate chain shouldn&#x27;t be able to choose to not buy from somebody on the basis of political allegiance. &quot;Offering a service or product to the market&quot; and &quot;Acquiring a service or product from the market&quot; are symmetrical.')
