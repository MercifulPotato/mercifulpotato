Someone high up in the WF foodchain didn&#x27;t do their homework before deciding this policy.  Wearing poppies in Canada is a big deal.  Fun fact, Canada used to celebrate Thanksgiving the same date as America, but they pulled it 6 weeks forward so it wouldn&#x27;t crowd the mourning period around Remembrance Day (Nov 11).  That&#x27;s just how serious Canada is about this particular holiday.  Although an old hockey commentator got fired last year for ranting about how immigrants don&#x27;t wear enough poppies, there&#x27;s widespread support from every section of Canada about wearing poppies and in general paying some respect to the war effort around Remembrance Day.  Outside of Don Cherry&#x27;s rants though, people rarely make a political statement about it.  It&#x27;s just one of those things you do.')
