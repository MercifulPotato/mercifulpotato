Apple could be lying, but they (top executives) have stated multiple times that the mac is not an iDevice. They have also stated they have no plans to only allow installs from app store, and they understand the value of tools like brew etc...They are what makes the mac popular with developers.<p>This could all change, but until it does articles like this feel a lot like FUD. Additionally, completely dismissing the M1 as a &#x27;marginal improvement&#x27; shows a level of anti-Apple that is clearly clouding the authors judgement.')
