In C++, use switch blocks instead of if statements, combined with enums (or better yet, enum class) to get exhaustibility checking (warnings at least) from the compiler.<p>More correctly, model the entire thing as a state machine and use strong typing to prevent inadvertent or undesirable code flow changes that bypass the points of entry you are intended to use. But none of that helps here because they purposely added something that escapes the normal control flow for accessibility reasons, and instead of designing it as a part of the locked-down system, they used an escape to load the regular, unauthenticated accessibility apps for reuse.')
