Generally for image filtering, antialiasing, and alpha compositing, you want to use a linear space (though there are subtleties here). And there are even some cases you want to use a device space, as the device gamut is usually nice cube there, while it has quite the complex shape in other color spaces.</i><p>Tangent: would it be correct to conclude that if I am trying to convert a high quality image into one with a limited palette that uses dithering (basically, think of gifs here), it would be best to determine the palette in a perceptual color space, and then proceed to handle the image dithering to that palette using a linear color space?')
