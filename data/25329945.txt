Each &quot;content group&quot; has a LUKS encrypted filesystem somewhere in the cloud.  Keys are exchanged using Megolm and Matrix rooms. The filesystems are mounted via sshfs and decrypted locally. The &quot;pin&quot; is replaced by membership in a Matrix room.<p>The cloud never sees the LUKS key, and the tagging is done locally.  The cloud back-end can be changed using the Matrix control channel, so you&#x27;re not locked in to one vendor.<p>I really don&#x27;t think people will buy in though.  At this point, no one cares if their whole life story is recorded by FAAMG.')
