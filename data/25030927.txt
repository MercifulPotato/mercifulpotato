Yes, in theory you&#x27;ll hit a limit that Rust could help you go beyond. In practice, are you ever going to reach that limit?<p>Rust&#x27;s embedded support is mostly theoretical at this point, and the use cases for old-school embedded are increasingly limited. Want to write some code for that cheap off-the-shelf SoC you bought? Scala is probably a perfectly good option, because it&#x27;s probably an ARM with at least 1Gb of RAM and the JVM will run there just fine. If you&#x27;re actually writing something that has to run for months off a single charge then yeah, Scala won&#x27;t cut it whereas Rust may one day be able to. But most &quot;embedded&quot; these days isn&#x27;t like that.')
