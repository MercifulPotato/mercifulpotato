Had Trump won, and Biden voters were publishing content like this with the same lack of evidence, do you believe that Democratic senators would still be urging YouTube to take it down in the interest of fairness to Trump?  I think you know the answer to that.<p>The scary part of this is that <i>elected</i> officials, who were presumably elected by people that thought they were going to protect the freedoms granted to them by the Constitution, and who must take an oath upon taking office to &quot;support and defend the Constitution,&quot; sat down and wrote a letter that gleefully trampled all over one of our most fundamental constitutional rights.  Since they were successful in this endeavor, it <i>will</i> happen again, on other, more expansive, partisan issues.  Down the slippery slope we go.<p>The simple fact of the matter is that people are entitled to their opinions, and in the United States, they have a constitutional right to express those opinions in the same way and on the same platforms as those that disagree with them.  The only problem is that now we have politicians who believe that those rights should only be extended to those who are on their side.  Both sides of the political aisle are acting this way, and it does not bode well for our future as a country.')
