If the primary importance of something is only apparent from the big picture how is a user supposed to decide whether to use it or not? The big picture is rarely available to most programmers.<p>Maybe a user isn&#x27;t supposed to. I believe that&#x27;s the premise of Paul Graham&#x27;s Blub Paradox [1]. I certainly didn&#x27;t learn, say, Common Lisp, because I was doing a feature comparison. I had no idea what a lexical closure was at the time, and a couple of toy examples wouldn&#x27;t have convinced me of their worth. I&#x27;d been programming quite happily without them for some time by then.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blub_paradox#The_Blub_paradox" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blub_paradox#The_Blub_paradox</a>')
