Item(by='FullyFunctional', descendants=None, kids=[25259948], score=None, time=1606770954, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25257932, text='I&#x27;m am very appreciative to Apple for finally closing the endless &quot;The ISA doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; nonsense.  The ISA does matter and it&#x27;s part of what enabled Apple to go so wide.<p>However, there the article is slightly misleading.  The ROB isn&#x27;t where instructions are issued from, that would be the schedulers which usually holds a much smaller set of instruction (16 per scheduler is common).  The ROB holds everything that was decoded and not yet retired, thus including instruction that haven&#x27;t yet been issued to schedulers and more importantly, instruction that have been executed for not retired (eg. might be waiting on older instruction to retire first).')
