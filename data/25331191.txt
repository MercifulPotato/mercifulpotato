In retrospect, my first comment insinuates a lazy approach to filtering. However, I didn&#x27;t intend so, and it caused a misunderstanding, because we are in agreement. I did not intend to suggest that &#x27;allowing other people to select for you&#x27; creates a monoculture, though the lack of information in the sentence and my subsequent replies points to that.<p>&gt; I guess the only thing left to add is that you can&#x27;t read everything, but there&#x27;s a lot you could read. Given this problem, does one be an early adopter for a book or not?<p>The answer to the explore-exploit dilemma is dependent on the remaining time and your reward function, i.e. goals. I am still in my infancy as an avid reader, therefore I can not give a good enough comment.')
