If they don&#x27;t get high-paying jobs, the bootcamp doesn&#x27;t get paid back.<p>From what I&#x27;ve read though, they actually bundle the ISAs and sell them off to investors--just like the mortgage-backed securities that led to the 2008 financial crisis. So the bootcamp&#x27;s real incentive would be to generate as many ISAs to sell as possible, not to make sure the ISAs are any good.')
