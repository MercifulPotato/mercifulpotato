Just like the right to bear arms does not mean that I can own any type of military weapon.<p>As an American, I know that even in the US, free speech is not absolute, nor has it ever been.<p>And all the things you mention are, <i>in context</i>, crimes here in the US as well.<p>One of the big differences in the US (not sure about France&#x2F;The Netherlands), but in the UK it&#x27;s <i>much</i> easier to prove libel&#x2F;defamation than it is here.<p>I actually <i>could</i> say you robbed me yesterday, but if I didn&#x27;t file a police report alleging that, it would be difficult for you to successfully sue me over it.  Because you would have to prove that I knowingly did so and not only <i>intended</i> to cause injury, I actually did cause injury.<p>However, if I filed a false police report, I could be prosecuted for that -- and if you suffered some injury because I did (arrest&#x2F;imprisonment, loss of job, etc.), you could likely win a libel&#x2F;defamation lawsuit.<p>If there are people who tell you otherwise, they&#x27;re either ignorant&#x2F;uninformed or just lying.')
