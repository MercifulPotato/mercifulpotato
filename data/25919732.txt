I struggle to find a use case that isn&#x27;t limited by serialization&#x2F;deserialization.<p>AFAIK, workers are strings in and strings out. Often serialization is the most expensive operation, so adding additional serialization&#x2F;deserialization steps can decrease performance overall.<p>The only use case I can imagine that would really benefit is computation-heavy with minimal input&#x2F;output.<p>Until there is safe shared memory (please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) I don&#x27;t see many compelling use cases for web workers.')
