You are correct that cookie-equivalents are similarly regulated (including most fingerprinting techniques!). But they&#x27;re not just a special case of GDPR.<p>Most importantly, the ePD applies to cookies <i>even when they are not personal data</i>. Your post made it sound like the <i>only</i> concern is identifying users via cookies. That is not the case. Non-identifying cookies would not incur obligations under GDPR, but they do incur obligations under the ePD.')
