VIM, for instance, is my preferred editor. It&#x27;s on every Unix machine I need. I learned a ton of basic things I can do with it. I don&#x27;t customize it because I don&#x27;t usually have the permissions or the time. It lets me get in, edit, get out. You have to judge the reason for a tool.<p>Personally, the best tool for typing productivity I ever have used is a keyboard with no letters on the key caps. It also means I&#x27;m the only person in my immediate circle that can use my computer at all. My wife literally can&#x27;t use my PC.')
