Item(by='lovetocode', descendants=None, kids=[24988859], score=None, time=1604493047, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24988203, text='$0.12&#x2F;month seems expensive for such a low requirement? Is it because of the size of the function? Does GCP lack a free tier that would otherwise be free on a different platform? Not knocking your decisions. I just legitimately want to know where the cost comes from.')
