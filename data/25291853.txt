Item(by='xibalba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607017493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25291552, text='If I write my employer an email that says &quot;do x, y, and z or I resign&quot;, that is pretty obviously a resignation if x,y, and&#x2F;or z are refused.<p>In fact, there is no law that states resignation must be submitted in writing (though a contract can stipulate that requirement). I can walk into my boss&#x27; office and resign verbally with immediate effect. California is an &quot;at will&quot; state.<p>That said, I would be happy to read the source you&#x27;re citing with respect to the employment law relating to resignation if it contradicts my claims.')
