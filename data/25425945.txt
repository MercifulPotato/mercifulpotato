How do they respond to feedback? Or when something is hard? When they get stuck? How do they communicate a design? Rally a team around them? Deal with disputes? React to changing situations? Can they take the initiative or need to be told what to do? Etc, etc.<p>Together with actual coding&#x2F;design skills - and with proper management - these are the necessary conditions. All my humble opinion, of course.')
