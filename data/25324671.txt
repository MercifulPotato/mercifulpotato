It&#x27;s not even an 80&#x2F;20 split between &quot;use proven technology&quot; and &quot;explore new tools&quot;.<p>What it all comes down to at the end of the day is &quot;quality&quot;.<p>You need to have an eye for quality, you need to be able to recognize good design decisions when you see them, appreciate their worth and weigh their potential. You need to be able to make up your mind for yourself.<p>If you can spot quality in a language, framework (assuming you even need one) or database, then &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;proven&quot; become meaningless phrases.<p>Quality transcends age and hype.<p>When you can spot quality far off, you can paddle out to the swell, be there as it breaks, and enjoy a long quality ride that&#x27;s not cut short because of irrelevance. You won&#x27;t need to see thousands of surfers on a wave to know it&#x27;s a quality break.<p>With technology, the earlier you can spot quality, the sooner you can start riding the wave and benefitting from everything that comes with that (long term experience with that technology, deep understanding, the opportunity to shape or introduce key design decisions at a critical stage, learning from new ideas that can compound earlier into your own output, new connections and marketing opportunities). That&#x27;s how it always works. There&#x27;s no point catching a wave because everyone else is riding it. By then, you probably need to be paddling out for the next big swell.<p>To be clear, this is more than &quot;skating to where you think the puck will be&quot;. This is looking for quality and having an eye for it, and being sure of it when you find it.')
