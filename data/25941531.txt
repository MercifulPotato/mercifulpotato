For instance, I can vouch for the security of my desktop (except for the times I run some random development stuff bound to 0.0.0.0, for convenient multi-machine access). I can&#x27;t vouch for the security of my printer, or my IoT bridge. As long as it stays true, someone breaching a single device on your LAN is already creating extra security risk for your other devices.')
