To make that claim shows either bad faith or profound ignorance. Porn is incredibly harmful and degrading, both to those who perform on it as well as those who watch it. Nevermind the child porn, sex trafficking, or the blatantly non-consensual stuff, porn itself is gravely immoral and incredibly destructive. It hurts a person’s ability to have a healthy relationship. It creates obsessions and addictions that are also difficult to break. It enslaves you to your passions and blinds you. It locks you within yourself. Porn is a totalitarian regime’s dream come true. Instead of prodding  people with police batons, you drown them in isolated prurient occupations, Brave New World style. You want a revolution that increases your power (until it gets out of hand, anyway)? Begin with sexual depravity. Sell it as “liberation”. Reenact the Bacchae. A man has as many masters as he has vices, so multiply those vices in others to multiply your control over them. Give them rationalizations that keep them trapped in their vices and easy to manipulate. He who controls the passions controls the masses.<p>Thus a man is only free when he has mastery over his passions and lives according to the truth. For a man can either conform the truth to his passions (rationalization) or he can conform his passions to the truth. The first is a slave, the latter a free man.')
