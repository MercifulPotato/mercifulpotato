People who deny the existence of systemic and institutional racism?<p>&gt; As a non-white person I would have been extremely uncomfortable sitting through that.<p>Why? I ask because I&#x27;m also a non-white person who has sat through just those kind of discussions.  They weren&#x27;t &quot;comfortable&quot; - no introspective discussion of racism is - but they certainly were not hostile because the participants came  with charity  and a desire to understand themselves and the context better.<p>The tone of any conversation, defined by the attitudes of those who participate, has a great deal to do with the way people experience it.')
