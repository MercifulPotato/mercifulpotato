Comcast has no mechanism for submitting a counter-notice, and if you get too many such complaints they will ban you for up to 6 months. It&#x27;s shocking that an ISP can be so bad that they&#x27;re the impetus for moving all by themselves.<p>In your case though, if you&#x27;re interested you might be able to get a lawyer involved? Lying is generally legal, but they might have some civil liability for fraud or something. It probably wouldn&#x27;t be profitable for you, but if you won it might make you feel better.')
