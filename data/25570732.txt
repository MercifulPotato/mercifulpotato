I was not aware of the exact private prison inmate share, and I thought it to be much higher.<p>Re: &quot;worse offender&quot;, though, I guess that trophy goes to the whole system of &quot;war on drugs&quot;: legislation, legislators, corresponding policing and then jurisdiction.  It all looks and sounds just and fine and logical.  However at the end, prison work is slave work, inmates lose their right to vote, the whole &quot;war on drugs&quot; is a system where war on drugs in almost all cases is a war on POC.')
