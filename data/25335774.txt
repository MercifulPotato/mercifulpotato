This is up from $97,225.55 in 2017.<p>The average household net worth in 2020 was $746,821. It was $692,100 in 2017.<p>The disparity between these two numbers is itself a major problem, but not the point. If you have a net work of $120k you aren&#x27;t wealthy, even if you earnt that all in the last month.<p>The way you get from having no wealth to having an average amount is by working harder and earning more. However the tax system is built to punish people who earn more money from work, and reward people who gain more wealth through things like capital gains -- you pay more tax if you increase your wealth by a dollar from working than from the side-effect of being already wealthy and seeing your assets gain value. You&#x27;re also far more likely to have higher outgoings if you&#x27;re working (higher cost to live near a high paying job, commuting costs etc)<p>If you are on the median ohio wage on 37k a year, so $30,427.47 net, and spending 37k to live, your wealth doesn&#x27;t increase.<p>If you work an extra 1k, you take home $31,202.47 -- $775, 22.5% tax.<p>If you make 1k in capital gains, you keep $971, 3% tax.<p>Look at twice median wage of 74k a year. Take home 57,439.49. Extra $1k will give you 58,109.69, an extra $670 - 33% tax.<p>Make 1k in capital gains and you pay 18% tax.<p>Earn 10 times the median wage at $370k and you keep 239,713.20, 42% tax.<p>Get 1k in capital gains and you keep $764, 24% tax.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dqydj.com&#x2F;average-median-top-net-worth-percentiles&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dqydj.com&#x2F;average-median-top-net-worth-percentiles&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thebalance.com&#x2F;breakdown-of-average-monthly-household-expenses-4687519" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thebalance.com&#x2F;breakdown-of-average-monthly-hous...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goodcalculators.com&#x2F;us-salary-tax-calculator&#x2F;ohio&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goodcalculators.com&#x2F;us-salary-tax-calculator&#x2F;ohio&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smartasset.com&#x2F;investing&#x2F;capital-gains-tax-calculator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smartasset.com&#x2F;investing&#x2F;capital-gains-tax-calculato...</a>')
