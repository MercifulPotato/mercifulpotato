This is a lie&#x2F;incorrect because recipients of such material can manually report it [2] and&#x2F;or it&#x27;s possible to make the detection tool work on end points, it&#x27;s a fancy hash comparison algorithm [3].<p>The Matrix people respond to what they think &quot;lawful access&quot; is by saying that &quot;lawful access &quot; is a EE2E backdoor so they it&#x27;s impossible to have &quot;lawful access&quot; and &quot;E2EE&quot;. It&#x27;s an assumption that &quot;lawful access&quot; is a third decryption key and it&#x27;s possible to have E2EE and third party access to it as Facebook Messenger proves [2].<p>If all parties were honest the governments would say &quot;we want regular police work to have a way to lawful access E2EE messages and while you&#x27;re a it a backdoor for the intelligence agencies&quot;. The other side would have positions between &quot;no to both&quot; but most would say &quot;no backdoor, OK to past encrypted messages for police investigations and intelligence agencies with transparency reports and oversight&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;publications&#x2F;international-statement-end-to-end-encryption-and-public-safety&#x2F;international-statement-end-to-end-encryption-and-public-safety-accessible-version#signatories" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;publications&#x2F;international-sta...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;messenger-app&#x2F;android&#x2F;498828660322839?rdrhc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;messenger-app&#x2F;android&#x2F;49882866...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PhotoDNA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PhotoDNA</a>')
