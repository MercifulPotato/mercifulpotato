I love the moral shades a gray that the books cover in intense detail. That said, I think the article&#x27;s author glosses over a lot in order to present a capitalist vs. socialist narrative that feels a bit myopic.<p>I don&#x27;t think reality is so black and white. I&#x27;m not sure The Culture could really be described as a marxist utopia, given the real power + means of production within The Culture is actually in the hands of so few. Nor does Bezos&#x27;&#x2F;Elons&#x27; personal wealth necessarily have to be in conflict with their idealist view of the future.<p>This does make me want to re-read the Culture series again. I&#x27;m actually sad Amazon was unable to pick up the rights to make a TV series; that has potential to be such an incredible ride.')
