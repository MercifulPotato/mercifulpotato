So it&#x27;s like SSH on steriods, where your editor and IDE works, including all the extensions you&#x27;d expect.<p>So for example, instead of going through the hassle of building Visual Studio Code on Raspberry Pi, where there&#x27;s no official support, you can simply use the Remote - SSH extension to develop directly on the Raspbery Pi from a Windows computer. This really shines when the Linux machine you&#x27;re connecting to is headless.<p>The Remote - WSL extension allows the same thing but in a more direct way by connecting to a WSL installation on your Windows computer.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;remote&#x2F;remote-overview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;remote&#x2F;remote-overview</a><p>This feature is also why I&#x27;ve recently been using Visual Studio Code more and more. I think something like Emacs, once you learn it and spend a huge amount of time on, would be more performant and snappy in the end, but Visual Studio Code has too many modern features and a rather frictionless configuration and extension experience that keeps me there.')
