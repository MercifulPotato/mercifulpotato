It is an open source client for Palo Alto, Cisco, Juniper, etc. VPNs which typically are just cruft on top of IPSEC tunnels. While some of the features these VPNs offer sound cool but at the end of the day they use client side validation in the from of a &#x27;trojan&#x27; binary that is downloaded and collects a bunch of metadata about your system. Obviously this can be spoofed pretty easily if you have full control of the machine. I know it works on Linux and it should work on Mac, and Windows.<p>With some tweaking you can also use it to configure a split tunnel (at least on Linux) VPN so that your employer can&#x27;t spy on all of your web activity. (Really for any VPN you just need to update the routing table after the VPN software is running).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;openconnect&#x2F;openconnect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;openconnect&#x2F;openconnect</a>')
