Could you elaborate on what you think &#x27;Domain Driven Design&#x27; is, and what you think &#x27;boundaries&#x27; are in the context of development? It would help dispel the impression I get that you&#x27;re a clueless CTO who knows enough to be dangerous.<p>(apologies for being a bit rude perhaps; consider it a comment slightly in bad faith, but very curious to hear you prove me wrong)')
