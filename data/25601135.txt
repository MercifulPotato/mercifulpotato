Maybe the article confused the total generation from the 8 plants with and the 4 being removed.<p>They estimated 450 million to add fish ladders and rehabilitate the facilities for the next 100 years. If it was $450 million for 170 MW $2.6 million &#x2F; MW is pretty cheap construction cost. I am surprised that it isnâ€™t an attractive investment')
