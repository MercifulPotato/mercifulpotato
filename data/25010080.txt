I can at least still buy 3rd-party refilled cartridges online without worrying about them getting deactivated.<p>My dad&#x27;s printer is affected by this news, and between this and other recent issues it&#x27;s having I doubt he&#x27;ll ever buy a new HP printer again. He&#x27;s been a lifelong (dare I say lifetime) customer since buying his HP 12C calculator in the 80s, and has owned only HP printers since his first DeskJet 697c in &#x27;96.')
