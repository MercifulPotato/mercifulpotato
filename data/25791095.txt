Just curious if one has approached this site from a usability perspective? For example, one formality in usability studies is that of personnas. The name &quot;Hacker&quot;suggests a preconcieved personna? Who is this hacker? My usability and marketing spidey senses tell me hacker embodies on one hand a elite group of programmers and on the other hand a lawless band of brigands? Have you ever conducted studies on how just the name Hacker alone gates this community? Who shies away from this place and who doesn&#x27;t? I highly recommend courses by NNG for usability. The word hacker certainly has stigmas associated with it. The last study I read from NNG concluded that while many gains have been made in usabilty in the last decade, their findings were that IA, information architecture, lags significantly. IA is about word choices. If I saw an application menu with the word Hacker as a selection I would definitely flag that for review? Also I enjoy the site and Happy New Year!')
