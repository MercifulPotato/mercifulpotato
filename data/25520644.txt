Everyone has interests and strengths that over time move them in a direction to specialization. To say one codes both the front end and back end of a web site is about as general as I’d accept.<p>Example, game developers and financial systems engineers have very little shared domain knowledge and would require a huge amount of context switching on the order of months.<p>Mobile engineers also rarely want to work on server code.
