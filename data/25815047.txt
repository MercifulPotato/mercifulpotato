I feel like advertisers delivering boatloads of JS with their ads sometimes gets conflated in this discussion.<p>Another point, it&#x27;s true Reddit doesn&#x27;t need a SPA. However, while I hate their new design, at the scale of Reddit an SPA can have real effects on server costs as well as user engagement. And, if you look at their growth numbers it seems to be working out for them, despite their design churning me as a user.<p>Third, the ecosystem of well-built components means that even if you don&#x27;t really need a SPA, using React could save you money in launching your MVP, which is a big consideration for startups.<p>In the end, widgets with lower-latency interactivity, even when not absolutely necessary, is a better experience (for example, a form field that tells you what&#x27;s wrong with your password as you&#x27;re typing). Also, because the SPA crowd are building richer applications, you&#x27;re going to have access to richer open-source widgets when building with that technology. So it&#x27;s a hard thing to ask people to avoid React when it could be the difference between a great user experience and a mediocre one down the line.<p>Let&#x27;s just continue to build better SSR tools so we can have the best of both worlds. We can build tools to help developers cut JS from their app, because it&#x27;s true, eventually the latency bottle-neck isn&#x27;t the speed of a round-trip request with PHP but the speed of downloading and executing all that JS with your SPA.<p>I believe this is a loosing battle, not because of hype, but because of the business reasons for using frameworks that are capable of delivering richer widgets. We can have our cake and eat it too, instead of fighting the shift in technology.')
