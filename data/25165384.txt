In college, as soon as I got a little money in my pocket from scholarships and grants I went out and bought a Macbook.<p>If anything the nostalgic conservative position for me to take would be that Macs are still awesome and cool despite any critiques.<p>What big innovation would be scaring me away at this point? Changing architectures? That&#x27;s happened in the past. Macbooks are still macbooks more or less.<p>Locking down the system more and more each generation isn&#x27;t innovation. It isn&#x27;t &quot;conservative&quot; to criticize vendor lock in or to prefer more user freedom over the familiar comfort of Apple&#x27;s design language.')
