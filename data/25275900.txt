It is <i>never</i> easy, and you&#x27;d be surprised how many bits can leak out of what you thought was properly anonymized data.<p>If you are using data for test purposes <i>please</i> use <i>generated</i> data, not anonymized data. This has the additional advantage that there is no potential path for live data to end up on a developers machine.<p>added in edit: And also realize that just using a service such as this or similar actually increases the chances that you are leaking sensitive data, in fact uploading somewhere it is the very best way in which you could ensure that at some point there is a breach. Don&#x27;t take the &#x27;made easy&#x27; line for granted if possible ask the company for their audit reports and what measures they have in place to ensure that your data doesn&#x27;t end up elsewhere, a company providing such a service or a chunk of software that does this is - of course - a massive target. The only way you would stay away from that extra risk is by running this on your premises on a machine that is not connected directly or indirectly to the outside world.')
