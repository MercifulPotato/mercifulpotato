In the pursuit of power and profit they have advanced us towards the type of cyberpunk dystopias most of the folks posting on this forum grew up reading, and most of the people posting here are the cogs that enable some of the atrocious privacy and human rights violations that are happening on the regular.<p>I am a strong believer in the role that unions play because I grew up in a community where unions literally saved lives because managers at a smelter wanted to maximize profits and workers didn&#x27;t want to die from a massive cauldron of liquid copper or zinc exploding on them, or wanted effective safety gear when prying plates of zinc deposit from cathodes.  It may not be quite the same degree of physical risk, but the folks who screen objectionable content on social media platforms certainly deserve protections.  Gig economy workers deserve protections.  Startup employees deserve protection.  If government regulation isn&#x27;t doing the job, then unions are the natural organizations to step in, as they have during some of the most prosperous times in history.<p>Virtually all of the concerns that folks have about shitty unions (and shitty leadership) can be solved through transparency, but it is incumbent on the leaders selected by constituents of those groups (union members and investors&#x2F;founders&#x2F;executives) to choose transparency.')
