The portable API is a good idea, but could just as easily connect to a well-known gRPC service address (which could be always on-host, or not). In that case, the transport would be good ol&#x27; virtio-net (or whatever), but is otherwise the same to the user.<p>I suppose that with virtio, you can perhaps eliminate one copy (but not necessarily, since you&#x27;ll probably need to copy from the guest memory into some device-mapped buffer). Other than it being fun to write virtio backends for various hypervisors, I&#x27;m not sure what the compelling advantage is over the more naive transport? Perhaps I&#x27;m missing something.')
