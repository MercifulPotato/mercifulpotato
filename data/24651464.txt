Nobody wants a fucking $100 cable that&#x27;s going to wear out for basic fuck-it purposes. So you start to create production segmentation. Then it couples into directly shit like Microsoft refusing to implement PD in Surface Books because they do not trust on the market cables to safely handle the 100W they need without catching fire and there&#x27;s no way to verify.\nOr do you what other vendors do and &quot;fork&quot; PD so that you can make sure both devices are yours strictly.<p>Sadly it seems there is a march to making cables even more expensive to duck tape on more solutions.')
