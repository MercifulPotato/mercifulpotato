When we&#x27;ve figured something out about nature for good, the explanation is usually surprisingly simple and <i>just makes sense</i>. You know you&#x27;re most probably wrong when your model produces more questions than it answers.<p>That said, I like Stephen Wolfram&#x27;s theory of everything.
