This would have had minimal psychic toll. You can see right now that the countries that were successful with the virus response like Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam have much less restricted societies right now and also did throughout the summer. They are all mostly open with mask wearing requirements. They might have some restrictions on stadiums and large indoor gatherings but everything else is going on as normal.<p>You can end the lock downs quickly if you do the lockdowns right. This of course also includes proper government response, such as testing, contact tracing enforcing isolation, having covid clinics, etc. Not the idiotic &quot;see no evil, hear no evil, the virus will go away by itself&quot; policy of the us federal government.<p>Here I should mention that you are also off topic. The cruise ship workers were subjected to much higher psychic stress than usual people. This is mostly due to the cruise companies irresponsible behavior during the pandemic.')
