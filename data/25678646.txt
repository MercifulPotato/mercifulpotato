I think trying to make any strong statements leaning on historical data should be carefully weighed.<p>I can&#x27;t really answer what the best tactic for weighing news sources is since I think that the true measure would need to involve observing the reporters and editors behind each specific article which isn&#x27;t really feasible.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wrong for you to be hesitant about trusting NYT, and feel free to never trust an article written by Miller - I personally think she&#x27;s shown a lack of care for discovering the truth - but... Eh, balance in all things.')
