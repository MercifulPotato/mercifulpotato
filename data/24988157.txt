There are mitigations and workarounds but the issue is fundamental to the paradigm.<p>Consider this trivial counterexample:<p><pre><code>    int counter = 0;\n    label(&quot;count: %d\\n&quot;, counter);\n    if(button(&quot;increase&quot;)) { counter += 1; }\n    label(&quot;count: %d\\n&quot;, counter);\n</code></pre>\nThis is, of course, a silly little example but the same issue will arise in many practical use cases and would be much more complicated.<p>Most applications &quot;solve&quot; this by rendering new frames continuously, so the inconsistent state is only shown for one frame and will quickly disappear. This, however, has terrible power consumption implications if nothing of interest is occuring on the screen.')
