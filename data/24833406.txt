I ran numbers at one point, and came up with 8 bu&#x2F;yr corn to provide the calories for a grown adult for a year (protein, nutrients notwithstanding).  So ~2B people a year whose calories could be provided by just conventional corn produced by just the United States?<p>So if a practice reduced yield by 50%, for the US it would mean reducing the calorie yield by 1B people?  (Ethanol, feed for animals and the like ignored). How much surplus is in the system to support alternative practices?')
