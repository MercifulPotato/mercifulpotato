You don&#x27;t know how to do it, and even if you learn a few things here and there, you&#x27;re clearly not an expert in marketing (just based off your post.) Not trying to offend you, but I&#x27;m being straight - hire someone. Someone good, who has done exactly this before, preferably several times, at several different companies, with several different strategies. Someone that can see what&#x27;s happening with the numbers and feedback and tweak smartly. Pay them well or give them equity. Then retire.<p>This idea is excellent, useful, and very timely. You have a huge potential customer base out there.<p>I don&#x27;t like your pricing structure, but that&#x27;s just my opinion. Don&#x27;t want to go too in depth on this.<p>Good luck.')
