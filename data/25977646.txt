They&#x27;re often incompetent enough to even hire someone competent to do those things. The government should maybe have a dedicated unit that assists other units with procurement of IT solutions. Where the staff gets very well compensated when a project is a success. But that&#x27;s probably never going to happen, for more than one reason.')
