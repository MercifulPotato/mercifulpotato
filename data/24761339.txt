There are no active developers maintaining it full time. There is no professional support. The community is very small.<p>LibreOffice has the development work and the community. The Document Foundation could make a groveling blog post apologizing for 10 years of development on a fork of OpenOffice. They cannot offer the code of LibreOffice as the copyright to the code belongs to the individual contributors and the licenses are not compatible (in that direction). However, The Document Foundation has nothing to give the Apache OpenOffice community (unless they want to start over from scratch on reinvigorating OpenOffice).<p>&gt; Seriously, WTF is it with these people?<p>These people are upset that after 10 years of extremely active development, the &quot;upstream&quot; of the LibreOffice project still has a very large mindshare. Despite OpenOffice having barely any development in 10 years, many users still have never heard of its successor.<p>I think a better question, is the one being asked by The Document Foundation: Why won&#x27;t Apache point people to a more up-to-date office suite rather than continue to peddle an old legacy system?')
