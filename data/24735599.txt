One day about halfway through the internship, a VP told me to call him so that he could explain a couple of concepts relevant to a few pages we were putting together for a book (client presentation) due the next day.<p>Matt spent about 20 minutes on the phone with me walking me through a few derivatives-related topics and it was the most interesting and fun part of the summer by far. That  guy is smart and funny -- it&#x27;s not an act for his column.<p>He may have thought he was bad at his job but from my perspective he exemplified the good part about working at GS -- really smart people, often with a wicked sense of humor, who go out of their way to help each other out.')
