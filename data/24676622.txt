It was called XML and XML Schema.<p>It would be true if XML was not full of all this SGML debris like &quot;entities&quot; (really, uncontroller macros), if real schema formats was flexible enough (I needed &lt;c&gt; inside &lt;a&gt; and &lt;c&gt; inside &lt;b&gt; when they totally different), etc.<p>But when a config reader tool has to deal with 40+-year legacy of enterprise guys wanting to embrace the universe, but all this doesn&#x27;t allow to control contents without external measures like regexp checking... that simply shuts up facing real world.')
