Whenever I lock my screen on Windows, I get an unremovable ad from Microsoft that says I can earn money for every search if I just switch to Bing.  When you click &quot;help&quot; in Windows, it doesn&#x27;t give you help -- it opens your a browser for a Bing search for something vaguely related to the problem, and the search returns no useful results.  (It doesn&#x27;t link to as much malware as it used to.  Maybe that&#x27;s because of my ad blocker though.)<p>The reality is that Bing sucks.  Hard.  It can&#x27;t even return Microsoft&#x27;s knowledge base for a search term that Microsoft explicitly set up.  Every time, I cut-n-paste the term into Google and that is how I resolve my question.  (Of course being linked to Microsoft&#x27;s own website!  They wrote the software.  They wrote the documentation.  But their own search can&#x27;t find it!)<p>The problem is not Google being anti-competitive here.  It&#x27;s Microsoft that can&#x27;t compete.  They don&#x27;t have two employees that said &quot;hey, we should set up a monthly sync to make sure all the help in Windows gets linked to our knowledge base in Bing&quot; between someone on the Windows team and someone on the Bing team.  And that&#x27;s the kind of thing that makes your company go out of business.  The government can do very little to help you with that.')
