As an artist you pay to be on Spotify? Tried finding it just now but it just says<p>&gt; To get your music on Spotify, you need to work with a distributor, or with a record label who already has a distributor. They handle all the licensing and distribution, and pay your streaming royalties.<p>Kinda odd, why would Spotify not just let you enter an IBAN and send you your share as soon as you accumulated a minimum of â‚¬10 or something? Regardless, I see this is not as easy as signing up for YouTube and making money off of adds there.<p>I suppose I didn&#x27;t mean Spotify very specifically, it just happened to be the example and I figured they&#x27;d rather have a broader selection of music for their subscribers; the point however works just as well with YouTube or other services.')
