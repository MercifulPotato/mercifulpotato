I run this with a VyOS router and the same 5268ac that you have, but it works with things like Ubiquiti routers too. The only catch is you need three NICs on your router, but a cheap USB 10&#x2F;100 one will do for the port that connects to the 5268ac.<p>Another option is getting the 802.1x certificate out of a hacked router, but it&#x27;s not possible as far as I know on the 5268ac. You could buy a hackable ATT router but they&#x27;re not cheap. Some sellers even sell the key by itself.<p>Mysteriously, doing this fixed an issue I previously had where SSHing into AWS would fail.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jaysoffian&#x2F;eap_proxy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jaysoffian&#x2F;eap_proxy</a>')
