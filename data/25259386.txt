When one farmer retires and builds a neighborhood that&#x27;s not that different from the existing houses, it&#x27;s not a big deal.  When a property developer wants to steamroll the city&#x27;s zoning and put 200 apartments sharing a fence with people who&#x27;ve maintained the community and lived for decades with 1 or 2 neighbors, that is a big deal.  When a bunch of people from out of state decide they know what a random city should look like (ahem, strongtowns), that&#x27;s colonialism.')
