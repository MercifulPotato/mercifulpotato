Lower-level languages however also give you much more foot-guns.<p>These days my ideal app is written in Elixir for almost everything due to the insane parallelisation and fault-tolerance that it offers (and the copy semantics that make shared memory bugs impossible) with Rust sprinkled at the critically important-to-be-fast places -- like working with sqlite3 for example.<p>All of that could be achieved with Rust or any other language really. But it requires tons of tooling, CI&#x2F;CD jobs, Git hooks, static analyzers, linters, formatters etc. And a good chunk of all that doesn&#x27;t even exist for many languages.<p>So I prefer to make my own blend that has the important advantages at the right places.')
