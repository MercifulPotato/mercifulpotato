Even ADA Spark struggles to verify seemingly simple stuff [1, 2].  It is much easier if you trade compile time for runtime verification, which you can do in C# (but not Mono) or via code comments in Java [3].<p>WRT subtypes: language designers have plenty of motivation to try and push every non-core feature into a library.  Programming in Ada kinda sucks because there are soooo many reserved keywords.  You are also stuck with bad design decisions <i>forever</i>, like with Java&#x27;s Date API [4].  Since it&#x27;s relatively easy to use the newtype pattern to achieve what you want, it probably doesn&#x27;t factor into the core language design.<p>Which is to say that I largely agree with you, but the people paying for new languages have a different set of priorities.  Making a cat video database go faster is very lucrative, but it&#x27;s only with the rise of cryptocurrencies that there has been significant funding for high-assurance programming languages outside of defense and aerospace.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imperialviolet.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;07&#x2F;provers.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imperialviolet.org&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;07&#x2F;provers.html</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.adacore.com&#x2F;using-spark-to-prove-255-bit-integer-arithmetic-from-curve25519" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.adacore.com&#x2F;using-spark-to-prove-255-bit-intege...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openjml.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openjml.org&#x2F;</a><p>[4]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;1571265&#x2F;why-is-the-java-date-api-java-util-date-calendar-such-a-mess" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;1571265&#x2F;why-is-the-java-...</a>')
