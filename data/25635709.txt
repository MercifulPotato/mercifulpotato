Building something complex in a competitive environment is going to feel difficult because it is. The company can make it more or less painful and the good ones do a good job, but there&#x27;s no way around it.<p>The alternative is not to do difficult things and thus have no pressure and no responsibility. By that definition, the homeless guy on the corner is the most relaxed person (and sometimes it&#x27;s true, you see them chilled out, nobody depends on them and there&#x27;s nothing for them to achieve) but if that resonates with you then you shouldn&#x27;t be working at a company like that in the first place. Try working at the DMV instead - I am being a bit facetious but also serious, people chose their careers based in part of how much pressure&#x2F;adventure&#x2F;challenge they have an appetite for.<p>There&#x27;s no success without risk, hard work and pressure.
