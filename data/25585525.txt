Target and Walmart weren&#x27;t dead, but Amazon was eating their lunch.<p>What they are doing much better at now is the hybrid e-commerce&#x2F;brick and mortar that Amazon is struggling with. Whole Foods helped give them a platform, but Whole Foods are nowhere near as prolific as Target&#x2F;Walmart&#x2F;Best Buy.<p>For all the reasons mentioned throughout this post, Amazon has gone from my first stop to far down on the list when looking to buy something.')
