The list of playlists can&#x27;t be sorted in alphabetical order by playlist name. It seems to be ordered either by playlist creation date and&#x2F;or by when I last added a video to the list (with most recent playlists first.)  I&#x27;d say the playlist feature is next to useless to me, except that I keep using it, ever so masochistically.<p>This is a recurring grief I have with Google products: poor UI and a seeming inability to receive and&#x2F;or act upon feedback from power users.')
