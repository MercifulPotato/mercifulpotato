Item(by='Closi', descendants=None, kids=[25611483], score=None, time=1609579514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25592140, text='&gt; Most fast food restaurant franchisees probably donâ€™t have margins much above 5%<p>If we follow your train of thought, we shouldn&#x27;t see employers paying minimum wage with higher margins because those higher margins would have transpired to lower prices for consumers.<p>McDonalds corporate profit margin is 20%! People might say, &quot;Well most margin comes from franchise fees and McDonalds doesn&#x27;t directly own most restaurants or own that cost base&quot; - but while some franchisees earn 12%+ profit, they don&#x27;t even have a mechanism where they are even ALLOWED to reduce prices so how exactly are higher profits supposed to get passed back as lower prices?<p>The reality is that if a companies goal is to profit-maximise, &quot;cost plus margin&quot; is not a particularly effective strategy. From an economics perspective, you would work out what your demand curve is, plot that against your cost base to produce a profit figure for each point on the demand curve, and pick where maximises profit. In reality this will be less of a formal process, but this is the microeconomic theory.')
