The majority of the docs are just function signatures without explanation, let alone usage examples.<p>The language however is quite nice and the stdlib is fairly complete.<p>Edit: Another problem I see is the (over?) reliance on PPX preprocessors. It does make a lot of tasks simpler, but it is too much magic for me personally.')
