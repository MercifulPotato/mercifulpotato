But you also don&#x27;t and didn&#x27;t know the situation of the others in that cabin so your interpretation of how &quot;they misread you&quot; not true either. Maybe that &quot;white knight&quot; was worried that you would get in the way of him getting it on with your ex, maybe scared of not measuring up to you,  but couldn&#x27;t navigate those feelings and acted aggressively towards you by intentionally misreading you. My guess is as good as yours...')
