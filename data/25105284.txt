They run at decent speed because everything is native, but they&#x27;re forced to use Android&#x27;s kernel and device drivers which are non free, closed and therefore not trustworthy, and cannot protect themselves by malicious Android apps and&#x2F;or backdoors.\nI would rather have a truly free and open operating system in which I can set up one or more sandboxes containing all stuff I don&#x27;t trust (closed apps, Android emulation etc), that is essentially the other way around. The Pinephone ideally is trying to be a step in this direction.')
