It&#x27;s a figure next to no one will actually ever pay. Insurers pay less. If you ask for a discount you will pay less.<p>Columns H through AI represent the negotiated insurance rates or agreed schedules. AJ represents the lowest negotiated charge for that service across all providers.<p>Interesting reading, really. Aetna largely seems to pay retail, whereas others like Cigna and Emblem are getting &quot;decent&quot; discounts. Also provides a good basis for negotiation if you&#x27;re a cash payer. &quot;I can pay your minimum negotiated charge for this, or I can dispute it during collection&quot;<p>But even still, these prices are ridiculous even after negotiation and are indicative of a broken system. For what it&#x27;s worth, hospitals aren&#x27;t charging these fees because they&#x27;re profiting; many of them are struggling to stay in the black.<p>(I used to run appsec at a healthcare best practice and advisory firm. A lot of my background on this was absorbed through osmosis, though I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m an expert)')
