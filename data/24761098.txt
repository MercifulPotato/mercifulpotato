This is amazing, especially the ability to just type calculations into the terminal, e.g. &quot;5*25.4&quot; or &quot;import math&quot; and then &quot;math.asin(1)&quot;.<p>And you can use matplotlib, numpy, and cv2 directly from the terminal. Freaking awesome.<p>The only major issue I&#x27;m encountering is that if the prompt is wider than the terminal (due to your path + git branch name being too long) it goes bezerk.')
