Did I forget a quote? better wipe the display with my finger<p>&#x27;&amp;a - &quot;mut&quot; and &quot;ref&quot; but &#x27; ?<p>foo! - yelling out function calls. &quot;print!&quot; &quot;exit!&quot; &quot;macro!&quot;. Angry Codes!<p>foo? - when you&#x27;re done yelling, make sure to ask existential questions of the return result. This one I have the least problems with since it actually makes me question the return value (&quot;hm, something&#x27;s weird here, it could be null, pay attention&quot;), but when coupled with the yelling, just makes the whole thing look dramatic. &quot;do_it_now!(); did_we()?&quot;<p>fn - by itself not a huge deal, but the list of truncated words that are used frequently is &quot;impl&quot;, &quot;mut&quot; and &quot;pub&quot;. I save some characters (am I really in such a rush?) at the cost of reading this broken English &quot;f-n impl moot pahb&quot;. At least C doesn&#x27;t have that. Pascal had &quot;interface&quot; &quot;implementation&quot;, &quot;begin&quot;, &quot;end&quot;, etc. Java has &quot;public&quot;, &quot;interface&quot;, &quot;extends&quot;, &quot;class&quot;.<p>Default for Borrowed - suddenly English! No time to type &#x27;function&#x27; or &#x27;mutable&#x27; but &quot;Default for Borrowed&quot; is a-ok?<p>underscores all over the place in the standard library. Even C doesn&#x27;t have that many, mostly in the _r variants that were added.<p>unwrap() - what does that word have to do with errors? (I know what it does) It wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice.<p>I have a whole list of awesome stuff, meh-stuff and wtf-stuff I noted down about Rust while trying to learn it (on multiple occasions), and there are a lot of excellent things about Rust, but the aesthetics of the language are important, otherwise we&#x27;d all have no issues coding in Brainf*ck.<p>Yes it&#x27;s possible to go nuts with syntax, but this just feels like the &quot;programmer art&quot; of language syntax. I think it&#x27;s usable (clearly), it&#x27;s just not elegant to me.')
