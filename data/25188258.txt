Item(by='steve76', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606147979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25178458, text='If someone wants to &quot;do politics&quot;, I suggest they start by making a list of people who need to die. Kill them and then take power. That way, all the misery is contained and over before you put your name on it. There will always be people who need to die, for instance, Joseph Duncan. I would hit him with some antibiotic resistant airborne tetanus. Spread panic through the global economy to make my backers rich and my opponents poor. Crash the over-leveraged investments of competitors. And you wouldn&#x27;t even need to do it. Just make it look like it and convince everyone. Use the panic to cover up the removal of signature requirements and deadlines on ballots, as well as media collusion and corruption of federal police and attorneys.<p>I guess it&#x27;s only voter fraud if you loose. Good one. And it doesn&#x27;t hurt democracy at all. To be able to launch hundreds of court cases, to fight dirty, to push what it means to be called human in all aspects of reality, nothing wins over that.<p>What requires focus is not the bad part, but the good part. Use panic to cure the common cold or reverse aging. Troll the world into serving up society&#x27;s fingernail clippings to the head transplant doctor, and his soul to the people who image surfaces of black holes.<p>People hide their true intentions. Marxism, anarchism, decadence and debauchery. How little do they know Americans have done it already. The only choice is to walk away from power. It belongs to someone else. The world is much too big for authoritarianism, for one person to control. And the hellbound heart, this puzzle we all spend so much effort on to only tear ourselves apart, takes many forms, the least of which are militaristic.<p>No matter your ideology, your vision, there will always be one law, that there is no law.<p>Take all who dare bother me to the house of pain!!!<p>Knives!!!<p>Sharp things!!!')
