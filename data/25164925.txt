Is it safe to assume that a design focused on cutting edge performance may have compromised on security in some form? Does the fact that this is first gen indicate opportunity for hackers to discover low hanging fruit vulnerabilities possibly to the benefit of nation state or private actors?<p>I feel like the long term path for silicon will converge on extreme compartmentalization of general purpose computing hardware inside chips, designed from the ground up to achieve physical process isolation purpose built per task, with highly secure hardware IPC all on a single high perf die.<p>Interested to learn what Apple has done to build a &quot;more secure&quot; CPU design. edit: A quick web search yields relevant results on this topic already, e.g. work by Chinese based Tencent Security.')
