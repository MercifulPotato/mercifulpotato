If &quot;markets&quot; are defined as purely mathematical, then they&#x27;re not &quot;real markets&quot; (if such things even exist). If &quot;markets&quot; are part of reality, then they&#x27;re divorced from pure mathematics. Either way it&#x27;s misleading to place markets and P=NP in the same epistemological context.')
