Maybe you find it appalling to harm others? But plenty of crimes don&#x27;t harm others. So how do you feel about the rest?<p>And if enough incarcerated people and non-incarcerated people collectively believe a thing, what makes the beliefs of the non-incarcerated special given that the beliefs are the same?<p>By what we can assume is your reasoning based on your dismissal, if two thirds of the entire population believed that a thing should be legal but half of them were incarcerated for doing that very thing, the final third should be able to hold the incarcerated third hostage despite being significantly in the minority on the issue. That&#x27;s highly irrational.')
