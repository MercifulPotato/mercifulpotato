Unfortunately the tweet you referenced got that right, so the criticism still stands. See [1] for a short description.<p>I think I knew that the M0+ lacks the regular load&#x2F;store exclusive instructions from larger ARMs, handy for implementing synchronization primitives ... odd that they&#x27;ve build a dual core then? No idea how that is supposed to work, but haven&#x27;t checked the docs either.<p><i>Edit</i>: After browsing the (very nice-looking) RP2040 documents, it seems the only atomic thing on the chip is the special &quot;ghosted&quot; I&#x2F;O access. That will probably be co-opted to implement atomic data structures, but then it will be at the cost of making access to the actual peripheral whose registers are being &quot;stolen&quot; harder or impossible. Strange, hopefully I&#x27;m missing something obvious. :)<p>Also, the PIO peripherals seem awesome! Can&#x27;t wait to see all the cool things people will pull off with those. The document mentions them being capable of DVI and VGA signalling, even.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ARM_Cortex-M#Cortex-M0+" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ARM_Cortex-M#Cortex-M0+</a>')
