Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610064401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25669984, text='&gt; If someone seriously posts &quot;jet fuel can&#x27;t melt steel beams&quot; I&#x27;m going to associate them with 9&#x2F;11 truthers.<p>If you ask for a video that supposedly reveals something about 9&#x2F;11, and someone posts a video that fulfills your request, you are not then entitled to consider the person who responded to you as &quot;9&#x2F;11 truther.&quot; That would be ridiculous.<p>&gt; You (or the allegers) are just creating a narrative that&#x27;s convenient for you&#x2F;them! And filling in the details. We don&#x27;t even see them leave the building!<p>What do you think it would look like for someone to violate the chain of custody of a thumb drive on camera?<p>&gt; Here&#x27;s another one: the lady on the left gave the other one her car keys, and the girl and guy were about to sneak off to the carpark to make out. Or, it was a bag of weed, and they&#x27;re about to go to the back of the building and get high.<p>None of those require or suggest the behavior seen in the video.<p>&gt; Did you even confirm how the votes are stored? There are boxes with United States Postal Service in the background. So surely they&#x27;re counting mail ballots. There are no computers on the desks, so, it doesn&#x27;t seem the results of the counted mail ballots are being stored digitally.<p>Actually lots of voting machines read the ballot and record the result onto digital media.<p>&gt;  Do these 3 look like master hackers, or is it so easy to tamper with the digital files that it&#x27;s plausible anyone (including many in republican areas) could do it<p>In fact its so easy that up until very recently lots of mainstream orgs (like the NYT!) were sounding the alarm.<p>&gt; but you&#x27;ve only &quot;caught&quot; these 3 doing it?<p>Well first people said there was no evidence, now you&#x27;re saying there must be more evidence or this doesn&#x27;t count?')
