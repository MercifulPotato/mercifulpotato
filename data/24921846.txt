You&#x27;re never going to catch it.<p>Two, it takes more energy to get carbon out of the air than the energy it took to put it in there. So not only do you have to find clean energy to replace our current needs, you then have to find an integer multiple of that clean energy to get the carbon out, plus an <i>accelerating</i> multiple to get the postive-feedback carbon out too.<p>You&#x27;ll never get that card down to 0 if you keep spending on it.')
