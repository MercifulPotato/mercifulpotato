Item(by='studius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610907286, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25808659, text='&gt; I have never needed an SD card<p>I need to use SD cards for my camera and RPis. That&#x27;s a significant amount of users that would buy Macs, even if you don&#x27;t use them.<p>&gt; and have gone all-in on USB-C<p>The move to Thunderbolt 3 &#x2F; USB-C seemed to be hinged on the assumption that all new products would be USB-C. The prior removal of the headphone jack[1] and replacement of the lightning-adapter airbuds included with new iPhones set precedent to allow them to continue to simplify. But there&#x27;s a big difference between (a) providing a replacement that effectively works the same way and (b) having a market based on being best and svelte, but expecting that the average customer can and will buy replacement lanky adapters and big ugly hubs that get in the way (especially when the cheaper ones can cause more interference[2]).<p>Apple once had a &quot;Think Different&quot; campaign, and perhaps that transmogrified to &quot;Be the Change&quot; in the 2010s. &quot;Think Different&quot; was about producing the best product, with a quality product that worked better, not about forcing customers to take on the burden of a mess, making their lives more difficult and looking out-of-control. &quot;Be the Change&quot; is activism which often causes problems for some, with a goal of things becoming better. &quot;Think Different&quot; works better in product design and development. &quot;Be the Change&quot; is for Human Resources and Marketing.<p>&gt; Please just do MagSage + USB-C, so I can maintain my one-cable-for-everything, making traveling lighter and simpler. Here&#x27;s my counter argument to all those that love MagSafe: makes traveling a huge hassle, forcing me to carry a special charge brick that only works for ONE device. In 2021 going forward, I will flat refuse to spend money on anything that doesn&#x27;t use USB-C or Qi charging<p>It&#x27;s expected to have Thunderbolt 3 (in form of USB-C) on it. I&#x27;d assume that they will allow charging the computer from it, as that&#x27;s part of the spec of Thunderbolt 3; I&#x27;m not 100% on that, but as keeping that capability would be part of the Thunderbolt 3 spec which includes Thunderbolt, USB, DisplayPort, and 100W power input[3]. It just wouldn&#x27;t charge as quickly.<p>This MagSafe will probably be the Qi-supporting MagSafe[3][4] which can be 15W for faster charging or 7.5W for Qi and will probably support the ring chargers, probably under the  touchpad, given design choices from existing charging stands[5].<p>&gt; I can now travel with a single 2xUSB-C power brick<p>And you would probably be able to do that, but it will charge faster with MagSafe.<p>&gt; I am all for removing the TouchBar<p>Yep. I couldn&#x27;t easily change brightness or volume when in context specific mode with the settings I had by default, and it was distracting.<p>It can be emulated[6].<p>[1]- 1&#x2F;8&quot; headphone that in some Macs had optical out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-za&#x2F;guide&#x2F;mac-help&#x2F;cpmh0052&#x2F;11.0&#x2F;mac&#x2F;11.0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-za&#x2F;guide&#x2F;mac-help&#x2F;cpmh0052&#x2F;11.0...</a><p>[2]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;usb-3-and-usb-c-devices-can-cause-problems-with-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-connections-but-theres-a-solution&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;usb-3-and-usb-c-devices-can-ca...</a><p>[3]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT208368" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT208368</a><p>[4]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MagSafe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MagSafe</a><p>[5]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amazon.com&#x2F;Kensington-SmartFit-Ergonomic-15-6-Inch-Wireless&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B01IVHCVUU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amazon.com&#x2F;Kensington-SmartFit-Ergonomic-15-6-Inch-W...</a><p>[6]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sindresorhus&#x2F;touch-bar-simulator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sindresorhus&#x2F;touch-bar-simulator</a>')
