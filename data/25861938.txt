I assume Spotify just prefers to make a few big deals instead of lots of small deals. It saves them from having to manage all the individual payments, and probably the whole &quot;is this really your music?&quot; thing.<p>So the aggregator&#x27;s fee is simply an entry fee. As you can see from my numbers above, it&#x27;s not a lot of money. :)<p>To be fair, the aggregator I use offers a choice between 15% of the revenue, or a fixed yearly cost of $9.99 per release (first year may be slightly more expensive, depending on release size). Since I used to release a trickle of singles as I finished them, the per-release pricing definitely made no sense for me; the 15% thing was the best deal I could find when I started uploading in 2009-2010. Also, back then (not sure about now), some aggregators&#x27; terms actually demanded <i>exclusive</i> digital distribution rights, which was a complete non-starter for me: I wanted to put stuff on YouTube and free downloads on my website too.')
