Even <i>getting</i> to Mercury is hard.<p>I think getting off Venus from 50km up wouldn&#x27;t be too bad.  If you&#x27;ve got enough flotation to carry a research station or city or whatever, with water supply, food production, life support, etc., you can carry a fuelled up Starship and Super Heavy (if your base is smaller, use a smaller rocket [1]).  Launching them seems like it would be doable: drop in belly flop orientation, it glides a bit away as it falls, then starts the main engines and pivots to upright, and away it goes.  &quot;Landing&quot; or whatever arrival would entail seems more complicated, but you might be able to make a platform a bit like landing on a barge (but one that can go down to cushion the landing).<p>[1] A fully fuelled up Falcon 9 weighs more than the ISS, so we&#x27;re talking a big research station for this to be feasible.')
