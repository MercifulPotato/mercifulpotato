You just have to be around young children for a short while.<p>Kids will run and tumble and bonk their heads and get up laughing. Then they&#x27;ll catch their finger and look at it: if it looks fine, they carry on but of they see a drop of blood, suddenly they&#x27;re in mortal pain and the end times are nigh as they scream in agony.<p>I don&#x27;t think people grow out of that. The stakes just change as they get older.')
