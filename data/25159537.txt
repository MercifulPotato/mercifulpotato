I myself disagree at least moderately with more than half of what they say:<p><i>Increased letter height for better reading experience:</i> this makes the proportions of the letters a little awkward, and makes ascenders, descenders and capitals less distinct. There’s a <i>reason</i> why the height of x should be quite a bit less than the height of d or M. They say “see how much nicer than Consolas this is!” yet I <i>strongly</i> prefer Consolas there.<p><i>Code-specific eye movement:</i> again, increasing homogeneity regularly actually <i>decreases</i> reading performance. You do want patterns to be clear, yes, but trying to make everything closer to rectangular may well be taking things too far.<p><i>Functional сonstruction:</i> who told you tails on letters like u were “unnecessary details”? The r and g ones are more subjective (Fira Code’s r especially is perhaps unnecessarily complex), but them tails be there for a reason, as they help with orientation of the letters and pattern recognition. Note that the g <i>retained</i> the taily thing at the top right corner.<p><i>Distinctiveness of symbols:</i> I certainly have no complaints here—unless it be that the top left taily thing is inconsistent with the rest of the font, as with the letter i; but doing i and l in this way is quite common in monospaces.<p><i>Cut strokes:</i> there’s truth to the pixel grid alignment technique, so long as the size is right or hinting is employed (… which it probably isn’t, nowadays). Tech personality, yeah, that’s probably true.<p><i>Italic:</i> seems legit.<p><i>Ligatures for code:</i> “To reduce noise”? This is an extremely contentious claim that I happen to believe is drivel (largely because your fingers still have to think in terms of the actual characters when you were typing, so <i>even if</i> you’ve reduced one cognitive load—debatable—you’ve certainly introduced another). “To balance whitespace”: fairly subjective, I think; in a proportional font, you do this sort of thing via kerning, where it works easily and naturally; but I don’t much like using ligatures to achieve the effect in a monospace.')
