To me it seems to take nearly the same amount of soap exposure, and time at the sink, to wash dishes by hand.<p>Maybe if I needed gloves, I&#x27;d get frustrated with the smell your hands take on from dishgloves, but honestly washing dishes (particularly dishes that aren&#x27;t precious) is pretty easy.')
