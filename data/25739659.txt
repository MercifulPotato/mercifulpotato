But we observe other species expressing mathematical properties we communicate. Does (for example) a snail “know” or “understand” the “golden ratio”? Who knows! But a snail’s shell expresses it. That’s partly something we can observe (so it can be designated “invented”), but partly something that appears so much it’s either a biological commonality, subject to some unknown universal constant, or an expression that many forms of life find a way to express.')
