Many of the suggestions I&#x27;ve seen here are about interesting books. These may give you insight into part of a profession, but I think we need to remember that these jobs also have boring parts or that the protagonist is exceptional. After all, most people won&#x27;t read a book about an unremarkable person nor would someone write a book that includes all the boring bits. For example, most police&#x2F;investigative work involves reading through papers, waiting, minor offenses, and other boring stuff that isn&#x27;t sufficiently portrayed in media.')
