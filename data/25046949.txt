Or at all.  (Not that I&#x27;m a security expert, but that hardly makes it better when even I can see that something is nonsense).<p>Right now I know of at least half a dozen products that are marketed as having E2E encryption but do not actually implement this (no, I&#x27;m not going to out them.  See second to last paragraph as to when to be wary).  In part because executives, marketers and salespeople don&#x27;t know what it means. And in part because when explained what it means they will insist on their own definition&#x2F;interpretation and demand the product is marketed as E2E.<p>It is also important to note that quite often you are not dealing only with the company that makes a product, but the regulatory bodies that can pressure companies into complying with their wishes.<p>As for Zoom, I don&#x27;t understand why people trust them or still use their product if they are at all concerned about security.  It makes very little sense.')
