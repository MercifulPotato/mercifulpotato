People always remark about how much I eat though.  Most of them completely fail to notice that I eat only at meals, so even though it seems like I&#x27;m eating a lot, over the course of a day I&#x27;m getting no more than them.  However most of my calories are not empty snacks (even counting the desert).<p>I cook most of my meals at home though, which allows me to get enough without needing desert every meal. Plus my cooking tastes better since it is real flavor not added sugar&#x2F;salt.')
