But the trouble is that JPEG starts destroying parts of the F1 image a good deal earlier, and so you have to have parts of the image at a much higher quality than would seem necessary, lest other parts of the image be ruined. Similar happens with MP3 compression artefacts and Opus&#x2F;MP3 comparisons.<p>It would have been good if the article also included an AVIF image increased in quality to match the JPEG’s DDSIM score, or at least indicated what that quality level was. I’d expect that 30KB would be sufficient, quite possibly even 25KB.')
