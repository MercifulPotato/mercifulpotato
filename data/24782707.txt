You should read what I have to say above in reply to ISL 4 about the matter.<p><i>&#x27;Most American (and many British) readers use Farenheit to describe the weather and room temperatures, and given the context, it absolutely makes sense to use it in this article.&#x27;</i><p>You&#x27;re not trying to tell me that Quanta wasn&#x27;t hamming up the report by using Farenheit are you?  Come on, pull the other one.<p>Next, I suppose you&#x27;ll be telling me that not enforcing the use of SI units wasn&#x27;t the reason for Hubble&#x27;s &#x27;blindness&#x27;.  The UK is supposed to be metric but unlike Australia the conversion was stuffed up as it wasn&#x27;t enforced by legalization (in Australia, hardly anyone knows what Farenheit means these days).<p>The fact that the US is so damn backward in this matter is a combination of factors (a) bloody-libertarian mindedness in that people can&#x27;t be told even if it&#x27;s for their own good (just look at the US&#x27;s fiasco over masks and COVID-19 and you&#x27;ll get the message); (b) industry (mainly heavy industrial&#x2F;machining) pulled too many strings in Congress saying the conversion would cost too much; and, (c) the US education system is far too fractionalized to agree upon anything let alone the Metric System&#x2F;SI units.  Thus the US is the laughing stock of the world, as it&#x27;s the only major power left officially with imperial (British) units.  It&#x27;s even more laughable given what took place in the US in 1776!  How many more centuries does the US need?<p>That said, the people who write for Quanta and Quanta&#x27;s editorial policy ought to be in line with the rest of the scientific world. Keeping Fahrenheit only <i>&#x27;absolutely makes sense&#x27;</i> if one&#x27;s still living in a time warp that should have long since gone.  Sorry!')
