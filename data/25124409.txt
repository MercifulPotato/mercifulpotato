I&#x27;m not up-to-date on everything, but from what I remember, strep-A infection is associated with increased likelihood of RA decades later; Epstein Barr exposure (causing Giullan Barre in children and Mono in adults) is associated with higher probability for MS, and there are a few other such suspected causalities - autoimmune diseases are no joke, and it seems like they can be triggered by either a pathogen (virus, bacteria) or a vaccine (which is designed to provoke the same kind of immune reaction without letting the pathogen do harm).<p>On average to society, it is almost sure that if nothing becomes suspicious within a year, it is a net gain.<p>To individuals, the question is much more complicated - autoimmune diseases often appear in clusters; I think it is prudent for people with a history (or even family history) of autoimmune disease to hold off as much as they can - as it may take years or decades to figure out how it effects the unlucky ones (of which they are much more likely to be).')
