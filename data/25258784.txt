It lasted about six months and I finally gave up since there&#x27;s so much I do with Adobe products and they haven&#x27;t ported any of their stuff to Linux, I just run into too many problems with trying to replace those.<p>I literally loved everything about Linux with that one exception. If Linux had comparable Adobe products I&#x27;d be there 100% no problem, which is really frustrating. Everything else you can find an open source alternative for most Apple and MS products.<p>The one thing I do love about Linux is the amount of distros you can choose from. From the absolute minimalistic to brand new distros being built almost daily. If you don&#x27;t have an Adobe requirement, I&#x27;d check out the distro site and take a look around. You should be able to find something to fit what you&#x27;re doing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;distrowatch.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;distrowatch.com&#x2F;</a>')
