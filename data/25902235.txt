Many half-baked solutions handle serializing, but don&#x27;t consider how you&#x27;re going to deserialize data. And if you do anything with numbers, you may need to guard against intermediate processors that truncate all numbers to 64-bit float accuracy.<p>I took a shot at it with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;json-syntax&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;json-syntax&#x2F;</a> after doing some ad hoc solutions.<p>My approach was:<p>1. Don&#x27;t serialize directly to JSON, but convert to the &quot;jsonic&quot; types.\n2. Allow users to pick the rules they need, and make it reasonably easy to create new rules.\n3. Generate picklable encoding and decoding functions.<p>It&#x27;s worked pretty well for a project that has a very complex set of objects that need to be transmitted via JSON. The main difficulty is that it depends on interrogating Python&#x27;s type annotations, which were pretty sketchy in earlier versions.')
