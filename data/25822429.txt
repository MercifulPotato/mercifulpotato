We installed all-LED lighting in the office. Over the past two years way over 50% of the LED lamps have died. Yesterday I ordered yet another batch of 25 new LED lamps. The office isn&#x27;t even all that big, just four rooms.<p>And this is without dimmers. In the hallway, where there is a dimmer, the LED lamps (that are marked as supporting use with dimmer) dies after only a few months. Our hallway is dark at the moment, because it is just too much effort to replace the lamps.<p>IMHO the biggest boost for LED lamps would be for the longevity ratings to at least somewhat correlate with real world life time...')
