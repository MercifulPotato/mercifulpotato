They&#x27;ll decide that some branch of the organization is rotten and they&#x27;ll prune it. Pruning has the advantage that whatever the negative behavior is it leaves with the offending group.<p>Advice if you work at a place like that and find you&#x27;re under a bad boss or your coworkers are assholes you need to transfer out. Otherwise eventually you&#x27;ll get made redundant with the rest of them.')
