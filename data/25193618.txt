According to anybody who&#x27;s not blinded by partisanship.<p>Thats your perspective. The law says differently.<p>&gt; The objective reality is that there is no path to a Trump victory.<p>In fact that&#x27;s not the case, although I can understand how you would feel that way, since the media has been negligent in informing the public about the facts.<p>&gt; All that&#x27;s left is Trump desperately trying to somehow prevent the inevitable, and looking hopeless, desperate, and delusional in the process. That&#x27;s the reality.<p>No, that&#x27;s a picture painted by partisans who are hoping to bully people into accepting their preferred outcome prematurely.<p>&gt; And: &quot;win&quot;? Biden won. No &quot;quotes&quot; about it.<p>The winner won&#x27;t be official until electors are chosen. Thats how the system works. Although I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you would have called Al Gore delusional at this stage of the process in 2000 as well.<p>Thanks for the reply.')
