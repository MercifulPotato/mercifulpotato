Carefully planned waterfall style development will actively hurt you at this stage, because you have no idea where you&#x27;re going yet.  If you find something promising and want to scale it, then you slow down a little and check your work.  This continues as you scale, and by the time your billion dollar business depends on your clever algorithm, the update process for your production version should look a lot more like the bridge building process.')
