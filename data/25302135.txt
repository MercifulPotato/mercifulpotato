Item(by='klmr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607089514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25301975, text='The study was <i>designed</i> to tease out mask-wearing by attempting to control for other factors via its study design. — They did this specifically by comparing a mask-wearing city with a synthetic control unit based on reference populations without mask-wearing rules. So the hypothesis “mask-wearing helps” is, <i>by design</i>, not post-hoc.<p>You’re right that it’s a single data point (though with a strong effect size). And, being an observational study, it simply can’t exclude all confounding factors, and will never approach the strength that a controlled study could. Nobody is disputing that. Interpretation of observational studies always needs to be tempered by the reality that it’s impossible to control for all confounders.<p>But within these given constraints the study essentially provides <i>as strong</i> evidence as could reasonably be expected (unless the study has a flaw that I’m overlooking and which, as far as I know, hasn’t yet been pointed out elsewhere). Their design of the synthetic control is statistically sound and controls for a very large number of reasonable confounders. And, contrary to the claim in the comment I’m replying to, data from other cities does <i>not</i> invalidate the study’s findings. As far as I can see, the study’s inadequacies are all due to external circumstances and not because it’s a bad study.')
