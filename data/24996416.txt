A asks B &quot;who can help&quot;, B says &quot;Firm C know how to help you -  know the managing partner there and he fixes stuff like this all the time&quot;.<p>This is code for &quot;give C work or you will get sacked.&quot;<p>B will receive information and assistance from C, possibly a job himself in the future.<p>A will receive 12 - 36 more months of employment as CEO while she&#x2F;he implements the change program proposed by C. A will get $4m -&gt; $45m of pay for this. The change program will have a random impact, because there is no evidence that any of them are efficacious or applicable in any context - so they are randomly applied and even if they can help sometimes they don&#x27;t mostly.<p>But, if you are smart you go along with this and don&#x27;t argue because you absolutely will be forced out if you do. A, B and C all have more power than you, and they all have incentives in the millions of $ to do this.')
