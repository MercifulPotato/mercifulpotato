I was in a team that somehow think that could make a decent software without using postgresql as-is. Is wrong: How many devs know how implement, CORRECTLY, ACID?<p>ALL OF ACID?<p>Then if &quot;remove&quot; for &quot;efficiency&quot; the single piece of software that ACTUALLY implement it, CORRECTLY, what exactly them expect?<p>Well, them were running in circles, avoiding ACID, being very efficient running 12 docker images (!) and not implementing actual features. I left because I point to this and was deemed not good fit.<p>With relation to microservices and all their past selves (n-tiers variations) the best advice is:<p>Use a rdbms, properly<p>Maybe, add a cache as redis.<p>End.<p>This is all you need for the vast majority of apps. And it will scale, and will perform very well. If it NOT scale and not perform very well, then is MORE likely that the app code is wrong than PostgreSQL&#x2F;Redis to be wrong.<p>MORE.')
