This is much better than the supporting information I had seen earlier (debunked story about HIV genes being spliced in, etc., etc.)<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen, the Chinese government has a very authoritarian mindset, and assume any hint of pushback is a sign of agitators.  They tend to obstruct all investigation, even when they&#x27;re not trying to hide anything specific.  They try and get anything even mildly embarrassing out of the news as quickly as possible by stonewalling.  I was in China 2 months before the melamine milk scandal broke, and even after the story broke, they tried to suppress information, even though I&#x27;m not aware that there were ever any government connections to the scandal.  They just hated the embarrassment.')
