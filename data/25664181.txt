It&#x27;s easy to come to conclusion that the game is rigged in less democratic countries where the person wins over and over with 90% of the votes, or with leaders such as Putin.<p>But I just don&#x27;t understand how losing an election that was looked over by members of your own party, and won by similar margins which you won by previously, can be this controversial. Let alone the fact that the party still did really well in all the other ballots including house and senate.')
