I am just an average person so I would assume that there are many hundreds of thousands of people doing the same as me, thus the economy contracts.<p>My state is essentially not shut down at all, so very little impact is due to government regulations and almost all of it is due to personal spending choices. The less restrictions in place, the more the virus spreads and the less money I spend.<p>The economy is highly dependent on people spending and many people dont want to spend right now.')
