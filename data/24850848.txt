If we know what is doing it, and who is doing it, the President has probably been briefed on it. If China was orchestrating it, Trump probably would have just said something by now. Same for Cuba or Iran. It would play strongly in his favor politically considering the ongoing diplomatic hostilities with those nations.<p>Russia perhaps?<p>Trump probably wouldn&#x27;t call out Russia based on his response to the bounty thing:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;29&#x2F;trump-russian-bounties-putin-call-385925" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;29&#x2F;trump-russian-bount...</a><p>The attacks started in Havana, and if you&#x27;ve ever seen the Russian embassy in Havana, it&#x27;s RIGHT out of a 70&#x27;s Bond movie. Seriously, look it up. The building is awesome.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Embassy_of_Russia_in_Havana" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Embassy_of_Russia_in_Havana</a><p>If there&#x27;s anything going on in Havana, the Russians either know about it, or are involved in it. It&#x27;s their diplomatic backyard, they&#x27;ve been there since forever, and it&#x27;s a pretty small city.<p>Idle speculation (just for fun). My money is on:<p>A. Russia has something to do with it.<p>B. President won&#x27;t publicly call them out on it.<p>C. Intelligence community is frustrated, so they&#x27;re encouraging affected employees to go public in hopes that someone outside of the security-clearance bubble will figure out what&#x27;s going on.<p>&#x2F;Pretending I&#x27;m a super-secret squirrel.')
