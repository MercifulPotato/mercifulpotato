Let me try again.<p>1. The color space of the EV&#x27;s display (and even the wide-gamut monitors available for desktop use) do no fully encompass the colors we can see.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i2.wp.com&#x2F;digital-photography-school.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;Color-Spaces-Horseshoe-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i2.wp.com&#x2F;digital-photography-school.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;...</a> for a diagrammatic example of common colorspaces vs. what our eyes are capable of perceiving. In particular, the greens and purples are abbreviated, and I prefer composing with the true colors in my eyepiece.<p>2. Knowing the condition of the light before it hits the sensor lets me compose more accurately.  If I&#x27;m looking at the true light, I can tell at a glance if there is detail worth working to preserve in the highlights or shadows (by using a split neutral density filter, for example, to bring the sky brightness down some) or not.<p>3. I&#x27;m not talking about edge-to-edge clarity.  I&#x27;m referring to the depth of the focal plane, and the rate of falloff.  If you&#x27;re shooting with a very wide aperture before infinity-focus distance, the plane is going to be very narrow, and seeing the rate of the falloff is easier when it isn&#x27;t pixelated.<p>Hope that helps.')
