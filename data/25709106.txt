Item(by='jhanschoo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610249068, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25708791, text='&gt; In an email obtained by BuzzFeed News, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Trust and Safety team told Parler Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff that the calls for violence propagating across Parler violated its terms of service and that Amazon is unconvinced that the serviceâ€™s plan to use volunteers to moderate such things will be effective.<p>The article seems to suggest that it&#x27;s calls for violence that have violated its ToS (presumably agreed upon at time of hosting or earlier).<p>&gt; it seems pretty obvious that this did not happen because of the simple facts in evidence regarding Parler, but because of the broader context that a lot of people were beginning to try to pressure Amazon to drop Parler.<p>So I don&#x27;t see how what you say is indeed obvious, since Amazon&#x27;s relationship to Parler suffice to explain the termination, absent any public sentiment or pressure.<p>Perhaps your argument would be bolstered if you can provide an example of a service with similar volume of calls to violence that has not yet been booted off.')
