But I&#x27;m not the norm (yet), and no, it&#x27;s not actually a good solution.<p>We&#x27;re in the beginning of the story of the boy who cried wolf. Eventually the whole town ended up like me: fully willing to ignore and oppose the mainstream information channels. When a real wolf came, the boy told the truth once out of 1,000 times, and the townspeople all ignored him and got their sheep eaten up. We need to find a way to crowd-source our trust mechanism if &quot;trust the experts&quot; starts to fail.<p>My suggestion is that any &quot;expert&quot; who volunteers an opinion that later gets falsified should be canceled permanently from the public sphere, with no forgiveness. They can go on publishing in scientific journals and selling books, but their opinion should not be accepted by the general public anymore.<p>The other solution is to keep ignoring the boy and start watching your own sheep.')
