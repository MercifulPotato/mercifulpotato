This provides a deterministic tree structure for any given set of keyvalues, when you arrange them by key order.<p>Noms Prolly-Trees use a rolling hash across the sequence of keyvalues to determine split points, similarly when the number of leading zeros exceeds a threshold. Then those leaves are assigned as children to keyvalues on the next highest layer, which is again split in the same way, until a single root node is left.')
