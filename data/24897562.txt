Why would Microsoft want to shut this down?<p>I suspect most of Microsoft&#x27;s revenue comes from business and OEM licenses - neither of which are likely to switch to ReactOS.  Even if ReactOS was stable and perfectly compatible with Windows, I doubt many people would switch to it.  I don&#x27;t have any data on what portion of users have installed an operating system on their personal computer, but I bet it&#x27;s extremely small.<p>ReactOS isn&#x27;t competing with Microsoft&#x27;s most profitable software.  By allowing ReactOS to exist, non-Windows users are more likely to stay within the Windows ecosystem.  Microsoft still retains control of the development direction for the platform and they can still sell their software to those users.<p>Even ignoring the bad publicity Microsoft would get from the tech community for shutting down ReactOS, I just don&#x27;t see a good reason for them to do it.  It seems much more likely to me that Microsoft will use only legal action so far as to ensure ReactOS never becomes a viable &quot;Windows killer&quot;, but I doubt they&#x27;ll so far as to shut it down altogether.')
