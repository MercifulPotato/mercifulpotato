Platform builders would define the schema definitions for their API and then they would create several `Composition` objects, each representing a different way of satisfying the same API. Then app developers include a claim YAML together with their artifact. The `Composition` to be chosen is decided via selectors or by platform builder.<p>This way you can include generic `AcmeMySQLInstance` (think of it as interface in Golang or protocol in other languages) and then one of the Compositions is selected to satisfy this requirement: `AWSRDSInstance`, `AzureSQLServer` or `GCPCloudInstance` or some in-house configuration. The protocol between app dev and builder is the schema and the credential object (`Secret`) that is being published.<p>See details in docs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crossplane.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;v1.0&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;package-infrastructure.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crossplane.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;v1.0&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;package-infr...</a><p>Disclosure: I&#x27;m one of Crossplane maintainers.')
