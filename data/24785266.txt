Although I&#x27;ve only been using it for the past twelve minutes. :)<p>Your &#x27;about&#x27; page says: \n&quot;The primary feature of our site is the sending of email alerts when prices change. The user simply sets a <i>price threshold</i> at which alerts are generated, and we email you when that condition is met.&quot;<p>Just to confirm, the &quot;price threshold&quot; mentioned will trigger a set alert when the price is <i>at or below</i> the threshold.  Is that correct or will it only alert when the exact price is found?<p>Thanks again for your very useful site!')
