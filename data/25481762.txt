Like the word &quot;both&quot;, it seems like a weird thing to have in a language that normally is single&#x2F;plural. I came across it because I was reading about languages at one point, but all I used to get there was just ordinary reading. Yes, I didn&#x27;t hear about it until I heard about it, but I also wasn&#x27;t prevented from learning this little tidbit from a lack of supporting knowledge. By contrast, there are areas of math that would take me years to even understand what the research questions are.')
