Dropbox actually works and it works well. It can handle suddenly having thousands of tiny text files, it can handle a 5GB PDF, it handles foreign letters in file names and it has a sane way of determining which file version is the current one when switching between platforms.<p>It gives me cold sweat to read headlines like this since there aren&#x27;t enough alternatives to Dropbox that &quot;just work&quot;. Similar to what happens to Apple. I have no idea why Dropbox is fucking around with their shit so much. I&#x27;d happily pay a dollar more here and there (and they <i>just</i> increased pricing!), just don&#x27;t do bullshit in the background.')
