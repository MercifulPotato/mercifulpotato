Their reputation system is less spammy than Amazon&#x27;s.<p>One of my areas to watch: solid state relays.<p>Here we have yet another fake Fotek solid state relay on Amazon.[1] Note the &quot;Made in China&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s the real thing.[2] Note the &quot;Taiwan made&quot; from the real Fotek. Costs a lot more.\nThat&#x27;s because it will actually handle the rated current. The fakes are notorious for overheating and burning out. The real thing has overheat and surge protection, will shut off if it overheats, and can stand a big short term overload for motor starting or when a short is in the process of tripping the circuit breaker upstream.<p>Here&#x27;s a similar solid state relay from China, from the actual manufacturer.<p>They actually provide a table which shows how much they\nexaggerate the ratings. They&#x27;re over-rated by 2X for\na resistive load, and 6x for an inductive load.\n&quot;For a motor with rated current of 15A and the motor\nis inductive load, the formula is 15A x 6 = 90A, so\nyou should choose to buy 100A solid state relay&quot;.<p>For a little extra, you can have your own fake label. Minimum order 200 pcs.<p>Here&#x27;s a fake Fotek.[4] What&#x27;s amusing is that this is the actual manufacturer in China selling the fakes. They&#x27;re in Guangdong, and they&#x27;re selling under their own name, but with a fake label. No shame.<p>There are legit manufacturers in China selling solid state relays.[5] They put their own name on the product, show pictures of the inside their rather grubby factory, and have realistic numbers on their data sheets, along with pictures of UL certification documents. About 4x more expensive than the fakes. If you&#x27;re in China and are building industrial equipment which needs these components, you need ones that won&#x27;t fail and shut down a manufacturing line.<p>Here&#x27;s a teardown of a fake. [6] The fakes are just solid state switches with power ratings way beyond what their components are good for. UL warning notice about fake Fotek solid state relays.[7] UL issued that notice six years ago, and they&#x27;re still on Amazon and eBay.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;SSR-25-DC-AC-Solid-State-Relay&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07FVR37QN&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;SSR-25-DC-AC-Solid-State-Relay&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fotek.com.tw&#x2F;en-gb&#x2F;product-category&#x2F;143" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fotek.com.tw&#x2F;en-gb&#x2F;product-category&#x2F;143</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alibaba.com&#x2F;product-detail&#x2F;1PCS-SSR-10-DA-DC-Control_1600149635502.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alibaba.com&#x2F;product-detail&#x2F;1PCS-SSR-10-DA-DC-Con...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alibaba.com&#x2F;product-detail&#x2F;High-quality-SSR-25DA-SSR-25DA_1931397677.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alibaba.com&#x2F;product-detail&#x2F;High-quality-SSR-25DA...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alibaba.com&#x2F;product-detail&#x2F;SSR-S25DA-H-DC-TO-AC_1688083866.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alibaba.com&#x2F;product-detail&#x2F;SSR-S25DA-H-DC-TO-AC_...</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;DxEhxjvifyY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;DxEhxjvifyY</a><p>[7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;ul-warns-of-solid-state-relay-with-counterfeit-ul-recognition-mark-release-13pn-52-242919311.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;ul-warns-of-solid-s...</a>')
