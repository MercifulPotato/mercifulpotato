Ohio. That doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me. The metaphor still holds.<p>To put it another way, regardless of the ruling I still doubt a person who walks into a the same theater every day repeatedly screaming &quot;fire&quot; and pulling the fire alarm with malicious intent to hurt the profits of the theater would have a 1st amendment case get very far against the theater when the theater decides to throw that person out.')
