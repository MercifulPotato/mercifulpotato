Keys are generated for each &quot;layer&quot; of the account (so one for the account, one for collections, and etc), so each part can be re-encrypted (or not) separately if needed.<p>Password change: you can either re-encrypt the data if you want, or more likely, if the password hasn&#x27;t be compromised, just re-encrypt the main encryption key that&#x27;s used to encrypt the data.<p>Password lost: tough luck. We can&#x27;t help you recover that, because we don&#x27;t have access to your data. Though we have some ideas on how to maybe enable recovery (using key custodians, shamir secret sharing, or another method, haven&#x27;t decided).')
