What the judge in each case has to determine is how best to define the market. Whether &quot;smartphone owners&quot; or &quot;devices that play videogames&quot; or &quot;App Store users&quot; or &quot;iOS devices&quot; or &quot;computers&quot; or &quot;phones&quot; or any number of other ways. Do you determine it in the US only, or world-wide? (US courts have jurisdiction only here, but can determine a market based on any parameters) Do you determine the majority player based on units, or gross revenue, or profits? Is your primary concern when it comes to damages companies (like Epic) or end users? And so on.<p>People are blithely making cases here like all of these things are simple, but they&#x27;re the key to this and all other similar cases, and it&#x27;s not as clear as people seem to assume. Different judges might decide different things on different days, and none are necessarily wrong... or right!')
