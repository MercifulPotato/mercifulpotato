Item(by='zepto', descendants=None, kids=[25687016], score=None, time=1610126083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25686870, text='&gt; Democrats are not blameless, and I&#x27;m first in line to be critical of the politicians I have voted for, but Republicans are also not innocent victims.<p>Honestly, I can’t see how or why you would accuse the author of this, given paragraphs like this:<p>“The Republicans started the cycle of escalation in the 1990s. Rejecting the very idea of a bipartisan consensus, Newt Gingrich disseminated a partisan vocabulary to make it appear that Republicans favored the opposite of everything Democrats favored. Gingrich told Republicans to contrast the “conservative opportunity society” with “the liberal welfare state.” Semantic warfare was combined with quasi-military organization, as Gingrich and his Republican successors imposed a degree of discipline on the Republican Party in Congress that was alien to American traditions.”')
