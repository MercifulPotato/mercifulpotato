The investigation was because of Carter Page, not the dossier. Mueller&#x27;s scope of investigation was very narrow, was ended by Barr prematurely, and was filtered through Barr.<p>Donald Trump definitely solicited Russian interference in the election. His family met with Russians in Trump Tower. Right after the meeting, Trump said to expect dirt on Clinton. Soon after that, he looked into a camera and told Putin to hack Clinton. Hours later, Clinton was hacked by Russians for the first time.<p>Mueller may not have found a smoking gun from a legal perspective, but let&#x27;s not act like this is a Democratic hoax. Trump was caught doing it again a few months later, with Ukraine, and was impeached for it.')
