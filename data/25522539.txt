I came away from that experience with two showstoppers:<p>- Apple does not disclose to you who bought your app.<p>- There is no mechanism to make paid updates possible.  If you want to release a big update and get paid you need to release a new app.  There is no way to contact current users and offer them an inexpensive update.<p>Are these two issues still true of the MacOS App Store?')
