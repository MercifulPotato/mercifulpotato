I wasn&#x27;t &quot;trying to say&quot; anything in favour of censorship, or against censorship. According to the guidelines of this site you&#x27;re meant to assume good faith (not that I really care that much).<p>My personal view happens to be that it is a good thing if people can plan violence on the internet. The alternative is to move further in the direction of state monopolisation of violence, which I view to be a move further away from democracy (and I view democracy to be a disarable thing).')
