Low interests actually allow the asset &quot;poor&quot; to acquire assets by borrowing at low rates that allow them to afford assets.<p>But you are very much correct about the &quot;&quot;skills crisis&quot;, and unfortunately, the short term solution that has been used by politicians and corporations to evade responsibility, accountability, and having to reveal their failure … immigration … the syphoning off of skills from other societies; has only fueled the deepening of the damaging crisis.<p>I like foreign cultures and people off all of the world very much, but there has been a vast con job pulled on people for many years now … far longer than any of us are old … that simply replaced spending and having to solve difficult questions by simply extracting talent from foreign societies and cultures and countries.<p>The impact has been vast on both the origin and destination side. It has both immensely sabotaged the growth and potential of other countries that were deprived of the skilled talent, and it has also allowed corrupt politicians and corrupt corporate institutions to obscure their utter failure and incompetence and mask the immoral and evil damage they have done to people. It may not be a popular opinion here, but at the core of it, immigration is an evil concept that only serves the billionaire strata. You&#x27;ve never asked yourself why the millionaires and billionaires love nothing more than immigration, i.e., cheap labor that allows them to profit more?<p>Immigration is a sabotage of the origin countries too that are drained of their human energy and potential.')
