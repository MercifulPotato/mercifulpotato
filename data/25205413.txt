The other party does not know who else you swipe right on. Narrowing a search does not yield an increase in match rates.<p>Bob is interested in goth women. There&#x27;s 5 of them in his area. Plus another 95 non-goth women. If he accepts only the 5 goth women, he might get lucky and get a match but at 1-3% change of matching he&#x27;s still likely to have zero matches. But if he swipes right on all 100 women his chances of having at lease a couple matches goes up drastically, and the 5 goth women he&#x27;s especially interested are no less likely to match with him.<p>Sure, taking better pictures and working out to become more attractive increases the likelihood of matching. If Bob hits the gym, gets some professional photos taken, and crafts a better profile his match rate with those 5 goth women will increase. But his chances also increase for the other 95 women, and he has no reason to refrain from swiping right on them.<p>&gt; Swiping everyone is just like emailing every company your resume. Spend sometime craft your profile and target who you want.<p>Yes! When you&#x27;re job searching there&#x27;s no reason to limit your job search. Yes, you should craft your resume and cover letter to emphasize the skills the company is looking for. But you&#x27;re still strictly better off applying to 100 companies as compared to 10 companies. Online dating is no different.<p>In fact I was job searching not long ago and I applied to ~50 companies a day. Why <i>not</i> apply to a company I&#x27;m only lukewarm about? If it turns out I don&#x27;t like the company I can just not schedule an interview. Or do the interview anyway, and use a potential offer as leverage in negotiating.')
