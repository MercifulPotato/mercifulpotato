Anybody who likes steak medium well or higher, of course.<p>Fears of trichinosis decades ago led to pork being overcooked for a long time. I did sous vide pork chops for my parents and they said it was the best pork chop they&#x27;d ever had, but still weren&#x27;t crazy about it. They just don&#x27;t like pork, after a lifetime of eating it overcooked.<p>I&#x27;ve done chicken breast at low temp and ended up with a mushy piece of meat i didn&#x27;t care for. Chicken breast is good in a relatively narrow band of temperatures, where it&#x27;s neither mushy nor dessicated, and often you still need to crisp the skin. Technology has made it easier to get in that band.<p>It would be cool to do steak tartare at home, though!')
