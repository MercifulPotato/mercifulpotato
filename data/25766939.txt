Item(by='alecbz', descendants=None, kids=[25767746], score=None, time=1610566627, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25766775, text='I think the problem is:<p>a) it&#x27;s too easy to build data syncing into other products<p>b) the ease of having syncing built into the product I&#x27;m using is really powerful<p>When Dropbox first came out a lot of software was a lot more &quot;local&quot;, and Dropbox was a lot more useful. But now we have Google Docs and Office 365 for most documents, git&#x2F;GitHub, etc. for source code, things like Figma are starting to crop up for designers.<p>For each of these, unless the syncing was <i>especially</i> bad, it&#x27;s hard to imagine an out-of-band syncing solution differentiating itself in any meaningful way to make up for the more complex UX&#x2F;setup.<p>Unless someone for some reason comes up with a product that&#x27;s just <i>amazing</i> compared to its competition but has no syncing capabilities, or syncing becomes incredibly difficult to implement well, I don&#x27;t see why people would use Dropbox.<p>I&#x27;m not a musician, but my guess is that musicians care enough about pedals or the differences between them to justify a separate market for them. Certain pedals are smoother, or offer more resistance, and that matters a lot to certain people? But I don&#x27;t see an analog to that for data syncing.<p>---<p><i>If</i> there were a market for data syncing itself, I feel like it would be product companies paying for it as a service, and not something that end-users want to pay for directly.<p>Another way to look at this is that maybe filesystems are too low-level of an abstraction for most end-users. I found that people would often be confused by the idea of a filesystem that existed separately from any application when I was trying to explain computers to them, and UX seems to be moving away from needing users to think about a filesystem.')
