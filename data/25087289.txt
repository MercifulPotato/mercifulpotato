Why am I responsible for the way the chemicals in someone&#x27;s brain react if I say something that unintentionally hurts them? If i&#x27;m doing nothing wrong as you say and someone else is offended, or sad or hurt, that&#x27;s honestly their problem.<p>People need to take responsibility for their feelings instead of making everyone else take responsibility for their feelings.<p>Why should I ever be responsible for the way someone feels unless i&#x27;ve done something intentionally to make them feel that way?<p>People&#x27;s feelings are their own business, nobody else has the unintentional responsibility of random people&#x27;s arbitrary feelings.')
