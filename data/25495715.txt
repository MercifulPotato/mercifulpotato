I finished grad school before 2010, and at least with the smaller state schools I went to, total cost of tuition and books was in the $3k~$5k range. Boutique schools like Vanderbilt were like $25k+ (per semester). I had a friend who got a free ride there for graduate school, and he said it wasn&#x27;t really that different than our state school. You get out of any education what you put into it.<p>All that being said, the Pandemic is not going to be enough to fix the tuition problems across the board. Federally subsidized student loans need to GO AWAY. They&#x27;ve allowed students to enter into debt, the only long term contracts kids under 18 can legally sign, for something they can never declare bankruptcy on.<p>Schools have soaked up that student loan money, increasing costs as the amount kids qualify for goes up. It all gets sucked into administrative costs. Very little of that money even get to professors, many who still depend on grant writing to fund their departments.<p>Schools will scream and moan if the federal government stops backing student loans, but it needs to happen. They&#x27;ve exploited a system to take more public funds without actually contributing significantly a better education for students.')
