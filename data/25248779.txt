We have dozens more, including newer, 30 years more advanced designs of spy satellites pointing inwards. That&#x27;s pretty depressing. I get that defense is a requirement but our biggest scientific projects are essentially just offcuts of military tech with its unlimited budgets. Imagine if the space telescopes had similar budgets to spy satellites.')
