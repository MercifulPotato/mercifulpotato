If you work with one-time purchase versions, it’s only available in Office 2019. It’s been in Office 365 for a bit longer. But if you (or whoever sends you the CSV file) use older one-time-purchase versions of Excel, the option is not available. Even if you do have the latest version of Excel, the old option is still there, so someone might save a file as Windows-XXXX accidentally.')
