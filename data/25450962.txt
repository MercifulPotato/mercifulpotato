When switching tabs via mouse it is way too easy to accidently cause it to open a tab in a new window and I also occasionally accidently open a new window via the right click menu.  Not once in at least 5 years (most likely longer) have I actually wanted more than one window for a profile.<p>I don&#x27;t mind customizing things the way I want them, but it would be helpful if there was an easier way to share setting between profiles.')
