Item(by='dwohnitmok', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604211552, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24956884, text='Aaronson is using a slightly less common definition of soundness (arithmetical soundness) than the usual one you&#x27;ll see. Usually we talk about the soundness of entire logical systems (e.g. the soundness of first-order logic) rather than particular theories within that system.<p>Here arithmetical soundness is tightly coupled to the idea of Godel encodings of theorems and proofs. That is a system like ZFC does not have a direct notion of theorems and proofs. Instead a statement such as `Con(ZFC)` is actually a statement about the (non-)existence of a certain natural number fulfilling certain conditions. More specifically `Con(F)` is usually a statement stating that the natural number corresponding to a Godel encoding of a proof of a clearly contradictory statement (e.g. `1 = 0`) does <i>not</i> exist, whereas `Not(Con(F))` is a statement that such a Godel encoding does exist (which usually makes `Not(Con(F))` the more fundamental statement of the two and `Con(F)` is really `Not(Incon(F))` but I digress).<p>Arithmetical soundness requires the notion of &quot;standard natural numbers.&quot; In particular, as stated elsewhere in this thread, first-order Peano Arithmetic can be satisfied by many different models, only one of which we designate as our familiar &quot;standard natural numbers.&quot;<p>Arithmetical soundness then is the property that natural numbers which satisfy the conditions of these statements encoded via Godel encodings are all standard natural numbers. So for example `Not(Con(F))` corresponds to a statement about the existence of a natural number. If `F` is &quot;truly&quot; consistent then `Not(Con(F))` can only be satisfied by a non-standard natural number. On the other hand if `F` is &quot;truly&quot; inconsistent then `Not(Con(F))` can be satisfied by a standard natural  number.<p>You&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve put the word &quot;truly&quot; in quote marks. This is for two reasons:<p>1. The usual way to rigorously define &quot;truly&quot; is to appeal to some standard model. Hence the arrow of definition should be going the other way; the concept of a standard natural number that underlies arithmetical soundness is what lets talk about &quot;true&quot; consistency.<p>2. Whether it makes sense to talk about &quot;the&quot; standard model of a given theory or whether there are multiple possible standard models becomes a matter of philosophy. The former position corresponds to essentially a version of Platonism. The latter position is what is often known as the &quot;multiverse&quot; theory of mathematical logic. Through the philosophical viewpoint of the latter, we can never say absolutely whether a given theory is arithmetically unsound or not, only that it is arithmetically unsound relative to a given model of the natural numbers.')
