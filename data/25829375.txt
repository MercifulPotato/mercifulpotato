Item(by='nirushiv', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1611024042, title='Ask HN: Any open source tools for searching across services?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hello HN<p>I’ve been looking for a tool that would let me and my team search across SaaS services we subscribe to.<p>For example, our team uses Google Drive, but teams we work with use Dropbox sometimes. Similarly with Github, Figment, Azure, Notion (some use Confluence) and a few other tools. It’s an absolute pain to curate (we’ve tried) and search for things across them.<p>We haven’t been able to find any commercial tools that fit the bill, and CTO insists that because we deal with sensitive data, a trusted&#x2F;certified vendor (based on industry standards for data protection) is needed. No such vendors found.<p>I convinced him that an open-source tool, with a security audit (we have a great security team that routinely tracks down vulnerabilities in popular tools) is also passable.<p>I understand this would be very useful for a lot of people outside our company.<p>- If something like this exists, and someone here knows about it, please point me towards it. I’d be so grateful and will buy you a coffee.<p>- If a simpler version of this exists, I have approval to contribute to the project and <i>possibly</i> bring some more dedicated man hours from the company.<p>- If it does not exist, I’m also willing to help start&#x2F;maintain such an open source project. We agree it’s worth pursuing. If you’re interested, please let me know in the comments or through email.')
