Many people have a hard time finding a partner, often due to genetic issues. On the other hand, many people have genetic traits that help making them highly attractive and able to give their genes to many people.<p>So selection is still around, but nowadays we select for different things than nature used to when medicine wasn&#x27;t as well developed as it is today.<p>Note that this selection alone won&#x27;t cause any genetic change faster than what existed in the past. What really accelerates changes in the gene pool is us deliberately doing them. We&#x27;ll start with eliminating hereditary diseases, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll stop there. We&#x27;ll likely study which genetic variants give rise to desirable traits and then make those mutations to upcoming children of interested individuals.')
