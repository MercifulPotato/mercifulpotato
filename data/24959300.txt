Making compiler writers&#x27; lives harder means you&#x27;re less likely to get optimal performance. At least on the more exotic variants, but possibly even on the most common ones.<p>I can empathize, but isn&#x27;t that just part of the job of making a compiler? Any successful, long-lived ISA is going to have extensions and revisions that will need to be handled in the toolchain. I guess my point is not so much that it isn&#x27;t painful, it&#x27;s more that I don&#x27;t really see what makes RISC-V really different besides the fact that it&#x27;s a younger ISA and therefore we don&#x27;t already know for sure which extensions are going to become de-facto standard and which ones will be less common.<p>&gt;I believe the author doesn&#x27;t identify as a &quot;guy&quot;.<p>Arg, of course the one time I don&#x27;t use gender-neutral language I manage to mess it up. Edited, thanks.')
