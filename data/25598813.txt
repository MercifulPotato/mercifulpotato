Item(by='beaner', descendants=None, kids=[25599273], score=None, time=1609459236, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25598743, text='It requires 100% because it only takes one miner to include the transaction for it to eventually be included.<p>Chain splits do not &quot;edit&quot; blockchains, they still require their own proof of work, and they cannot modify transactions, only drop them. Honest participants in a chain that is orphaned will not have had their money spent in the new chain, leaving it available to spend again. That&#x27;s all that can be done. It requires a lot of work to be done once, let alone maintained over time on consecutive blocks, and in extremely short order the rewards sacrificed by fucking with the blockchain make continued attacks expensive to the degree that they&#x27;d be practically impossible.<p>People aren&#x27;t thinking this through. The &quot;race to the bottom&quot; endgame is not that miners consolidate in one state with subsidized electricity, but that mining operations eventually power themselves off-grid through renewables, making distribution entirely detached from geography and jurisdiction.')
