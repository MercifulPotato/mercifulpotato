My main issue with it was:<p>1. You shouldn&#x27;t know <i>a priori</i> whether you will be able to reject your null hypothesis (otherwise what is the point of doing the experiment). So what you need is luck, luck that your hunch turned out to be true.<p>2. If careers live and die by published results, then those who are <i>lucky</i> with finding significant effects early on in their career will win out.<p>3. Running a well-controlled experiment at scale is difficult in a way that I haven&#x27;t found matched in the tech fields I have been in since leaving academia. I mean mega-hassle difficult.<p>4. You therefore have an incredible amount riding on the outcome of that experiment, because of its enormous opportunity cost.<p>5. The likelihood of being caught faking data is low (especially if you are halfway-competent which this researcher clearly is not).<p>6. The penalties of being caught faking data (as set out in this article) are relatively low.<p>7. The payoff of getting away with faking data can include a lot, up to and including a high profile academic career and tenure.<p>8. So from a game theoretic perspective, it&#x27;s almost inevitable that quite a few people at the top have faked their way there.<p>This is not to say that good work is not being done - there is some amazing work out there. I just think that like athletes taking steroids before they reach the big leagues, many academics succumbed to temptation to get an edge in order to get to the top.<p>See the Dutch Social Psychology scandal for more on this.')
