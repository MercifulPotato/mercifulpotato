I end up with 2 tabs for the site I want to log into if I don&#x27;t close the original tab.<p>Regarding security, I don&#x27;t see it being any better than if a user is using a password manager or different passwords for services. If someone takes control of the email they have access to all services that login via &quot;magic&quot; links, just like if they&#x27;d compromise the users password manager.')
