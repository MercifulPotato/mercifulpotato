If we&#x27;re going to use these things, let&#x27;s just require them to publish the license plate and time online, so our phone&#x27;s can download the number and tell us if we&#x27;re currently going to get ticketed going past them.<p>Because tickets aren&#x27;t just monetary - at least in Australia, license demerit points mean you eventually lose your license, thus your ability to drive and very likely your job as a result.')
