A &quot;commons&quot; physical space has has an firm upper limit on how many people it can reach.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is entitled to the massive amplification of their words that a large social media platform can provide without recourse to either being moderated or curated the way other broadcast media is done. A person could not perform some analog to &quot;shouting fire in a crowded theatre&quot; on those traditional media forms, and I don&#x27;t see how doing it on the internet should change that.<p>The problem as always is where do you draw the line? Some free speech advocates seem to say it&#x27;s too difficult so we shouldn&#x27;t try. That one reasonable step could be the justification for an unreasonable one. I think that&#x27;s a complete cop out. I think you do the reasonable thing, and then fight against the unreasonable thing. Not give up because it&#x27;s not easy. It&#x27;s a hard thing and we need to constantly as a whole and in individual circumstances assess our judgements, but not back away from making them.')
