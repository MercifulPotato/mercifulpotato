Item(by='simmons', descendants=None, kids=[25102838, 25104666, 25103476], score=None, time=1605457869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25100034, text='I&#x27;m about as close to a free-speech absolutist as there is, and it&#x27;s very frustrating that the market for these platforms seems to be settling into ruts where we have to choose between the hyper-conformity of highly managed platforms and the dumpster fires of the unmanaged platforms. I think the feedback loop you describe is a big part of it. I also wonder if we&#x27;re experiencing a decline in education and critical thinking skills that could be fueling these ruts.<p>This greatly saddens me. Can&#x27;t there be some way to build a platform that encourages intelligent, reasonable, polite debate? Discussions of ideas based on their merits instead of personal attacks and tribal allegiances? Some way to provide free speech without providing <i>free amplification</i>? Has society devolved to a point where this is no longer possible?')
