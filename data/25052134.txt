Prison requires cheap enough food or a high ransom to be viable as an institution to allow keeping them working and some means of ensuring they cannot escape or fight successfully - potentially guards as well.<p>It can be a historical running dark joke - &quot;Sadly &lt;x&gt; still qualified as an improvement.&quot; such as slavery technically being a bit better than early human warfare ending in genocide either directly or indirectly (forced out of all territory capable of sustaining themselves).<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t try to do better (ones with far better recidivism rates should be a model for one) but given the history it isn&#x27;t a failing in itself - that would suggest a shift away from widespread killing and mutilating people was a mistake.')
