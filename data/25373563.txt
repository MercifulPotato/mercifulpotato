You are arguing to limit critical thinking to the cute &quot;bunnies or butterflies&quot; topics. I would argue that critical thinking is necessary, especially in topics that &quot;hurt&quot;. One may leave genocide or cannibalism to the advanced classes, but if a topic isn&#x27;t the least bit controversial, I would say it is impossible to learn critical thinking.')
