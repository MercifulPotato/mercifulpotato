Possibly also debugging - I don&#x27;t get powerful REPLs in the statically typed languages I&#x27;ve used, as much as those in the the dynamically typed language I use.<p>Concepts like these don&#x27;t represent best practices for sure at large scale, but they do make things easier at least at small scale, and they don&#x27;t need to be necessarily supported.<p>Taken to the extreme, Perl variable autoinitialization and context sensitivity are very convenient for 3-statement programs, but they&#x27;d be horror above that. It doesn&#x27;t make sense for any language to try to support that.')
