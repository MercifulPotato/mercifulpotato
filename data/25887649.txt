The argument goes that since phashion includes the source code of pHash as apart of its distribution, it needs to also use the GPL 3.0 license.<p>My question ... is there a licensing conflict between phashion and pHash? If so, what are the options?<p>Other question ... are there any open source lawyers&#x2F;organizations I could talk to for free?<p>NOTE - I realize I&#x27;m asking a legal&#x2F;IP question. I will not treat comments or opinions as legal advice.')
