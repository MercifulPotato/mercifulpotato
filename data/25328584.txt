That may keep a device from working, so the device maker guards against it. A quick scroll through this thread reveals good reasons for device makers to do this, mostly ISPs behaving badly.<p>I&#x27;m generally inclined to think an &quot;always use this manually-configured DNS&quot; option is desirable in that situation. Of course, many devices may have a financial incentive (ads) to actively resist the network owner&#x27;s attempts at filtering.<p>Filtering is inherently adversarial, and I expect a reasonably sophisticated user on your network could find a way to access some proscribed content. I also expect the users of concern on your network are under five years old and that most of them lack advanced knowledge of networking. Is there an established standard for what qualifies as a reliable-enough filter?')
