Amazing experience!  I mean, sure, fit and finish is a problem, repairs take forever, hard to get parts, you just live with the smallish problems... Well, no, never had this many issues on &lt;any other car brand&gt; but this is the future I&#x27;m driving!  I&#x27;ll get even newer stuff in upgrades... Oh, the physical parts? That&#x27;s a problem... But the savings! Of course, no gas payments!  Well my power bill did increase, but it&#x27;s gotta be cheaper than my gas.&quot;<p>Each person was initially effusive then, when pushed, realistic.  Sloppy assembly, broken features, things that we would never accept in a usd$90K car from any other brand... Til Tesla both lowered and raised the bar, depending on your pov.<p>The power of Brand: the comfort with paying more for an item or service wirh equal or less quality than alternatives in general, but with one (or a small cluster of) perceived unique value prop. Amazing.<p>And even with all the evidence of the problems, I still want one too...<p>(A coda: the cutesy naming of tesla sort of sums it up around lots of flash, some amazing function, some tawdry qualities: the models sure are &quot;s3xy&quot;.)')
