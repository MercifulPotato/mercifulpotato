On the metro to the forest you&#x27;ll find skiers with amazingly expensive skis &amp; performance clothes as well as those with borrowed skis and clothes they&#x27;d normally wear outside. The higher &amp; more balanced wealth of the population definitely help, but Norway is no utopia and there are many people with low incomes who borrow equipment from organisations set up to do so. There is also a very big and cheap secondhand market that most people use.<p>Cabins tend to be owned by the older &amp; richer generations, but that&#x27;s not really the point of friluftsliv as that concept is much bigger. It means people are outside more, even if it&#x27;s just in the city, the park, or for a walk in the local woods.')
