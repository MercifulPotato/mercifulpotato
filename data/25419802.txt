Discipline yourself (and your team) to use dedicated key storage even on test systems, (and of course that key storage isn&#x27;t &quot;Duh, a github repo&quot; but an appropriate technology for your platform)<p>If you instinctively want to write<p>shiny_api_key = &#x27;SOME.KEY.BOSS.EMAILED.ME&#x27;<p>Force yourself to instead take the extra few minutes to do<p># my-cloud-vendor key-store create shiny_api_key\nSOME.KEY.BOSS.EMAILED.ME<p>and then write<p>shiny_api_key = key_store_access(&#x27;shiny_api_key&#x27;)<p>This way, when six hours later you check that code in, to GitHub, and go home for the weekend, you won&#x27;t get a call from the boss ruining your Sunday lie-in, &quot;WTF Did you upload our $5000 shiny API key to GitHub? You are fired&quot;.<p>This habit also allows for correct separation as an organisation grows, when you&#x27;re big enough you want it to be possible for somebody to write code against test systems with test API keys, and that same code to work as written in production, even though production API keys are not accessible to the coders. Using key stores to mediate makes this much more likely to actually work.')
