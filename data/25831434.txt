With the rise of the standards around charging electric cars, it seems like a no brainer to standardise on robotics to handle the hook up as we go to higher power levels.<p>Park car roughly in the correct place, and wait. No more issues using any cable technology that’s appropriate like coolants or the sheer cable mass in terms of copper. The robot can be built to match , and every charging port makes a nice standard looking target for vision tracking and alignment to drive the robot to the right place every time.')
