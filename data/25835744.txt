These are very cheap ($20&#x27;ish) radios that work very poorly (they splatter all over the bands) even when equipped with decent antennas.  They barely work when equipped with the stock rubber-duck antennas.<p>It&#x27;s easy to be a snob about the type of radios that they are using, but that&#x27;s not even the point.<p>These people are idiots.  Bringing their cellphones, recording video of themselves committing felonies and then posting them online.  There is already plenty of rules regarding what can&#x2F;can not be said using amateur radios.  There is however no requirement to provide identification before you purchase an amateur radio.<p>Anybody can buy them, and it&#x27;s based on the honour system to use them according to the law.  It&#x27;s already against the law to use them in a manner that is against the law.<p>Id&#x27; like to see this used as a punitive measure against everybody who was using them during the coup.  Maximum FCC fine for all of them.')
