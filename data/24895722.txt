When you hear, for example, that each patient in a given area infects 1.2 other people on average, this doesn&#x27;t mean that everyone spreads it to one or two people. It means that out of 10 infectious patients, 9 patients don&#x27;t spread it to anyone else and the tenth patient spreads it to a dozen people at once.<p>Because of this high dispersion rate, it may make sense to earmark a certain amount of vaccine doses for people who are not themselves at risk of complications when contracting Covid, but who are at risk of becoming a superspreader.<p>(Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not an epidemiologist.)')
