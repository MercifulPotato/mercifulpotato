Your ideas have to be both correct and novel. You can&#x27;t publish papers saying things other people already know. You need to say things no one else has realized yet.&quot;<p>Oof, first paragraph and he&#x27;s entirely wrong. That&#x27;s rough.<p>One of the most worrisome aspects of the world&#x27;s take on science lately is that reproduction of published results is considered the work of dullards and thus unworthy of funding.<p>By definition, reproduction of results is <i>not novel</i>, and yet it is (or at least really should be) one of the single most crucial aspects of a shared scientific method.<p>This is profoundly bad thinking by Paul.')
