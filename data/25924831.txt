We are allowed to say that wars should end, that people shouldn&#x27;t die of hunger, and so on - even if we don&#x27;t have the exact step by step plan on how to implement it that we can share on HN.<p>And sacrificing my privacy doesn&#x27;t have to mean that it&#x27;s open to public, it refers to actually being able to enforce certain rules. If I were to do something that&#x27;s illegal on HN the authorities would have no problem finding me.')
