This type def file is about 1000 lines (can&#x27;t count the number of declarations in there).<p>What seems to happen consistently: I can delete a label in a type record, no lag. As soon as I finish adding a label (haven&#x27;t added its type yet), all matter of slow hell breaks loose and there is a 5 second delay before anything shows up. This happens regardless of whether or not the type is used in a low (&lt;20) or high (&gt;100) number of places. The delay is the same in all records.')
