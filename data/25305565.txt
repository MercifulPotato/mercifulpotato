It came along with millenium hype.<p>Even then only maybe 1&#x2F;3 of Americans had consistent Internet access, but everyone was talking about it. &#x27;The Matrix&#x27; films remember are about hackers.<p>Then the metastasizing with mobile, which really took root post 2010 when even poor people around the globe became connected.<p>I think AI, in the long run, won&#x27;t be the thing we look at, it will be the internet itself.<p>In 500 years, I wonder if even Television or Radio will be remembered as &#x27;a thing&#x27; - they were foundational and transformational, but only for a few decades until the internet took over.<p>The mishmash we have now, may resemble whatever it is we have in 1000 years. Protocols, sources, viewing tech will all change, but I think that it will actually kind of feel similar. It won&#x27;t have the orthodoxy of &#x27;TV Channels&#x27; with &#x27;set program timings&#x27; etc..')
