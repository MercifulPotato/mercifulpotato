I imagine the complex case where I sell some creative content (e.g. a pdf, audio file or video). You pay me for access to this content and download it. I grant that you ought to be able to retain a local copy of that content for so long as you wish.<p>Then you create freecontent.com and publish it. You don&#x27;t put ads on it, you don&#x27;t sell it - you simply make it available for free at some URL without my express permission. In a world where that is legal, I feel it would materially harm my ability to earn from content I create. I have a hard time supporting that even though I am sympathetic to the idea that information ought to spread freely.')
