Item(by='erklik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609810764, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640645, text='&gt; and they&#x27;re free to keep paying me to do something else instead<p>But I am guessing they&#x27;re not free to fire you, right? So, it&#x27;s not really &quot;take-it-or-leave-it&quot; but more &quot;take-it-or-choose-something-else&quot;. There&#x27;s not leaving involved.<p>&gt; If Alphabet workers want to use that collective power to negotiate a legal contract protecting their job if they refuse to work on a project, that&#x27;s their right.<p>This is what confuses me, and maybe you can help me understand.<p>1. Employee and Employer have a contract where Employee will work on what Employer wants and get paid in return.<p>2. Employee does not want to work on what Employer wants, yet wants to be paid i.e. wants the employer to honor their part of the contract while wanting to renege on their part.<p>Let&#x27;s use another example.<p>Would one be supportive of employees wanting to only work FOSS while at Alphabet refusing to work on anything else, and still &quot;protect their job&quot; i.e. not be fired?')
