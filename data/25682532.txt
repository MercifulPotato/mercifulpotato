Most of it is idling 90%+ of the time, the utilized portion is mostly wasted in a sea of inefficiencies. Performance improvements of 100x are not uncommon. To simplify a bit - Apple&#x27;s business model boils down to selling mediocre hardware at premium prices, and concealing that fact by a large amount of optimizations and polish.<p>Cars are nothing like that; they&#x27;re already at their efficiency plateau. An improvement of 10% is considered astonishing. Cars are much more like gaming rigs - raw power is required there, the games are already reasonably optimized, and no amount of sleek design and UI polish would hide the lackluster price&#x2F;performance ratio. There&#x27;s a reason Apple is not in the gaming business.<p>For Apple to maintain their margins, they&#x27;d have to sell something like Nissan Leaf for the price of Tesla Model S.')
