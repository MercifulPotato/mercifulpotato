And the fun of iOS background modes while getting an incoming call. Of course the Google examples were all broken in their own little devious way. And there is really jack shit on WebRTC on the web, seems like everybody that figured it out just said &quot;fuck it I&#x27;m not giving away this for free&quot; after spending possibly months to get it working.<p>Though some people here seem to complain about no audio or no video...I have to say once we got it working it kept working. Sometimes the websocket we used for signalling dropped it&#x27;s connection but the video call kept on trucking on some really bad WiFi!')
