But to those who wish to just walk into a bar and start trying to perform market research or sales... yeah, know that it comes across as an invasion of personal space.<p>If anyone wishes to use any forum for successful launch of a project... either your product has to be that good (in which case they&#x27;ll only trust an existing member saying so) or you should get to know the community first and contribute to it and be a trusted member of it.')
