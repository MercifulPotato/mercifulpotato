Among other things it means we don&#x27;t want to keep eyeballs on our site - the quicker you can deal with your email and go do something else, the fewer server resources you use!<p>We do participate in spam reporting feedback channels - such that are part of email deliverability and abuse detection of course, but that&#x27;s about behaviour on the MX side, not about customers.  Our list of &quot;badly behaved IPv4 addresses&quot; is quite extensive!')
