Basically, what Stanford&#x2F;MIT does (and a bunch of others).<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve seen places where the &quot;Software Engineering&quot; is about requirement, methodologies and tools and has no math nor algorithms. That&#x27;s akin to an aeronautical engineer without a solid background in classical mechanics.')
