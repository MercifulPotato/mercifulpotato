Since we live in a democracy, this gives companies like Twitter and Facebook a non-trivial amount of control over elections and legislation.<p>I think this ascribes a lack of self-determinism that I see in a lot of these arguments. We (the people) give Twitter and Facebook that control. If they have violated the norms we (the people) have set in such a way that we want to take that power back, we can. This seems self-evident since you are a non-user.')
