Thompson.<p>My 16 y.o. son is not struggling with quarantine at all, but his education is taking a massive nosedive - something he&#x27;s not yet mature enough to worry about. So yeah, mental health-wise he&#x27;s fine. Education-wise he&#x27;s in a bit of a pickle. I say &quot;a bit&quot; because we&#x27;ve been supplementing his education with STEM tutoring for the past 3 years or so, which is not something poorer people can afford to do. _Those_ kids are fucked like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I think we&#x27;d be better off canceling the entire school year, furloughing all teachers, and keeping kids in the same grade for the time being.')
