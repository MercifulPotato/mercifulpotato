Importantly, the security of DNS records on Handshake is strong even with the possibility of a 51% attack.<p>51% attacks on blockchains used as a store of value are bad because an attacker can spend their coins (ie BTC) on an exchange, withdraw their profits, then perform a 51% attack on the previous block to take back their spent coins.<p>On Handshake, that same attack exists for HNS, but DNS updates on chain take 36 blocks (about 6 hours worth of transactions) to propagate, which is significantly more expensive and unlikely than pulling off a normal 51% attack on a single block (it gets exponentially more unlikely). Furthermore this wouldn&#x27;t even be an attack per se. An attacker may be able to undo a DNS update, but they wouldn&#x27;t be able to falsify DNS records because only the owner of the name who controls the private key would be able to submit valid UPDATE transactioins.')
