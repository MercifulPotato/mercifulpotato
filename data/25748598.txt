Don&#x27;t get to that point. Don&#x27;t back away from the keyboard when the clock strikes 5; move away from the keyboard when you&#x27;re at a natural stopping point. If that point is 3:30, and you know that the next block of work you&#x27;d like to do is going to take you three hours, don&#x27;t start it. Commit, push, and consider yourself done writing code for the day.<p>2. I keep a journal of what I do throughout the day. This probably is at a higher level than what you&#x27;re looking for,  but occasionally I&#x27;ll post links to github with the file and line number where I left off.<p>3. Sometimes, I don&#x27;t commit everything; hopping back on in the morning, a `git diff` shows me what I&#x27;m working on. This obviously doesn&#x27;t work if you&#x27;ve changed a thousand lines, but that goes back to point 1 - have reasonable stopping points.<p>4. Break tests. If you know you need to finish something, write a test for it that doesn&#x27;t work.')
