Its a good tool, but shouldn&#x27;t be the only one.  With threats constantly changing, ML alone will fall short.  Its great for so called &#x27;easy&#x27; stuff or locating &#x27;odd&#x27; stuff to prioritize.<p>On top of that you need explainability and reproducibility.  Depending on the ML in use, this can be difficult.  When a FP or FN occurs, customers want to know what happened and can you fix it.  They don&#x27;t like to be told things like &quot;because the ML said so.&quot;  Reproducibility is important for support.  When things go wrong, they need to know how to right it.  If you can&#x27;t explain or reproduce, its hard to say the misclassification is resolved and won&#x27;t happen again.')
