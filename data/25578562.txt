Obviously the spike proteins are using an existing mechanism (ACE2) in our bodies to bind to cells.<p>Sure, but aren&#x27;t the proteins produced by the vaccine virtually identical to the ones produced by the actual virus?<p>If so, the calculus looks like this:<p>1) Take the vaccine and accept the (unknown, but apparently quite small) probability that something in your body will react very negatively to the generated viral proteins.<p>2) Get the virus, accept the probability (also unknown, but the same as in 1) that something in your body  will react very negatively to the viral proteins, <i>plus</i> accept the <i>additional</i> risk of being infected by the actual virus.<p>I guess the third possibility would be to refuse the vaccine and gamble that you won&#x27;t get the virus, either.')
