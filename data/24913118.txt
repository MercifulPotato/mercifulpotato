We value different violations with different levels of punishment - if we were living in madmax times then maybe rules around water sharing and preservation would be chief among folks.<p>That ruleset does change with technology on a functional level (murder with a gun when guns don&#x27;t exist is a non-issue) I don&#x27;t think there is a particularly interesting relationship with technology though - it&#x27;s more just an extension of existing rules to platforms.<p>One thing that might counter that is doxing though - this is a pretty new phenomena that was pretty inconceivable when the world moved slower and humans were more directly involved with communication handling.  I think you have the right to not be doxed but I don&#x27;t think that right clearly translates to any pre-internet rights - it might be an implied right (but unstated or considered due to the infeasibility) but it is a pretty good example of a more novel rule for a sustainable community... that said we&#x27;re still societally new to the internet so maybe it eventually won&#x27;t be a rule and we&#x27;ll find that doxing was an unfortunate emergent behavior of some integrated systems that really shouldn&#x27;t have been integrated.')
