Do you go around calling black people the n-word because your token black friend gave you the n-word pass?<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure what you are trying to say with the second paragraph. Other communities have identities, so it&#x27;s their fault that 4chan, an outlier in the social platform space, enables and encourages their users to post derogatory and inflammatory garbage about people? Have you considered the fact that identity is part of why many communities exist in the first place?')
