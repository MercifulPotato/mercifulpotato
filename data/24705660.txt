Some people think of religion is a valuable tool humans invented to help them govern their lives . To others, religion is a doctrine that teaches ostensibly facts about the nature of the universe. Typically these facts lead to conclusions such as &quot;humans SHOULD do x, MUST NOT do y&quot;, etc.<p>Two completely different concepts, one word. So it&#x27;s a bit confusing.
