For example, while the Iraq war was going on and soldiers were getting killed by IEDs, I kept designing a vehicle in my head to be resistant to such infernal devices. The armored vehicle designers likely know how to do this far better than me, but I couldn&#x27;t help it.<p>But maybe not. I bought a Generac generator the other day, and the controls on it are so horribly designed I want to scream. It isn&#x27;t horrible because they saved money, it is pointlessly, stupidly bad, and Generac has been making generators forever. It baffles me.')
