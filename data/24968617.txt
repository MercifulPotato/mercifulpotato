In the workplace, this was fairly strongly enforced via the concept of &quot;professionalism&quot;, i.e. not personal. You didn&#x27;t discuss your political or religious views because the workplace wasn&#x27;t the appropriate venue. On the family front, you didn&#x27;t discuss religion or politics at Thanksgiving. And so on.<p>But, furthermore, I think, because the concept of &quot;personal&quot; was precisely that - personal, private. There was no social media ecosystem encouraging you to output your entire self into the public sphere. The fact that voting is private is an indicator that in the final analysis, your political opinions <i>should</i> be a private matter.<p>In the last few decades, we&#x27;ve seen a wholesale rejection of this idea. Instead, you should &quot;bring your whole self to work&quot;. Your political opinions are now a key, or even the <i>only</i>, important part of your personality. Markers of professionalism like wearing a suit or not swearing at work are seen as antiquated.<p>A lot of this polarization would evaporate, IMO, if we brought back the professional-personal distinction and strongly enforced it.')
