Then, refactor it to be pipelined (which demands branch stall logic). Next, add branch prediction. Then, refactor in an HDL. Finally, superscalar, VLIW, and&#x2F;or unified scheduler.<p>Choosing MICMAC or MMIX would be good macrolanguage target to start with. Remember, the microprogramming ops can be much simpler and VLIW-style.<p>The microprogram will be a ROM block that runs the decoding and execution of the actual processor&#x27;s ISA. It&#x27;s helpful to write a microprogram assembly language and compiler to make maintenance easier.')
