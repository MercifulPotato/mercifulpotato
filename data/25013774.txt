Why do we see it in physical constants and so many other places, but not election results?<p>I did look through that paper by Deckert, Myagkov and Ordeshook from the Wikipedia citation, and I find it extremely difficult to follow. (A literature search reveals a number of other papers with varying conclusions.) I haven&#x27;t done any stats since college, and that was over a decade ago, so I don&#x27;t claim to be an expert. Still, if you actually understand something, you should be able to explain it from first principles!<p>I did some more digging, and I did find this very well-written piece on Benfordâ€™s law. It is something I can actually follow: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;towardsdatascience.com&#x2F;benfords-law-a-simple-explanation-341e17abbe75" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;towardsdatascience.com&#x2F;benfords-law-a-simple-explana...</a><p>In general, I think it is best to avoid argument from intimidation. I also don&#x27;t think that linking conspiracy theorizing with someone that just wants to understand something better is a kind thing to do.')
