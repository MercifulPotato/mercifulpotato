They&#x27;re simpler to implement than HTTP 1.1 and don&#x27;t set expectations on the client they can&#x27;t meet.<p>When you&#x27;ve got a fleet of machines behind load balancers you don&#x27;t need things like a Host field to support vhosts since it&#x27;s one site to a host. You also don&#x27;t need pipelining because each connection is a one and done operation.')
