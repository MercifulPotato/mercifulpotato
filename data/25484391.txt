Item(by='enriquto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608446174, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25483489, text='&gt; Could someone tell me if I’ve got this right?<p>Yes, you got this right!<p>&gt; So when the data is visualised, the perspective in the SAR image is actually 90deg<p>True.  The extreme (and useless) case would be when the satellite is exactly in the vertical direction, then the whole image would collapse in a single point.  The closer to the horizon, the best resolution you have (but then there are problems with occluding objects).  As you say, there is a sort of &quot;equivalence&quot; between an optical image taken at an angle α from the vertical, and a radar image taken at an angle α-90.<p>&gt; I get the impression that the imaging radar has no angular resolution,<p>True.  All the antenna can do is to send a spherical wave and receive replicas of it.  Conceptually, there is 0 angular resolution.  In practice the beam is somewhat directed (to not waste energy), but the high resolution you see does not come from that.')
