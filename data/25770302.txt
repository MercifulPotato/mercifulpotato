It use to be zookeeper, but etcd is much simpler and that&#x27;s what Kubernetes uses and it has been a big success and proved itself out there in the field.  Definitely easier than a full SQL database which is overkill and much harder to replicate especially if you want to have a cluster of &gt;= 3.   Again, key is &quot;distributed&quot; and that immediately rules out sqlite.')
