It contains EVERYTHING, from payroll to inventory management. Think of it more like an Exchange server plus all Microsoft office apps combined. To connect to the Exchange server and get all features, you need Outlook. It&#x27;s the same with the SAP database and SAP client GUIs.<p>The official GUI is C++ and Windows only. They do have a Java port for other OSes, and some 3rd party GUIs, but none of that is feature-complete or even halfway there.')
