And politics, by it&#x27;s very nature, is not restricted to the realm of facts. If it was it would be science and not politics.<p>Politics is about applying values to facts.<p>EDIT: This concept is fairly well explained by Karl Popper in his book, The Open Society and Its enemies. In Chapter 5, Nature and Convention [1] which is worth a read if this is hard to grasp.<p>quoted&gt;<p>It is important for the understanding of this attitude to realize that\nthese decisions can never be derived from facts (or from statements of\nfacts), although they pertain to facts. The decision, for instance, to\noppose slavery does not depend upon the fact that all men are born free\nand equal, and that no man is born in chains. For even if all were born\nfree, some men might perhaps try to put others in chains, and they may\neven believe that they ought to put them in chains. And conversely, even\nif men were born in chains, many of us might demand the removal of these\nchains. Or to put this matter more precisely, if we consider a fact as\nalterable—such as the fact that many people are suffering from\ndiseases—then we can always adopt a number of different attitudes\ntowards this fact: more especially, we can decide to make an attempt to\nalter it; or we can decide to resist any such attempt; or we can decide\nnot to take action at all.<p>All moral decisions pertain in this way to some fact or other,\nespecially to some fact of social life, and all (alterable) facts of\nsocial life can give rise to many different decisions. Which shows that\nthe decisions can never be derivable from these facts, or from a\ndescription of these facts.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;xHDkUypF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;xHDkUypF</a>')
