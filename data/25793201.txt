There&#x27;s basically no noticeable lag normally, i have very few complaints about the raw message functionality of Signal.<p>My complaints (if you can call them that) would be the general app quality on various platforms, and how much better Telegram feels. I&#x27;m a user that also enjoys all the stupid features that non-encrypted platforms have easier times adding. Gifs, stickers, drawing, reactions, &#x2F;shrug - nothing necessary, but still.<p>So yea, functionally Signal works for me and my small group without much issue. It just doesn&#x27;t have many Bells&#x2F;Whistles.')
