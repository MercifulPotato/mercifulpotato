That feels more evil then just being a creature of the time. That&#x27;s knowing better but making a conscious decision to embrace evil because it makes your life easier.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Washington&#x27;s will freed his slaves on Martha&#x27;s death because he didn&#x27;t want to break up slave families (her slaves were part of her dowry and as such could not be manumitted so easily at will). Manumission law was quite complicated, and IIRC Washington himself lobbied to liberalize Virginia&#x27;s law somewhat so that it was not as difficult to free slaves.<p>One of the most appalling aspects of US slavery was that it did break up families quite often. Washington doing this to keep the families together is hardly evil compared to what the alternative would have been.<p>EDIT: The parent post has grated on me a bit more. Why are we so arrogant to assume we know the whole context of what was going on two or three centuries ago? Every time I review the literature of historical situations, the richness and complexity is remarkable. We tend to think of our time as &quot;more complex,&quot; but I think we are comparing the complex reality we experience with the simple stories we have been told (and continue to tell ourselves) about the past. In reality, much of the past was comparably complex to our own lives today.')
