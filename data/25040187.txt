Libraries generally aren&#x27;t a product, and even though some of them do a lot, it&#x27;s hard to charge folks for an `npm i`-style product. I tried <i>a lot</i> to look into this and it just didn&#x27;t pan out. I think there&#x27;s an opportunity for a library marketplace that does all of the curation, security checks, and other validation as it would provide a lot of value to organizations so they don&#x27;t have to build all this themselves. Seems like all of this already exists, just not in a concise package.<p>On that, I feel like docker could provide a much much better storefront, and charge folks for their packages, but just hasn&#x27;t. Did you even know they had a store? That&#x27;s what their hub is supposed to be, but they don&#x27;t charge for anything! How great would it be if they built out a marketplace?! This has even more potential, IMO, since images are generally a whole service and not just a library.<p>The opportunity and value definitely are there, and the need is there, it&#x27;s just not something that anyone has tackled in a way that makes sense with software.')
