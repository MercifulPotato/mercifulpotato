We have to remember that free speech is literally the FIRST amendment.<p>Here&#x27;s the first amendment:<p>&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;<p>&quot;Congress shall not abridge the freedom of speech.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t say &quot;freedom of speech is a mechanism that leads to truth&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t say &quot;freedom of speech means you have to let someone come into your house and speak at you&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t say &quot;freedom of speech means, if you build a social media platform, you have to let fascists use it to spread disinformation with a rapidity and accuracy of targeting that founding fathers could never possibly have conceived of&quot;. It just says &quot;Congress shall not abridge the freedom of speech.&quot;<p>In the age of social media, we have seen the truly perverse impacts that viral spread of lies can have, like in Myanmar where months of anti-Rohingya propaganda on Facebook lead to the genocide of the Rohingya [0]. Another perverse impact is the fostering of echo chambers where participants could freely share conspiracy theories and convince themselves of truly crazy things, like that Hillary Clinton ran a cabal of pedophiles that worked out of the basement of Comet Pizza, or that tens of thousands of election workers across many states executed a perfect rigging of the US election. In the past, people susceptible to fringe beliefs would struggle to find likeminded people and would have been too embarrassed to freely exercise speech, but per Facebook&#x27;s own research: &quot;64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendation tools” and that most of the activity came from the platform’s “Groups You Should Join” and “Discover” algorithms. [1][2]. Free speech was unleashed in a way never possible before.<p>Last Wednesday, the elected Representatives and Senators of my country were in the process of certifying the results of my country&#x27;s election, but they were violently interrupted by people who believe a set of lies that they&#x27;ve heard and read hundreds of times. Since this insurrection attempt, we&#x27;ve found a lot of footage indicating these people were looking to kill the Vice President and the Speaker of the House, the #2 and #3 people in the Presidential line of succession.<p>I don&#x27;t know why people think the 1st amendment means private companies, who aren&#x27;t Congress at all, should have to make the fruits of their labor accessible to terrorists, or why that&#x27;s a good thing. But a lot of people here seem to consider that to be an article of faith. I truly have no idea why.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;technology&#x2F;myanmar-facebook-genocide.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;technology&#x2F;myanmar-facebo...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;facebook-knows-it-encourages-di...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;opinion-platforms-must-pay-for-their-role-in-the-insurrection&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;opinion-platforms-must-pay-for-t...</a>')
