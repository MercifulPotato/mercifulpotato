It doesn&#x27;t come with a charging brick either, and to get the advertised speeds then you need to use that brick. Literally no other charging bricks will get that speed.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s actually true:<p>Any USB-C charger with a port on it capable of 20W or higher (including all extant USB-C Mac chargers and all extant USB-C PC chargers) will drive MagSafe at full power, and the author probably knew this, but it&#x27;s inconvenient to acknowledge it. Such chargers are extremely common.')
