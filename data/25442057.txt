That was HFT at a time in the 80s.<p>Then being able to trade a a second level to keep exchange prices in sync, that was at one time HFT level speed.  That was HFT in the 90s.<p>People now take that HFT behaviour for granted and try to move the goal posts to micro second timing forgetting that the above are all hft activities, its just that many more people can do them now.<p>HFT has undeniably shrunk spreads and decreased what the average person pays to buy the market.')
