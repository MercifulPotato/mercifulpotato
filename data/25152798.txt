They are not necessarily the <i>best</i> Q&amp;A resource (MathOverflow maybe?) but worth a mention. This is not to say AskHistorians is very forum-like, they now moderate the answers with the spirit of journal editor.<p>In general, there are good subreddits that sometimes develop community spirit. Unfortunately they are a fleeting phenomenon: either they grow too big, or die off (or in the rare case of AskHistorians, become something that can manage the flood), and if you don&#x27;t find them by accident, it probable one heard about them because they are becoming too popular.')
