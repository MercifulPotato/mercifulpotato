But, while quick results are nice, is this problem really so urgent that only the fastest solution should be considered?<p>Another difference is the set of users who are protected. If you rotate DKIM keys, you <i>protect Gmail users against non-repudiation risks</i> because their outgoing emails become more deniable. But if you strip headers from Gmail users&#x27; inboxes, you <i>protect Gmail users against hacking</i>, because now hacking a Gmail account gets you less-valuable data.<p>Also, publishing old DKIM secret keys will require some distribution method. Where do you actually put them? For a given email provider, where do you go look to find them? It&#x27;s a solvable problem but it&#x27;s one that doesn&#x27;t exist with the header-stripping approach.')
