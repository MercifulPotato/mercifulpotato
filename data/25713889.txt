Unfortunately, since then they have stagnated, and they are now stuck solving portability problems very few of us have.

CMake worked perfectly.<p>Since the decline and obsolescence of proprietary UNIX platforms, the main purpose of the Autotools has been effectively removed.  Today, the Autotools work on Linux, BSDs and MacOS, but with pretty much everything else having been long obsoleted, the amount of testing on other UNIX platforms is both minimal and completely pointless.  Few people care.  They are dead.  But, they still don&#x27;t support the most popular platforms of today: Windows, Android and iOS.  But CMake does.')
