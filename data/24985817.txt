Yet anybody requesting translation between these would be laughed out of court, and rightly so.<p>Also, doesn&#x27;t your claim that BCS speakers are attuned to different dialect groups and understand their terms even further undermine the claim that there&#x27;s an actual need for translation?  By and large, speakers of English aren&#x27;t (although thanks to Hollywood everybody knows some American), but an Aussie in NYC or a Brit in Melbourne is not going to have any real issues communicating.')
