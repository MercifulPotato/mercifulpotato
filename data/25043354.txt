Item(by='watermelon59', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1604990528, title='Ask HN: How can I overcome anxiety over dealing with infrastructure?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Not kidding: having to change - or even worse, add - anything to my team&#x27;s Terraform files gives me real, serious anxiety.<p>As someone who&#x27;s been strictly a developer for all of my 15-year career, infrastructure just doesn&#x27;t &quot;click&quot; with me. It&#x27;s a bunch of arbitrary concepts each with tons of arbitrary properties. There&#x27;s no cohesive logic to it, and I find it impossible to form a mental model of those things.<p>I&#x27;m currently responsible for creating a new service, and because I have to add a lot of new Terraform definitions to those files, I&#x27;ve literally been avoiding work these last few days. I can&#x27;t reason about it. Even if I write something, it&#x27;s annoying me to no end that I can&#x27;t look at it and analyze whether it&#x27;s complete and sound. All I can do is trial and error.<p>I understand individual concepts (like what AWS ECS and ECR, or Elasticache, or whatever), but the &quot;glue&quot; looks so inscrutable. Sometimes two things are connected together by a &quot;chain&quot; of definitions, but it&#x27;s not really a chain because it&#x27;s really hard to read those files and understand the association between components.<p>Does anyone else suffer from the same problem? How can I get better at this?')
