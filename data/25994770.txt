The stimulant medications do not make me &quot;high&quot;, do not provide any kind of buzz.  Rather, they have a moderating effect.  Explaining this requires correcting the misunderstandings in the public realm of how adult ADHD presents, but in nutshell:<p>* The (largely mental) hyperactivity is controllable, that is, I retain my creative ideas generation and interest in new things, but I am no longer governed by it, and<p>* The rarely discussed <i>hyperfocus</i> behaviour (which I frankly regard as a superpower) is more easily snapped out of.<p>To the uninformed, the most paradoxical outcome is that I can take a powerful stimulant medication, lie down in bed, and fall asleep easily, when normally I&#x27;d be staring at the ceiling pondering anything from CSS to soldering and unable to sleep for the rush of ideas.<p>This response to medication is not diagnostic, but it is indicative that the medication I have is correct.  Moreover it allows me to both retain the two traits that have made me a successful systems maker, but permits a less chaotic engagement with the neurotypical-oriented processes of modern human society, so for example I renew my passport before it expires.<p>I self-medicated with a variety of over-the-counter substances for decades, including nicotine, sugar, and coffee.  I am super grateful for the medication since I have now dropped the nicotine and sugar.<p>My psychiatrist believes the condition is a) misnamed, and would be better titled &quot;Attention Difference Disorder&quot;, and b) points out that the twin traits of rapid ideas switching and hyperfocus are only a problem in some aspects of engagement with modern society and that in an pre-agrarian society they&#x27;d be excellent traits for a hunter.')
