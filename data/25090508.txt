I&#x27;m pretty sure I used a SME server backend running Jooma or WordPress, I had experience with the server but none with Joomla or Wordpress. Two days after getting the site launched she sold the company to a competitor, paid me and I got a 22 inch LED monitor as a bonus!! So sometimes it is worth taking a chance.')
