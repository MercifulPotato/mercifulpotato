There&#x27;s nothing wrong with coming up with new models and testing them against the data, and eventually getting enough variables to be significantly more effective. But such models should be a low portion of your overall probability until actually found to be more effective.<p>Of course, if you start out with a contrived example where there&#x27;s a large amount of unobservable simple  structure, then it looks like postulating unobserved structures is good. I could give a contrary example where it&#x27;s impossible to do better than random and draw the opposite lesson.<p>Beyond that, under logical positivism there isn&#x27;t a notion of truth as the author applies it. To critique LP by saying it doesn&#x27;t get at the truth is kind of missing the point.')
