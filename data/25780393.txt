I wonder if the statistic takes in account factors like the size of the protest (large sizes alone can be seen as threatening) or the attitude of protesters- I imagine that left-wing protesters can be more confrontational than right-wing ones, especially when the issue at hand is police violence and partly because rightwing people might see the police more as an ally than a threat (because law-and-order and general conservativism).')
