The UNHCR (not the EC or EU) estimates that 1.44 million people need resettlement in 2020. \nThe European commission (EC) doesn&#x27;t set a figure but urges member countries to show solidarity with those displaced and supports member states in taking in refugees. EU  countries pledge 29,487 places between them in 2020. Given that there was 150,000 migrants arriving across the Mediterranean in 2019 I can see the EC&#x27;s and southern Europe&#x27;s problem.')
