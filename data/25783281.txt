AFAIK diet generally affects weight more than exercise does; if your diet is energy-heavy, it&#x27;s very difficult (without being an athlete) to exercise enough to consume as much as your energy surplus from the diet is.<p>I don&#x27;t have any references or numbers to back that up, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve understood from what I&#x27;ve read in papers and heard from some people who apparently did the math.<p>With that said, physical activity has lots of benefits beyond just weight loss, and it would be worth it to make one&#x27;s lifestyle non-sedentary in any case.')
