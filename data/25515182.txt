Yeah most rich people are smart but not exponentially smarter than everyone else.<p>A lot of wealth is luck. But wealthy people (like HN audience) don&#x27;t like to hear that. I can&#x27;t find a link but there&#x27;s controlled studies that show the richer someone precieves they are, the more they attribute it to skill. Even in studies where outcomes are completely randomized.<p>Usually it&#x27;s something like this: grow up as a citizen of one of the richest countries in the world. Have fairly stable family situation where you did well in school. Family wealthy enough that you went to a good primary school too. Family wealthy enough to fix overbite, scoliosis, speech impediment, and most other things that would handicap you professionally. Money&#x2F;connections&#x2F;grades to get into a good college. Skin color, gender, and culture to not be dicriminated against. Enough intelligence to pick a well paying career (maybe top ~25%). &quot;Gifts&quot; from parents early in life where wealth has decades to accumulate. Things like gifted cars, college education, wedding costs, first house. Ability to take arbitrary career risks because you always have family and their gifts to fall back on.<p>That probably describes more than half of people in well paying professions. And it&#x27;s all 100% luck. The path to millions when you&#x27;ve already got so much going for you isn&#x27;t so hard. You&#x27;ve already passed the barriers that stop 99% of people.<p>Merit isn&#x27;t wealth. Wealth is mostly luck and we shouldn&#x27;t worship wealthy people like Gods, hanging on their every word.<p>There&#x27;s logical ways to measure class mobility and the US does badly compared to practically every wealthy country besides the UK')
