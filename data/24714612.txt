There are only six distinct cases, so we can &quot;simulate&quot; it exhaustively, and a Monte Carlo will approximate this.<p>Let &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; represent the prizes; A is valuable, B and C are goats.  They&#x27;re shuffled behind doors, so the player and Monty choose &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot;, and after the fact we&#x27;ll map ABC to 123.  As such, we can assume without loss of generality that the player always chooses &quot;1&quot; and Monty always chooses &quot;2&quot;.<p>What happens?<p><pre><code>  123\n  ABC - player was right at first, so they lose if they switch\n  ACB - player was right at first, so they lose if they switch\n  BAC - player was wrong, Monty chooses 2 which is the car, so the game is ruined\n  BCA - player was wrong, Monty finds a goat, player wins if they switch.\n  CAB - player was wrong, Monty chooses 2 which is the car, so the game is ruined\n  CBA - player was wrong, Monty finds a goat, player wins if they switch.\n</code></pre>\nHuh.  Of the 4 non-ruined games, half of them are improved by switching, half are worsened.<p>I believed you were wrong, but now I believe you.')
