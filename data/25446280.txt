This was only possible because the nature of the attack left all of the compromised funds locked in place for 30 days. Arguably, if it required a rollback of the blockchain, people probably wouldn&#x27;t have gone along with it. (Though node operators and miners may still have as evidenced by the bitcoin supply bug and rollback in 2010)<p>2) The funds in the DAO at the time were roughly 14% of the total supply at the time. This is ~1.5x the amount of ether currently custodied by the largest ether custodians today.<p>3) The common argument of this event being a slippery slope and that it would lead to frequent recovery of hacked funds has turned out to be false.<p>4) Since the state change was introduced as a software upgrade, node operators (mining pools &amp; infrastructure providers) all had to opt into the change - which a large majority did. This would indicate that most organizations and individuals were either in favor of this solution or were apathetic to the solution')
