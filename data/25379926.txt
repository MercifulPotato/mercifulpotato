But process patents aren&#x27;t the only way you can protect your production process, you can also patent various necessary equipment.<p>Ultimately, if you rely on keeping a process secret, you will most likely fail. Processes are trivial to copy, patent or not, and if you don&#x27;t file a patent then it&#x27;s not even illegal to copy your process when, not if, it becomes known.')
