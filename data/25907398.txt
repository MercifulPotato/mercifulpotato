(Fever dream material right here) This is very close to my heart. If you want to lift it wholesale (I doubt it), please give me credit. I would work on this as a fulltime startup, if I did not have visa restrictions and responsibilities :)<p>1. Graphs as the fundamental way of navigating notes. Your view is exclusively of the node you are concerned with. You should be able to see a node&#x27;s content, parents, children and top ranked undirected connections. I don&#x27;t want graphs to be a &#x27;see we also have this&#x27; feature. I want it to be highly opinionated notes app that forces you to represent everything as a graph.<p>2. Ability to form strong and weak connections. Ability to extract strongly connected sub-graphs as mostly self-contained &#x27;concepts&#x27;.<p>3.(specific to me, but fundamentally important to this &#x27;ideal&#x27; app) 1st party support for inking, OCR and structure extraction. Inking is what brings all of this together. Drawing graphs with a pen is trivial. OCR, structure extraction and graph reconstruction are all solvable problems in the current Vision space.<p>User flow: (I expect this to be a 2-in-1 device or tablet)<p>* Draw a node or an orphaned sub-graph. Title and content for each node. connections (optionally directed) between nodes. Node content can be text, images, video, diagrams, etc.<p>* Run Ocr, structure extraction -&gt; and get it into text,edge-list format (user can fix any corrupt conversion)<p>* Run NLP similarity and suggest the most likely parent node (concept header) and suggest some weak connections. Alternatively user can define these themselves.<p>* Sub-graph&#x2F;Node gets added to notes<p>* Share notes by sharing any parent node. All Children and strong connections are shared instantly. Everything else stays public. Shared notes cannot delete existing nodes, but can add new nodes and parent-&gt;child connections.<p>* Nodes can also be tagged with information depth. (low, medium, detailed). That way, you can choose what level of detail to expose to a reader of said notes.<p>________________<p>The big mistake is to try to make a notes app that accommodates graphs.<p>I am thinking of a graph app that made to accomodate nodes. Sounds similar, HUGE difference in practice.')
