In so many cases, if we knew exactly how long things would take to compute we&#x27;d have already computed them or we&#x27;d have a world bending solution to The Halting Problem that would change everything. It&#x27;s really hard to describe NP Complete&#x2F;NP Hard to the average user, and it shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise that the poor tool that keeps having to do it over and over again in so many places and ways, the lowly progress bar, keeps getting blamed for our industry having failed to solve (and unlikely to ever solve) The Halting Problem.')
