There was a dev at S2 who somehow had two kids, attended university to finish up his degree, and worked at S2. As far as I know, he had a very happy family life and was a great dad. It was almost frightening seeing just how much a disciplined and motivated person can do with the time they’re given.<p>The other aspect I wanted to share, if it helps at all, is... it’s truly fine to waste your weekend, or to be unproductive and do nothing. There’s so much stigma attached to that, and almost every system in a capitalistic society would have you believe it’s a terrible sin or that you’re less of a person.<p>But I get that your point is more along the lines of “I just wish I had time for everything I wanted to do.” For whatever it’s worth, the feeling doesn’t go away. I feel guilty about not being as focused as I could have been yesterday, for example, and it’s hard to shake the idea that 24 hours are simply too few.<p>I should probably stop here, since the obvious reply is “yeah, that sure sounds like an awful problem to have, with all that time available to you. &#x2F;s” which is entirely valid.<p>But! You can get it for yourself, depending on what you can exchange for it. In truth, my laptop’s internal keyboard has been dead for four years or so. I just bring an external everywhere, since it’s $500 to fix.<p>Unfortunately parents don’t have the luxury of simply choosing to save up money and then take a year off work, because the cost of family often scales with time. So, those of you who have children and still manage to do a lot of other things: you’re real heroes in my eyes. Fuck Sunday!')
