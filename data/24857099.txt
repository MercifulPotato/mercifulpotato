Once you have 1G Torchships, orbital mechanics becomes very irrelevant.<p>You basically take straight line paths between to points in space, constantly accelerating for half the journey then flipping over at the half way point to decelerate for the rest.<p>Earth to Mars at closest takes 46 hours at 1G. Earth to Jupiter at closest takes less than 6 days. With 1G torch ships, the entire solar systems becomes accessible in less than two weeks journey. And the Expanse has ships that have much more acceleration.')
