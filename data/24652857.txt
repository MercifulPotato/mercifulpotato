Processing personal data without a basis specified in law is illegal. One of those legal bases is that processing personal data is &quot;necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the [company]&quot;. For companies that chose this as their legal basis, they must conduct a balancing test between the benefits provided by the processing and potential impact to individuals whose data is processed.<p>If you don&#x27;t do that balancing according to the whims of the data protection authority, your data processing will be a violation of GDPR.<p>If you don&#x27;t have documentation of that balancing, the authority will presume you did not do any balancing, and therefore your data processing violates GDPR.')
