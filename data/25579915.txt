All you need to do is throw data at it.<p>What it lacks are more high level operations like:<p>- Interactively switch between different chart types (lines, scatter, box plots, bar charts etc)<p>- Aggregate time series by hour&#x2F;day&#x2F;month&#x2F;week&#x2F;year<p>- Extrapolate data to the rest of the current time period<p>So I built this functionality on top of Plotly and I am happy with the result.<p>It looks like over time I will turn this into a mix of data studio and jupyter notebooks. But it runs in the browser and is simple and blazingly fast.')
