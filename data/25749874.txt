It would be interesting to see benchmarks that analyze the performance (and correctness) impact of full TSO emulation vs. heuristics.<p>Another interesting bit that is mentioned is that like Apple&#x27;s M1, NVidia&#x27;s Tegra K1 64-bit and Tegra Xavier support sequential consistency as the memory model.')
