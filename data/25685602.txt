For those who <i>don&#x27;t</i> use Linux, these times were extremely chaotic in graphics, especially for Linux with respect to Nvidia, who were largely catering to Windows users. It&#x27;s what kept Windows gaming in such a strategic position. This affects people who have lower end machines, people who can&#x27;t afford Windows, and people who seek freedom from predatory data collection. Throwing up his middle finger at a company with those kind of practices is hardly revolutionary or inappropriate.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;06&#x2F;torvalds-nvidia-linux&#x2F;amp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;06&#x2F;torvalds-nvidia-linux&#x2F;amp</a>')
