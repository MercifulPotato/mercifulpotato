We&#x27;re able to use online platforms to leverage companies into giving us what we want socially by threatening them when they step out of line. The companies that led to Parler shutting down were acting on public sentiment as a boon to their brands, thus ultimately reflecting the will of the people.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like a single payer system for social justice.<p>It&#x27;s weird end run back to representation but I&#x27;ll take it for now.
