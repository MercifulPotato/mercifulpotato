It looks like decimal floating point is something used for financial calculations.<p>Fixed point is where say in a 32 bit word, 16 bits is used for the integer part and 16 bits for the fraction or any combination that you can declare. Usually notated like 16.16 or 16:16. Another format example in 32 bits could be 8.24 and also formats in other word sizes.<p>I found some crates using &#x27;fixed&#x27; as the search term.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;search?page=1&amp;per_page=10&amp;q=fixed%20point" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;search?page=1&amp;per_page=10&amp;q=fixed%20point</a><p>It&#x27;s been my desire to have a language for embedded to have first class support for fixed point just from the ability to work with them like you would a floating point number and not have to worry about macros.')
