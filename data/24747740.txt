Item(by='pi-rat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602439595, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24746173, text='I live in a hilly city, and the green part of the city council here ran a campaign this year were they cover 25% of the cost of an ebike (up to ~$550 for bikes and ~$1100 for cargo-ebikes). Now I see Tern GSDs and Riese &amp; MÃ¼llers all over the place. Bought one myself, and it really removes the hills from the equation when deciding to bike or not.<p>They got bike counters at major routes, but sadly haven&#x27;t released stats for 2020 yet. Number of bikers have been at a stand still for the last 8 years, looking forward to see the effect of COVID + sponsored ebikes when the new numbers are out.')
