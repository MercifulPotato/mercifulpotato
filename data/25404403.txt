Post on Twitter that you&#x27;ve asked Company X for this bounty and if they don&#x27;t pay it by Date X you&#x27;ll post it on Twitter.<p>No, it is not legal. This is called blackmail. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justia.com&#x2F;criminal&#x2F;offenses&#x2F;white-collar-crimes&#x2F;blackmail" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justia.com&#x2F;criminal&#x2F;offenses&#x2F;white-collar-crimes...</a><p>Although as a non-legal expert, I&#x27;m not clear on how this is different from demanding that the company fix the bug or else you&#x27;ll reveal it after ninety days a la Google Project Zero?
