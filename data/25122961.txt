We&#x27;re not talking about &quot;users&quot; here, we&#x27;re talking about &quot;engineers&quot;. If you can&#x27;t grasp the complexity of Git, you&#x27;ve no business using it. You need to be working in an environment with a centralised VCS and somebody administering it.<p>Unless you mean just VCS for yourself, in which case you could probably just use anything you liked rather than complaining about it ...<p>And it&#x27;s not manliness to say that if you can&#x27;t grasp complexity you really shouldn&#x27;t be writing code. That&#x27;s self evident. It&#x27;s the whole point of what we do. I&#x27;m not looking down on people who can&#x27;t code - but it&#x27;s horses for courses. To suggest anything else is just bonkers.')
