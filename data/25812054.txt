It gets passed around as legit probably because it enforces the idea that Christ is a son of God.<p>But If you ask Jews, who wrote that section of the Bible, benei elokim translates as something like “those who are free”:<p>“Who or what exactly are the benei elokim? Who are the nephilim? How are they related to each other? And what does it all mean?<p>One thing benei elokim does not mean is “sons of G‑d.” In fact, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai would “curse” anyone who translated the term benei elokim as the “sons of G‑d.”1 The word elokim in Scripture, while generally referring to G‑d, is in essence merely an expression of authority.2 Similarly, the term benei does not necessarily mean “sons,” but is often just a title. Benei chorin, for example, means those who are free—not “sons of freedom.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chabad.org&#x2F;parshah&#x2F;article_cdo&#x2F;aid&#x2F;1987422&#x2F;jewish&#x2F;Nephilim-Fallen-Angels-Giants-or-Men.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chabad.org&#x2F;parshah&#x2F;article_cdo&#x2F;aid&#x2F;1987422&#x2F;jewis...</a>')
