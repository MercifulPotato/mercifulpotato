I think it’s absolutely shocking that people think that with free speech “this time it’s different” and it’s time to further restrict freedom of speech.<p>The thing that really pushed me over the edge was the poll that said “98% of people don’t believe what they read on the internet”.[1]. Unlike many people, I actually have faith that people will accept the truth, eventually.  It may take time and it may be messy and ugly, but it will happen.<p>And I also believe that the free flow of ideas (good and bad) is a fundamental quality of the American system that is overall a net plus, not a net negative.<p>And I feel sad when I see people so willing to give up such a fundamental right because of what they see on Facebook.  I mean it’s not like there are thousands of examples of where a lack of free speech has been used to oppress people.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newsfeed.time.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;07&#x2F;23&#x2F;almost-everyone-doesnt-trust-the-internet&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newsfeed.time.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;07&#x2F;23&#x2F;almost-everyone-doesnt-...</a>')
