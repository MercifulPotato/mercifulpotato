They were obviously hand picked to ensure maximum safety, adequate public profile, having committed large sums of money to prove their allegiance, as well as being existing fans of the company.  So they&#x27;re likely to be biased.<p>But that&#x27;s a long way from alleging that they&#x27;ve doctored their videos, or that Tesla itself has censored them.  There are many many instances of footage showing almost crashes that were only avoided because the driver intervened.  If you were the censor, would you allow those?<p>Compare that to Waymo or Cruise or anyone else.  They are obviously heavily censoring and have no independent owners recording footage, nor sharing it like this.  It&#x27;s a huge step up in much needed transparency.')
