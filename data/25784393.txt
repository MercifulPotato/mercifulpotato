Less so now, with mass media and increased mobility gradually reducing the extremes, but exemplars of each are almost chalk and cheese - like Queen&#x27;s English vs Cockney.<p>Northside drops trailing Ts, replacing them with a gentle glottal stop (&quot;give me my coat&quot; -&gt; &quot;gimme me coa&#x27;&quot;), &quot;book&quot; may be pronounced &quot;buke&quot;, etc.<p>Southside, at the sterotypical maximum, pushes trailing Ts towards SH and broadens vowels (&quot;are you all right&quot; -&gt; &quot;ore you awl roish&quot; - it&#x27;s not quite sh, but in that direction).<p>(I was born in Dublin, my father and his siblings grew up in North Strand in the shade of Croke Park, but I grew up in Galway, so I observed the accent as an outsider when staying in Dublin.)')
