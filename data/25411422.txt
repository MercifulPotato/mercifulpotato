For example I think they have settled on having no dynamic dispatch feature (interface, trait, virtual method, etc) at the language level. The comptime feature is flexible enough that userland approaches seem to be good enough. I bet a lot of &quot;complexity&quot; in the future will come from competing idioms used in various third party libraries.')
