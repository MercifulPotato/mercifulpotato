Item(by='derefr', descendants=None, kids=[25939358], score=None, time=1611728186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924766, text='My point was that — allowing that &quot;the web&quot; is just arbitrary &#x27;stuff&#x27; at URLs, and that a &quot;web browser&quot; is a tool for viewing that arbitrary &#x27;stuff&#x27; — there are always going to be novel <i>non-standardized, proprietary</i> document types residing at URLs, that people will nevertheless expect their web browser to display for them (and rightly so!)<p>How will users view these documents in a timely manner (i.e. not on the W3C&#x27;s glacial schedule)? Whatever your answer, it&#x27;s going to necessarily involve <i>some</i> kind of arbitrary code execution at <i>some</i> point. Whether that means Javascript; Java&#x2F;ActiveX applets, or PPAPI (NaCl); Chrome Apps or other in-browser centrally-managed-lifecycle apps; installable NPAPI plugins like Flash; or COM component servers (as seen when e.g. IE&#x2F;Edge is navigated to an .xlsx file URL.)<p>Presuming the user discovers they can&#x27;t view document X, and therefore goes and hunts down tech Y and installs it to make X viewable, all such &quot;tech Y&quot; are equivalent in the sense that they&#x27;re someone&#x27;s arbitrary proprietary code, that the user is rolling the dice on hopefully allowing them to view X, while not doing anything <i>other</i> than allowing them to view X.')
