In 12 years, I&#x27;ve never had that happen.  I have, however, had it happen dozens of times where I changed something from interpolated to not and then I have to bounce over to change the quotes.  This happens a lot and is annoying.<p>It&#x27;s also an eyesore when you have an array of messages, each neatly aligned, but some are interpolated and some aren&#x27;t, so the quotes change.<p>In Ruby, knowing that a string has interpolation is easy enough by seeing the #{} in the middle of it.  It&#x27;s hard to miss, really.<p>The single&#x2F;double quote cop which is turned on by default is also counter to the existing style of every-string-is-double when it came along.')
