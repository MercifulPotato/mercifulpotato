Item(by='bird_monster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610333878, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25723016, text='&gt; but the amount of added complexity to set up non-trivial networking and security and redundancy&#x2F;failover and backups and all that stuff in the cloud is far more complicated<p>This complexity exists either way, is my point. Whether you&#x27;re managing your own servers, or using barebones cloud VMs, or using a bunch of cloud fanciness, the complexity you just defined still exists. And if that complexity is a constant, why is it only being used as a negative against cloud services?<p>&gt; Just look at the number of anecdotes about even quite large and well-established businesses that have had systems go down because they didn&#x27;t fully understand AZs and failover arrangements, or have been landed with some crazy high bill because they didn&#x27;t fully understand all the different things they were going to be charged for, or have been breached because they left some S3 bucket open.<p>If your argument is &quot;It&#x27;s not better when done badly&quot;, definitely, I agree, because what is?<p>I guess, my overall point is that cloud-based infrastructure shifts your focus. Yes, you have to know how to configure cloud resources, but in 2021, do you think it&#x27;s easier to find people with AWS experience, or people with custom in-house or colo server management experience?')
