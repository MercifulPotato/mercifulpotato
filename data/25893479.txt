I help run and launch professional news organizations on WordPress, some of which have tremendous archives of 100s of thousands of posts.<p>The post meta table can scale fine to hundreds of thousands of post objects without needing special infra or handling. The WordPress core has a caching layer for metadata, and either way it&#x27;s not like &quot;SELECT * FROM wp_postmeta WHERE meta_key = &#x27;foo&#x27; AND post_id = 1234&quot; is going to be a performance bottleneck regardless of the size of the meta table.')
