Secure multi tenancy is a difficult problem in its own right. You would now have to build a security layer outside the JVM because the JVM is exposing too many interfaces. You can use containers but the amount of interfaces a container exposes is still high enough that a container escape is possible. Then you need a security layer on top of containers based on VMs. At this point rolling your own security solution is either going to be highly inefficient because you are allocating too many resources to individual customers or expensive because developing infrastructure management to stay secure doesn&#x27;t make your company more profitable. Your last hope would be to use an off the shelf solution like firecracker to run each JVM in a VM.<p>Alternatively you can just use a runtime that is sandboxed by default and avoid the cat and mouse game.')
