Maybe I&#x27;m on a legacy plan?<p>I pay for 75&#x2F;30, which maybe they don&#x27;t offer in your area for some reason (I pay the low end of the spectrum here, 70 a month). Its always worked well for my household so I haven&#x27;t thought to change it. Surprisingly, I&#x27;m tempted to see if I can get more speed for the dollars I&#x27;m paying.')
