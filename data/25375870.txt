The curmudgeons complained about everything you could imagine without providing much in the way of solutions.<p>I can sympathize with someone caught between these two factions, but I really dislike this rhetorical move where people say &quot;well you&#x27;re not providing solutions&quot;. Particularly if they were the one who advocated making the mess in the first place. Those people are just galling, the solution would be to fire their fucking ass.<p>Everything about this originated from people being hotshots trying to use underbaked tech and trying to get promoted (which worked by the way). The &quot;solution&quot; is not running your company&#x2F;engineering org that way.<p>The way this ends, in an equanimous &quot;who can say if it was worth it&quot; is totally bonkers to me. Think of the human cost alone. So much of this turmoil could have been avoided by not just simply going balls to the wall. This story is upsetting.')
