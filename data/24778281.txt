We want to wrap it up there.&quot; and the network&#x2F;Netflix suits to say &quot;OK, then you get two more seasons. Make &#x27;em great.&quot;<p>Very slightly less ideal would be for decisions about whether there will be, for instance, a season 4 to be made <i>at the beginning</i> of season 3, so that the writers can design season 3 to be a final season and wrap up loose plot threads.')
