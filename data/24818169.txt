My selection of Whitmer was meant as a single illustrative example, and not necessarily meant to embody all possible civic vices; if you simply wish to clarify that Whitmer was not ruled &quot;arbitrary and capricious&quot; then that clarification provides people with additional factual information which is well and good.<p>On the other hand, you can go next door to Ohio and find a ruling using that language in <i>Rock House Fitness et al v. Amy Acton and Lake County General Health District.</i> I decline to enumerate further suits at this time; I need to stop somewhere or I&#x27;ll be here all day and it won&#x27;t do anyone any good.')
