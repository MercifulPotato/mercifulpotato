Seeing them now in this way is bringing us closer to answers needed now. He raised doubts about functionalism, the theory that is the  basis of the computer revolution&#x27;s theory of mind. So for example, he showed that just knowing the rules for computation was not enough to bring forth intelligence, much the less the wisdom that is the deeper need.His private language argument, that language is not private, speaks to the community needed to make computers work. One of the more important aspects in philosophy is Kant&#x27;s\n post Church, post science goals, was for us to think for ourselves; we can&#x27;t just pass the problem off to others. Much of this is happening now, even taken for granted, but Wittgenstein helped bring it about.')
