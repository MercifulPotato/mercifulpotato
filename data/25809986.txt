Eclipse and Jdeveloper which you have time to get a coffee before any of them boot up<p>2. solr&#x2F;elastic search: 8 core and 16GB of RAM as a minimum requirement on a DEV machine, that&#x27;s insane when sqlite can do basic full text search on the cheapest raspberry pi<p>3. Jenkins which can&#x27;t run a few jobs without using many GB of memory. Other CI&#x2F;CD I&#x27;ve used and was made in Java were also dog slow and painful in so many way: IBM urban code and another one made by oracle which was well oracle<p>4. the arduino IDE which often freeze my laptop forcing me to ctrl+alt+suppr<p>5. oracle DB: internally refer as the beast by people who deal with it, I wasn&#x27;t able to run a local copy on my machine as my work laptop don&#x27;t match their 256GB of RAM server we have for the dev environment.<p>6. boot time which make it almost unusable for CLI type of application<p>7.
