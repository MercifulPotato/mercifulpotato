Lenders would just need to be sure that loans are structured so that they are repaid before the jubilee.<p>I would think the bigger effect would be to dissuade lenders from lending more than the borrowers could repay before the debt forgiveness date. Also certain things that are inflated due to finance (like housing, cars, college) might see an adjustment to more affordable prices, or maybe some things would cycle, going up when people could borrow, and going down as the debt forgiveness event approached.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting idea, to think about the pros and cons.')
