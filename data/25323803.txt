Being polite is socially expected, therefore being rude is unexpected. When you&#x27;re rude, people take it personally, and it creates anxiety, anger, and rage, because it is unexpected and frankly, unnecessary.<p>There&#x27;s just no situation I can imagine where being rude and impolite helps. Every social situation is ameliorated by the engine oil that is kindness. People are happier, more willing to help, more creative and flexible, all due to not yelling and not personally attacking them. Both parties in any transaction or interaction being polite is a win win.')
