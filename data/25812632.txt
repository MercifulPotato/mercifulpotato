Centralized services are single point of failure, and in that regard Signal is no better than WhatsApp, because yes, in theory you can run your own server, but have you tried to do so?<p>It&#x27;s not practical or even endorsed by the Signal creators themself, since there is no way in the clients to make them connect to your server instead of the centralized one.<p>Another bad thing of Signal is the use of a phone number as the authentication method. A phone number is not something that preserves your privacy. Well in theory in countries where you can go into a shop and buy a SIM card cash yes, but in a lot of countries you have to give your ID. Another aspect in which email is just better.')
