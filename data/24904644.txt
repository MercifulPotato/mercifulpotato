However this means that even if your server can theoretically handle 5000 concurrent reads you will never get there because opening 5000 connections isn&#x27;t practical. You&#x27;ll likely hit a memory limit.<p>Why is this generally accepted as ok? Decoupling concurrency from connections seems possible via pipelining commands over a single connection. Is it just too late for a project as mature as Postgres?')
