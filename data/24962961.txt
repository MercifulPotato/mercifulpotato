It could be a one line change or many days of work<p>With time range, you can represent that and it&#x27;s very visible. With points, you can represent that as the same points, but that does not reflect reality, one of the two estimates is potentially wrong.\nThis also helps providing input on what research tasks should be performed and what&#x27;s their value.')
