I care about what the government knows and what it can do to you. I constantly have 2-3 low risk exposure notifications.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t matter where they happened since I already know that I am carefully avoiding risky areas. I am sitting next to my window when working and people walk past that window within 2 meters. That alone could set off exposure notifications. Or maybe someone across the aisle in the supermarket?<p>Would I not go to the supermarket if I know it happened there? Would I not go for a walk if I knew someone 8 meters away from me on some bench was later diagnosed with COVID?<p>It barely serves any purpose at all outside of curiosity. The app already tells you everything you need to know.')
