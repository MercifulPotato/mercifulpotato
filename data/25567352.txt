We want to cure cancer, and find effective general-purpose antivirals, and help people maintain healthy bodies, and figure out how to repair hearts, and cure diabetes, and fix autoimmune disorders, and figure out general-purpose gene therapies, and work out what exactly is up with the gut microbiome, and make prosthetic ears&#x2F;eyes&#x2F;etc, and then there&#x27;s the brain...<p>There&#x27;s only so much that you can do with the technology we have right now.
