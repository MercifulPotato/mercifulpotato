Everyone who sat out of the market since 2011 loudly shouting about a bubble.<p>And the world is not as simple as your rejoinder. 2011 came after a crisis unlike anything seen since the 1930&#x27;s.  And the &#x27;fixes&#x27; to the economy since then have patched over rather than resolved the debt overhangs that led to the 2008 crisis. The great &#x27;patch&#x27; was to print money. But the real economy (the physical universe that the financial universe simulates) still has constraints. Figuring out which one we trip over next is entrail-reading, but to think that constraints are no longer an issue is dangerous.')
