The pictures are small because a big picture will throw things off.<p>I&#x27;m not sure, but I think Japanese people (and Asians in general) have very different rules for negative space - they either don&#x27;t use it at all (and pack the design like blocks of tofu) or will use it in a very intentional way. It&#x27;s rarer (as far as I can tell) for negative space to just relaxing filler, it&#x27;s more a bold statement similar to an attention-grabbing graphic.')
