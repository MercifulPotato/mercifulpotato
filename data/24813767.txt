It&#x27;s quite common to see a significant performance gain and reduction in stuttering from the cracked version compared to the original version.<p>For this reason I tend to prefer buying my games from GOG, which sells all its games DRM-free.<p>I do value the work game developers put in these games and I buy all of them, but I like having the peace of mind that if something happens to my purchases down the road I could run a cracked executable later on.')
