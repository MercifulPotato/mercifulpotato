How hard can it be?  But then, I am no user of CMYK.  All my experience is RGB, and in fact I am bad enough at color to not really notice it when color profiles are significantly off.  CMYK is an unknown unknown for me, I don&#x27;t even understand the troubles they are having.<p>So I think this touches a core problem of open source:  The average hobbyist does not feel this itch, hence can&#x27;t scratch it.  You need someone with good understanding of the printing industry, maybe access to professional printing hardware.  Hard to do on hobby time or as a lone programmer.  This is an example of a whole class of problems where OSS tends to do worse than the industry average.<p>BTW, it pains me to say this as a regular user, krita is very good software.')
