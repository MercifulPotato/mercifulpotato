Large customers can almost always find the capital to run their own infrastructure and save on cost. That&#x27;s not to say that there aren&#x27;t big customers of these types of services or that certain business models make using them more attractive than maintaining infrastructure yourself, but I would guess that revenue from these sorts of services are largely built on appealing to smaller customers, so their needs would be taken into consideration. Not taking potential cost overruns into consideration to me seems a bit deliberate.<p>To me it looks very similar to the personal checking overdraft schemes banks were using up until a few years ago.')
