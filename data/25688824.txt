Item(by='aidenn0', descendants=None, kids=[25690361], score=None, time=1610133288, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25688090, text='A quick search shows that many states have changed their stances either through precedent or legislation over the past 20 years or so, so my information may be out of date.<p>The California court&#x27;s website states that cohabiting spouses is a conclusive presumption[1] and the exceptions to overturning are very limited, even with genetic testing.  I&#x27;m not a lawyer and can&#x27;t easily research precedent, but the law seems pretty clear that if you don&#x27;t challenge before the 2nd birthday of the child, it can&#x27;t be overturned.  There may be other restrictions as well.<p>It seems like recent anecdotes I can find relate to the 2 year deadline.  The father didn&#x27;t challenge paternity at the time of divorce, found out he was not biological father (or that he could challenge) later, but it was too late.<p>Hopefully we can all agree it would be shitty to disown a kid you&#x27;ve been raising for years because you found out you weren&#x27;t the biological father, but I can certainly have empathy for someone who has limited (or no) visitation and is stuck shelling out money for someone else&#x27;s kid.<p>[edit]<p>It looks like the law was revised recently as well, so amybe the court website is out of date on some of this?  AB2684 mentions &quot;rebuttable presumptions&quot; and was passed in 2018, going into effect in 2019.  IANAL and don&#x27;t have time to follow up on this.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courts.ca.gov&#x2F;1202.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courts.ca.gov&#x2F;1202.htm</a>')
