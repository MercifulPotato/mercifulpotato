Repeatedly pruning things that 90% of the current userbase doesn&#x27;t use over time give you a thoroughly useless product. I mean, do it 7 times, and you&#x27;ve already lost 50% of your audience. If you target 80% cutoff, you&#x27;re down to 20% of the users now.<p>I personally <i>do</i> want it from WSL. Hell, 90% of my use of WSL is like this - I run Emacs on my work machine under WSL, where it feels at home. I use it to drive Windows-side cmake and Visual Studio compiler, piping output back to Emacs. Because I can, it works, and it&#x27;s a much nicer working experience than any app could give me.')
