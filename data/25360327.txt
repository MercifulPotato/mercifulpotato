Item(by='caconym_', descendants=None, kids=[25361069], score=None, time=1607531255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25358907, text='My understanding is that the master encryption key does not exist on the device in non-volatile storage, but rather is computed by combining a secret key (I guess you could call this a “salt”) stored in the secure enclave with the user’s passphrase. When you start the device and authenticate, this derivation happens, and then the derived key is kept in memory and it’s only software keeping an attacker out.<p>If the locked state without a derived key loaded is as secure as it theoretically should be, doesn’t that mean recovering data off the device without uncapping (or similar) requires correctly guessing the passcode in however many master key derivation attempts the secure enclave is configured to allow before it wipes the secret key and renders the stored data useless?<p>This seems really secure on average, even with a weak PIN. I’m trying to decode Cellebrite’s claims about access to “locked” phones and I’m assuming they mean locked with key loaded, though I guess I can imagine some vulnerability that sidesteps the maximum attempts logic in the secure enclave.')
