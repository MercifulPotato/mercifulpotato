The UN system was put in place for America to exert its post-war dominance. China is a complicated nation. It is constructing a parallel system to the IMF&#x2F;World Bank that under-girds US hegemony. It also controls a huge fraction of world manufacturing due to the laziness and greed of the business community. However, because it is not a pure capitalist country, it doesn&#x27;t have the same imperial market imperatives that western countries certainly have.<p>If we don&#x27;t try to build a better future, we will realpolitik ourselves into a dystopian one.<p>Also, nations are fake creations of the elites. The working class is international in scope and we have no quarrel with one another.')
