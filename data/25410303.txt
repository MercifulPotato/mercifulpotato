CFR cannot be higher than IFR. The number of deaths per confirmed infection obviously isn&#x27;t higher than the number of deaths per infection (confirmed or unconfirmed).<p>I&#x27;ll continue to believe epidemiologists who actually have a clue what they are doing over your &quot;general impression&quot;.')
