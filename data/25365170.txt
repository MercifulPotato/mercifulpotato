Solving it, in my experience, requires a strongly supported central body focused on managing code quality across teams. I know this is a relatively straightforward exercise with large React apps. I&#x27;ve never seen it done with Angular to know how difficult that is. Doing this all comes with a cost of maintaining that team and possibly slower development, of course.<p>However, I assert that no cloud provider has won or lost significant cloud deals based on the speed of their UI, and most engineers who live in the cloud do so through CLI tools. While people may not like it, and perhaps it&#x27;s caused some engineers to do something different for personal projects, this is rightly not a KPI for Google Cloud, hence the state of of the cloud console.')
