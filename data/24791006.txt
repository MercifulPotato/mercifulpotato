Item(by='mitchellh', descendants=None, kids=[24791643, 24797581], score=None, time=1602781980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24790941, text='The similarity between Otto and Waypoint are only skin deep: they both use the word &quot;deploy.&quot; The way they deploy, their philosophies, etc. are COMPLETELY different. I talk about that in this comment a bit here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24790491" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24790491</a><p>Waypoint is fully open source. There is no risk of it going closed source. If you are alluding to Otto here, Otto&#x27;s source was never removed either, it is in the Git history of the project that&#x27;s still on GitHub and we provided a one-click download link on the Otto website when we shut it down.<p>EDIT to add: If you&#x27;re afraid of us shutting down projects, please note Otto is the only project in our entire history we shut down like that. So we don&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t!) have the same reputation around that that Google has. Terraform was effectively failing (no growth) for almost 12 months and we stayed committed to that.')
