Thousands of people chose to buy the book.  That&#x27;s where the $90k number comes from.<p>&gt; And the book&#x27;s photos are black &amp; white ...<p>&quot;The food is terrible...and the portions are so small&quot;.<p>The wonderful thing about the free market is that those who want to buy a thing can, and those who don&#x27;t, need not.<p>Cheers!')
