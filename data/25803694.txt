We do support incremental updates for MSSQL &amp; Postgres -- I updated the docs to make this clear.<p>More broadly as an ELT tool, Airbyte is focused on supporting the long tail of integrations. The number of data silos is increasing rapidly, and it&#x27;s intractable for a single engineering team or company to integrate with them all. So as an OSS tool, Airbyte provides a core platform for replicating data (e.g: a UI, scheduling, logging, state management, etc..) and the most popular connectors out of the box, then gets out of the way of its users. If you need a connector you need that Airbyte doesn&#x27;t already provide, you can implement a Docker image which conforms to the Airbyte protocol, then start using it in your Airbyte instance without ever needing to go through us (Although many users do end up contributing their connectors back to the core codebase).')
