The packages usually use the platform standard .pkg installer format.<p>(Note that the update check does not send information about your system to Apple.)<p>Apple still provides the `softwareupdate` command line tool to list, download, and apply updates and even whole OS installers of the last 4 years of releases. The OS installers contain tools that can produce bootable install media if you want to archive them.<p>Apple has also provided tools to mirror software updates on your own infrastructure---see the &quot;Content Caching&quot; option in the Sharing prefpane, for example. Not sure what the state of this is today.<p>I think the linked article makes good arguments for why it may be premature to discontinue the standalone updates. And I am critical of how difficult it is to obtain OS installers for older hardware and VMs. But it&#x27;s not the end of macOS as a developer platform.')
