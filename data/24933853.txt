And neither is the nytimes, wsj or any major news company at this point.<p>&gt; Giuliani has burned his credibility, and the entire laptop story is on its face unbelievable.<p>It&#x27;s far more credible than incubator babies or yellowcake.<p>&gt; These other stories like Yellow Cake came from legit sources that were credible at the time.<p>No they weren&#x27;t. It was intentionally manufactured lies. The nayirah testimony was a PR generated propaganda. And yellow cake was propaganda conjured up by the nytimes and pro-war intelligence groups.<p>&gt; You are comparing apples and oranges.<p>You are right, I am comparing actual lies that led to millions of people&#x27;s deaths and a possible lie.
