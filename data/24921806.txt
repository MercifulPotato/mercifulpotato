But it&#x27;s not a replacement of X11. You don&#x27;t &quot;switch to Wayland&quot;, despite what that GDM button seems to indicate. Wayland is just a protocol, whereas X11 is a protocol and entire system around it.<p>So Wayland is not a replacement of X11. Gnome on Wayland <i>should</i> be a replacement for Gnome on X11. KDE on Wayland should be replacement for KDE on X11. Sway on Wayland should be a replacement for i3 and X11. But as you can imagine in this equation, KDE, Gnome and Sway are permitted and required to take on more responsibilities.<p>You might take issue with the fact that a lot more of the display stack gets tied up in specific desktop environments. It&#x27;s KDE and Gnome and Sway that are not providing you these command line tools&#x2F;screen recording&#x2F;clipboard access. I don&#x27;t mean to say this as nitpicking or that &quot;&quot;&quot;Wayland&quot;&quot;&quot; (whatever that means) is dropping the ball, but this is <i>really</i> the responsibility of the desktop environment (or WM) in Wayland&#x27;s design. Wayland is just a protocol.<p>What you&#x27;re observing as shortcomings in Wayland is really a lock of pace and direction of development for (e.g. Freedesktop) standards that standardize clipboard access&#x2F;screen recording use cases, and the adoption of those standards. The Linux community seems to have been hit by 1) not realizing Wayland does not replace X11 and 2) realizing that, not being to coordinate standardization well of the pieces of the X11 stack that should be replaced as well. If you need to replace X11, you need a lot more than just Wayland. But that seems to keep on catching people by surprise.<p>I think it&#x27;d be helpful for the future of the Linux desktop if more people recognized that.')
