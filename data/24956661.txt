(or a convertible note?)<p>2) What % time is the CEO + Chairman dedicating to the company? Why is the final member getting 25% equity for being chairman? What value is the chairman bringing to justify the equity? Does the 25%-chairman provide some of that 200K?<p>3) How does the existing company view their CEO becoming CEO of a new company? Or him taking two people out of that project and putting into yours? How would you feel if he took people out of your company and started a 3rd company with someone else?<p>Here&#x27;s my advice: Startups are hard enough to do with people committed full-time, or 120% even. If we&#x27;re talking about a scalable start-up and not a lifestyle business, if you guys will go raise again,  no one will invest into a company where 2 part-time guys own 50% of the equity, where the CEO is a part-time person with another company to run. Any new investor, or customer for that matter, will require your team to be fully committed to your company - if not, why should they commit as an investor or customer?<p>After all you are quitting your job.<p>There are certain exceptions - some biotechs are co-founded by well known professors, or if your CEO is Steve Jobs, Elon Musk etc.<p>As it stands this doesn&#x27;t seem to have the right structure, right incentives, and right economics built-in.<p>Try to recruit a full time co-founder who knows the industry you&#x27;re targeting.  If you fail to do that, perhaps that&#x27;s a good indication that the idea is not amazing. After all, you&#x27;re trying to convince someone to get paid for doing the idea. Soon, you&#x27;ll have to convince customers to part with their money :)<p>Also, if your idea is good, you can raise money from a seed-fund with a better structure.  You can even tell those funds the story about this CEO etc. If the seed funds pass, you can ask them genuinely what they didn&#x27;t like.')
