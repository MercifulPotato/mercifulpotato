Back when I started my PhD program in biophysics, the exact opposite was stated: &quot;if you can determine the 3D structure of the protein that causes a disease, you can target it with a drug.&quot;.  I wasted <i>decades</i> believing that paradigm because really smart people kept repeating it.<p>unfortunately there is no clear next step for the disease biology part of the study, as far as I can tell, except to collect enormous amounts of high quality data about diseases, typically one or a few at a time, and hope you get lucky finding something (IE, serendipity is just as important as intelligence).')
