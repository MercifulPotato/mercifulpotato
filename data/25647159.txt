Sometimes you get enough sleep but wake up feeling shocking, while other times you&#x27;ll wake up after getting less sleep but feel great. There&#x27;s probably ways to do this much more accurately but I find if I get 6, 7.5, or 9 hours sleep, I&#x27;ll feel great, but waking up in between those 90 minute intervals is rough.')
