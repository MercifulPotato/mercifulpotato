There doesn&#x27;t appear to be non-classified evidence that can attribute it (yet - at least available to FireEye&#x2F;Mandiant).<p>But members of the US subcommittee on Cybersecurity have attributed it and asked for the evidence they saw to be declassified.<p>Having said that, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if in coming days it is able to be positively attributed from non-classified sources. This attack seems very widespread, and while it seems extremely professionally done in the past we&#x27;ve seen how small errors make attribution possible.<p>Usually it&#x27;s that an exploit developer reused some supporting infrastructure that has been previously seen and it can be attributed from that.')
