They all get how to use Mastodon, including the seniors, so that&#x27;s what most people engage with.  Peertube videos can be easily embedded into toots so both pics and videos are shareable.<p>I also have a Nextcloud instance and have all photos and videos auto uploaded, then recently Nextcloud introduced some workflow features that I used to auto upload all videos from Nextcloud to Peertube, making it really easy to go pick the video link and share.<p>What I&#x27;ve found is that better quality photos and videos tend to make it into Mastodon and Peertube, while other content will still be shared in the Signal group chat.<p>It&#x27;s all running in docker, making it easy to upgrade, backup, and&#x2F;or move around.')
