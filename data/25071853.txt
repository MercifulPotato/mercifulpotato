Complexity exists in the problem domain of the web, and always will. .NET Core is generally well architected in response to a long experience in enterprise and developer concerns. It&#x27;s not a magical answer to every domain&#x27;s requirements, but it&#x27;s generally a damn good compromise ime.')
