If you can do that with JS I would genuinely love to know (since I write JS frequently).<p>&gt; Picking Clojure over JS today is a very hard sell.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I would choose ClojureScript over JS on the frontend. I haven&#x27;t worked with ClojureScript much nor thought much about the trade-offs.<p>&gt; Defaulting to immutability it&#x27;s not as useful in single-threaded environments like nodejs or the browser.<p>It might not be as useful, but I think it&#x27;s still useful. With immutability, you know that inside a scope you can do whatever you want with any data (ignoring atoms for a moment) and you&#x27;re not going to step on somebody else&#x27;s state.<p>&gt; with the difference that JS has a big enabling ecosystem of libraries<p>ClojureScript has interoperability with all the JS libraries, no?<p>And if you need strong typing, then I&#x27;d agree Clojure is not a good fit.')
