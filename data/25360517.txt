If YouTube or Instagram didn&#x27;t get acquired, Google and Facebook would find a way to destroy them just like Microsoft did to Netscape and they wouldn&#x27;t exist anymore but in essence they are great products and there are no other products like them on the market. Once they get destroyed there is less competition and at least when they are alive you can look up to them for quality of service and motivation to compete.')
