My solution in the past has been FIR filters and waiting a long time.  I recently experimented with alternative forms of IIR representation.  I found that converting from transfer function (B,A) to zero-pole-gain (z,p,k) form, then to second order sections (sos,g) form, then using the MATLAB filter function, the issues with double floating point precision go away in my use cases.<p>Is this a well known trick that I just stumbled upon?')
