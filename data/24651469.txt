This is certainly in part for competition reasons, but it&#x27;s also so they can ensure that I&#x27;m not materially increasing my risk of burn-out, which would cost them (and I think they have a legal obligation to ensure I&#x27;m remaining healthy within their scope, though I&#x27;m not sure where the boundaries of that lie.)<p>So if I said I was doing 5 hours or so per week for something else unrelated to my company, it&#x27;d probably be fine. If I instead was doing 30, there&#x27;d be cause to not give me approval, or step me down to reduced hours with them, or similar.')
