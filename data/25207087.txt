Having a few packs could be beneficial, but while city dwellers are mostly in favor, hunters and farmers see it more critically.<p>I like wolves, but if they gain a critical spread, there will be conflicts with civilization.<p>And of course you need to hunt them at some point to keep them away from urban areas. Didn&#x27;t take 5 years after their immigration for my country to allow to hunt them again because they primarily attack grazing animals even if they are only present in tiny numbers.<p>We have too many boars and there is truth in the argument about ecological balance, but they aren&#x27;t the preferred prey if there are that many sheep around.
