If it was a single woman smiling it would probably be labelled &quot;happy woman&quot; or just &quot;happiness&quot;. The word &quot;white&quot; is likely to appear when there are other people of different colors in the same picture. For example &quot;Afro man and white woman happy at a pool&quot; or something like that.<p>Same with European art. The prefix &quot;European&quot; would only be added when the author of the picture tries to contrast it with something else, or push some agenda about &quot;European art&quot;. Otherwise it would just be under &quot;art&quot;.<p>Case in point with another term: look at &quot;American scientists&quot; and &quot;white American scientist&quot;. The second one will have more results of black people. This is again, in my opinion, because the addition of &quot;white&quot; is mainly added by those who concentrate and write about things related to  race.<p>Another case in point - try looking for &quot;thin woman&quot; and observe how the proportion of pictures with obesity in them is bigger compared to searching for &quot;woman&quot; only.')
