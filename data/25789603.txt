I would always deny access and still manage to successfully login. Yesterday I tried the same but with no luck. I contacted Dropbox support and this is their reply:<p>&gt; I&#x27;m afraid that is not possible at the time. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.<p>Interesting that they chose this route when users are getting more and more privacy-aware.')
