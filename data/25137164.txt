That&#x27;s been my experience. Proclamations and cheerleading about &quot;we&#x27;re a meritocracy, we act democratically in this company&quot;.<p>Times get tough (like a Global pandemic coming along), employees ask firm questions like &quot;will the executives taking a pay cut like the rest of us?&quot;<p>Response: &quot;the board said no&quot;<p>&quot;We&#x27;re all in this together&quot;; &quot;The board won&#x27;t approve it.&quot;<p>&quot;Burnout is real! Take steps to monitor it&quot;;&quot;The board won&#x27;t approve a 4 day work week&quot;<p>etc.  I&#x27;ve been in some VERY heated and passionately argued meetings in the last month as a leader, hearing my cohort leaders giving voice and in some cases giving voice myself to concerns and frustrations coming from a workforce that is growing pretty pessimistic watching how much of the internal corporate cheerleading and messaging in practice is at odds with corporate <i>rhetoric</i> that have manifested during our extended org-wide WFH.<p>Wonder if anyone else has observed the same.')
