You can’t just turn a dial and add more talent.<p>It’s true that we can’t turn a dial, but there must be a vast amount of human potential that goes unused every day, because people are born in impoverished countries, or suffer discrimination due to gender or race or something else, get sick with a preventable disease, or whatever other thing denies them the opportunity to make the most of themselves.<p>This is probably actually the norm in the world, not the exception.<p>So I think there’s rather a lot we could do as a species (or within individual countries) to give people opportunities and make sure potential for progress is realised')
