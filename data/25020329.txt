Since the parent was explicitly talking about <i>any</i> email communication coming from accounts you’ve signed up for, it is important to note that the CFR you’re citing does not always apply.<p>You absolutely can legally require a password to change some subscription and communication settings relating directly to someone’s account, to require otherwise would be a glaring and massive security hole. It’s quite easy to spoof email addresses, and being able to unsubscribe someone else from transactional email subscriptions would be extremely dangerous.')
