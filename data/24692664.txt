Social interaction is not programming.<p>I&#x27;ll just point you at yet another poll from Sweden, this one from another institute - Sifo - and published in another newspaper - SvD (Svenska Dagbladet) - with exactly the same outcome as the one from Demoskop: 58% of respondents want a reduction in migration [1].<p>You come across like someone with a black-and-white view of the world, possibly partly due to your stated profession of programmer. My advice to you is to go out into the world a bit more, speak to people outside of your own circle. Those people you so easily put in a box labelled &#x27;racist&#x27; or &#x27;right-wing&#x27; might actually have some insights which you lack. If you think more than half of the Swedish and Dutch population is &#x27;racist&#x27; and &#x27;right-wing&#x27; the problem lies with you, not with those you try to stamp and label.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svd.se&#x2F;okat-flyktingmotstand--kopplas-till-kriminalitet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svd.se&#x2F;okat-flyktingmotstand--kopplas-till-krimi...</a>')
