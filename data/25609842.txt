You don’t have to pay up front and this is a textbook stress claim, esp if six months employment. It’s sad nobody knows their rights. Your first clue is the fact that they were pressuring you to resign. NEVER RESIGN.<p>It sad he will be dealing with this stress for life but never thought that he should at least consult with an attorney??? THIS IS AMERICA.
