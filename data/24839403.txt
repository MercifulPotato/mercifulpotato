Item(by='Slartie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603211705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24837257, text='&gt;I also want to add that I want to punch an executive every time someone calls his discord space a &quot;server&quot;. It&#x27;s not a server.<p>As far as I know, they don&#x27;t even internally use that name, but call it a &quot;guild&quot;, which is kind of a bad name in its own right (because not every community using Discord is a &quot;guild&quot; - not even in gaming, since mostly fantasy-MMORPG-style games call their game-internal groups &quot;guilds&quot;, other games often use different monikers, &quot;clans&quot; or &quot;corporations&quot; or whatever fits the game world). However, I must admit that it was a genius idea to market the thing to users as a &quot;server&quot;, because that invokes the idea of an actual dedicated server as they were typical for earlier Teamspeak&#x2F;Mumble solutions, which usually was a significant time and money investment. By calling Discord communities &quot;servers&quot;, people who switch over from one of these classic self-hosted setups subconsciously think they are now getting the same thing for free that they usually had to pay a significant sum of money for.')
