It&#x27;s just a matter of time when developers will make use of higher core numbers, and distributing the workload across more cores will also reduce the power consumption of the CPU, which is essential for light and portable laptops.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced, parallelism is not inevitable for individual applications, it can be hard or not applicable. I understand there are certain CPU intensive programs where the benefit is too great to ignore, but for the rest it still seems like it&#x27;s not worth the developers time.')
