Bitcoin corresponds with Austrian economic ideas in that bitcoin was intended to provide a monetary alternative that is beyond the reach of governments to regulate. Bitcoin has correspondence with libertarian ideas, which have some relationship with Austrian ideas. In the USA, my experience is that bitcoin proponents appear to have obtained their theory from science-fiction, radical libertarian popular literature, anti- government&#x2F;anti-tax activism, and often from nothing that is apparent except their own thoughts.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1312.2048.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1312.2048.pdf</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1312.2048" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1312.2048</a>')
