Due to usage latency from the time that a resource is used to the time that the activity is billed, you might incur additional costs for usage that hasn&#x27;t arrived at the time that all services are stopped. Following the steps in this capping example is <i>not a guarantee that you will not spend more than your budget</i>. Recommendation: If you have a hard funds limit, set your maximum budget below your available funds to account for billing delays.<p>(Source link in parent post, emphasis mine).<p>In this case they had a additional cost due to delay of $72k. Which, lets be honest means this feature kinda useless for anything but the somewhat harmless case.<p>Only by combining this with resource limits in load balancers, instance and concurrency limits and similar can the maximal worst cost be limited. But tbh. this partially cripples auto-scaling functionality and it&#x27;s really hard to find a good setting which doesn&#x27;t allow to much &quot;over&quot; cost and at the same time doesn&#x27;t hinder the intended auto-scaling use-case.')
