They see three lines of code in more than one place and extract it into a single procedure, without knowing if those three lines of code present a useful abstraction or they are just necessary boilerplate. Soon the codebase become a rube goldberg device with stuff piping in and out of these buckets of DRY code and run-time switches to activate or deactivate behaviors. Instead, you want helpers and components and tools to be reused but only when you notice a pattern, not before.')
