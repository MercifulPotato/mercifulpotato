IIRC the main reasons I chose Django-Q were 1) Built in DB as a broker (Huey is mainly focused on Redis I think) 2) Django-Q can run multiple clusters (I run in an AWS auto scaling group) and not duplicate scheduled tasks and 3) it will run on Windows (I run an OS project that is cross platform).')
