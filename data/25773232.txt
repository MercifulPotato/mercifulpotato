There are many cloud services, colo facilities, etc. If Amazon chooses not to do business with you there are certainly other options.<p>This certainly happens at the local level all the time: really toxic customers can get &quot;fired&quot; and banned from all the local movie theaters or all the local grocery stores. It is really no different online - some people just got used to living consequence-free on the internet. Wider society had no idea what the internet was at first then later didn&#x27;t grasp the seriousness or impact the internet had. Fewer people hold such obviously disprovable beliefs now.

Neo-Nazi groups often can&#x27;t find private venues willing to host their rallies, caterers willing to serve them food, etc. Newspapers refuse to run ads all the time. Broadcast networks don&#x27;t hand over the microphone to everyone who demands it. If every newspaper in the country refuses to run your political ad that doesn&#x27;t make it a grand conspiracy to censor you - perhaps you&#x27;re just an asshole they don&#x27;t want to do business with.<p>RIRs are not regular for-profit businesses and operate under very different policies for many reasons not the least of which is there are no alternatives since the RIR controls your access to the internet within your region via IP assignments.')
