Discussions end up in flame wars, vitriolic language, and the moderation is very ad-hoc. But people definitely love to debate.<p>I am envisaging a platform that allows the community to structure and &quot;type-check&quot; (loosely) arguments.<p>The key I feel is to allow people to post as they normally would and then allow annotation tools to structure arguments. Essentially a super easy UX to carry out [argument mapping](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Argument_map).<p>The goal would be to find as much as possible that people agree on (definitions, evidence) and then to focus the arguments on the specific points of contention.<p>I can imagine a template of logical argument forms such a &quot;X should do Y when Z&quot; which would need to be filled in for an argument to be valid.<p>Its usually difficult to come to an objective truth when arguing, so another key point is tracking consistency of argument. This is a great way to invalidate an argument. If someone makes a claim like &quot;X should do Y when Z&quot;, if they are caught saying &quot;X should not do Y when something similar to Z&quot; then its a great way to invalidate an argument and unearth bias without having to examine the rest of the argument.<p>I want to bring back the art of debate!')
