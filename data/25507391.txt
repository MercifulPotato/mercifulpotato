It costs money to make movies, TV shows, and music. There are millions of people whose careers depend on it. Most of the people involved make less than your average HN media pirate. Yes, like everything else, the people at the top make more. Yes, there are shitty UIs, DRM, and absurd rules preventing fair and convenient use of media even if you pay for it. No, copying media isn&#x27;t the same kind of theft as shoplifting. You&#x27;re still unilaterally deciding that the rules don&#x27;t apply to you, that no one involved in the production deserves to get paid. Don&#x27;t like all the negative aspects of the broken media business? Fine, spend your money on something else, but watch something else too. You should all be ashamed of yourselves.')
