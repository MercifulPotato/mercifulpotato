Currently they have just commandeered my wife&#x27;s laptop since she uses her phone almost exclusively these days.<p>Part of me thinks staying with a fully functioning computer is the way to go, and that the new Raspberry pi 400 keyboard pc thing might be a good fit for that.<p>And then part of me thinks I should just get a roku and call it a day.<p>Either way I&#x27;d have to buy a monitor. I could also just get a smart tv I suppose, but I really don&#x27;t care for TVs with all the &quot;smarts&quot; built in.<p>Thoughts?')
