We also can turn on more scanning and other features of all email users.<p>The key though, if you allow users to PUT files onto your S3 (even private &#x2F; signed in) then google may scan them. That means if your user uploads a suspicious file to a trouble ticket system, if there IS a virus in there and google sees it, wham. Obviously most folks will segregate those uploads off into their own s3 bucket by user&#x2F;account to avoid contamination, but you really have to be careful not to hose viruses AT ALL on your key domains.')
