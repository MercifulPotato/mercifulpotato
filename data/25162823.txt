Every time I&#x27;ve heard someone say &quot;Intel uses RISC internally&quot;, what they mean is that the decoding logic used to turn x86 instructions into uops (and thus get the benefits of RISC) takes up a fixed amount of transistors on the board that RISC doesn&#x27;t need, and this penalty becomes proportionally larger at lower power levels, hence why x86 is still a good performer on servers&#x2F;HEDTs but got crushed in mobile. Which is pretty much what this article says as well.')
