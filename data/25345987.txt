After all this crisis is about health, we are clearly concerned with our health so why does this not extend to concern around a rapidly developed vaccine that you are going to put in your body?<p>Humans err all the time, why is this an exception? Why is no one here skeptical, or at least curious? Why is critical thinking set aside?<p>Science is now relative. Not only do we have mass misinformation but the side effect is an overreaction seeing intelligent thinkers reject their principles in order to put as much distance as possible between them and the perceived thought cancer.<p>What we are witnessing is compulsory hard-line. Where will you be when the mob comes after your curiosity? How many friends will you lose, how many thoughts of your own will you be free to have?<p>I really don&#x27;t get how everyone is ok with ushering in what would otherwise be seen as dystopia. And don&#x27;t compare this to a war. Wars are to preserve freedom and our principles. This war is the complete opposite. We have given up on free thinking, western values are out the window, right or wrong, but make no mistake this is the reality and we should at least acknowledge it as such.')
