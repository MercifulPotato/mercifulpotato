Given that even places with extremely high mask compliance are experiencing the same spikes as everywhere else, I have trouble believing that the benefit from masks is anything but marginal, since very few people are wearing N95 respirators. Meanwhile, for that marginal benefit everyone is being subjected to the discomfort of constrained breathing, the psychological impacts of not seeing faces&#x2F;expressions, and difficulty for the hard of hearing (who rely on seeing lips&#x2F;expressions).
