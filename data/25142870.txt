Drawing upon our personal experience as eczema sufferers, we’ve developed a platform that can help users (1) connect with other users who have similar condition and experiences, (2) collect and share condition-based product reviews, and (3) log their skin condition.<p>This platform is FREE and supported by the University. Our Open Beta is now live and to further improve the platform, we need valuable feedback.<p>We&#x27;re still at a very early stage and have a long way to go. But with your feedback&#x2F;comment we can make this better. To check it out:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.skinlync.com&#x2F;register')
