At first I&#x27;d say it seems unbelievable, but then when you think of people in churches speaking in tongues, etc. -- I guess I could see it.<p>But if you&#x27;ve ever <i>done</i> MDMA you&#x27;d certainly know it was a placebo, so it feels like these are people who never had, but <i>imagined</i> what they thought it <i>ought</i> to be like.<p>I&#x27;d actually be incredibly curious to hear their description of it? Especially since everyone knows what people act like when drunk or on cocaine... but I&#x27;m not quite sure people have as definite an idea of MDMA?')
