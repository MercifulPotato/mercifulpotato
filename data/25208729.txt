How I understood this comment is that there&#x27;s no easy or defined way to contribute UI&#x2F;UX improvements. For code improvements it&#x27;s pretty clear, but the whole issue&#x2F;PR workflow can&#x27;t be applied 1:1 to the UI&#x2F;UX process works from what I&#x27;ve seen. So I&#x27;d definitely agree with that sentiment.')
