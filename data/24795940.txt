That&#x27;s precisely how things work for utilities. You can do whatever with your private road or power generator. But if you&#x27;re providing essential services to the masses then eventually universal service, non-discrimination and neutrality rules come into play.<p>If doctors coordinate their covid response over facebook groups, elon musk makes stock-affecting announcement over twitter and the police sends out warnings via twitter than they&#x27;re taking on the role of a public communication provider.<p>You could argue that it&#x27;s a free service and you&#x27;re not a customer as you&#x27;re with a utility. But on the other hand you&#x27;re paying with your data and attention.<p>&gt; Removing the liability shield for sites that moderate will destroy either the site or the moderation, and either way the usefulness of the site comes to an end.<p>You&#x27;re assuming that there is no way to adapt to the new rules. Separation of platform services and moderation would be one. Would it work? Maybe not and you could be right and communities would be destroyed. Or maybe it would result in more Bloggers, Wordpresses and Signals.<p>&gt; Make a new network that puts control in the hands of the users in the way you envision, and test it to see how well it works.<p>Regulation is a valid approach though? I&#x27;m not saying that the FCC is intending to do good here, just that I can can imagine a hypothetical well-intentioned version of what they&#x27;re doing.<p>&gt; That angle is why Section 230 was created in the first place, and why it should remain intact.<p>Let me rephrase, I find it concerning that it could specifically empower the entrenched players while harming the smaller ones. Requiring an army of moderators when you want to create a global communication platform on the one hand but impose your preferred corporate image (and be it just to remain attractive to advertisiers) on all participants then I am not feeling all that sympathetic.\nAnd this isn&#x27;t just about communication in the narrow sense. The controversy around the apple app store is in a similar vein. On the one hand they pretend that they act as a simple market facilitator, a platform. On the other hand they categorically ban certain categories of legal software because it goes against their corporate interests. Forcing them to choose between platform and publisher could result in either a smaller, carefully curated official apple store + sideloading or larger, more open default app store. Either outcome seems desirable to me.')
