It seems to morph the images of the nouns in the prompt in an aesthetically-pleasing and almost artifact-free way (very cool!).<p>But it does not seem &#x27;understand&#x27; anything like some other commenters have said. Try &#x27;4 glasses on a table&#x27; and you will rarely see 4 glasses, even though that is a very well-defined input. I would be more impressed about the language model if it had a working prompt like: &quot;A teapot that does <i>not</i> look like the image prompt.&quot;<p>I think some of these examples trigger some kind of bias, where we think: &quot;Oh wow, that armchair <i>does</i> look like an avocado!&quot; - But morphing an armchair and an avocado will almost always look like both because they have similar shapes. And it does not &#x27;understand&#x27; what you called &#x27;object concepts&#x27;, otherwise it should not produce armchairs where you clearly cannot sit in due to the avocado stone (or stem in the flower-related &#x27;armchairs&#x27;).')
