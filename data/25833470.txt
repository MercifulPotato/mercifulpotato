Is that self-identified including &quot;cultural&quot; Christians who merely inherited a label?<p>Are you counting the person who got water sprinkled as a baby and never set foot in a Church?<p>Does your number lump the post-modern wing of Presbyterianism with Latin-mass Catholics?<p>If you know anything about Christianity you&#x27;d know that to reach 200 million you must be including all of the above. And, if you did lump them all together, then you don&#x27;t really understand Christians.<p>Christians are quickly becoming the most discriminated class in America. By Christians I mean those coherent with Christian teaching. You might not like them, and you might agree with their persecution and so you might not like that the ennobled label of &quot;victimhood&quot; is rightly applied to them. But, nonetheless, Christians are increasingly under pressure in the West.<p>But, don&#x27;t worry. There aren&#x27;t that many of them. Certainly not 200 million.')
