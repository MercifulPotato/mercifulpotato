FastCGI solves that, but it&#x27;s a more complicated protocol that requires language support, unlike CGI.<p>(2) Language support and (web) framework support.  Python&#x27;s FastCGI support is kinda crappy; you&#x27;ll probably see worse in other languages.  Although I noticed Rust has some FastCGI bindings, so I guess people are still using it?<p>(3) Container support.  This is probably the biggest one.  All the hosting providers that I know of that support CGI or FastCGI don&#x27;t give you root (for good reason),  and they also don&#x27;t support rootless containers (good reason 10 years ago, maybe not a good reason now)<p>So if shared hosting starts installing &quot;bubblewrap&quot; rootless containers on their machines, then we could build our own &quot;serverless&quot; FastCGI.  But we can&#x27;t really do it now.<p>I use FastCGI on Dreamhost, and I just tried it on NearlyFreeSpeech, and neither is quite adequate.  It&#x27;s funny how small a distance there is though.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25488958" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25488958</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;9o4zsx&#x2F;back_70s_with_serverless#c_9hxzjs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;9o4zsx&#x2F;back_70s_with_serverless#c_9hxzjs</a>')
