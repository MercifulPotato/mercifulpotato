It&#x27;s a starting point for a candidate to show an ability to code something, <i>and</i> an understanding of the requirements, <i>and</i> an ability to talk about their code and why it does things in the particular way they wrote it, <i>and</i> to discuss what the next steps would be (streaming, optimizations, etc).<p>If the coding test is literally <i>just</i> &#x27;write fizzbuzz&#x27; then it&#x27;s a terrible test, but if it&#x27;s more like &#x27;write fizzbuzz and then we&#x27;ll talk about it&#x27; then it can be a great test.<p>Coding interviews (and just coding as an art really) should never be about solving a problem in a limited amount of time. The problems we face as developers usually need a few rounds of thinking, experimentation, more thinking, implementation, optimization, and so on. You can&#x27;t do that process properly in an interview. Using things like fizzbuzz is an attempt at a shortcut.<p>Also, as someone who interviewed <i>lots</i> of people and used fizzbuzz as a test in the past, I can assure you that simply being capable of implementing it takes you out of the bottom 30% or so. Being able to talk about it and suggest ways to do more with it, or to extend it, would put you in the top 30%. There are a lot of developers out there who are <i>not great</i>.')
