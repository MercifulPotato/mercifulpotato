But legalization also increases exposure to say like kids.<p>I know I sipped some alcohol before I turned 21, what if I tried shooting up on heroin or sniffing coke? I think the story here is much more complicated then &quot;legalize&quot; it.<p>Certainly the drug war was a huge mistake but completely legalizing drugs isn&#x27;t exactly the right solution either.<p>The current opioid epidemic is the result of legalization through medical usage.<p>I&#x27;m also willing to bet that people who support complete legalization are users either casual or frequent (not necessarily addicts) so there&#x27;s a personal agenda going on here as well.<p>Is there anyone who is completely drug free who supports total legalization?')
