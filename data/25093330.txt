But the stuff we&#x27;re expected to cover is really broad - anything from a sexual assault victim and preserving evidence to your garden variety suicidal ideation.  So given our role it&#x27;s mainly geared towards identifying potential medical causes for their behavior.  The best thing we can do for a patient is keep an open mind to why they&#x27;re acting strangely.  It could be an infection, stroke, overdose, withdrawal syndrome, postictal state after a seizure, tons of stuff.<p>My point is that even the best training probably won&#x27;t make the tradeoff of not having law enforcement on scene worth it.  Patients with the kinds of issues I listed above - they tend not to respond to being talked down.  No amount of babying is going to make the person who&#x27;s been high on meth and awake for 4 days straight stop seeing the shadow people.')
