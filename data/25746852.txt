Item(by='SulphurCrested', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610459566, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25744186, text='Those who want to read more might enjoy Leo Brodie&#x27;s book &quot;Starting FORTH&quot;, complete with hand-drawn illustrations and retro monospaced font. I never worked with the language, but found the book an enjoyable read in the 1980s when it came out, as much from seeing how he went about explaining things as from the things being explained.<p>Unfortunately my copy was eaten by a rat. But a scanned and OCRed version of that 1st edition is available as a PDF here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forth.com&#x2F;starting-forth&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forth.com&#x2F;starting-forth&#x2F;</a>')
