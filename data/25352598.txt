The Radio 1 breakfast show is 5.13m listeners. I&#x27;d hazard a lot of the plays on Spotify are just as passive as the radio (and it&#x27;s probably replaced the radio for a lot of people). If you&#x27;re working to the same metrics, Spotify pays considerably more per play (again, based on some Googled numbers).</i><p>I don&#x27;t disagree with your whole point, but I have to point out that Radio used to be a marketing channel for a product (a record), and any profit was secondary, while Spotify streams are the end-product itself, which replaced both the marketing channel and the previous products.')
