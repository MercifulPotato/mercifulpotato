I wonder if there is another route though. If we assume that Intel (for process reasons) are out of it, then could AMD produce an &#x27;x86 version&#x27; of the M1 on TSMC 5nm using Zen3 and successors which would help other firms compete with Apple.<p>I guess the extent to which M1 is great because its ARM isn&#x27;t clear - there are some advantages in instruction decoding, having bigLITTLE etc - but the impact of all these together hasn&#x27;t been quantified. Plus there is the deeper integration with Apple&#x27;s software.')
