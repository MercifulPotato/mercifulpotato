Almost no laptops sustain their top (boost) clock on heavy workloads. Most usually only sustain max performance for minutes (or seconds!) before throttling. Here&#x27;s an example chart that shows how various premium Athena&#x2F;Evo U laptops perform: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notebookcheck.net&#x2F;Asus-Zenbook-S-UX393JA-Laptop-Review-The-Microsoft-Surface-Alternative.497792.0.html#toc-performance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notebookcheck.net&#x2F;Asus-Zenbook-S-UX393JA-Laptop-...</a><p>On the workstation side, people complain about Macbooks, but recent MBPs actually throttle their Intel H processors less than a comparable XPS 15 for example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notebookcheck.net&#x2F;Apple-MacBook-Pro-15-2019-in-review-Still-a-very-good-multimedia-laptop-in-2020.452381.0.html#toc-performance-high-scores-for-the-mbp-15" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notebookcheck.net&#x2F;Apple-MacBook-Pro-15-2019-in-r...</a><p>If you are interested in how modern Intel laptop chips throttle and what base and boost clocks mean, you want to do a search for PL1, PL2, and Tau. For AMD chips, you will want to look up STAPM, Fast and Slow PPT.<p>Note that while a i7-10875H&#x27;s top &quot;boost&quot; clock is 5.1GHz, the sustained &quot;base&quot; clock is only 2.3GHz. This is so low to be meaningless as a top speed. In practice, unless your laptop&#x27;s cooling is absolutely terrible, you&#x27;ll probably end up mostly running in the 3-3.5GHz range under full load. In comparison, on a properly cooled desktop system, a same-gen i9-10900K desktop system should be able to maintain a sustained (all-the-time) clock of about 5GHz (very close to its 5.3GHz boost). AMD chips scale a little bit better due to 7nm having better power efficiency and how PPT works, but the same ratio roughly applies.')
