Because those are <i>not actual rules of grammar at all.</i> The split-infintives &quot;rule&quot; came about by a false analogy with Latin (where it is largely impossible to split infinitives, at least present active ones, because they are almost always single words -- e.g. <i>amare</i>, &quot;to love&quot;): Fowler, for one, holds that a split infinitive is preferable &quot;to real ambiguity, and to patent artificiality&quot;. The ban on prepositions at the ends of sentences was made up out of whole cloth by Dryden, again with irrelevant reference to Latin. And I think you would be hard pushed to find a writer in the English literary canon who never begins a sentence with a conjunction.<p>&gt; Double negatives in particular make statements harder to reason about.<p>That&#x27;s bad news for French philosophy, then, because formal French <i>demands</i> a double negative in many contexts. E.g., <i>jamais</i> is French for &quot;never&quot;, but &quot;I would never do that&quot; is <i>Je ne ferais jamais Ã§a,</i> where <i>ne</i> is the direct equivalent of the English &quot;not&quot;. (In informal French, curiously, the <i>ne</i> is often dropped, or so I understand.) Of course, French is not English, but if Francophones can handle double negatives without logical edifices collapsing, I&#x27;m sure Anglophones can too.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re explaining a process and say, &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t get &#x27;no results&#x27; here.&quot;<p>Then any confusion is my own fault for expressing myself in such a clumsy and ambiguous manner. I should have said either &quot;You should get some results here&quot; or &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t get the message &#x27;no results&#x27; here&quot;, depending on whether the presence of results or the absence of the error was the key criterion of success.')
