I like to be ahead of trends, I&#x27;ve been gently phasing Google out of my life. It isn&#x27;t causing me any problems, there are alternatives for most things. They are currently pushing all the people I watch off YouTube, so wherever they go to I&#x27;ll follow.<p>If a person trusts Google (or YouTube) to decide what they see or host their content, then that is the person&#x27;s choice. Google have a long history of unchallenged market dominance because they provide, frankly, better service than the alternatives. Not because of shady tricks, but because Google is a technically amazing company. But at some point they will cease to be technically amazing and sink back to being average, and then the market will open up space for some competitors.<p>I&#x27;d love to see innovative advertising models to break AdWords and redirect profits from Google to the advertisers. That&#x27;d be an improvement. Getting the government and judges involved to decide how to rank search results is not an improvement. I do not want any US administration, or US Congress, or US appointed judge deciding what I should see in my searches. Nothing good will come of that.')
