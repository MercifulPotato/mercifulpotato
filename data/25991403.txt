(There is an additional mounting kit to support it on the Gen10.)<p>For me, three mirrored ZFS 4TB drives are all I needed for my local storage to be available and resilient.  The fourth SATA slot is the SSD in a cradle.<p>My long term bet for safety is offline USB mirrors on-site, Borg off-site to rsync.net (thanks!) and tarsnap off-site for the smaller stuff.<p>Maybe one day I’ll be brave and use ZFS to mirror the content to rsync.net?  I haven’t upgraded beyond ZoL 0.7 yet but if I did can I replicate an encrypted pool to you without giving you the keys?')
