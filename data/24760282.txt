Software developers suck at UX because they are too empathetic. Products get bloated because engineers get emotionally attached to the work and can&#x27;t cut anything because there&#x27;s always someone&#x27;s feelings attached.<p>Meanwhile all the good UX people I&#x27;ve known have been either exceedingly impatient or obsessively narcissistic. The ones who empathize do so with the people right in front of them, their co-workers not the user, and end up compromising the product.<p>The person with an abundance of empathy is going to consider John&#x27;s feelings when throwing out six weeks of his work. But stuff like that doesn&#x27;t matter at all to the user.')
