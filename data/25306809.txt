They trigger your immune system to be aware of a threat and train it to defeat that threat. This is something your body does fairly constantly with natural pathogens without any known delayed long-term effects.<p>This idea that there is some sort of known risk of a significant issue popping up out of nowhere months or years down the road has no historical precedent. The two modern (last 50 years) incidences where a vaccine may have caused a serious side effect in a statistically significant way [0][1] may have taken a little bit of time to be noticed, but it was because they were so statistically rare, not because the actual problem was delayed in occurring. Interestingly, both those incidents involved auto-immune illnesses which would have likely been much more likely to occur if the vaccinated folks caught the virus itself.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pandemrix" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pandemrix</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1976_swine_flu_outbreak" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1976_swine_flu_outbreak</a>')
