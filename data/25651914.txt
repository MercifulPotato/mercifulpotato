About 50% of the team of 12 participated, meaning your week came up basically every month and a half. This seemed fair.</i><p>That seems roughly fair to me too. Strangely, that&#x27;s always how it worked at non-SV companiesâ€”<i>of course</i> you get compensated if there&#x27;s considerable off-hours burden. For some reason though, SV seems to have established a new standard here. Maybe because people are often younger and&#x2F;or already paid &quot;too much&quot;.<p>&gt; <i>If your company doesn&#x27;t want to pay for the aggravation, put your phone on silent, make sure alarms escalate to your manager, and start looking for another job.</i><p>Hah, well not ready to burn the bridge to this level quite yet, but yes, unfortunately that&#x27;s the only option that&#x27;s a guaranteed solution.')
