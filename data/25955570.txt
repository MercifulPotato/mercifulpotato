Pandemic response plans just fundamentally <i>aren&#x27;t designed</i> to stop a respiratory pandemic like this one, at best they try to mitigate a little of the damage and even a lot of that is experimental and untested. (We don&#x27;t even know something as basic as how effective school closures are against flu pandemics!) SARS and MERS had very different characteristics which made contact tracing a lot more effective against them; the UK, US and most other countries tried using the same approach that worked against them and it failed (and started a bazillion conspiracy theories about why the UK abandoned it). People&#x27;s expectations seem to have more to do with cynical partisan political attempts to exploit the pandemic than reality.')
