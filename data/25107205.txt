That&#x27;s where your digital voting machine prints a receipt (actually 2!). The voter checks that the receipt matches and then deposits their anonymous stub into a bin. Need to verify results? You sample randomly from that receipt bin. If you really wanted to, you could count every single receipt but either way you have a verifiable way to verify that the digital results have not been manipulated. Of course this requires the voter to do slightly more work (verify, deposit their receipt, and keep the copy) but this also makes it a lot easier to show that voter fraud happened. There&#x27;s verifiable proof. Granted as the wiki article notes, people don&#x27;t verify and when they do verify don&#x27;t commonly find discrepancies, but hey this is another account to fall back on. It should be done in addition to other methods, not as a cureall to catch voter fraud.<p>But this is basically what your [1] is, which got cut off.<p>&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Voter-verified_paper_audit_trail')
