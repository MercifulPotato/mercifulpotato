I&#x27;m only just scratching the surface though and not really dived too deep, I find it quite overwhelming tbh, it feels like the text editing part is really just the tip of  the iceberg when it comes to Emacs.<p>Org-mode is pretty cool and I love the note capturing feature, I&#x27;ve bound Cmd+N to this feature so I can take notes quickly.<p>One thing that I&#x27;ve not fully figured out yet is how to share notes between my work life and personal life. Sometimes I make notes at work about some cool programming trick or something useful to know, but that stays on my work machine. I don&#x27;t want work related information to be accessible from my personal machines but I want access to those &#x27;general&#x27; notes. Obviously I could set up separate files that sync, but I really like the quick-capture workflow and introducing a &quot;should I save this here or there&quot; type of action would slow that  down...')
