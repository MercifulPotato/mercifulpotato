(Note that Arabic doesn&#x27;t normally write out its vowels). The `gh&#x27; should sound roughly like the voiced variant of the final sound of &quot;loch&quot; or &quot;Bach&quot;.<p>Given that your purported translations all have four consonants in them, not three, I&#x27;m guessing you somehow pasted the wrong string? When I get &quot;غدر&quot; in Google Translate, I get the transliteration as ghadar and not ha-zi-bo-m.')
