The process is way too manual, and increasing the chunk size from 2GB to 10GB causes a lot more failures of the individual downloads for me.<p>And I don&#x27;t particularly want to hear &quot;get a better network connection&quot;.  My connection works just fine for everything else.<p>That said, if you&#x27;re able to download everything, it&#x27;s reasonably well-organized, although as stated elsewhere, there&#x27;s a lot of duplication of data.')
