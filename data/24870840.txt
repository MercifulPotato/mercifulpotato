At some point, it will swing back, as people realise that handing control of things they depend on over to centralised organisations that will naturally tend to act in their own interests isn&#x27;t necessary or desirable, and as businesses realise that a lot of the claimed advantages of cloud computing are overstated or entirely illusory. There are some clear advantages to everyone being connected online, but it&#x27;s not necessary (from a technical perspective) for everyone to follow the models that have become popular so far in order to enjoy those advantages.<p>The question is when that will happen, because obviously the powerful interests running Big Software are almost all heavily invested in promoting the cloud model for now since they&#x27;re the ones most able to benefit from it. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the effective opposition eventually comes from some sort of grass roots movement towards open hardware and open software, even if it takes a decade or more, rather than from any of the established tech giants voluntarily changing strategy within that time frame. It&#x27;s just a shame about all the billions we&#x27;re going to waste due to lost productivity and security&#x2F;privacy problems with the dumbed down software and corporate exploitation that will be the norm for IT in the meantime. :-(')
