It does need a refill, but writing with it is efortless, just like with the fountain pen and the writing also looks good because the trail is continuous. I think they have a ceramic ball tip instead of a metal one. I absolutely love them. One can also reuse the cartridges and refill them with regular ink using a syringe if they can be bothered to do so.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;schneiderpen.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;cartridge-rollerballs&#x2F;easy-white-m-4004675124777&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;schneiderpen.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;cartridge-rollerballs&#x2F;easy-wh...</a>')
