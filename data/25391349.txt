Yeah, that&#x27;s a good sign. Are they burner accounts all the way down? How many other personas are you in here?<p>&quot;You also brought up India.&quot;<p>Specifically to point out that number of people is largely irrelevant. But, as with the Ferrari nonsense, way to completely miss the point.<p>&quot;Of course you deleted it as soon as you realised it.&quot;<p>LOL, I deleted it because I realized there were newer numbers (humorously BETTER numbers as the iphone is seasonal), but by then you&#x27;d added more stupid edits to your insane comment. WOMP WOMP!<p>The Italy thing is uproarious, and betrays that you&#x27;re a clown. Apple is shipping more units to Italy than ever, but at the very low end people replaced their dumbphones with junk Huawei units. Yeah, Apple isn&#x27;t crying in their sleep. Apple still completely dominates the wealthy and upper middle class in virtually every nation the world over.<p>This all started with an insanely stupid comment that Apple only matters in the US, which is so profoundly dumb it disqualifies anyone from talking again. See - you.')
