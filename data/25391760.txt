Truth is, those who decide to offer compensation based on value added instead of a magic HR approved formula will get interest from everyone else. I expect some companies to use this CoL-based compensation as a way to let go underperformers and others to attract talent that was previously unavailable.<p>&gt; Will smaller firms elsewhere have to raise salaries to compete with locals taking non-regional salaries?<p>They&#x27;ll have to.')
