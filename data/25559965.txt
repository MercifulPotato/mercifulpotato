Keys will get stuck, latency will cause keys to be pressed in the wrong order, sometimes one half of the keyboard will stop working... I&#x27;m designing my won Centromere-alike right now, but I&#x27;ll make it wired (and I&#x27;ll print test layouts to see what fits my fingers better).<p>Have you not had similar experiences with wireless keyboards? I love the layout but am so tired by the constant problems with wireless, especially when the keyboard always sits on the same spot on my desk.')
