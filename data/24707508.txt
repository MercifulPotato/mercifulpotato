From figuring out what to search for, to understanding the code that needs to change, to making the change, to building it, to determining what&#x27;s ~~best practice~~ at least <i>not worst practice</i> for installing it.<p>And I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s fairly confident in my abilities, has been using linux for about 15 years, and is comfortable in C and familiar with other packaging systems.<p>I&#x27;m sure I could come up with at least a dozen exercises like this that would take me under a minute but would take the average HN reader hours if not days to complete.<p>My point is that it&#x27;s incredibly unfair to take something with which you&#x27;re obviously quite familiar with and claim it takes less time than buying an app online, just because with experience <i>you</i> can do it that fast.')
