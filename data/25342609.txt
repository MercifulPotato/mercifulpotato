Likewise with many of the South Bay trails and parks. I don&#x27;t even go to SF downtown during the day anymore because of the number of times I&#x27;ve almost stepped in human feces, and the needles strewn about.<p>8 years of liberal politicians claiming to care, and 8 years later it is significantly worse. I could excuse the lack of progress if the city government wasn&#x27;t rolling in money the entire time. If they can&#x27;t solve the problem with the way things were, they are going to have a hell of time doing it with the way they are headed.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d also like to point out society does not exist to gift every person peace, safety, and health. A just society offers opportunities, not guarantees.')
