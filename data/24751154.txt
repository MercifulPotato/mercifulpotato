I don&#x27;t know, but not anymore. Mint Mobile will get you unlimited talk&#x2F;text and 3GB data for $15&#x2F;month, no extra fees. They&#x27;re an MVNO using T-Mobile&#x27;s network. If T-Mobile can make money wholesaling their network to Mint, and Mint can make money selling plans at that price, there&#x27;s no reason for a &quot;normal&quot; plan to run $70 before taxes and fees. Even Mint&#x27;s unlimited plan is only $30, less than half of what TMobile has.')
