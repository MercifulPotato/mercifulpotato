For example, if you’re a B2B Saas, distribution is often way more important than the product itself.<p>So by the “core to our flywheel” standard you need to build your own email marketing software, your own version of salesforce CRM, your own analytics tool for triggering marketing funnels, etc.<p>That’s just hilarious. As someone who runs a business, I wouldn’t spend a single minute of engineering resources on anything that we don’t sell directly to a customer.<p>I’d go even further and say if you have less than 5000 employees, ALWAYS buy. Never build.')
