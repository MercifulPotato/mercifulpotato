The steady drip of unseen material removes the stigma of pressing the “again” button and gives me a small reward of story progression from each session.<p>In a separate deck, I use cloze deletion on sheet music to help learn songs.  That deck only gets reviewed by actively playing music, which is an inherently enjoyable activity on its own.')
