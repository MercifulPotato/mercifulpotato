FBS extraction is a &quot;slaughterhouse&quot; technology, so these new products don&#x27;t yet move us any closer to the goal of ending industrial animal slaughter. In fact, this could actually be a step in the wrong direction.<p>I&#x27;ve kept an eye on this space for a while, and there have been plenty of announcements of artificial FBS, but none of them have ever been able to offer any proof, just vapor.<p>If a company comes along with a synthetic plant-derived alternative to FBS, and they can actually prove it works, invest heavily. They&#x27;re the ones who will change the world.<p>EDIT: Good news! I found there is now a commercially available FBS alternative called &#x27;FastGro&#x27;. It is very expensive - $264.60 per 100ml - and it doesn&#x27;t say how it&#x27;s made, but hey, it&#x27;s a start.<p>It&#x27;s also worth checking out their brochure just because of how hilarious and awesome the art is: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.mpbio.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;file&#x2F;brochure&#x2F;dest&#x2F;l&#x2F;s&#x2F;1&#x2F;0&#x2F;2&#x2F;LS102019-EN-FastGro-Brochure.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.mpbio.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;file&#x2F;brochure&#x2F;dest&#x2F;l&#x2F;s&#x2F;1&#x2F;0&#x2F;...</a>')
