I currently plan to use C (clang) as IL in the first iteration, with the option to upgrade to LLVM IL later. \nI wonder whether there is any easier alternative. I definitely need to start with a framework that takes text input, because everything else would be hard to integrate with the TypeScript-based interpreter of my language. And it needs to work with a runtime written in C. QBE looks nicer than LLVM&#x27;s IL, but I wonder whether it would cause more trouble in the end.')
