I don&#x27;t consider Elm a full alternative to Purescript, even though I understand the draw.<p>Purescript is more in line with the harder core FP or frontend Haskell I was seeking.<p>On another note, Rust does types and pattern matching quite well where I see that as another draw away from Haskell. But I feel like Haskell is the motherland for this stuff so might as well figure it out eventually.')
