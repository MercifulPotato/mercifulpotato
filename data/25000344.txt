As someone who frequently manages networks professionally and personally, I constantly need to look up information on the how the address hashing works, CIDR block ranges, short-hand notation, etc, etc...etc (because there is a lot). It&#x27;s really added a hinderance to my workflow and makes typical network configuration take much longer than it would have before.<p>It was easy for me to differentiate between LANs and WANs, subnets, etc in IPv4-land because the address space is much more intuitive to work with. CIDR block notation for IPv4 takes a minute to get used to (for new people), but it&#x27;s easy to learn quickly and understand the ranges of your networks, or at least get a feel for it.<p>Even after working with IPv6 for over a year, I <i>still</i> do not have an intuitive feel for <i>how many addresses</i> or <i>what address range</i> a CIDR block contains - which is extremely useful for debugging issues. If I can look at an IPv4 address in a log, I can immediately track down what subnet&#x2F;machine had the issue and dig into the issue. IPv6 requires extra steps, and a lot of them.<p>Naturally, NAT became a thing for IPv4. I don&#x27;t know if it was originally introduced as a firewall mechanism or to cut down on publicly used IPs, but it works well for both. IPv6 circumvents the need for NAT, but then we have NPT, which is <i>also</i> unintuitive.<p><i>Numbers</i> are much more human friendly, as time has shown. It&#x27;s easy to understand 127.x.x.x and 192.x.x.x are common prefix to local networks and I think that <i>most</i> people who have worked with computers at all have some understanding of what a &quot;local&quot; network is, but even after reading the article, my brain says &quot;any IPv6 address that starts with an <i>f</i> is probably a special one, but I don&#x27;t know why, just assume it means something and I&#x27;ll have to do some Googling about &#x27;prefixes&#x27; to figure it out&quot;.<p>I like some of the pros of IPv6, and maybe after another year of usage it might feel more intuitive, but right now it comes with a serious learning curve and anytime I need to work with it, I get an instant headache.<p>Also, have you ever looked at one screen to mentally grab an IP address and then needed to type it into another? Or asked a coworker for the machine&#x27;s address so that you can take a look? Get used to using copy-paste a <i>lot</i>, because there&#x27;s no way that you can glance at a screen for 2 seconds and mentally go, &quot;aaah. Just need to <i>ssh user@aksj:dfja:skja:sviw:eijf:000i:hate:00my:life</i>....easy peasy&quot;')
