It&#x27;s the first step for a major cryptocurrency towards ledger security that does not damage the environment via mining.<p>I always hated how wasteful and energy-inefficient mining is.

With lightweight clients in development, it is possible to validate chain using Raspberry Pi.<p>I hope (but don&#x27;t expect) that some time in the next 10 years Bitcoin will follow. If not, it&#x27;s just so much CO2 that could have been avoided.')
