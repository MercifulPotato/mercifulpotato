In the end I picked out an LG tv which had a great picture - but it’s app support really sucks if you want something more then Netflix and Hulu.<p>I ended up getting a Fire stick and an Apple TV to go with it so I can access content. If I did it all again I wouldn’t even bother setting up the networking for the TV - it’s just one more vector for advertising - and just plan on having the other devices day one. They are updated much more frequently and get the streaming apps that nobody bothers to develop for the TV itself.<p>Downloading firmware updates for the TV takes hours. I’m pretty sure the server is under somebody’s desk and every LG tv in the world hits it at once so the throughput is bytes per second - they should use an S3 bucket or something instead.')
