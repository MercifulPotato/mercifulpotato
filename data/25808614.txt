The 2 lb Macbook is the best laptop I&#x27;ve ever owned, by far. Maybe I&#x27;m too sensitive about weight, but I feel an incredible difference between 3 lb and 2 lb laptops, especially if its sitting on your lap for extended periods of time. The keyboard and charger have never once been a hindrance to my workflow, as the article makes it out be. I really wish Apple would come out with 2 lb laptops again. Latest line of Macbooks (the &quot;Air&quot;) weigh in at 2.8 lb minimum.')
