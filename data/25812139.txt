Secondly yes, you do need to comply, even if you are innocent.

But wool should&#x27;ve been over everyone&#x27;s eyes like 10 years ago. The US acts no different than China in how the state allows government abuse of power to fuck you bureaucratically. Unlike places like Germany where the state compensates you for your time and money if they can&#x27;t prove your criminality, also reserving your job as well unless convicted; The US just says fuck you but only with slightly more rights than China gives their citizens.')
