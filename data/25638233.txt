And require state of the art facilities, with biohazard containment, viral samples, etc.<p>Now? Given a virus sequence done in a lab on the other side of the planet, one can design a vaccine in a day. Sure, it took many years of research (and in coronaviruses in particular) to reach this stage, specially on how to stabilize the spike protein. But one cannot understate how amazing this new technology is.<p>And then once done you can send the results to a machine to get it &quot;built&quot;. At a low scale, sure, but it&#x27;s still impressive.<p>With the mRNA approach we no longer have to resort to things like using eggs to make the vaccines, we can use the cellular machinery for that. It&#x27;s mind-boggling.')
