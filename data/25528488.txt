If every piece of equipment needs to be launched from Earth&#x27;s surface, then it&#x27;s going to be very tough to make it profitable. I don&#x27;t think the space mining start-ups he&#x27;s so dismissive of were in any doubt about that.<p>His fictional example of &quot;Moon&quot; is illustrative. That film was set in a Helium-3 mining facility. Helium-3 simply doesn&#x27;t exist on Earth. If we get to the point where we need it to power our advanced fusion reactors, then we&#x27;ll have no alternative but to create a space-based mining industry. Once the infrastructure is in place for that, then lots of other space-mining opportunities will start to look tempting too.')
