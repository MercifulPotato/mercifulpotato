Item(by='shakna', descendants=None, kids=[24949150, 24949414], score=None, time=1604110438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947948, text='&gt; There is no certain test for either condition- in particular, fibromyalgia is basically a bucket you get tossed into if nothing else makes sense.<p>FM is young (around 1990 it got its name), so a lot of what we know has changed, especially in fifteen years, but it is no longer the case that there isn&#x27;t a test for it (there&#x27;s multiple), and it should not be the diagnosis of last resort when nothing else makes sense. There are specific diagnostic criteria.<p>For testing, we have things like the FM&#x2F;a blood test (since 2012), and for diagnosis you need to fulfill &quot;The American College of Rheumatology preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia and measurement of symptom severity&quot; (2010), or similar.<p>FM also falls into four categories:<p>+ Extreme sensitivity to pain but no associated psychiatric conditions (usually treated by attempting to de-sensitise the nervous system)<p>+ Fibromyalgia and comorbid, pain-related depression (usually treated as the above, whilst also utilising an anti-depression regime)<p>+ Depression with concomitant fibromyalgia syndrome (usually treated as the above)<p>+ Fibromyalgia due to somatization (usually treated with psychotherapy)<p>The fourth category is sort of what everyone assumes the entire illness is like, at least in my experience. It also happens to be the least common form of the illness since we began standardised diagnosis.<p>---<p>I fall into the first category. I am not intending to provide any advice whatsoever, because that&#x27;s one of the most infuriating things about living with the illness. I&#x27;ve been learning to deal with this for half my life, the person talking to me may be frustrated and want to help... But the chances of you coming up with anything I&#x27;m not aware of are practically zero. And an insult to my intelligence and determination.<p>However, fibromyalgia shouldn&#x27;t get the stigma of being the &quot;random disease&quot; anymore. It isn&#x27;t. Unless you fall into the fourth category, there are neural structures unique to sufferers, and blood markers that are unique to sufferers. This is a condition, not a wastepaper basket for people that are just too hard to diagnose.<p>The illness can already ruin you, don&#x27;t let the stigma burn you as well.')
