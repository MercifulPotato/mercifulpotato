A proprietary program or SaaSS would take away your freedom, so you shouldn&#x27;t use those. You can contribute your time or your money to development of a free replacement.<p>Statements like this are why GNU&#x27;s and the FSF&#x27;s arguments often fall apart. If someone wants to do something and free software is not available to help them achieve it, telling them to just not do it is not a good solution. Change requires compromise, and its counterproductive to hold such a firm stance.')
