The problem is most credit unions suck.<p>Examples:<p>* it&#x27;s 2020 and my credit union doesn&#x27;t have autopay for my credit card.<p>* someone stole my cards and made some unauthorized charges at an unattended parking lot -- they did it almost 40 times in a single day across 3 cards that I rotated between.  Chase and Amex took a 5 minute phone call each.  My credit union took more than ten hours of work to get my money back, including demanding that I go to a -- remember, unattended -- parking lot that was near a job I hadn&#x27;t worked at in 6 months to try to get a refund.<p>The real answer is if you qualify for eg a chase sapphire reserve, you get excellent service and an excellent product.')
