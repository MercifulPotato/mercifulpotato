So this is certainly a point where there could be different opinions, but, sure, that&#x27;s probably arguably correct.<p>&gt; while a senior manager earning $500,000&#x2F;year at Google would be proleteriat (selling their labor for wages)?<p>A senior manager earning $500,000&#x2F;yr at Google is <i>likely</i> investing quite a bit of that, and likely has been during the series of highly-paid jobs they had prior to becoming a senior manager, and very often would fit the alternate petit bourgeois pattern discussed in the parenthetical in GP, where a significant fraction of their gains are from ownership (indirectly through financial instruments) of capital, though they also have significant income from selling labor. But, sure, it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> for them to just be a highly paid member of the proletarian intelligentsia.')
