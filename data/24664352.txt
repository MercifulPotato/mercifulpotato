Item(by='wait_a_minute', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601656665, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24663116, text='If we will generalize about &quot;freedom&quot; types supporting Palantir, allow me to generalize about the opposite as well - the people who never care about pro-privacy and anti-censorship matters, unless they believe there&#x27;s an angle from which they can attack &quot;American imperialism&quot; or the &quot;industrial-military complex&quot; or what have you. I suspect the only reason some people get upset about Palantir is because they provide tools to the government and military, and it is popular to bash the American government and the American military. At least on the left, where building software for national security is seen in the same light as supporting hegemony and imperialism.<p>I am skeptical about the people who complain about liberty or democracy being at risk because of Palantir, Facebook, etc, because my experience with these people has been that they are never anti-censorship, pro-democracy except when it suits their own partisan side. They&#x27;ll easily welcome censorship if it means Facebook shutting down &quot;dangerous&quot; groups, where dangerous is any group that is not their group.')
