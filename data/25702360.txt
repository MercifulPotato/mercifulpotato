Similar to a paint by numbers craft.<p>Right now I&#x27;m working on the backend before making the frontend minimally-less-ugly.<p>It resizes the image, then uses k-means quantization (scikit-learn) to map the pixel colors to the color set you choose. Right now the options are a few crayola marker packs. Would love to add something where you can upload your own colors, or provide my own markers.<p>The idea is that you can create a simple custom paint by numbers craft and get started right away using stuff you already have. I have a few other ideas, but trying to make a product cheaper than some existing custom paint by numbers kits.<p>Would love thoughts or feedback on the idea.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d3gmwd8ku7h7jh.cloudfront.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d3gmwd8ku7h7jh.cloudfront.net&#x2F;</a>')
