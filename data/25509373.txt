The placenta is ultimately the part of the embryo that embeds itself in the uterus and triggers the mother&#x27;s pregnancy. It connects to the fetus via the umbilical cord.<p>In practice people don&#x27;t think of them belonging to the fetus though, and the title &quot;Microplastics found in human placentas&quot; would have been clearer.')
