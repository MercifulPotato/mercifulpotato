Addressing some of your points:<p>&gt; Apple have taken their absolute dominance in selling music and moved to middle of the pack in music streaming squeezed between Spotify and Youtube.<p>That is true, but Apple is estimated to have almost ~70M subscribers and Spotify has ~290M. Not sure how many of Apple&#x27;s are paying but that&#x27;s a lot of people who find Apple&#x27;s service at least &quot;good enough&quot; which means less revenue for Spotify and competing services. If apple decides to provide a platform for music creation and direct publishing to Apple Music, that creates more lock-in.<p>&gt; They&#x27;re late to TV streaming and somehow, despite being incredibly closely linked to Disney have failed to tie up a deal.<p>Apple being late is a pretty frequent occurrence but execution is what can set them apart here. I doubt Apple will invest the billions it takes to make good entertainment but time will tell. They succeeded (in the USA) with maps and the Apple Watch so far.<p>&gt; Apple&#x27;s Siri is distinctly second tier, losing them both for Apple Music, but also potential shopping via smart assistant.<p>No question there - Siri is still a mediocre product but it is also accessible across their devices. Assistant is better but only if you have an Android phone or the Google app. If you want to buy a smart speaker, you have to _device_ which service you want versus &quot;If Apple makes this speaker, I know it has Siri and works with my devices&quot;.<p>&gt; iCloud<p>Yep that&#x27;s a joke and bad deal. Storage is quite cheap so I don&#x27;t get why Apple won&#x27;t expand the options.<p>Apple One is a rough start but I expect them to refine it and slowly add options to improve the offering. Fitness+ could be huge if they pair it with the socioeconomic class of people who go to spin&#x2F;yoga&#x2F;pilates&#x2F;crossfit classes and view fitness as a badge.<p>They can create a social network effect like Strava and build partnerships with Peloton, Flywheel, etc. (I&#x27;m not the right demographic so this is a guess). Apple could partner with hospitals for health data sharing with doctors and maybe get insurance companies on board for discounts.<p>&gt; Finally you&#x27;ve got the Appstore. Apple is getting absolutely hammered on their 30% fee. At this point it looks almost certain that they&#x27;ll either change their fee structure or face regulatory action.<p>+1<p>&gt;  If Apple is a services company why isn&#x27;t FaceTime adding $100Bn of market cap to Apple&#x27;s value as a competitor to Zoom?<p>Because Apple sucks at making services for a world that&#x27;s not Apple-focused which is what you need to survive in enterprise. I&#x27;m okay with Apple dominating cross-platform video calling ...<p>Overall, I think the ease of a customer using their Apple ID&#x2F;Device for _everything_ is  hard to overstate and is Apple&#x27;s long term play.')
