That&#x27;s definitely a stereotype.<p>It is entirely possible to be charming, without secretly being cruel or vindictive. Yes, it can be more difficult to judge a disarming person&#x27;s intentions, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the person is inherently sadistic or ill willed. Perhaps they are just good at making other people feel comfortable.')
