It allows you to run apps written for it which can communicate over the Urbit network (By far the most used one is an instant messaging app).<p>Every Urbit has a permanent address which persists even if you move it around between computers. Each Urbit fully encapsulates its own state, so it can be zipped into a single file, unzipped 20 years later on a different computer, and it&#x27;ll still work, still be able to connect to the network, and still contain all the data you had.<p>Urbit apps are fully decentralized, users own all the data and control what and how they wish to share it via the Urbit network.<p>As it contains a high-level Turing-complete programming language named Hoon, it could be used for anything which regular computers are used for.<p>There are actually some very interesting ideas in Urbit. Unfortunately it&#x27;s all hidden below many layers of obfuscation and weird naming.')
