I think the debate is around whether they should have those protections, given that at present they are virtually a monopoly within their sphere and people don&#x27;t have viable alternatives to use once they are kicked off of Facebook.  BTW, my private property rights can be overriden whenever the governement or utilities or even neighbors can show a public need.')
