The CPU in the current MCU is custom, if they wanted to limit software development cost on it, using the same MCU might make sense as well as economies of scale and what not.<p>The cameras on a Tesla are used for Front Collision Alert, Lane Departure Warning and Lane Keep Assist as well as Sentry Mode.  The backup camera is required by law in many places now.  Removing those would limit the number of advanced safety features they could offer.<p>I wonder how much cost savings would be realized by removing the nonessential cameras?  I know automotive grade parts tend to cost more but are we talking about hundreds or thousands of dollars in savings?')
