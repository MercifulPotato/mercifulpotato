This is my side project that I have been working on recently. Day X has come, I finished the project, it&#x27;s time to launch here.<p>We are going through a difficult time, I thought how I could help, and decided that this is not a bad idea. Of course, the idea is not new, but I tried make it well, better than we have now.<p>Considering that I completely did everything myself, design and development, perhaps this does not yet have a lot of the necessary functionality.<p>So, if Scanly has users, I plan to add:\n Direct Payments\n Covid Trace (in some countries this requirement)\n Online booking and order<p>If any of you have someone who needs such a service, I would be happy your recommendation.<p>And I really excited about your feedback.<p>Cheers,\nMarat')
