We are already seeing several new strains.<p>Also having COVID-19 doesn’t automatically mean your body even develops an immunity. All sorts of caveats might prevent that from happening such as the infection being too mild to begin with (eg viral load).<p>And lastly, while on the topic of viral load, if your reinfection it too severe then you can still die from a reinfection even if you do have a immunity (immunity gives your body the resistance to fight it, but that doesn’t mean you’re invulnerable to the decease).<p>So while your points are valid, that doesn’t mean anyone who’s caught COVID-19 and recovered should be thinking they’re bullet proof (metaphorically speaking). At best, they could still be carriers. At worst they could still find their body unable to fight off any new infections.')
