Also, for the user, one thing I found is that if you hold a large paperclip in your hand like it&#x27;s a pencil, you can make easier writing motions on a trackpad. I do this when I&#x27;m using my Macbook instead of my iPad.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doodledocs.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doodledocs.com</a> is basically Witeboard but with a less pretty and more buggy interface :P (I wrote it last year as a side project)')
