I&#x27;d rather not use a feature that requires me to give out banking details - I don&#x27;t think that even is allowed in bank&#x27;s T&amp;C. Probably if a 3rd party stolen your money because you give them your details, you won&#x27;t be covered. I was asked this once and I refused. I&#x27;d rather enter things manually than let someone &quot;have a peek&quot;.')
