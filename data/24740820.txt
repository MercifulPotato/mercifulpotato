The models are evaluated to have a 1.5% error to signal ratio, meaning it&#x27;s 1.5% different from the actual recorded signal, coming from an SM57 microphone.<p>I really do appreciate the constructive criticism, and well observed points. I&#x27;m new to promoting a project and also this Hacker News site. I&#x27;m actually floored it&#x27;s getting this much attention.<p>The fact it uses deep learning doesn&#x27;t make it better than traditionally modeled amps, but it does mean that someone with no domain experience for amp modeling (like me) can come in and make a good sounding guitar plugin.')
