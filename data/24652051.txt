I would sometimes even take an earlier&#x2F;later flight to maximize upgrades. (If I&#x27;m already away from the family for the day, I&#x27;d much rather a 0600 first-class seat than an 0730 economy. Same with 2030 departure over an 1830 on the way home. Either way, I arrive after the kids are in bed; I might as well do some emailing and work catchup from the lounge.)<p>I was really happy when the airlines started holding the exit row seats for their frequent fliers. I could book an exit row and chance an upgrade to first. If the exit row ACDF seats were all booked at ticketing, that meant my upgrade chances were also lower.')
