In contrast, given the experimental work needed to go from sequence to structure, only around 170,000 protein structures are in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). &quot;<p>So, basically, less than 0.1% of the proteins we are interested in, have structures determined via lab experiments. The Deep Mind method could fill in the remaining 99.9%<p>original:\nQuestion by someone who knows nothing about molecular biology:\nHow many proteins exist that we are predominantly interested in? How many of those have known structures? And for the remaining, how long would it take humanity to find their structure through experiments instead of these computer models? (Do these questions even make sense?)')
