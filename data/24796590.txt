Those companies wouldn&#x27;t touch gay rights with a 10 foot pole until one day all of a sudden they&#x27;re beating their way to the front of the line at the pride parade.  They&#x27;ll follow what&#x27;s popular, and if that&#x27;s liquidating jews, they&#x27;ll do it (some of them did!).<p>In this particular case, where there&#x27;s a common carrier for information, we figured out the market failures and how to handle them long ago, the answer is neutrality to the message.  There are some people in the thread making the case that it&#x27;s different now, and maybe it is, maybe we need a different approach, but &quot;just trust the market&quot; is the dumbest idea ever.<p>The market is paper-clip-optimizing gray goo.  Harness it, but don&#x27;t anthropomorphize it and certainly don&#x27;t &quot;trust&quot; it.')
