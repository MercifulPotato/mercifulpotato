I loved it so much (&gt;5 years ago?) that I used as VPN, but this didn&#x27;t quite work on my phone and ended up being too much of a bother.<p>Spotify&#x27;s big advantage, like most monopoly-focused &#x27;startups&#x27; is their monopoly. Not actually providing the best to their customers.<p>I can use Spotify without a VPN, it has a lot of stuff Pandora doesn&#x27;t have, and I can share stuff with friends because everyone else also uses Spotify. It&#x27;s difficult to compete with that.')
