Item(by='mitchs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610471786, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25748097, text='I was initially troubled by the booting of Parler, but I&#x27;ve come around to seeing AWS&#x27;s position as similar to the payment processors who don&#x27;t want to deal with porn sites. Doing business with some clients creates risks. Traditional players don&#x27;t want to deal with risky clients, but there are specialized services who are willing to take them. However, they are more expensive for the same nominal service (because of the risks.) While the payment processors are dealing with frequent charge-backs, the risks I&#x27;d see in hosting Parler are more about liability and litigation.<p>There are clearly hosting providers (like Epik) who would be willing to take them on as clients from the start. If you read AWS&#x27;s acceptable use policy, and then read the Parler&#x27;s TOS, it is clear AWS was a terrible match as a hosting provider. By my read, AWS doesn&#x27;t want to deal with anything that can be construed as &quot;harmful&quot; where Parler only forbade directly illegal behavior. (And it is apparent they barely felt a responsibility to moderate even to that level.) This was never going to work. Jan 6 brought things to a head, but as I see it, this business relationship was doomed from the start.<p>(I work for Amazon, these opinions are my own.)')
