The missus, on the other hand, pretty much pours an unending stream of tea down her neck, from the moment she gets up in the morning til she goes to bed at night.<p>DNA REPORT: I have a DNA marker which suggests I&#x27;m fairly impervious to cold [as in temperature]. The missus has the opposite.<p>REAL WORLD: In winter, I&#x27;ll quite often be sat round the house in a T-shirt, while the missus is wrapped up in several layers of shirts &#x2F; jerseys, etc. complaining she&#x27;s freezing.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen other sites where you can upload your raw DNA data and get a report telling you which diseases eg. cardiovascular, cancer, etc you might be more prone to getting. But I gave those ones a miss. When it comes to that kind of thing, I prefer blissful ignorance to intimations of impending doom.  It&#x27;s been bad enough these past 6 months thinking <i>&quot;Oh no. It&#x27;s the Covid!&quot;</i> every time I get a tickle in my throat.')
