People will bring over their culture to wherever they move.<p>The only counter to this is cultural integration; however, some people will see that as cultural imperialism, or whatever other name is current.<p>The same issue is seen in Africa when new populations move into non traditional areas and bring their customs.  If they are dispersed and don’t clump ala enclaves, they adopt local culture, but if they form enclaves and only hang out with others from their origin they just continue what they knew.<p>In the US so long as immigration was “stretched out” it allowed for slow integration.  The speed of growth though allows for the culture migrate along with the population.  That’s just how it works.  An additional “phenomenon” is usually the transplanted population changes more slowly than the home population.')
