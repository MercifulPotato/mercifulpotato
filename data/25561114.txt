Item(by='Kalium', descendants=None, kids=[25561846, 25572520, 25561408], score=None, time=1609176866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25561004, text='California requires winning a plebiscite to build public housing. This is not optional.<p>When it <i>does</i> manage to build public housing, SF spends approximately a million dollars a unit to do so. That&#x27;s purely to get a habitable unit. It includes none of the maintenance costs, which will increase over time, or the social services required to make public housing work as intended.<p>With that in mind, giving literally 100% of San Francisco&#x27;s budget to building public housing could produce 12,000 units. That would mean shutting down Zuckerberg General Hospital, street cleaning, street repaving, SFO, schools, and anything else SF does.<p>Incidentally, the Supes only actually get to control about $3.5bn of that. So now we&#x27;re reduced to 3,500 units a year... in a city where population growth averages 11,000 people a year. And we still haven&#x27;t talked about social services, maintenance, or how allocation of what will never be enough public housing units will work.<p>I think these numbers lay clear that public housing is unlikely to solve SF&#x27;s housing woes. Don&#x27;t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear!')
