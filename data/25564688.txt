Some of the recent events include:<p>- Crippled macOS Mojave+ to let Apple know every app you open (in the name of malware protection, but sent unencrypted over the internet).<p>- Crippled macOS Big Sur to allow any Apple whitelisted software to bypass any user application firewall blocks and some VPN apps.<p>- Even ios, that has a whole lot of &quot;do you give app permissions&quot; for loads of stuff, leaves a glaring wide hole open as it doesn&#x27;t let the user to allow or block an app from connecting to the internet (on WiFi).')
