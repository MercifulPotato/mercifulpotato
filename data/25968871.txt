Item(by='Throwawayaerlei', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612013307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25967249, text='Not a good <i>or recent</i> one, but reading the linked article indicates the sort of trials being done for vaccines will have a median much greater than the $19 million you cite.  These trials enroll 30,000 subjects at minimum, and take 2 years, both of which substantially exceed the maximums cited in the paper that they or anyone else they knew of had tried.  In the case of length, by 4 times.<p>Thinking further, a billion is too high an estimate today, because these trials or one I looked closely at use smartphone &quot;ediaries&quot; to reduce the number of direct person to person contacts.  But they&#x27;re still high touch affairs, nothing substitutes for phone calls and direct examinations, although the latter are limited in number, but start with a general medical exam.<p>Thanks for bringing that paper to my attention, I&#x27;ll look more closely at it later.')
