I consider it an existence-proof of the idea that a free market cannot solve all problems.<p>I think homelessness due to other causes-- mental health for example-- are more complex but similarly demonstrate fundamental flaws in the framework of society.<p>Only once was I able to give a homeless person a meal... I&#x27;d just bought my lunch, driving a few blocks away I saw someone with as sign asking for $$ for food... I go cashless, so I stopped and ran my lunch over to them. It was Chipotle, so I hope I didn&#x27;t do any lasting damage.<p>As for giving money to homeless on the street... I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the right thing to do, if it will be used for food&#x2F;shelter etc. or something more self-destructive. I&#x27;ve stopped caring about that possibility. I&#x27;ve decided I can&#x27;t <i>not</i> do something that might help someone simply because it also might <i>not</i> help. I also figure addicts have to eat too, and absent enough money to do both, they might decide not to eat.')
