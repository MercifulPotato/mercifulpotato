But it would be stupid to restrict them to 3G spectrum because that&#x27;s a waste of spectrum, so they get rate-limited to &quot;3G-speeds&quot;, which they consider 6mbps.<p>Funny thing is, I&#x27;m on the same network, and if I disable 4G and go on 3G, I get ~16mbps on my speed tests...<p>Like, 5G and 4G <i>save</i> telecoms money by being more efficient with their spectrum, requiring less tower&#x2F;leases and less power. Their equipment needs regular refreshment anyway, upgraded or not. But in Canada they still sell it as a more premium service.')
