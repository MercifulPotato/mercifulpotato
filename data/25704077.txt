The only people that complain about &quot;both sides&quot; points are people who can&#x27;t introspect their own ideologies.<p>All you&#x27;ve done here is ask that people on the right ignore your fringe groups, but would you do the same? Or would you do what they&#x27;re doing and engage in hyperbole to make you deal with them?<p>Both your parties are junk to me, so I&#x27;m happy to keep saying &quot;both sides&quot; until you all get your bad behavior under control.')
