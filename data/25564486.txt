And the minute you create an interface that makes it easy, you become the single point of failure.<p>I used to think BitTorrent was easy for the average computer user by now, but actually not so. You can&#x27;t really delete a magnet link, but you can relatively easily take down the websites that host them, so it&#x27;s not really relevant. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the file still exists and there&#x27;s a peer willing to distribute it if I cannot find it. In practice a lot of a popular torrent trackers (or magnet link indexers) manage to stay up for several years, but there&#x27;s no technological guarantee for this.')
