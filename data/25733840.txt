If the page is about fashion, sell ad space to clothing companies. If the page is about travel, sell it to hospitality companies and tourism boards. If the page is about politics or finance, sell it to people making catheters and stair lifts.<p>It&#x27;s much less creepy than trying to spy on everybody who reads the page, and then looking for an ad that fits your warped understanding of their preferences.')
