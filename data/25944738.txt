Item(by='FabHK', descendants=None, kids=[25945743], score=None, time=1611852758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25943493, text='Ok, so, there&#x27;s a concert by &lt;insert favourite musician&gt; in 4 weeks.<p>Tickets are sold at 100$. But the show is extremely popular, so the tickets are traded, and the price shoots up to 300$. You think the price is still going to go higher, so you buy a ticket for 300$. The price goes up to 400$, you sell the ticket, and you made 100$. (You were long, and the price went up - you made money.)<p>Now, the price goes to 5000$. You think, well, that&#x27;s way too much - you&#x27;re sure the price is coming down. So, what to do? Well, your friend Mike is going to go to the concert, he has a ticket, and he wants to keep it. He doesn&#x27;t care what the price is, he&#x27;s going to the concert. So, you say, listen, Mike, can I have the ticket for a week or so? I&#x27;ll give it back before the concert. He says, sure, and hands you the ticket.<p>You go and sell the ticket for $5000. A week later the ticket price has come down to a more reasonable $4000. So, you go buy a ticket for $4000, and hand it back to Mike. You received $5000, spent $4000, and made $1000, because you were short, and the price went down.<p>That&#x27;s the basic mechanic of short selling.<p>Now, assume the price is going up though. The price could go up to $100000. The date of the concert is coming closer. Mike wants his ticket back. Dang, you have to go out and buy the bloody ticket for $100000. You lost your shirt, because the price went up while you were short a ticket.<p>Ok, price is back at $5000. You think the price is going to fall, and want to short. You put an ad in the paper saying that you have a ticket to sell. Joe calls and wants to buy the ticket. However, Mike is out for lunch. You tell Joe to transfer the money, you&#x27;ll mail him the ticket. When Mike comes back, you ask Mike to borrow the ticket. He might or might not give it to you - if he doesn&#x27;t then you either have to buy it from someone else, or you&#x27;re stiffing Joe.<p>That&#x27;s a naked short.')
