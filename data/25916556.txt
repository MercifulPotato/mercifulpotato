This is for frontend development with 3-4 backend services and rather old versions of MySQL and PHP (not EOL but nothing I want to install on my OSX machine). I&#x27;ve used vagrant previously, but the performance hit and memory usage made me look at docker.<p>So far I&#x27;m really happy.<p>We build the backend services on push to main on Github and push them to AWS container repository. I run PHP in a custom image which is basically php:x.x-apache + some extra PHP plugins.<p>Another usage for docker is that we have DB images which come complete with a test fixture. So instead of the default mysql image we have a custom image that contains a test database that we use for e2e tests. It&#x27;s easy to reset the container to get back to a good known state and it&#x27;s also easier for developers to get started.')
