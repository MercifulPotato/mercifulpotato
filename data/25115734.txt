Yelp and GrubHub may be gaming the SEO, but Google owns the kingdom.  This problem is prevalent enough that Google can&#x27;t claim not to know about it.  And they&#x27;ve certainly invested time in the past to make the algorithms give preference to more likely correct information.  They should be penalizing Yelp and GrubHub sites, they&#x27;re easy enough to recognize.<p>It won&#x27;t take too long before people just quit trusting Google search results.  That&#x27;s probably for the best, unless you&#x27;re Google, which is why I&#x27;m surprised they haven&#x27;t nipped this practice in the bud.')
