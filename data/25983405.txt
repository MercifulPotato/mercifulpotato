History has shown where this road goes.<p>I think, the only way to have a fair &quot;app store&quot; is to somehow model the recommendation mechanics of the pre-monopoly era. 50 years ago you would learn about a new product from your friends (i.e. people you trust) or a newspaper you would buy (i.e. the &quot;influencer&quot; you trust). Each person had their own circle of friends and trusted &quot;influencers&quot;, and made their decisions based on them. There wasn&#x27;t any central authority that could apply the same ranking algorithm to what 100 million different people get to see.<p>This could be modeled fairly well with decentralized mechanisms. Where the weight&#x2F;rating of an app is different for each user, and it strictly comes from the approval of that app by the people they trust. If you get too much spam this way, just track down the source in your trust network and untrust them.')
