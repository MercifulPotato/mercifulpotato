E.g. many Mastodon instances disable their signup pages and new users can only be added by the admins.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to put restrictions on new identities, you could still treat them as suspect by default. E.g. apply a kind of rate limiting where content created by new users is shown at most once per day and the limit rises slowly as the user&#x27;s content is viewed more and more without requiring moderation. (This is a half-baked idea I had just now, so I&#x27;m sure there are many drawbacks. But it might be worth a shot.)')
