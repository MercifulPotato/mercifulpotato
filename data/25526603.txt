Able to apply after 5 years and more or less got his French passport immediately after handing in the necessary documents and passing interviews and language tests. All in the same year he applied. Maybe it&#x27;s different because of marriage, no idea.<p>When you are not in France, the hardest part is to find someone to administer the necessary language test. Last time I checked there were two institutes in Germany with the proper certification, one in Frankfurt and one in Berlin. Then Covid hit I didn&#x27;t check again.<p>Paperwork seems to be a pain in the ass, so. That being said, it seems easier than getting German citizenship.')
