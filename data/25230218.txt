For every decision or element, consider how it contributes to the experience you are enabling. Then, fill out the scope of any large project by talking to others about it, and ideally, others from a range of disciplines and backgrounds. Even some of those who don&#x27;t appear to be relevant to the effort.<p>Developing an understanding of the experience you want to enable and the scope of implementing it are obviously important. And for me, the specific objective is to avoid doing the life&#x27;s work of implementation only to discover it didn&#x27;t turn out the way I wanted.')
