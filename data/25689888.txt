For example: by making the mail-in system more trustworthy, or by eliminating it.<p>My country (Chile) only uses on-site voting and no one alleges fraud because we know that it would be incredibly hard to steal an election with this system. The system is transparent, votes are counted publicly the same day of the voting.<p>The electoral service is one of the few public institutions that I deem competent and actually trust in my country, and I think I&#x27;m not alone.<p>To be honest, now politicians are trying to impose mail-in ballot system, but that not the electoral service&#x27;s fault. That&#x27;s idiot politicians trying to ruin something that works.')
