It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are a dictator or a janitor - you will die anyway. But the institutions, the system, the culture  - will stay for much much longer.<p>Those who build a centralized system that can control every aspect of humans life just don&#x27;t realize they are building Hell on Earth.<p>Decentralization and fairfull consensus between every acting party, no matter how much power they have - this is the only way to build a great culture and a system.<p>Unfortunately, we are still too far from this. Too much people are still trying to build this ugly human pyramid of subordination, just like in a primal tribe or mafia organization.')
