And indeed these two examples are protected by law.<p>So yes you can say that “your right to religion should not limit my right to free speech”, but there is no conflict of interest or ambiguity in terms of how these two rights interact. In South Africa the line is drawn in the sand already. While this may seem like a hardline (pun not intended), it’s important to understand South Africa’s dark history with selective rights and freedoms, and that the one of the lessons learnt is the explicit outline of rights and their limitations in the Constitution. South Africa is a young democracy and these limitations are a feature of fairly recent history.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Constitution_of_South_Africa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Constitution_of_South_Africa</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.za&#x2F;documents&#x2F;constitution&#x2F;chapter-2-bill-rights#16" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.za&#x2F;documents&#x2F;constitution&#x2F;chapter-2-bill-rig...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freedom_of_religion_in_South_Africa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freedom_of_religion_in_South...</a>')
