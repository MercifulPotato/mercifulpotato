It&#x27;s a common quote, a standard and vague answer for the question of limits to individual freedoms.<p>I&#x27;m not GP, but I agree that it often doesn&#x27;t make sense - <i>because</i> it doesn&#x27;t convey any concrete meaning. It requires your conversation partners to infer what exactly you meant by this, and it invites debating the abstract point under unrelated examples (particularly edge cases), or what is or isn&#x27;t a freedom.<p>In a context of a particular conversation - say, short-time rentals - you could say it to argue that just because one can run a short-term rental in residential area, doesn&#x27;t mean they should. But saying &quot;my freedom ends when your begins&quot; doesn&#x27;t communicate much. You could, instead, say that &quot;your freedom to make money off random strangers ends where my freedom to have a good night&#x27;s sleep begins&quot;. Or, better yet, you could simply say something like &quot;my problem is that, in practice, such rentals tend to be a source of constant loud noise and other bad behavior - which goes against mine and other permanent residents&#x27; desire to live in a safe neighborhood and be able to sleep well at night&quot;.<p>(And speaking of landmines, don&#x27;t ever mention &quot;zoning&quot; in such conversations.)<p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1053&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1053&#x2F;</a>')
