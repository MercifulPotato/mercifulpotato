This is often interpreted as you need to release publicly, but that is not the case. If I&#x27;m remembering rightly then the author can&#x27;t make them give him a copy of the code at this point, but one of their users could. If they have&#x2F;had no users that care, there is no more that they need to do. Unless the author having visited their site counts as them being a user of the code protected by the license, then it swings back the other way.')
