When I talked to her about it, she was very much on the side that she wished she didn&#x27;t have to study for it because it didn&#x27;t have much to do with her job at all. She just wished she could spend her time getting better at the skills she actually used rather than a wide range of academic material that didn&#x27;t matter to her day to day.<p>Her friends from residency thought similarly. That&#x27;s just a few data points and maybe some doctors are helped, but it definitely isn&#x27;t every doctor.')
