I recently purchased a Model Y - and the 7-day return policy had <i>critical</i> influence on my choice to purchase. It makes it clear that they want you to be happy, and that they are confident you will be.<p>It is also a policy that I believe helps with word-of-mouth,  I specifically told friends and family about the policy and I also put 900 miles on my Model Y within the first few days to be sure there were no major issues I was unhappy with.<p>Regardless, the Model Y is fantastic, I can&#x27;t wait for there to be more options like it available from all auto manufacturers.')
