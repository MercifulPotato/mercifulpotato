I&#x27;ve run into it myself.  To be able to do that, you have to add Options&lt;T&gt; to the constructor of every class in the chain and then configure DI for it.  It just has bad code smell.<p>On my last project, I just assigned the configs to a static class that&#x27;s available everywhere and the code was just simply much cleaner.')
