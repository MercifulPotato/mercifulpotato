Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610813243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25802914, text='“HIPAA compliant” means you aren&#x27;t breaking the law, which is quite important independent of any audit or certification because there are penalties for breaking the law, and they apply to all covered entities.<p>“HIPAA certified” and the identity of the certifying authority is also potentially important; it may have some marketing value, but more importantly it is (as you note, but bizarrely use it to propose that “audit” is more important than “certification”), various people you might want to do business with may require certification, by an acceptable certification authority. (Possibly different ones for different aspects of HIPAA.) OTOH, there are covered entities that don&#x27;t have to worry about this at all, because of who they are and who they plan to do business with.<p>A 3rd party audit for HIPAA compliance probably isn&#x27;t important to anyone external to you directly (and is not an element of compliance), but may be useful for identifying compliance issues, or may be a component of certification.')
