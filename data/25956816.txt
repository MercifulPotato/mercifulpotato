They refused to give me an account, and refused (both in their app and over email) to tell me why. Left a bad taste in my mouth.<p>Ended up going with Nationwide, who are a bit behind tech-wise (they do this weird thing where they ask for 3 digits of a 6-digit PIN I&#x27;m supposed to memorize, which seems far less secure than a long random password in my password manager), but generally have been great. I tried to sign up for their student account, got told no and redirected to their no-credit-check account with no issues. (That&#x27;s probably also an indication of what went wrong with Monzo.)')
