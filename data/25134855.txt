Most of these questions are cheesy, but that isn&#x27;t important.<p>&quot;Who was your first love?&quot;, &quot;Where did you meet your wife?&quot;, &quot;what was your dream job as a child?&quot; that kind of thing.<p>I found them extremely interesting to read since people tend to write more than they say or would casually mention. I think it also helped the writer as it lessened the fear that things were left unsaid.<p>Otherwise if he enjoys his routine, maybe it is the most important thing to do right now.')
