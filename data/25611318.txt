The &quot;it&#x27;s dangerous&quot; crowd is as Ted Chiang put it imagining the singularity as no-holds-barred capitalism, because when they imagine superintelligence the only thing they can come up with is the companies they work for.The paperclip AI is just a VC funded startup, the only difference is it&#x27;s even better at disruption than their employers.<p>The Kurzweil one is basically just recycled Christian eschatology, where the final judgement comes around, we&#x27;ll resurrect the dead, defeat death and so on.<p>So it&#x27;s basically two American timeless cultural classics, the funny part is that people in that crowd don&#x27;t seem to notice it')
