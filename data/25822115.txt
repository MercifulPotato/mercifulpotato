This was enacted on Dec. 31, 2020 but passed earlier, being introduced with bipartisan support the spring&#x2F;summer (for house and senate, respectively) of 2019! Does anyone read before commenting? Talk about assumptions. Perhaps this is why the ills some are complaining about seem ubiquitous in their worldview.')
