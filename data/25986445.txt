And third-party filterset subscriptions that made heavy use of CSS-based element blocking rules had become quite popular by then. So an API that only provides for URL blocking is missing almost the entire point of uBlock.<p>(I wasn&#x27;t using any third-party filtersets at the time, so I found uBlock unimpressive and stuck with Adblock Plus for quite a while because I found its UI better for curating my own blocking rules.)')
