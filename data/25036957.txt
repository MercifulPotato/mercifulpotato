[1] There were four men charged in that incident. [2] So with about 30-100 personnel with malicious intent, distributed across a dozen election districts, you could theoretically swing an entire state&#x27;s results in the 5-figure ballot range.<p>While this is not PROBABLE, we should acknowledge that it is POSSIBLE, and take steps to mitigate the risk accordingly. But basic enforcement of election integrity just outright sucks. Why else would someone feel so bold as to video themselves ballot harvesting and thinking it&#x27;s ok?[3]<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newjerseyglobe.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;evidence-of-massive-voter-fraud-in-paterson-election-court-records-show&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newjerseyglobe.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;evidence-of-massive-voter-f...</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.northjersey.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;paterson-press&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;25&#x2F;paterson-nj-election-fraud-who-charged-and-what-we-know&#x2F;3260250001&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.northjersey.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;paterson-press&#x2F;2020&#x2F;0...</a><p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twincities.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;28&#x2F;project-veritas-video-alleges-widespread-voter-fraud-in-mn-with-u-s-rep-ilhan-omar-at-head&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twincities.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;28&#x2F;project-veritas-video-...</a>')
