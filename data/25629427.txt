For example:<p>* If your company ships under $1000 of goods to the UK per year, you don&#x27;t need to keep any records or pay tax.  Just write your name on the parcel.<p>* If you ship under $100,000 to the UK per year, you must pay 20% tax on imports, by annual cheque to &quot;The Queen&quot;.  You calculate the amount.<p>* If you import more than that, you need to register with the government, keep records of sales, allow our auditors to look at them, pay monthly in advance, etc.')
