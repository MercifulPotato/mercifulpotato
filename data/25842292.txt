It’s a federal crime for a courier like UPS or FedEx or Amazon to deposit things inside them, or indeed for you to pop a note to your neighbour if it is not affixed with postage (of course nobody cares about that). Most homes could easily do with a lockable (non-mail) delivery box, and I doubt that drones are going to drive adoption of that... I must say though, I vastly prefer the mail slot that is found in the U.K. and rest of Europe far more commonly as a model.')
