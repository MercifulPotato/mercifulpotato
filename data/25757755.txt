It is only telling you the fingerprint of the key the message claims to have been signed with, but there is no verification happening.<p>You can change part of the message or the encoded fingerprint (which is a bit longer than the portion you pasted), and it will still report it the same way.<p>However, you will not be able to mathematically verify that this message and another one was signed by the same key.<p>If you look carefully at what GPG is telling you, probably see a line like this, unless you have the key in keyring:<p><pre><code>    gpg: Can&#x27;t check signature: No public key</code></pre>')
