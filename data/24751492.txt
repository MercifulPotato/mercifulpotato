Misconduct took the form of Goatseing and GNAA posting and such.<p>In video games and sports it&#x27;s different.  Making a sport of trash-talking in a video game (or, the NFL line of scrimmage) is a different thing than making lame posts on reddit.

But I had a YouTube video go fairly viral in 2006, and it didn&#x27;t have the bad &quot;omg the YouTube comments&quot; experience that people started talking about some years later.  (On the other hand I could complain it got comments on my clothing, comments about my race, and offers of marriage, except, well, I enjoyed all of them.)')
