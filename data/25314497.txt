It sounds like ideologically driven circular reasoning. If you train an AI on the largest dataset it&#x27;s possible to obtain then you have, almost by definition, done the most you can to avoid bias of any sort: the model will learn the most accurate representation of reality it can given the data available.<p>Gebru is the type of person who defines &quot;bias&quot; as anything that isn&#x27;t sufficiently positive towards people who look like herself, not the usual definition of a deviation from reality as exists. Having encountered AI &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;bias&quot; papers (words quoted because the words aren&#x27;t used with their dictionary definitions), it&#x27;s not even clear to me they should count as research at all, let alone be worth reading. They take as the starting premise that anything a model learns about the world that is politically incorrect is a bug, and go downhill from there.')
