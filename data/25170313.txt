As a business customer, if it is going to cost me 30% less money to run the same workload regardless of the ISA, I will take it. A lesser power bill for the cloud provider that results from a more efficient ISA is a mere comforting thought. No more no less (to an extent). Philosophically and ethically, yes, I would rather run my workload on an ISA of my choice, but we can&#x27;t have that anymore, and Intel is at blame here why. Not that I personally have the intention to blame anyone.')
