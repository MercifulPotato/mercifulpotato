Item(by='throw0101a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611787029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25930691, text='&gt; <i>Okay a serious question: at what point does it make sense for these hedge fund guys to just purchase reddit and shut it down?</i><p>It would be irrelevant even if they could. The problem is&#x2F;was not Reddit&#x2F;WSB, but rather the positions that the hedge funds put themselves in.<p>Where are&#x2F;were the PhDs in risk analysis at these places? How do you get into a position of shorts being &gt;120% of the total float?<p>Take Willian Gibson&#x27;s &#x27;Law&#x27;:<p>* The future is already here—it&#x27;s just not evenly distributed.<p>And take the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH):<p>* The price of a security reflects all the available information about it.<p>And when you combine them you have the principle that the information is out there (<i>too many short contracts</i>), but it wasn&#x27;t evenly distributed—yet.† Until someone noticed it, and it started to spread, and that caused people to change their positions in GME.<p>Shutting down Reddit, or any other random forum, isn&#x27;t going to stop someone from noticing the shorts.<p>This is no different than what happened in <i>The Big Short</i>: some folks noticed discrepancies (e.g., mortgage delinquencies) and acted first, and as that information spread the market &quot;corrected&quot; its price. It&#x27;s just that it ended up causing the Great Recession.<p>The spread of information isn&#x27;t instantaneous either: at the very least it is limited by the speed of light. After that, it&#x27;s limited by either (a) human attention spans, and&#x2F;or (b) the machine learning systems that humans programmed in automated systems.<p>† Edit: I propose this phenomenon, if not labelled already, be called &quot;Gibson&#x27;s Market Corollary&quot;.<p>--<p>Now the price of GME is kind of meta though, in that it doesn&#x27;t reflect on what&#x27;s know about GameStop, <i>but rather</i> someone &#x27;related&#x27; to GameStop.')
