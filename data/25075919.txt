I honestly don&#x27;t know, because my experience with C++ was during school ~20 years ago, and since then professionally I&#x27;ve used mostly python in relatively small codebases where it&#x27;s all my own code (mostly for data processing&#x2F;analysis). Thanks!<p>(Although I did have to write some C code to glue together data in a <i>very</i> old legacy system that didn&#x27;t support C++, much less python. It took a lot more effort to do something simple, but it was also strangely a <i>really</i> rewarding experience. Kind of similar to feeling when I work with assembly on hobby projects)')
