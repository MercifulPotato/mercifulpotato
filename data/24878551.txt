I currently use Flickr, but they have a mountain of issues and they&#x27;re also closed source&#x2F;not encrypted. Unfortunately the pricing does turn me off a bit. For up to 300gb of photos, you&#x27;d pay the same as Flickr, but I happen to have slightly north of 300gb and so I&#x27;d pay more than double the price of Flickr. And Flickr offers unlimited storage...<p>What I&#x27;d really love is something I can self host. OwnPhotos seems super cool, but apparently it&#x27;s not stable yet. Are there any alternatives that can be run today?')
