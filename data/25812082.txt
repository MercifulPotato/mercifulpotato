And for the later we probably would need to differentiate between basing the automatic general purpose targeting based on the current context (the site you are on + what subsection of the site you are on + what you have in your shopping car and similar) with the actual context + history + ML based micro categorization.<p>In general what I am against is advertisements where<p>- the advertiser can choose targets based on too fine grained categories (micro categories)<p>- people get classified with too fine grained categories<p>(Both points are mostly the same.)<p>So &quot;people who bought this book also bought books X,Y,Z&quot; is IMHO fine, even if it can sometime lead to bad situations as it can be abused much less. (EDIT: But that partially because it shows real products, &quot;people who have seen XY news also see Z news&quot; would be a different thing.)')
