This is a non issue.<p>And how do you install other App Stores? Just visit epicgames.com&#x2F;ios, see a popup asking &quot;do you want to install this app store&quot; and click &quot;confirm&quot;? That&#x27;s no different than the exact thing that caused Windows to be known to need an antivirus (at least, until Windows Defender and smartscreen became good enough for &#x27;common sense&#x27; users). Anything more is going to be met with criticism for &#x27;too much of a barrier to install&#x27; for competing app stores.')
