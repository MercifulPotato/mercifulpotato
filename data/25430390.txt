In the UK paracetamol isn&#x27;t a brand name, it&#x27;s the generic term for a commodity product, &#x27;nobody&#x27; cares who&#x27;s name is on their paracetamol, I usually buy it with groceries if I&#x27;m low, so it&#x27;s whichever supermarket brand.<p>The only (non-supermarket&#x2F;chemist) brands I could name even would be e.g. Lemsip, where the paracetamol isn&#x27;t the main constituent (it&#x27;s a lemon flavoured sore throat&#x2F;cold soothing drink, if you don&#x27;t have it there) but an additive in some SKUs (also caffeine).<p>So you can get generic brands of &#x27;tylenol&#x27;? People just trust&#x2F;think better of Tylenol?')
