Even super-healthy people like astronauts have immune system weakening and hypersensitivites developed as result of decreased exposure to diverse antigens:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;190123174405.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedaily.com&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;190123174405.h...</a><p>&quot;Scientists compared blood samples of eight crewmembers who completed missions to the International Space Station with healthy individuals who remained on Earth. Blood samples were taken before launch, at several points during the mission and after the astronauts&#x27; return to Earth.<p>The results showed that NK-cell function is impaired in astronauts as compared with pre-flight levels and ground-based controls. At flight day 90, NK-cell cytotoxic activity against leukemia cells in vitro was reduced by approximately 50 percent in International Space Station crew members.&quot;')
