I&#x27;ve always being shocked by the fact that UK&#x2F;US citizens drink mainly milk instead of drinking water. Moreover, I visited US a couple of years ago, and it was shockingly hard to find normal pure water, since people there use to drink almost only water variants or other beverages. In Italy the only beverages you usually find on the table during lunch&#x2F;dinner are water and wine.')
