Item(by='pengaru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606600367, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25240431, text='I suspect lack of need for rollers is a primary feature.<p>Conceptually, to me, the new interior bits serve as a sort of individual tooth holder that is free to rotate with the tooth as the tooth orbits the axle.  So there&#x27;s not much friction at the tooth:holder junction as the sprocket turns.<p>That friction is now occurring at the narrower intersection of a hinged tooth holder and chain link.  Being a narrower hinge joint, just the length of a chain link&#x27;s thickness, it has less surface area for friction, and less room for debris ingress etc.<p>Conventional chains rotate a pin across the sprocket&#x27;s thickness, and AIUI use a roller to try keep debris out of and lubricant within that interface to reduce friction.  This contraption takes it a step further.<p>You can actually envision the tooth holder as analogous to the roller in a conventional chain, just with less surface area at the twisting intersection.  They&#x27;ve obsoleted the conventional roller.')
