Yes often you end up in quarantine at the destination, that is largely not enforced so just best hope. But if you cross 5 states while getting to your destination, they just let you through.<p>Has been like that since... whole covid. We traveled from west to east and back 4x during 2020 through 4 countries, never any issue, mostly no border controls.<p>The only exception was when French imposed strict lockdown and limited people to 1km around their house. That lasted couple of weeks. That&#x27;s it. Even right now you can travel freely within EU.')
