But in doing so, they’ll only pay a fixed fee to the dealer.<p>Instead, what happens is that the dealer has an incentive to build a local knowledge base on how to fix the common problems but not share it with GM as they can bill the repairs hourly.<p>(The specific failure mode he used as an example was inadequate weatherproofing in door electrics.  The local fix was to pop-rivet the bottom of a plastic container in the right place so as to improve weather resistance)')
