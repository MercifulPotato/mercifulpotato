Professionally, time == money, and where something like a come-along pulling a torque wrench <i>can</i> work, it&#x27;s not viable in the real world of a busy shop. At home, your own car, hobby, fine; but AFAIK that cost him his job.<p>I&#x27;ve been privileged to have spent a lot of time with people who kept construction and farm machinery operating as part of their living; and sheer brawn is <i>absolutely</i> so large a benefit in those tasks, as to almost be a requirement.')
