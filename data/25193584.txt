It&#x27;s IoT, businesses, hospitals, government agencies, utility companies, etc.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s the security needs of these organisations that are addressed by this technology, not yours, not mine.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly fine to let a sysadmin lock down a computer to reduce what the end user can do.<p>None of these use cases or security benefits require taking power away from the sysadmin.  And that&#x27;s what the argument is about: not whether the end-user is losing control, but whether the <i>sysadmin</i> is losing control.  With the obvious note that lots of home users are their own sysadmins.<p>&gt; I see this chip in the same area as Intel&#x27;s vPro, TPM 2.0, AMDs ASP (in their Ryzen PRO line), and so on; not necessarily aimed at end users (aside from the occasional buzzword) and more aimed towards businesses and government users (as part of their Zero-Trust initiative).<p>Those are basically fine, as long as they can be disabled when not needed.<p>But if I&#x27;m forced to give someone else special beyond-root access to my device for DRM purposes, that&#x27;s not acceptable.')
