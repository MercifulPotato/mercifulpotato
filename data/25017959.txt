Instead you do something like call people on a telephone, get a sample of people who both answer the telephone and who give answers you think indicate they are likely to vote. That sample isn&#x27;t going to be at all representative of the voting population, so you take your best guess at what the actual voting population looks like, and how representative each of the people in your sample is of the voting population, and weight it accordingly.<p>Your best guess at the actual voting population is probably wrong. Your best guess at how representative each person in your sample is of the actual voting population is wrong. Your doing things like assuming that every &lt;race&gt; person with &lt;education level&gt; votes similarly regardless of whether or not they answer the telephone and respond to pollsters because you really just don&#x27;t have a better option.')
