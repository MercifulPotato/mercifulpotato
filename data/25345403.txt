It let him sit up on his high horse, while everyone else flitted around. That&#x27;s where he was comfortable. Being above. Face to face or phone calls with strangers made him &quot;equal&quot; which he didn&#x27;t see himself as.<p>Not judging, just pointing out it&#x27;s interesting you can have this very likeable and well-loved and appreciated guy who internally sees himself (in this vocation of piloting) as the best of the best, which places him above everyone else in his estimation, which is a point of view that people who see as negative, and yet he was well-loved and he made it work. Only piloting tho, other things he didn&#x27;t see himself as better than others, but better than was where he was comfortable so he associated most with his piloting.<p>Slightly premonitive that I had a dream last night about astronauts and test pilots, and very clearly the phrase &quot;the right stuff&quot; was repeated a few times, and in the dream I related it to (I think there was) that movie in the late 80s or 90s about &quot;the right stuff&quot; pilots with a few big names in it. Nothing in the dream about Yeager but I consider that a definite hit tho. I don&#x27;t think I often get preinfo in dreams tho, so that&#x27;s interesting.')
