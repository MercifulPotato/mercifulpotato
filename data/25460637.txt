You&#x27;re responding to a claim that the difference was 0.8%.  This is pretty marginal â€” that first 99.2% takes exactly the same with xz or zstd, and the remaining 0.8% is not large in comparison.<p>Take for example ~13.5 GB.  This is a 6 hour download at your 5Mbps figure.  An extra 0.8% is less than 3 minutes on that 6 hour download.')
