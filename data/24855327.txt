Music that is very &quot;busy&quot; with bass and percussion is more difficult for young kids to pick up, in my experience.  Also the more difficult the vocal performance, the harder it will be to follow.<p>My wife and I listen to a lot of classical and hymns with simple 4-part harmonies.  We have 7 kids, most of whom could match the songs pretty well at surprisingly young ages (2 or 3 years old).')
