Item(by='filoleg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608249388, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25461751, text='&gt;If you are applying this to computer games, I see your point. If you are applying it to 5-star reviews for $20, then I disagree.<p>I am with you on this one. Not in the least part, because I don&#x27;t think that the analogy the parent comment brought up is valid here at all (and I am saying that as someone who actually read that book they mentioned).<p>In the example the parent comment brought up, it even says &quot;[...]throwing is an integral part of the design - it&#x27;s meant to be there[...]&quot;. That throwing mechanic was an intentional addition to the game, to counter-balance people who constantly block. The only people complaining about it are those who don&#x27;t understand the game well or early beginners (we are talking someone who never played any fighting games before at all). Every single person playing competitively understands that without throws, the balance would be completely off, and the game would become unplayable competitively. In fact, it would become a completely different kind of game altogether. And throws aren&#x27;t some hidden feature, it is featured prominently in tutorials and all.<p>While with gift cards in exchange for amazon reviews, it isn&#x27;t an intentional mechanic advertised as a feature of the service. Amazon doesn&#x27;t come out and say &quot;this is one of our core features, without it our service would go down the drain and become unusable.&quot; It is still against the rules, and I cannot think of any logical reason it is helpful for buyers in terms of making Amazon.com a better marketplace (aside from the cash gain to the customer writing the paid review, but that&#x27;s just a personal gain and doesn&#x27;t make the marketplace better).')
