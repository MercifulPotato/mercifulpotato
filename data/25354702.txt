But to say that apple’s headphones are not good is, honestly, just wrong. I love the AirPods for background music, podcasts, audiobooks, and phone calls as I go about my day. I owned a different set of wireless earbuds before the AirPods which were actually higher-quality and more expensive, but I didn’t like them nearly as much. Convenience and decent sound quality make the AirPods perfect for casual listening. Of course, still having a separate pair of actual high-end headphones for sitting down and really enjoying the detail in music in other scenarios.')
