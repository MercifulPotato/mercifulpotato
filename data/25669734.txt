I never invested in it but I remember being in awe of watching its price skyrocket within the course of a day and come crashing down the next. Obviously I wish I invested in it but I blame naïveté. I wonder what would have happened if I read the whitepaper.<p>Last year while I was gaining unemployment money and had extra funds I chose to buy myself things instead of investing in crypto.<p>I finally got around to investing a couple hundred dollars tonight. Took me long enough. I sure wish that I invested any amount in bitcoin at any point I have known about it in the past 8 years.<p>Bitcoin is a fantastic way to hold value as long as it as viewed as valuable and its valuableness is being cemented further and further everyday. Bitcoin might be a bubble but with the shrinking of the middle class and a growing lack of faith in government, bitcoin is becoming a fantastic way to hold wealth and the demand is going to go up as the availability of new bitcoins goes down.<p>At this point I’m not convinced the price of bitcoin will ever be stable, but that’s okay.')
