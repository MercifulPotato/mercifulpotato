If you leave your PC at Geek Squad there is a standard legal clause that states if you do not pick up the item within a certain amount of time then it becomes their property. Being that it is their property they can choose to dispose of it or do whatever they want with it, including reading the information and sharing it.<p>Geek squad is not a warehouse nor do they want the burden of holding the equipment indefinitely. This is common practice across almost all goods services such as laundry, shoe repair, instrument repair, etc. There’s an overwhelming legal precedence in this case. In this case the shop owner attempted to return the equipment several times but no response was heard, therefore the standard contract clause(s) are executed.<p>I think where you’re struggling is you’re confusing your emotions, clearly you don’t like this outcome, with legality. Feelings are not facts.<p>I could cite a whole bunch of legal jargon and cases to utterly destroy your weak argument, but I’ll have mercy keep it high level like above.<p>I won’t be responding to further comments because we both know you’re just pouting here and you got some free legal education on my dime.')
