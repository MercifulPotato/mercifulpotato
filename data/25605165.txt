I love the speed aspect of it, but I&#x27;m less keen on the template language. I&#x27;d have to rework a lot of Liquid stuff that I&#x27;ve built up over time, then it looks like it&#x27;d be very hard to port <i>out</i> of Hugo down the road because as far as I know, that language is pretty specific to Hugo.<p>Hugo also seems to be more or less &quot;take it or leave it&quot; in terms of customizability, and I don&#x27;t know Go.
