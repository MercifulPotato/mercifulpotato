Simply because wherever we built something to make things more efficient&#x2F;easier, those gains are usually swallowed and overshadowed by the demand for more complexity that arises from latent potential that has been opened up.<p>&quot;we&#x27;ve made taxes easy!&quot;<p>&quot;...could you also make tax evasion easy?&quot;<p>&quot;yes, but it would be more complicated&quot;<p>&quot;More complicated than before you were there?&quot;<p>This is just an made-up example but that&#x27;s how it so often goes and it really makes it feel like I should have become a hermit and wrote indie-games while living on cupnoodles instead.')
