Above, you said -<p>&gt;<i>the solution is [...] to have police put their blackmailing asses in the jail.</i><p>But now, you&#x27;re saying you don&#x27;t have meaningful access to law enforcement (in this context). So, why did you suggest a solution you know isn&#x27;t viable? I don&#x27;t get it.<p>To my mind, you&#x27;ve just made a strong argument <i>for</i> publishing DKIM keys since you readily admit law enforcement cannot tackle the blackmail problem. Indeed, even in countries with &quot;good&quot; law enforcement, they can&#x27;t reasonably tackle it since the blackmailers <i>almost always</i> come from overseas (or are un-traceable).')
