Am I exploring an idea on a lazy afternoon or am I one of dozens contributing to a code base older than the millennium in which bugs might cause measurable loss and some top500 exec call our enterprise&#x27;s exec?  I wouldn&#x27;t think it reasonable to expect that there is one language which suits those (and there are other) needs equally well.  I know which language I&#x27;ll enjoy better and which my co-workers (and potentially my later self) enjoy better.  It helps to be paid for using the latter.')
