With some exceptions, their CPUs have nothing to run without external help, so they are forced to load and run arbitrary code to even be operational.<p>Replacing a memory chip would not do anything because those aren&#x27;t used.<p>The artificial constraint is either that the code (firmware) is closed, or both closed and signed.<p>Otherwise, I like the criterion a lot. It&#x27;s a decent distinction between what&#x27;s &quot;software&quot; and &quot;hardware&quot;.<p>Another blurry line is devices that come with a memory chip where their program code is loaded, but they later need to have a patch loaded by the OS each time (like Intel microcode). Yet another uncertainty depends on how we define root access. If we take it to mean &quot;I have the last word&quot;, then Intel&#x2F;AMD and some ARM CPUs don&#x27;t qualify, as they have deep, manufacturer-signed-only modes.')
