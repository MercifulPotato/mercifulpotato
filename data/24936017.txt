If you look at the email chain that Glenn himself published [1], the correspondence is essentially the editor giving a bunch of suggestions of how to improve the article, then Glenn asserting CENSORSHIP and then the EIC telling him to stop being so rude to his colleagues and then Glenn quitting in a huff.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s possible that all of the implied messages were exactly as Glenn surmised them to be but ultimately, it doesn&#x27;t matter what&#x27;s implied. Glenn at no point even brings up what his supposed contractual rights are and lays out a paper trail forcing them to acknowledge a breach of contract.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible that if he had just pushed a little harder, they would have simply been like &quot;Well, it&#x27;s your grave but it does state it in the contract so we&#x27;ll put it up without edits&quot; but him not even trying makes it seem like he is engineering the situation to resolve to this particular outcome.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;emails-with-intercept-editors-showing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;emails-with-intercept-edito...</a>')
