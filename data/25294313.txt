Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607027334, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25292488, text='&gt; “What did you expect?” is my least favorite conversational trope (it’s more disappointing on HN because in general I have higher expectations here, but it’s common everywhere).<p>&gt; On the surface it sounds smart and world-weary. As an actual part of a conversation, whether something is expected is pretty orthogonal to whether, say, something would ideally be done about it.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty much just a lazy dismissal of the issue, and maybe even an attempt to jam up the discussion.')
