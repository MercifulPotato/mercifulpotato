In SC2, everything is on a knife edge and it&#x27;s common to fall apart after a bad engagement.<p>This is not a universal truth though. I primarily play AOE 2, where map distances and good static defence mean that an attacker needs momentum to push their advantage after a mistake from the other side if they want any chance to close the game. Hence it&#x27;s common to see even pro players recover from somewhat horrifying gaffes when their opponent fails to push aggressively enough.')
