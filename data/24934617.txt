That statement still leaves open a bunch of possibilities including that the contents of the laptop were faked by non-Russians, were faked by the Russians but the US doesn&#x27;t have intelligence confirming it, etc.<p>As for the FBI, they say &quot;we have nothing to add&quot; to the DNI&#x27;s statement and that &quot;the FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any ongoing investigation&quot;. Nothing in the FBI&#x27;s letter says anything about the laptop&#x27;s contents being genuine.')
