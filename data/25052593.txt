This isn&#x27;t an HN-specific problem, it&#x27;s industry-wide.  But I didn&#x27;t go into software until my 30s, so the gender skew of the industry feels alien and alienating to me.<p>I would ditch HN if I discovered another tech community which was more inviting to women.  I don&#x27;t care if I start to miss out on the HN-resident perspectives on gender which shock me, because there are other perspectives which are more important to me which I&#x27;m already missing out on.')
