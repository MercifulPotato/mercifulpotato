This shows a horrible lack of faith in your workers. I am sure almost any task you can see can be assessed for completion - or whatever metric you need apply. How do you watch them at work now? How do you measure that - just figure out a way. This is a win-win-win for employee, employer, and government. Taxing extra will destroy the value of work at home, a lose-lose-lose for the same levels. I can see a good employee may well be able to  hold down 2 or more jobs at home, as long as he&#x2F;she meets the metric it becomes a win-win-win...There will need to be a way to eliminate dead heads who game the systems= and meet a badly administered metric.')
