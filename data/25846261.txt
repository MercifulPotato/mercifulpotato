Item(by='dominotw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611149965, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25841607, text='Yes for sure. My cousin and moved to chicago into a $1000&#x2F;per month rental unit in west chicago. I found a minimum wage job as a gas station clerk, my cousin refused to get a job and preferred being a vagrant, I had to kick him out since I couldn&#x27;t afford to pay the full rent without a roomate and I had maxed out the one credit card I had. He bounced around from place to place tricking family and friends into believing he is working on finding job. One of my family contacts even got him a job at subway in suburbs of chicago but he refused to work there for more than a week. He eventually ended up on the streets. I am not quite sure if he could&#x27;ve used an govt assistance since he didn&#x27;t have a legal status in the country. I eventually found a better paying job at a hospital picking up soiled laundry but I lost touch with my cousin, he didn&#x27;t have a cell phone back then.')
