Item(by='deckard1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611607746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25908112, text='&gt; seems useful to ponder why does it happen.<p>Ooooh. I know this one! Because <i>that&#x27;s what VCs want</i>. AirBNB, Uber, Postmates, Google, Facebook, Apple.<p>VCs want to invest in winner-takes-all platforms and markets with incredibly strong network effects. But don&#x27;t say any of that out loud:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;themarkup.org&#x2F;google-the-giant&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;google-documents-show-taboo-words-antitrust" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;themarkup.org&#x2F;google-the-giant&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;google-doc...</a><p>All these people rushing in to Silicon Valley with hat-in-hand going from VC to VC talking about how they care so much about the user or the product. It&#x27;s all a giant colossal fucking sham. You&#x27;re there to become a billionaire. Can we all stop dancing around this fact already? Paul Graham and his fucking essays. The pretentious VC Twitterverse. It&#x27;s always been about the money. Facebook&#x27;s earliest slide deck tells the story of how they are going to harvest their users&#x27; private data and offer it up to advertisers:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.slidebean.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;s15UZQkE7T&#x2F;Facebooks-original-pitch-deck" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.slidebean.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;s15UZQkE7T&#x2F;Facebooks-original-pi...</a><p>This is back when they were still &quot;The Facebook&quot; and a tiny startup. They didn&#x27;t suddenly become evil and greedy. Greed and evil <i>was the plan</i>. It&#x27;s right there. Google is no different.')
