There are crisis responders who help the companies recover, who arrange a minimal payment, and who get paid by the insurers. This is market governance and it keeps the prices down because there is a sort of gentlemenâ€™s agreement between the gangs and the payment companies. Also, the lack of prohibition means these companies operate in the open and they can share information about pricing etc internally and with each other.
