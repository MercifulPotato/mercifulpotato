You should be worried about the ease by which various systems can bootstrap and adopt the language, which is a mostly solved problem for C&#x2F;C++ but not a given for Rust itself. Some maintainers will absolutely refuse bootstrapping off of binary artifacts compiled from other systems, others won&#x27;t even accept &#x27;compiled to C&#x27; artifacts.<p>Keeping a viable C++ implementation as part of GCC would be the smartest decision.')
