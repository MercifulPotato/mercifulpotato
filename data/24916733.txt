It noted that the two populations most mostly likely to suffer from covid are Haredim (ultra-Orthodox Jews) and Arabs, both of which tend to dress conservatively, and the latter of which have darker skin than the average Israeli, and thus might have less vitamin D in their systems.<p>Of course, these two populations also tend to be poorer and have larger families living together, so there are other factors to consider as well.<p>For example, Israelis are told to worry about skin cancer, and thus tend to use sunblock when going out in the summer. Which removes the chance of serious vitamin D generation, from what I understand.<p>I find the discussion of vitamin D to be very interesting, but it feels like we need a few more studies to determine whether this is the big one.  But the more discussions I see, the more I think it might actually explain quite a lot.')
