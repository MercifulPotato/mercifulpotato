Any shame was what they wanted. Shame that they were captured. Shamed that they were attacking villages. Shame that they gave up secrets.<p>So not only were you saying things that a romanticized view of the military has pounded into you that you would never do... but your captors are trained and specifically trying to make you feel shame &#x2F; degrade your sense of self value.<p>So I think it is more than just physical torture, but unfortunately adept mental torture as well, that leads to men having those emotions.')
