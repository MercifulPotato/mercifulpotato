When the manager is competent to understand, console and provide guidance to the team when they&#x27;re struggling - even slight slivers of technical skills and knowhow, the rapport they build is unbreakable.<p>The idea is to genuinely belong to a team, not just on an org chart. When troops are in the battle field, they form unbreakable bonds because they have trust, got each other&#x27;s backs and there is absolutely nothing artificial about it - life is on the line. More often than not, I&#x27;ve seen managers appear genuine but are not internally so and it will surface in future if not now.<p>Also, corporations, midsized companies and even small companies have this idea of not speaking the mind. Instead, massive amounts of bullshit corp speak and lipstick is put on the pig to do a quick dog and pony show for the upper management. Managers that suck up to upper management lose their support from the troops. Once that&#x27;s done, there is no going back.')
