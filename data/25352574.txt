While East Asians, Southeast Asians and Native Americans are more likely to have the dry type of cerumen (gray and flaky), African and European people are more likely to have the wet type (honey-brown, dark orange to dark-brown and moist).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Earwax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Earwax</a><p>So, the effectiveness of any tool is going to be wildly different for a &#x27;wet&#x27; type vs a &#x27;dry&#x27; type. And, the ability to be &quot;impacted&quot; will vary as well.')
