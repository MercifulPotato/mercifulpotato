I believe (could be wrong) that the required wage increase  for old-&gt;proposed new H1B requirements changes would be close to the below examples:<p>1)Software Developer in Chicago - Old $71k-&gt;New $105k<p>2)Software Developer in San Francisco - Old $96k-&gt;New $145k<p>My Opinion:<p>Free trade is generally good. That includes things, people and ideas. But the effects of immigration policies are very uneven throughout society.<p>Imagine if the US had 200 qualified TV meteorologists. If the US opens its borders to unlimited TV meteorologists from the developing country of Meteoroligistan, what would the effects be? It&#x27;s pretty clear that the news networks would be able to hire cheaper meteorologists. Because the meteorologists are cheaper, the news networks would also hire more of them. TV viewers would then get better, more frequent weather forecasts. The networks and the consumers win! But conventional wisdom says that the original 200 qualified meteorologists here lose.<p>But I kind of think conventional wisdom may be wrong. I&#x27;m not sure there aren&#x27;t significant second order effects. With so many meteorologists, maybe the US becomes the world&#x27;s capital of TV weather people. Maybe because of that, new weather companies are formed and new opportunities arise for those original 200. This really seems to be what has happened in the technology industry.<p>And for the humanity of the H1B program. I&#x27;m mixed...<p>The worst parts about being in the H1B program: uncertainty,  stamping process, delays, the constant fear of losing a job and being kicked out within weeks - serve no benefit at all for any side.<p>But to my most controversial thought which I have no data to support. I see many H1B workers who feel entitled to so much from the US without feeling any sense of gratefulness back to the US. Unlike many of our Grandparents who immigrated here and who seemed to feel grateful for their new country - I get the feeling many H1B workers+current immigrants are here just because it&#x27;s a good place to make some cash. They don&#x27;t take the time to appreciate what this country is and what it has given them. Maybe that&#x27;s fair given that the H1B program also seems to view them as temporary labor.<p>To the H1B holders who have been here for years, had children here, bought a house and just yearn to be part of the American dream - I&#x27;m sorry our country hasn&#x27;t given you the stability that you desired when you arrived.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flcdatacenter.com&#x2F;OesQuickResults.aspx?area=16980&amp;code=15-1132&amp;year=21&amp;source=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flcdatacenter.com&#x2F;OesQuickResults.aspx?area=1698...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flcdatacenter.com&#x2F;OesQuickResults.aspx?area=41860&amp;code=15-1132&amp;year=21&amp;source=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flcdatacenter.com&#x2F;OesQuickResults.aspx?area=4186...</a>')
