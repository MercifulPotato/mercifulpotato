The fact that I&#x27;ll stay powered up when everyone else is black is important in rural areas even on-grid. The fact that you know your power is green.<p>It also ignores the possibility that energy costs will go up over those 10 years. Essentially you are fixing your energy costs indefinitely.<p>Of course I&#x27;m not-quite normal kind of guy regardless. I paid too much for a very efficient house. I own my house. I own my cars.
