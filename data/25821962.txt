How could this be? It was wall-to-wall people all day -- many in tours that would sometimes just stop in the middle of a narrow corridor. We realized what this and all the other articles about Venice tourism describe -- that most tourists only come for the day.<p>The evenings and nights there were the best part of the day -- not only because the temp dropped, and the light was beautiful -- but because it became an entire different city without the droves of people. It became trivial to sit down at random restaurants and find quiet.<p>It&#x27;s a good start they&#x27;re going to start charging for entry to the island for the sake of the residents and preserving the city. Though not sure they need all this infra for tracking within the island itself to accomplish their goals.')
