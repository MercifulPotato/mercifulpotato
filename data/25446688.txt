My complaint was the lack of a real plan.  They left the states to fend for themselves without the level of guidance, coordination, or financial support that was needed for a proper response.<p>&gt;State governments have the power to pay people to stay home. They might have to shift funding from other areas or raise taxes in order to do so.<p>Most states are run on a deficit and several states are already near bankruptcy.  There simply isn&#x27;t a capability at the state level to have the type of financial response that is possible at the federal level with its ability to print money.')
