I can elaborate.<p>Some of it are technical choices Apple has made that make things hard. I like tiling window managers. The best (only?) one for OSX now requires you to go disable SIP to use it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;koekeishiya&#x2F;yabai&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Disabling-System-Integrity-Protection" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;koekeishiya&#x2F;yabai&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Disabling-System-I...</a> -- this wouldn&#x27;t be the case if Apple cared at all to support these sorts of use-cases, but they don&#x27;t, so it suffers collateral damage from their attempts to improve security. (Again, totally reasonable business choice. Not a ton of people in this boat, but turns me off. Why can&#x27;t I do this by clicking something in system prefs like when I open a downloaded app?)<p>Another one is, as a developer who once worked at a shop that shipped three-os software, their policies relating to macOS licensing are comical. It&#x27;s almost like they don&#x27;t want you to develop for Mac at all unless you&#x27;re going to exclusively develop for Mac. We had moved everything to the cloud, but we still had a room full of stupid mac minis just to run our build farm. Ridiculous. The new news about mac minis in AWS is an ever-so-slight improvement.<p>Some of it is definitely the familiarity you describe. I don&#x27;t want to have to get used to all the weird bsd-ish-but-not-really versions of the common CLI tools. I have no interest in learning apple script, etc. I&#x27;m being fairly obviously hypocritical because I was willing to learn a bunch about obscure config files on linux. But, my experience has often been that things I would be willing to invest to customize on macOS are simply not customizeable.<p>And, hey, perhaps I would&#x27;ve been willing to go through all that were it (reasonably) possible to run OSX on commodity hardware, but as a kid learning programming in the 90&#x27;s macs were damn expensive compared to windows alternatives. So, I grew up on windows. It&#x27;s still true. Today I could afford a Mac Pro, but it&#x27;s a <i>laughable</i> value proposition (easily 3x-5x the cost for equivalent power) compared to building my own linux box (as to the &#x27;your time is money!&#x27; counterargument people sometimes make here - it takes me about 2 hours to build a PC and my linux box hasn&#x27;t panicked or booted improperly once). This used to make sense to me when the OS&#x2F;hardware was more tightly integrated, but I don&#x27;t really see how a macPro is any different than the equivalent PC you could build with the same CPU&#x2F;GPU combos except more expensive and less flexible (admittedly, with a stunning case -- their manufacturing quality is incredible). Maybe they&#x27;ll realize those benefits again with the M1, which is certainly cool.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;ll never forgive them for starting the trend of eliminating 3.5mm jacks on phones.<p>TLDR; You&#x27;re probably right. Macs aren&#x27;t a great choice if you&#x27;re a power user (read: control freak) with your PC.')
