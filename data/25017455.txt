Market makers clearly believe that a Biden presidency and a Republican Senate will get very little done, pass very few new laws, and spend a lot of time quarreling.  This allows the economy to essentially run on auto-pilot, which in a free market system is rather conducive to growth.<p>If however the Senate swings to the Democrats after all the votes are counted, it may be a different story.')
