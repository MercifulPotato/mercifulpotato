This just reads like selection bias. Just drive to work some day, and look at all the cars cooperating so the traffic smoothly flows. They go to work, and cooperate with the people at the workplace, cooperate with their suppliers,  cooperate with their customers, and pretty much everyone they interact with all day, every day.<p>The winner-take-all mentality is in organized sports, which are specifically designed for that, and those are in every country. (And even then the teams have to cooperate with each other, and cooperate with other teams on rules and schedules.) But not much in other activities. Humans would all literally die in short order if we don&#x27;t cooperate.<p>Thought I&#x27;d throw in this thought:<p>Free markets are based on voluntary cooperation.\nSocialism is based on forced cooperation. I can&#x27;t even think of a functioning system based on non-cooperation.')
