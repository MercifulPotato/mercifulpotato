However:<p>- There are over 3,000 emojis defined in unicode, which is a very large vocabulary in which to become expert.<p>- There is no well-defined meaning for any of the emojis, even the &quot;simple&quot; common ones.  One must try to infer from shared context what the sender means.  This is fraught with error opportunities.<p>- They mean different things to different subgroups, and act as an &quot;in-group&quot; credential in many cases.<p>- They are visually very indistinct, and can be difficult to distinguish one from another for people who have less than perfect vision, or color-blindness.<p>- For people with autism or other non-neurotypical processing they can be completely unintelligible, rendering the communication even less successful than &quot;traditional&quot; language.<p>In short, emojis are undefined, colloquial, designed for only a small portion of the population, and have constantly shifting interpretations of a vast dictionary of symbols.<p>I don&#x27;t know why that&#x27;s a good idea for improving the clarity of communication.')
