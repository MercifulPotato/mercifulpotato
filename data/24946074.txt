To repeat, a <i>blind</i> speedrun of a very old boxing game. The level of skill and dedication that those runners have is just astonishing. In some strange way, it really makes you reevaluate the limits we humans have, and how they aren&#x27;t anywhere close to where you think they actually are. It&#x27;s a heck of an achievement.
