Item(by='wolverine876', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610344359, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25711827, text='&gt; In general Wikipedia does have mechanisms to deal with this sort of thing, but admins don&#x27;t always catch on early enough.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that it works, but regardless, &#x27;not early enough&#x27; is effectively not at all. It&#x27;s like the U.S. Justice Department&#x27;s antitrust suit against Microsoft - Netscape and others were long out of business. &#x27;Justice delayed is justice denied.&#x27;<p>The comment below by arp242 demonstrates it: There was a massive campaign on the lacrosse players&#x27; behalf and if the campaign succeeds, it becomes circular: That becomes the truth that arp242 believes.<p>There&#x27;s no evidence that the accusations were false (last I knew), they were just never brought to court; she never had her day in court. (What was the defense so worried about?). You know what they tell victims like the person allegedly raped: &#x27;Nobody will believe you. You&#x27;re nothing, we&#x27;re powerful. We can do whatever we want to you.&#x27;. Duke University is a powerful institution; some of the lacrosse players parents were Beltway PR consultants, IIRC. Their position was all over the news; the U.S. Attorney General took a position in a local county DA&#x27;s sexual assault case of no other merit but its publicity. People in power (and on HN) identify with Duke students, not strippers. What will a stripper do in the face of that? Call up her friends in the CNN newsroom? Look at the things DAs do and never get disbarred. What it takes is bringing charges against the powerful. Wikipedia was part of that.')
