With server side rendering of React, we still took advantage of caching the HTML in a CDN like you would with vanilla WP but it was much easier to build our own theme as desired with React.<p>While configuring certain parts of Wordpress was tricky at times, especially because deploying it is at odds with the stateless nature of modern containerized infra. Particularly plug-in installation with WP cli  requirng a DB connection which makes it tough to fully configure your installation at container build time. I still think it struck a balance between developer experience and a good experience for the content team.')
