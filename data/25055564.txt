One thing that would be awesome to try would be doing this with the House of Representatives in the US.<p>Basically, one registered voter would be randomly chosen from each congressional district. They would be obligated to serve for the 2 year term and paid the current salary of a member of Congress ($174,000&#x2F;year). They would never be part of the lottery again after 1 term.<p>I think this could have a lot of benefits in terms of reducing partisanship and reducing the effects of money in politics as you would have 1&#x2F;3 of the US Government that was not dependent on campaign contributions.')
