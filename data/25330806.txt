There are some ugly parts, especially if you&#x27;re not used to writing C, but it predates Android by decades and is extremely stable.<p>&gt; Java vs C++, meh, I think the main idea is that Java is a better language for most people than C++.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make Java it a good choice for a foundation. C++ wouldn&#x27;t be a good choice either. The right choice is something like C. The 99% of programmers that never touch C still rely 100% on the 1% that do.<p>&gt; Low-power is kind of a bad argument and pre-mature optimization without real metrics.<p>There&#x27;s no such thing &quot;pre-mature optimization&quot; when rolling out a major software platform. You can&#x27;t fix fundamental performance issues after-the-fact.<p>The first Android devices were borderline unusable, because of too little RAM. Today, Android devices have twice as much RAM as iOS devices, and generally poorer battery life. Fast garbage collection requires twice as much RAM. RAM uses battery. All of that was entirely predictable.')
