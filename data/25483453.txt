I&#x27;m comfortable going for long walks outside alone with my thoughts, even if its far too cold. But the cold, or the sunlight, or the breeze is all stimulation. Being alone in a room for a period with no task to accomplish - or to not accomplish - without stimuli is definitely less comfortable.')
