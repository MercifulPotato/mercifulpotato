It&#x27;s to find the people who are willing to spend hundreds of unpaid hours grinding leetcode. The thought process is that you only need two things to become a successful developer. Baseline critical thinking skills and the willingness to spend 60 hours a week reading up on best practices. If you can pass leetcodes interviews you&#x27;ve probably got both those.
