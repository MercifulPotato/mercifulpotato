Item(by='chrischen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610340545, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25712406, text='I think to some degree Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter being as successful they are in their verticals and also being fairly progressive is not a coincidence. They have to attract the best talent in the world, which will not only be people that come from different races, but also sexual orientations, religions, genders, and more. You take the beliefs generally being espoused on Parler and some of that is fundamentally antithetical to the progressive ideologies that even allow these companies to be leading players in their fields. Describing these companies as monopolies is unfair because most of them are simply doing work miles ahead of competitors (Apple for example). Choosing to be tolerant isn&#x27;t an arbitrary choice. It&#x27;s probably at the core of their success. So even if a conservative ecosystem pops up to support Parler I believe the reason it doesn&#x27;t exist already is because of the lack of talent. Same reason why so many smart Jewish scientists left Nazi Germanyâ€”intolerance leaves a lot of value and talent on the table, which is what you will need to outcompete others.')
