Item(by='vkou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602626016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24770556, text='&gt; - Unions add more politics to an already increasingly political environment. I don&#x27;t want to spend an hour or more every month in a meeting to vote on stuff I usually don&#x27;t care about.<p>Would you prefer these decisions to be made unilaterally, without any input from you? Because that&#x27;s the status quo. If you are happy with these decisions being made unilaterally, don&#x27;t vote. If you aren&#x27;t, you have more of a lever than you do without a union.<p>&gt; - Unions cost money, and while 200$&#x2F;2 weeks (which is what one big union in my country charges) might seem reasonable to you, I don&#x27;t like being forced to do anything.<p>I&#x27;m assuming most of that money is going into a strike fund. Having a strike budget makes your negotiating position much stronger, just like how if you don&#x27;t live paycheck to paycheck, <i>your</i> negotiating position is much stronger.<p>If most of that money goes into administrative expenses, you may want to consider voting to reduce those expenses.<p>&gt; Unions make it harder to fire under performing employees.<p>Unions require management to follow a <i>process</i> to fire employees, under-performing or otherwise. My wife worked in a union for 8 years, and plenty of poorly performing employees were fired during that time. The difference is that they weren&#x27;t fired arbitrarily. You&#x27;d appreciate protection from that, if you were to ever be fired for political, personal, retaliatory, or just purely fabricated reasons.<p>If your management can&#x27;t figure out how to document how an employee is underperforming, and to give them notice to shape up, I&#x27;m not sure your management can be trusted with <i>anything</i>.<p>&gt; - Unions usually end up with rules regarding who gets promoted and who doesn&#x27;t. Broke your back working OT to help out the company? Well tough luck Martha came in one month before you and has priority on promotions.<p>Did the union make those rules, or did management make those rules in an effort to control costs, and then blame it on the union?<p>Unions are democratic, by the way. If you don&#x27;t like tenure-based promotion, vote to change it. You have no such recourse with a manager who arbitrarily promotes people they like.')
