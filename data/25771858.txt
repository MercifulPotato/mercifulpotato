Item(by='jFriedensreich', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610597333, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25769759, text=': ) Don&#x27;t get me started on LiveView, i was only talking about mimicking rails mixins with the &quot;use&quot; macro in phoenix.<p>But now that you ask: The LiveView Idea to use websockets in general purpose web applications to achieve &quot;reactivity&quot; is an abomination, we have SSE and HTTP2 and also SPAs for that matter, which are from an operational and reasoning standpoint 1000% simpler and actually made for this kind of thing.<p>Websockets are for things like multiplayer shooters or collaborative drawing, why would someone think it is appropriate to use it to react to clicking a button.')
