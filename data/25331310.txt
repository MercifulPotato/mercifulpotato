Item(by='account42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607342133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25313863, text='isatty and checking for TERM=dumb are sensible (as well as flags to enable&#x2F;disable colors). Terminfo however is a meh depencency and since common tools (e.g. git) don&#x27;t bother either there is no point in anything beyond that.')
