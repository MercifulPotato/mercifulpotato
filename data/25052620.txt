Item(by='heisenbergs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605045735, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25051550, text='Apple clearly has an edge when it comes to silicon that others just won&#x27;t be able to replicate anytime soon. From a cost perspective, just eliminating 4-5 chips by utilizing a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) allows them to create much simpler logic boards whilst saving hundreds of dollars. Not to mention saving the intel tax or being burdened by intel&#x27;s lack of progress.<p>The big question remaining is how is this going to scale further up the mac pro line-up? I&#x27;d imagine a chiplet like architecture similar to AMDs zen3 is the way forward. But will they go all the way to 64 CPUs and beyond? Or will they just stick to a single SoC chip?<p>What cadence will they upgrade these chips with? I&#x27;d expect something closer to what the ipad has done with the AX chips, ie every 2 years. Questions.<p>Very interesting times. I want one, badly, just to have more than the meagre 2-4 hours of realistic batterly life i get on my 2017 MBP.')
