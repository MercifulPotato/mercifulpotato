We provide an API that lets developers quickly enable audit logging within their apps.<p>At previous gigs, I&#x27;ve had to either implement audit logging from scratch or integrate my service with preexisting internal solutions. Typically, a table within the primary DB would be used (leading to space issues), search would be slow or non-existent (can&#x27;t search - won&#x27;t use), or there would be little to no documentation on how to best utilize the tooling.<p>Despite these shortfalls, I saw the benefits of having audit logging in place. Customers could keep an eye on the activity occurring within their account, customer support could root-cause customer issues quicker, and product&#x2F;engineering teams could gauge feature adoption.<p>I built AuditAPI to scratch my own itch â€” to simplify the process of both storing and retrieving audit events.<p>I&#x27;d love to get your feedback, answer any questions, and hear your ideas. Thanks for your time!')
