I can relax in the comfort of my own home (#BothemSean and #AtatianaJefferson). I can ask for help after being in a car crash (#Jonathan Ferrell and #RenishaMcBride). I can have a cellphone (#StephonClark). I can leave a party to get to safety (#JordanEdwards). I can play loud music (#JordanDavis). I can sell CDs (#AltonSterling). I can sleep (#AiyanaJones). I can walk from the corner store (#MikeBrown).<p>Who really says this?<p>Michael Brown could&#x27;ve had a regular visit to the store too. Instead, he chose to brazenly steal whatever he wanted and waltzed out despite the owner&#x27;s protestations, strutted down the middle of the street with his stolen goods, wrestled a pistol from the attending police officer and discharged a shot in the struggle, and then - having made a little distance in his getaway - chose to turn around and charge at the officer even as he demanded cooperation.<p>Arbery could&#x27;ve had a pleasant jog too. Instead he chose to enter a stranger&#x27;s house, flee when confronted by concerned neighbours, and very nearly wrestle away his firearm - and we all know how that would&#x27;ve ended - creating a life or death situation for the good Samaritan.<p>Why, if this is such a terrible phenomenon, must we lie to create martyrs? I don&#x27;t even disagree with the scourge of brutality, especially having seen a 17 year old White boy shot and killed by police today in a welfare check. But why is it so common in the BLM movement to rally behind violent criminals on the receiving end of justifiable responses? I understand the black incentives for doing so, but why are Whites perpetuating these myths so enthusiastically? Why aren&#x27;t they rioting for the White victims instead of (or at the very least, <i>as well as</i>) these black thugs?')
