One of my best friends told me recently he has about 150 vending machines(in the sf bay area), he is the silent partner, providing capitol and his other partner does the stocking and collecting&#x2F;refilling of coinage. I didn&#x27;t want to pry into how much he was making but after reading this article it seems like it could be a lucrative side business for a non tech employee. (he is a manager primarily(non-tech)). There must be a number of machines that would be a limit where taking on additional workers&#x2F;partners ceases to make it a profitable venture.')
