And of course it&#x27;s possible they may decide to attack Taiwan if it were attempted. It&#x27;s also possible that not doing so _guarantees_ an attack by China. It&#x27;s all a balance of probabilities. One could very well rationally decide the likelihood of China attacking Taiwan decreases by putting a base there. I&#x27;m not saying that conclusion is guaranteed correct, or that you should agree with it, but you should have the intellectual honestly to admit it&#x27;s possible. Pretending such an act is lunacy is ridiculous.')
