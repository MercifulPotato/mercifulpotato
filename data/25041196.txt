But I can make something good tasting at home - one of the better ones has brown rice and chickpeas as the main ingredients.<p>I&#x27;m going to guess McDonald&#x27;s veggie burgers will have a decent amount of processing: I don&#x27;t know how that compares to processing hamburger patties. We are, after all, comparing hamburger patties to pucks of veggie material instead of veggie burgers vs steak.')
