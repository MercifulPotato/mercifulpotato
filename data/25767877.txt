Actually, I tried via rclone from VPSs at various locations also and no change. Frankly, that&#x27;s shit. I&#x27;ve been paying the 2â‚¬&#x2F;month 100GB storage plan simply because the OneDrive Android app does its job of offloading photos quickly well but that&#x27;s really it&#x27;s good for. That, and uploading 100K-1M Office documents.<p>As soon as I noticed this issue, the deal of 1TB storage with a O365 subscription also went sour. 1TB I can&#x27;t really use -- no deal.<p>This problem is well known; it&#x27;s all over the internet -- OneDrive is a sloth. It doesn&#x27;t affect downloads, btw.')
