If one is not present, you simply cannot[^1] instruct a Haskell program to perform those operations in a type safe way even if you give it a valid database connection identifier.<p>[1] Well, you can, but if you do you&#x27;re explicitly taking away all the safeguards that Haskell introduces, and it would never pass code review.')
