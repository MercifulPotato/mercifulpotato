We&#x27;re working on solving the problems described in the post.<p>We&#x27;re investing considerable effort into making it easier for researchers to find and consume scientific literature. Our team is made up of engineers and researchers who have felt the pain points firsthand and are very motivated to design and build solutions that fix them. Our software is free to use, and always will be.<p>Our search engine uses things like citation intent, citation influence, and figure and table extraction to make filtering through papers easier. Weâ€™re also currently prototyping an augmented reading experience that aims to embed contextual information directly into the reading experience so that it&#x27;s easier to consume and comprehend academic literature.
