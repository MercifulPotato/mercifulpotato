This seems more like a WSJ employee hired their &quot;Special&quot; child to produce this report. Are care homes even allowing new residents in at this time? I guess it would be a good way to guage Grandma&#x27;s strength...&quot;how wany people does it take to pry her out of the car and drag her into the home!&quot;<p>The truth is, families were already bathing, feeding and otherwise taking care of loved ones that were in these warehouses. When they were locked out and prevented from &quot;Visiting&quot;, the staff that had downloaded their jobs to the families were overwhelmed and unable to do the full amount of work required of them, people started dying because of it.<p>If and when the KooFoo ends there needs to be investigations into, and reform of these so called &quot;Care&quot; homes.')
