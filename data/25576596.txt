Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25578748], score=None, time=1609286068, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25576519, text='<i>&gt; Once you see it as a religious war it&#x27;s by far the best analogy to understand the dynamics, at least to me</i><p>If &quot;religious war&quot; means a sectarian war, in which both sides are believers, just believers in different sects (often different only in details so minor that outsiders can&#x27;t even see what the fuss is about), then I agree. I&#x27;m not aware, historically, of anything called a &quot;religious war&quot; that <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> a sectarian war in that sense.<p>This might just be a difference in terminology. However, it might not. If you think one of the sides in the &quot;religious war&quot; we are talking about is &quot;unbelievers&quot;, then we disagree on something of substance. &quot;Unbelievers&quot; in this context would mean people who just think we should have free speech, period; that <i>nobody</i> should be suppressed simply because of what they are saying. But, as I said in my previous comment, I don&#x27;t think either side in the current &quot;religious war&quot; meets this criterion; both sides agree that <i>some</i> speech should be suppressed, they just disagree on exactly <i>which</i> speech.<p>Note that this applies not just to the particular &quot;dustup&quot; referenced in the open letter, but to the larger &quot;cold war&quot; you describe. Nobody is fighting for free speech, period. The different sides are just fighting for different rules about what can be suppressed. One side&#x27;s rules currently seem a lot more draconian than the other&#x27;s, but both sides want <i>some</i> such rules.')
