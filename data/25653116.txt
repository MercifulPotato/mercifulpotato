I would build little carnival games that had all kinds of conditional branches, plus rovers and walking robots with complicated gear trains. I think playing with gears set my mind up for building programs more than dragging the block based if statements on the screen.<p>I can also recommend the classic book &quot;Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas&quot; by Seymour Papert, it talks about the LOGO turtle and has some really powerful ideas about empathy in general, with a special case for thinking from the perspective of a machine.')
