First of all is the assumption that people shouldn&#x27;t work if they&#x27;re not out to earn a full-time living from that work. This view is typical of posh Americans who went to nice universities, had snazzy internships, and are now happily working full time.<p>It gleefully ignores those who need to start lower, and get entry level experience. Indeed, it is actively hostile to entire classes of people working.<p>A retiree who wants a little extra money. A high school kid from some gang-afflicted neighborhood, one who isn&#x27;t going to college, but could benefit some low-key job in a restaurant, one that would keep him out of trouble, and get him a start for when he graduates. An ex-convict who&#x27;s just spent five years in prison under one of Biden&#x27;s drug laws, who could use a steady job to show his next employer he&#x27;s hard working and didn&#x27;t steal from work. An immigrant with marginal English language skills. That one girl I knew in school whose entire family was afflicted by a serious case of lead poisoning.<p>Now there&#x27;s sure to be some sort of whining to the effect that some of these people need to be supported directly, but suppose they are -- why would that deny them the right to work?<p>Of course the cynical part of the political apparatus has absolutely no use for these people, since they don&#x27;t vote, they don&#x27;t campaign, they compete with the labor unions, and they&#x27;re not always interested in sitting around and doing nothing on the government dime. They&#x27;re useless in the revolution.<p>Oh, and of course the other thing! is that it helps draw attention away from the other big problem: a broken housing policy that has produced sky-high rents in so many major cities. Why fix that problem when you can make a new set of problems instead? One is hard work, and the other earns you praise as compassionate.')
