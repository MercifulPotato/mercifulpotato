Your notebooks are run on a much beefier machine than when you&#x27;re in interactive mode. You won&#x27;t have the problem of a training job where you don&#x27;t get the result because of a lost connection.<p>- Automatic model detection and saving, parameter&#x2F;metrics tracking<p>- One click model deployment<p>- Multiple notebook checkpoints (revert back and forth to previous saved versions)<p>Caveat emptor: as you may notice, we&#x27;re not focusing on embellishing notebooks as we believe, from what we have experienced, that the fact machine learning projects take a long time is not for lack of beautiful stylesheets. We&#x27;ll tackle these problems at a later time.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai</a><p>- [1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;learnmachinelearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;je0pmv&#x2F;learn_machine_learning_on_ikoai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;learnmachinelearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;je0pm...</a>')
