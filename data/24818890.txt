I experience that with Firefox only when I use Windows (i.e. almost never, fortunately). I switched to Firefox on my main computer (Linux) a year ago and I could not be happier. It consumes much less memory than Chrome, it&#x27;s <i>way</i> faster (that&#x27;s my impression, I haven&#x27;t measured that in any way) and it is a lot more customizable. I removed a lot of stuff from the context menu for example.<p>As a bonus, it isn&#x27;t made by Google. I was a hardcore Google fan a few years ago, but after seeing what they are doing with Chrome and the internet, I just could not keep using Chrome any longer.')
