It depicted recommendation algorithms as three evil scheming clones, interspersed with a skit showing a family with the worst case of social media addiction the writers could imagine.

I don&#x27;t think many people would explicitly endorse the claim that social media addiction is so bad, preteens can&#x27;t last half an hour before smashing open locked boxes to get a hit - but that&#x27;s what the movie showed!')
