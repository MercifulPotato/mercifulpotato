They are just another way to build an analog computer -- better for machine learning, worse for classical ODEs.<p>But we have not used analog computers for 50 years, and for a good reason -- they are not reproducible, their accuracy is very process dependent and has a hard upper limit, and they are often tuned for a single function.<p>Would people want a chip which is basically unpredictable -- the performance can vary up by tens of %, they have to be re-trained periodically to prevent data loss, and there is no way to load pre-trained network? I doubt it. Maybe there is an extremely narrow use case, but I do not see it in the mainstream devices.')
