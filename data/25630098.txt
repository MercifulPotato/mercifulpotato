Item(by='imbnwa', descendants=None, kids=[25630750], score=None, time=1609760551, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25629653, text='&gt; Idris Elba does an excellent job, but it’s a little easier for him since he’s given the most slang and dialect to use.<p>Strangely, most of the significant characters in the drug trade are missing a Baltimore accent. I&#x27;m not really sure what accent Idris Elba is going for though it sounds vaguely New York City, while Method Man clearly sounds like a New Yorker when his character is from Baltimore. Wood Harris, who played Stringer&#x27;s partner Avon Barksdale, sounds like he&#x27;s from Chicago. The only ones speaking in a Baltimore accent are Proposition Joe, Slim Charles, and Snoop Pearson.')
