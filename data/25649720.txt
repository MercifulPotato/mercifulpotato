This problem is likely to get worse as time goes by, as people move on from projects and things become unmaintained.<p>One option is to fork the packaging at one level and then take on maintenance yourself (e.g. creating&#x2F;maintaining docker images) but then ofc you have all the work of doing that yourself.<p>Another option (in theory) could be someone selling a service of maintained, updated, scanned images&#x2F;helm charts, but I&#x27;ve not seen previous efforts in this area be hugely successful...<p>hopefully the OSSF will come up with some good solutions in this space, but it&#x27;s fundamentally a time consuming thing to  fix and maintain.')
