I think the reason it took a few quarters to figure this out, and why most folks are bad at sales is that they don’t know what sales is. They don’t <i>really</i> know.<p>Sales is the very intimate act of getting a stranger to reach into their pocket and give you their money. To do that the customer has to balance their priorities and desires and make a difficult personal decision. This might mean having less money to feed themselves with (figuratively or literally).<p>There are a number of ways you can go about this but in the end it’s very personal to the buyer, whether it is in-fact their money or not. Corporate software sales are just as personal, if not more.<p>So how do you get a stranger to give you their money? You can hustle them, fool them, pressure them, befriend them, help them, be a human vending machine for what you both know they already want, you can help them find what <i>they</i> want, you can do so many things, but just showing off how great <i>you</i> are isn’t likely to work very often. Showing off how great you are is called marketing and that’s a whole other discussion.')
