And of course with them there&#x27;s no way to stop it either for most of their properties, as they&#x27;re 100% web based.<p>Plus, in the excerpt you&#x27;re quoting the say they stopped logging IP address for dev tests -- logging those (and more) are par for the course in all kinds of debug environments (from MS, Oracle, etc.), that Apple doesn&#x27;t anymore is probably impressive.')
