For the annual reviews I just had a script that loaded a TeX template from the past review then populated it from the flagged entries in my weeky reports.  Then I&#x27;d just edit it down a bit, tweak the language and sent it out.  In theory I could have probably gotten away with sending the autogenerated one at least after I&#x27;d refined the usage some.<p>I did it this way because it&#x27;s always hard to <i>start</i> writing a performance review. But I found it a lot easier to start with a bunch of stuff I did and restrict it down to the relevant stuff.<p>I was tickled when they later updated the job description for my role and used the text from my performance review.  I guess since I didn&#x27;t have to spend much time populating it I managed to completely optimize the level of corporate-speak in my narrative. :)')
