One of our maintainers wrote the following on his personal blog:<p>&quot;It sounds horrible: &quot;UN peacekeepers accused of child rape in South Sudan.&quot; But the article makes it pretty clear that the &quot;children&quot; involved were not children. They were teenagers.<p>What about &quot;rape&quot;? Was this really rape? Or did they have sex willingly, and prudes want to call it &quot;rape&quot; to make it sound like an injustice? We can&#x27;t tell from the article which one it is.<p>Rape means coercing someone to have sex. Precisely because that is a grave and clear wrong, using the same name for something much less grave is a distortion.&quot;<p>He&#x27;s clearly a pedophile! How could the project be agnostic about something like this? Clearly he both endorses and encourages rape of children! (Even though there were no children involved in the story in the first place)')
