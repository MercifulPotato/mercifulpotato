You do not need to be a rockstar, and you don&#x27;t need to work more than 40 hours&#x2F;week for that (though that can depend on team, I&#x27;ve never encountered one that regularly asks for more than that).<p>If you&#x27;re talking finances, Google&#x2F;Facebook will pay you more, with less risk, and better work life balance than pretty much all startups. There are entirely justifiable reasons to prefer a startup, but you should take a second look at your calculations if you think finances come out favorable on the startup side.')
