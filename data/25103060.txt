You&#x27;d be surprised how often, especially with a few hints, go &quot;hmm.. I guess a PR wouldn&#x27;t be too hard and it be nice to contribute&quot;. And quite a few of these end up being repeat contributors, since a second PR is way easier than the first.<p>It also sends a signal: there&#x27;s a gazillion things that could be improved about this project. Unless there is a contributor that is willing to make a PR, it is likely not going to happen.<p>And I spend a larger percentage of my time doing code review, which (as the BDFL) is more effective use of my time anyway.')
