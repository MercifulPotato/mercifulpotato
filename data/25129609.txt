If you have a single server, what is K8S going to give you over say, a single static binary or a docker container?<p>K8S on a single node does nothing for you network-wise, you have no overlay network (because there is nothing to overlay) you have no ingress or egress (there is only 1 node so no matter what you &#x27;configure&#x27; your ingress and egress will be that same node), and it&#x27;s unlikely to have enough resources to do something like a full application deployment with some big helm chart.<p>While I agree that you can (ab)use K8S as a runtime and packaging format, all of those big benefits are removed when you are running it on 1 node, except perhaps the fact that you can talk to the apiserver and define your jobs&#x2F;tasks&#x2F;pods the same way. But even then you&#x27;d only do that locally, because &#x27;testing&#x27; in a dev or staging env that doesn&#x27;t match prod is going to give you non-representative results.')
