I have to say, I love the support the community gives to small makers (who are often solving small but substantial problems).<p>My question is, do you consciously choose an indie maker over a larger software company? If you do, is this because you can often reach the founder of the SaaS you are using to solve problems you might experience in a product or is there another reason?<p>I&#x27;ve started to see this behaviour in myself (maybe because I am trying to be one). I&#x27;d love to hear from you all.')
