This is something that I see very few drivers talk about but influences your earnings significantly.<p>Depreciation is a real cost. If at the time you sell your car your car, you get $X, but driving for Uber caused you to have more miles and thus sell for $X-$Y, then Y is real cost. Even if you don&#x27;t sell your car and instead drive your it into the ground, the extra miles you&#x27;re driving for Uber cause your car to fail faster.<p>I get the sense that many part time drivers think they&#x27;re making money when instead they&#x27;re losing it (or maybe making less than minimum wage after expenses).')
