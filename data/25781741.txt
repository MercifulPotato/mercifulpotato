People are capable of fraud. It’s just a matter of scale.<p>There’s more poor people than rich people, the multiple being pure head count. Rich people’s multiple is wealth. Both have a multiple handy to magnify the fraud.<p>If we all do fraud, via our multiples, you will see the outcome. So for example, yes everyone in India is poor, and apparently happy to be called uneducated, so let’s absolve them of having to follow basic traffic laws - all of them. At scale, you get whatever you see about traffic in India on YouTube.<p>We cannot be emotional or tit for tat over things that can be misused at scale, no matter our inclinations to think ‘oh but rich people have infinite loss carry over, so what if every normal American abuses federal aid’. At scale, we see the rotten results.<p>——-<p>Small aside, this is why I never got diversity based voting. It’s almost as if people can’t accept that a woman or minority could be greedy too. That those alternatives are immune from corruption. We are people, it’s the same across the board.<p>——-<p>I have close people to me that collect checks from the government. Perfectly healthy and in working condition. Is it right or wrong? I don’t know. I just know that if 300 million Americans did the exact same shit it would be problem, just like those traffic jams in India.')
