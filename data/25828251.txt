The idea was that if it will be super easy for companies to do reverse auctions and use them to buy material they will save a lot of money (proven concept in those who actually used it).<p>But what we learned after some time was it didn&#x27;t matter. Because people in the companies responsible for buying material didn&#x27;t really care for how much they buy it. They care that they call their favourite supplier have a nice chat and then order whatever they need. And those suppliers throw some &quot;gifts&#x2F;rewards&quot; to the package here and there. And without appraisal of those people the business owner never said yes.<p>The thing was that those people who effectively decided if they will use it or not didn&#x27;t benefited from it at all.<p>We haven&#x27;t lost so much money on that, but the lesson learned was huge.')
