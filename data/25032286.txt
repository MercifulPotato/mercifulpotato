Too much paid work or no more JavaScript, who knows.<p>I&#x27;ve been offered to take over the development and maintenance of a small Ruby gem many years ago. I think I contributed a patch or something. I needed that gem in my current Rails project, probably not in the next one. Furthermore I don&#x27;t work only with Ruby. So I refused.<p>Something like faker is useful in nearly every project and I contributed to the Elixir faker (my customer agreed to that, we needed it.) I learned a couple of things of the Elixir environment in the process. By the way, nice team and great tooling. Would I take over that package if offered? Again no, because I don&#x27;t use Elixir full time and I&#x27;d rather drop another contribution whenever I need it. No time to work on fixes and look at issues not related to my work.')
