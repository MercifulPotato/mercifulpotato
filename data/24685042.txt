Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601878608, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24682849, text='&gt; IP is one of the very few areas wherein smaller companies can have any hope of leverage over larger ones.<p>Leverage over another isn&#x27;t the only way to compete.<p>If there was no IP, smaller companies would have alternatives such as blatantly copying the larger companies&#x27; better product features, while being nimbler to innovate with those ideas, and to blend features from different companies into a new product.<p>Not every small company would be good at that.  But some would.  <i>Some</i> smaller companies would have more ability to out-innovate incumbents.<p>Of course that already happens, but it could happen more freely without IP.<p>The smaller companies would still have the problem of being noticed, selling their products, and getting investor interest (which I&#x27;m told IP helps with), but those problems aren&#x27;t new.')
