Moving to Germany feels a bit like they pretend to keep &quot;tax rates&quot; low by splitting out various things and making it &quot;not a tax&quot;. In the Netherlands I had income tax and that was it, from that the govt just pays development aid and old age money (AOW) as needed. Here, you have church tax (if your parents signed you up for that party), new states support, broadcast fee, pension contribution, and probably more I&#x27;m forgetting.')
