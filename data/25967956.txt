However, it&#x27;s approach to native GUI development is pretty good, the language itself seems pretty okay and the compilation times are generally pretty good, as is performance ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;which-programs-are-fastest.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;...</a> ).<p>Perhaps the only actual dealbreaker i can think of, is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have that many stable or even first party web development frameworks&#x2F;libraries ( the closest i&#x27;ve found to that being <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freepascal.org&#x2F;fpWeb_Tutorial" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freepascal.org&#x2F;fpWeb_Tutorial</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freepascal.org&#x2F;fcl-web" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.freepascal.org&#x2F;fcl-web</a> ), however they don&#x27;t seem to be as popular as the &quot;de facto&quot; frameworks of the other languages. For example, Java has Spring (and Spring Boot), Node has Express, Python has Django (or even Flask), Ruby has Rails, .NET Core has ASP.NET Core, which are all widely supported and well documented, with plenty of tutorials.<p>Of course, that has only been my limited experience, since i mostly work with the other alternatives at my workplace and only dabble in Pascal occasionally in my free time. Would anyone care to comment on their experience with modern Pascal as well?')
