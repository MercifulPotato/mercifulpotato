The firewall was only ever touched when doing something advanced and even people who were doing things like setting up home servers and such rarely had to deal with it.<p>Every single tutorial on the topic is IPv4-specific and until IPv6 isn&#x27;t more common, people will not write guides and tutorials with IPv6 in mind. So until the knowledge of proper security on open networks is common enough among home tinkerers, we should not be recommending people just throw everything straight onto the open Internet.')
