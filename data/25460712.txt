However, there is some disagreement on measuring taxes on the rich in the literature. First, there  is  no  consensus  on  which  taxes  to  look  at.  Whilst  some  authors look  at  taxes  on personal income (Egger et al., 2019; Rubolino and Waldenström, 2020), others focus on corporate taxation (Devereux et al., 2002) or inheritance taxation (Piketty and Saez, 2013b). Second, economists have used different tax policy indicators. Some look at top marginal income tax rates (Piketty et al., 2014), while others look at effective tax rates (Egger et al., 2019) or revenue generation (Baunsgaard and Keen, 2010). We propose an encompassing approach that utilises Bayesian latent variable analysis on a range of different taxes and indicators to overcome these problems. This allows us to detect shared variance across 7 indicators  that  are  commonly  used  proxies  for  taxes  on  the  rich  (see  Table  A1  in  the Appendix). In total, the data cover 18 OECD democracies over 5 decades (1965-2015). We estimate the latent variable using a Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach with  diffuse  normal  priors,  three  MCMC  chains  and  1000  burnin  iterations (for  more information on the estimation of the latent variable, see Hope and Limberg, 2020).</i><p>It&#x27;s likely that professionals have a better grasp of the nuances of empirical tax research than you or I.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprints.lse.ac.uk&#x2F;107919&#x2F;1&#x2F;Hope_economic_consequences_of_major_tax_cuts_published.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprints.lse.ac.uk&#x2F;107919&#x2F;1&#x2F;Hope_economic_consequences...</a>')
