Item(by='whimsicalism', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603152547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831435, text='The NYT article claims that &#x27;the psychologists Peter Gray and Gina Riley published a 2013 survey of about 230 unschooling families, they found “a wide range in terms of socioeconomic strata.”&#x27;.<p>I followed the link and the source is... flimsy at best. The lack of numbers here is conspicuous, especially when combined with the fact that most of the respondents were stay-at-home moms, not something super common among the American working-class.<p>I do not think the rise of this phenomenon is unrelated to the increasing number of affluent, young white parents raising their children in urban cores while remaining afraid of the school system.')
