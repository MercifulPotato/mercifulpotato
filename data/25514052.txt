The Mk 2 is waaay better in almost every way: focus accuracy, no push-pull, better bokeh (marginally) better contrastâ€¦ just better results with less effort. Also a lot more expensive.<p>I have three different TCs which I got from a friend who switched to Sony. I haven&#x27;t really used them much because they seem to drastically change the optic behavior in ways I don&#x27;t like. Maybe I should give them another chance as they never come out of their cases.')
