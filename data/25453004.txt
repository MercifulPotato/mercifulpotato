My grandfather left me his collection of over 7000 books. It was thrown up the attic because I was deemed to young to read some of them. By the time I got my hands on them, they were crumbling due to bad storage and some of them were so old that if you try to fold the edge, it broke..like a biscuit. And then we had a devastating flood and lost it..I tried to dry them and saved about half the collection. A second flood ten years later took away the remaining books.<p>Since then..I can’t bear to throw away even a magazine subscription. I guess that makes me a hoarder.<p>Anyone knows how to break the book hoarding habit? It’s about time I let go of the trauma of the flood damage and water logged books.')
