Item(by='sxp', descendants=None, kids=[25409712, 25409185], score=None, time=1607884659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395934, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kframework.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kframework.org&#x2F;</a> has high level details. It says &quot;K is a rewrite-based executable semantic framework in which programming languages, type systems and formal analysis tools can be defined using configurations, computations and rules. &quot;<p>I was confused by the git repo because I thought the &quot;K&quot; was referring to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;K_(programming_language)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;K_(programming_language)</a> which is a terse APL-style language.')
