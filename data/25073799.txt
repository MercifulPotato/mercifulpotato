Has a different, more urgent beep when it detects a large vehicle like a lorry or a bus, or if a vehicle is travelling at a high speed relative to you.<p>Highly recommend it, haven&#x27;t had any false negatives (obviously I still look over my shoulder, it&#x27;s just nice to know a car&#x27;s coming from a distance away and if they&#x27;re going very fast).')
