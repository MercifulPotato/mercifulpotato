There can be a massive paper trail, and blockchain trail, to prove that too. I&#x27;m not sure I really see a distinction here. It&#x27;s also not impossible to steal, wealth managers do it from time to time, it&#x27;s embezzlement, and the banks make the person whole. It happened to my grandfather: His manager at the bank converted assets to money and took the money. They got caught, and my grandfather got his money back.')
