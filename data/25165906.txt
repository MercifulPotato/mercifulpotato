Item(by='mbesto', descendants=None, kids=[25166925], score=None, time=1605911801, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25165346, text='&gt; It&#x27;s fairly obvious from the outside which companies are &quot;tech&quot; companies.<p>It it though? You&#x27;ll find a bunch of replies here with disagreements about what &quot;tech&quot; companies actually are, so how is that obvious?<p>&gt; But let&#x27;s be honest, you&#x27;re just being pedantic now.<p>And I think you&#x27;re being too obtuse. It&#x27;s one thing to refer to &quot;tech companies&quot; as a general colloquialism (I do), but if you&#x27;re going to try to start counting them, I think the distinction is important. You&#x27;ll find pretty quickly that many companies started in the last 10 years will just call themselves tech companies (Nikola, WeWork, Palantir, etc. come to mind) but have slight variations on revenue generated from software services.<p>My bigger point here, as I&#x27;ve pointed out in other threads is that &quot;tech&quot; isn&#x27;t a market - its an operating model. It&#x27;s one to thing colloquially say &quot;this is a tech company&quot;, but then when someone says &quot;how do we count how many tech companies do X&quot; then we start to get into a whole bunch of grey areas about how to measure something...hence my original comment.<p>&gt; But yes, of course they are a tech company. One of the first.<p>It&#x27;s a bad example, but it&#x27;s still a tech company? I think you just proved my point :)')
