Too many developers use a bunch of tools, and you get the impression that it&#x27;s just for the sake of tooling, or because that&#x27;s how you&#x27;re expected to do things. You can keep scaling a single server and deploying via simple git hooks for years until you need a more fancy setup.<p>Especially for side projects, you want to use the minimum amount of tooling that gets out of your way so you can focus on building a great product. To me, a weekend spent doing auxiliary or unessential stuff like configuring Kubernetes or whatever feels really fatiguing and demotivating when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to work on the project otherwise.')
