It&#x27;s not only those who contributed to the software and made PRs (which is sometimes a surprisingly small number of devs), but the software often only exists because it was taken up by a large number of projects that then created an ecosystem and a userbase around it.<p>Importantly, software is never &quot;finished&quot;, so when the single large company behind a popular open-source project close-sources it, it often means the end of that project as an open-source alternative. It&#x27;s frustrating if for example the existence of that killer open-source project in the past stopped other projects from blossoming.<p>The close-sourcing of several projects has made me cautious nowadays about using software that is backed by a company that exists only around that product.')
