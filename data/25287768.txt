It&#x27;s the whole core of Apple&#x27;s M1 Marketing. It&#x27;s probably the biggest reason why people buy new computers. Lack of speed is the reason I had to throw away my Smart TV after 8 years of useless upgrades.<p>People pay more for faster internet because they want more movies in bigger quality or to download big things faster. Not because they give a crap about your shitty app.<p><i>&gt; Unless you have a performance issue that’s really pathological, speed really doesn’t matter for most applications</i><p>And that&#x27;s only true because developers are constantly forcing hardware developers and customers to throw money at the problem.')
