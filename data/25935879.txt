Check their history and there&#x27;s literally pages of it.<p>I didn&#x27;t appreciate that so I reported it and left.<p>-<p>Lots of people confusing this with not liking WSB.<p>The other WSB discord which was linked to the subreddit was fine even though it was barely moderated. Rough around the edges like WSB tends to be... but fine as a place to hang out and see funny things.<p>-<p>This second server was extreme <i>even by WSB standards</i>.<p>The joke is &quot;4chan found a bloomberg terminal&quot; but really it&#x27;s like Reddit found one... no one is as down right randomly gross or racist as people are on deep end 4chan or Reddit would have banned it a long time.<p>This server was <i>really</i> like if the worst part of 4chan pretended to know what a stock is. It wasn&#x27;t even coherent by WSB standards, and the signal to noise made WSB proper look like an actual Bloomberg Terminal')
