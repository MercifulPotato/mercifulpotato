Also if your startup needs skill and services not available locally that have to be sourced outside thatâ€™s more cost, whereas a company coming in will have to provide those services at its own expense.<p>If local salaries are depressed like that, this implies the outside investment is sorely needed. If there was enough investment available locally and local companies had the resources to hire more workers and were successful enough to pay them well, those salaries would be higher, but the resources to make that happen have to come from somewhere.')
