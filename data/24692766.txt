Therefore it is so much more important to look at your contracts carefully, because they matter so much more.<p>If you don&#x27;t see it then imagine what a true 0% (or around -1%, to account for risk premium) riskfree interest rate across the entire duration means. It means, for example, that it theoretically makes sense to level entire mountains just to create more farmland or to build slightly faster highways because it will pay back over hundreds of years. Imagine negotiating such deals!<p>[1] this is not just my opinion, but also the opinion of 2012 Jerome Powell; you can find it in FOMC transcripts from before he became the chairman of the Fed.')
