Powered off nuclear reactor that sit on top of a lot of fuel, fuel that has many times the explosive power than the explosives that are surrounding the bomb core, can become an atomic bomb.<p>Personally I would prefer such a rocket to lift off from a secluded location way out there in the ocean, in case something goes wrong and becomes an atomic bomb instead. And I like to think that people with common sense think like me as well. Do you personally have common sense?')
