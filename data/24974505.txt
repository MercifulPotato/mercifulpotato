When this happens, everyone wins, even the idiots win as consumers... The pie can only get bigger when you have smart people in charge.<p>An idiot should never be anything more than a consumer, you can&#x27;t put them in charge of investment or production. If an idiot has money, you want to take that money away from them as fast as possible.<p>The system should aim to accelerate the failure of incompetent people, not slow it down.')
