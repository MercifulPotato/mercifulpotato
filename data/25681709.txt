Which is how it&#x27;s done in any of the entertainment systems I&#x27;ve worked on. (I interpret the question to be about direct bus access because something being able to just <i>write</i> to the bus and cause issues is typically what people are concerned about. Obviously the values originally come from the bus, and the data feed can be quite raw)')
