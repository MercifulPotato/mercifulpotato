You&#x27;re clearly confused.<p>What &#x27;2 is Copy&#x27; means precisely that Rust WILL NOT &#x27;introduce pointers where they don&#x27;t need to be&#x27; - 2 is fine to &#x27;alias&#x27; because it&#x27;s a primitive type and so a copy is made when you do that, (i.e. the type implements the &#x27;Copy&#x27; trait). However when you do that with complex types that do not implement Copy, you&#x27;re moving ownership to the new variable so cannot use the old one any more.')
