Item(by='twblalock', descendants=None, kids=[25283333], score=None, time=1606951980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25283147, text='&gt; Here&#x27;s a refutation: Microsoft spends $250k&#x2F;employee&#x2F;year on stock dividends and buybacks. That&#x27;s quite a large slice of the pie the union could negotiate for.<p>Those buybacks increase the stock price, and employees are compensated in stock, so stock buybacks benefit employees already.<p>I find it hard to believe that the company would just give that money as salary instead -- and even if they did, that would mean that employees of some companies are paid way, way more than employees at other companies. That is exactly the situation we have today, without unions! So again, why do employees at large companies need unions, considering they are already paid more than everyone else?<p>Incidentally, I get stock compensation at my job and getting cash instead would have been worse. The stock I was granted has increased in value. Cash is just cash, and loses value to inflation. I would rather have salary plus RSUs than just a large salary. I don&#x27;t know if a union would see the value in that.')
