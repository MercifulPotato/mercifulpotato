The price is clearly too high now, so it makes sense that sophisticated investors (probably other hedge funds) would be entering short positions at the recent prices. And those recent entrants will not be squeezed unless the price goes up by another ludicrous amount, which it is less likely to do now that the initial surge of enthusiasm is running its course. So lots of retail traders who got into the frenzy late with normal stock purchases at these absurd prices will get screwed during the inevitable crash, while the recent shorters will make a killing.')
