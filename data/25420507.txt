It&#x27;s a wacky place we&#x27;re in.  Some of the criticism out there (COVID denial, election fraud, etc) is dangerous, but legitimate criticism and nuanced points are getting crushed too in the process.  And the entities involved in the suppression are powerful, moving in lockstep, and have limited accountability to the public.<p>Worse, these platforms have the illusion of being grassroots and open, but you never know when you&#x27;re getting state-sponsored manipulation or what kinds of content isn&#x27;t permitted to flow through them today.')
