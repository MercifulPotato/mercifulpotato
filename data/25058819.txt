Item(by='npsimons', descendants=None, kids=[25063775], score=None, time=1605106227, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25054806, text='&gt; Doesn&#x27;t Debian sometimes go so far as to split software apart into multiple packages?<p>IMHO, this is the correct thing to do.<p>I&#x27;ve spent a considerable amount of time as both developer and systems adminstrator. Not <i>quite</i> DevOps, but I&#x27;ve been doing both since before that was a term.<p>Programmers don&#x27;t often have that systems level view that is necessary for systems administration. It leads to myopia like this Ubuntu patch, and packaging is usually an afterthought to many programmers. It&#x27;s that difference between a &quot;project&quot; and a &quot;product.&quot;<p>So honestly, complaining that Debian splits things would be like complaining they don&#x27;t deliver tarballs, because back before GitHub, that was how upstream &quot;delivered&quot; &quot;packages&quot; (how many people remember &quot;tar -xzf package.tar.gz &amp;&amp; cd package &amp;&amp; .&#x2F;configure &amp;&amp; make&quot;?). And before you bring up &quot;missing files&quot;, you can do an &quot;apt-file&quot; to search for things and then install the associated package, assuming that it wasn&#x27;t installed already as a Recommended package or in many, many cases, you are using a metapackage which contains the &quot;full&quot; package anyway.')
