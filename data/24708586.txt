One of the biggest reasons international students come to the US is to be able to live and work after graduation. If anything, this will deter international students from studying in the US, thus reducing much needed out-of-state revenue that colleges get from international students, which consequently only raises the costs for in-state students. I see the point of this rule, but I&#x27;d be interested in seeing the tertiary effects of it as well.')
