But it is unfair to use these features and than complain on compile speed or compare it to a language that doesn&#x27;t offer similar feature set.<p>Also, in our Java&#x2F;Scala project it turned out that Scala+Bloop was way faster (10x-100x) at incremental compilation than Java+Gradle. Bloop is based on SBT libraries so there are some things that SBT does right.')
