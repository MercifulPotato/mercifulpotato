We get it, DO did a bad thing solely for their benefit.<p>While we&#x27;re on the topic, let&#x27;s talk of ways Github can ease the load on OSS maintainers for the rest of the year too. Examples:<p>1. (someone else suggested) Mandatory to run linters or pass tests before sending a PR.<p>2. Vacation mode for repos, where all PRs are auto-declined, with a vacation auto-responder message. This is also good for maintainers&#x27; mental health.<p>3. Ability to whitelist contributors who are allowed to send PRs (this might be controversial and against the spirit of Open Source)<p>4. Ability to set a TTL on PRs per-repo. If an owner doesn&#x27;t respond within the TTL, it&#x27;s auto-closed.<p>5. Stop showing commit graphs and the other nonsense that turns committing code into a public performance.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are other suggestions.')
