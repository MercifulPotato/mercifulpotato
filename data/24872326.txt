IIRC, they transitioned rapidly from a two-child policy to a &quot;however many you want&quot; policy because not enough Chinese families chose to have another kid.<p>Anecdotally, it&#x27;s extremely expensive to have a kid in China because the culture is so cut-throat competitive and rankings-obsessed.  If you don&#x27;t provide your kid with a lot of (expensive) extra educational opportunities, he could fall behind.  On the other hand, Chinese culture (compared to Western culture) appears to be much more comfortable with parents playing favorites with their children, but I&#x27;m not sure how much that&#x27;s carried through to the one child generation.')
