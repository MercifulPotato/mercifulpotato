I wholeheartedly agree it simply isn&#x27;t enough, but it is substantially better than what&#x27;s in-use right now.<p>Like everyone else though, I am worried for the same reason I dislike <i>AMP</i> (accelerated mobile pages) despite it bringing noticeably better user-experience for many: Google has this nasty tendency to make things seem more &quot;open&quot;, &quot;benevolent&quot;, and &quot;private&quot; than they really are.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;federated.withgoogle.com&#x2F;#learn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;federated.withgoogle.com&#x2F;#learn</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chromium.org&#x2F;developers&#x2F;design-documents&#x2F;rappor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chromium.org&#x2F;developers&#x2F;design-documents&#x2F;rappor</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20767891" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20767891</a>')
