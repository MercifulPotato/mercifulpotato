But that is a habit of mind that had been developed during nearly a decade of ideological struggle against Fascism. The bulk of the British people, one ought to remember, remained an¦sthetic to that struggle until late into 1940. Abyssinia, Spain, China, Austria, Czechoslovakia — the long series of crimes and aggressions had simply slid past their consciousness or were dimly noted as quarrels occurring among foreigners and “not our business.” One can gauge the general ignorance from the fact that the ordinary Englishman thought of “Fascism” as an exclusively Italian thing and was bewildered when the same word was applied to Germany. And there is nothing in Wodehouse&#x27;s writings to suggest that he was better informed, or more interested in politics, than the general run of his readers.<p>But of course, Roderick Spode in e.g. <i>Code of the Woosters</i> (1938) is a parody of the British fascist Oswald Mosley:<p>&gt; Don&#x27;t you ever read the papers? Roderick Spode is the founder and head of the Saviours of Britain, a Fascist organization better known as the Black Shorts. His general idea, if he doesn&#x27;t get knocked on the head with a bottle in one of the frequent brawls in which he and his followers indulge, is to make himself a Dictator.<p>Orwell&#x27;s point stands, but it&#x27;s just interesting to me in two ways:<p>1) In 1946, you couldn&#x27;t just use Google to search the corpus of Wodehouse books for the string &quot;fascis&quot; to see what turned up.<p>2) I think Code of the Woosters is the most popular Wodehouse novel today, but it must have not been very familiar to Orwell, because Spode is such a key part of the plot, you could hardly miss him.')
