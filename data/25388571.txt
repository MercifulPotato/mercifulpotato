If anything, learning a neighbor&#x27;s language tends to bring people together!<p>I tend to agree, but I also respect the wishes of the various groups. They&#x27;ve undergone experiences at the hands of colonizers that I can&#x27;t begin to imagine, and if they want to try to preserve something of their culture so that it stays in their culture, and not just let any outsider with a passing interest learn it, I support them in that. Though I do wish more were like the Cherokee Nation, which offers free online courses for anyone across various levels of Cherokee, also integrating culture and such.')
