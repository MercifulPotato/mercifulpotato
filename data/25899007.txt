I have limited exposure to CBT, but I used to do research for BJ Fogg. These models are descendents from behavioral psychology, which isn&#x27;t all that great.<p>If habits work as an abstraction for you, great. But in general, it is not a good way of thinking about your mind as a bunch of random and temptation-ridden space that must be controlled. If you really understand a habit, it will no longer take any effort to choose to stop (or continue) it. Real change from A to B doesn&#x27;t require consistent effort to stop being A (which is what all these habit-based models are about). It means you are B now, as if you have always been B, etc.<p>Check out Andre Kukla&#x27;s The Mind for more info and stuff on memory reconsolidation&#x2F;focusing.<p>EDIT: Real change isn&#x27;t you are addicted to video games, and now you set up a really rigid schedule and regiment and discipline to stop playing video games, even though you REALLY want to. You still want to play videogames. It is not the mind that changed, but rather the circumstance (and some periphery of the mind that suppresses the temptations). Real change is actually you now being a person who never really liked videogames in the first place. So bunch of your friends are playing videogames in the living room, and you are more &#x27;tempted&#x27; to study for the exam you have tomorrow.<p>Not that this is easy, but looking at habits won&#x27;t get you to this place (given that you want this kind of real change). But the problem is people think habits are the only solution, and they dominate people&#x27;s minds on how they think about themselves.')
