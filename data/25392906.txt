Item(by='baumy', descendants=None, kids=[25395261], score=None, time=1607728338, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25392793, text='CDC best estimate IFR for COVID-19 is as follows:<p>0-19 years: 0.00003<p>20-49 years: 0.0002<p>50-69 years: 0.005<p>70+ years: 0.054<p>So only age 50+ have at least 0.5% chance to die from COVID-19. These numbers also include everyone in that age range, e.g. the obese, diabetic, immunocompromised. If you know you are healthy, your odds are better. As a healthy 27 year old and something of a fitness fanatic, my odds appear to be 99.98% of surviving at minimum. Due to the reasons I just mentioned, in addition to being on the younger end of the 20-49 age range, my odds are actually quite a bit better than 99.98%, although I don&#x27;t know the exact number. I&#x27;ll roll those dice over a vaccine that has been rushed, and will get the vaccine some years in the future if no problems emerge.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;planning-scenarios.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;planning-scena...</a>')
