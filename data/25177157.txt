We are doing good so far but I would like to keep developing my career.<p>For that reason I enrolled to the Top Performer Course (1) from Cal Newport and Scott Young. One of the first assignments is to find a career role model and have a short interview. In my case that would be a founder &#x2F; CEO and a technical conference speaker &#x2F; book author.<p>If you are keen on talking to me for a few minutes, please reach me at elopinologo01[at]gmail.com<p>Thank you in advance<p>1 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.top-performer-course.com&#x2F;')
