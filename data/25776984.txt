It would be a massive, ongoing public health crisis.<p>That would never happen. People literally wouldn&#x27;t buy the products enmass because they don&#x27;t want to sit around drooping all day.<p>&gt; Finally - if Tobacco is really in the same category of addictivity, then ironically, you&#x27;ve made an argument that we really should shut down the opioid industry hard, because while quitting smoking is difficult, it&#x27;s not existentially hard and the resulting withdrawal does not require medical attention or anything on the scale of &#x27;Trainspotting withdrawal&#x27;.<p>Everyone seems to be thinking about how bad the withdrawal is and not how long the addiction lasts. The addiction to heroin and many other substances is over in days and weeks. Tobacco as any former smoker who has successful quit will tell you, you have cravings for months, not constant but enough that it&#x27;s a thing for quite a while.<p>&gt; An acquaintance in Prison indicated they call the heroin addicts zombies, because they bang on the doors and yell 3 times a day as they receive their poison, which is slowly killing them. I&#x27;d argue that incarcerating people and slowly killing them is a strange punishment for those wanting to &#x27;reduce harm&#x27; whereupon the logical thing for their health would be to make sure they had absolutely no access and an opportunity to dry out. I hope that in 50 year we look back on &#x27;free heroin&#x27; like lobotomies or shock therapy.<p>You should look into how Portugal has dealt with the drug problem. The free heroin isn&#x27;t the issue, it&#x27;s the lack of other support systems to get them off the heroin. Prison is not a place for support.')
