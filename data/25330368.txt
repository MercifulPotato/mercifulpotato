At least not implementable policies; &#x27;everyone be good and happy&#x27; style policies are obviously beyond their power to implement.<p>2) Minorities are still going to resist a 60% majority; because Americans tend not to just give up and go away if they are in a minority.<p>As far as California flourishes, the Democrats can claim credit. As far as it fails, the Democrats are responsible. They&#x27;ve had 10 years according to [0]. At some point, they are powerful enough to be the only force who matter. A similar situation would evolve at the Federal level if they had the same sort of majority.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Political_party_strength_in_California" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Political_party_strength_in_Ca...</a>')
