I&#x27;ve done that several times and I think it always worked for me.</i><p>My home address is wrong on Google Maps. It&#x27;s correct on our national postal services&#x27; postcode system, but that only covers public post: most private couriers use Google for some reason. As do Uber&#x2F;delivery drivers&#x2F;taxis&#x2F;etc. I live in an urban centre (Dublin, home of Google&#x27;s EU HQ) so it&#x27;s not some obscure rural farm.<p>I&#x27;ve used their suggest a change feature within Maps pretty much every month since I&#x27;ve lived here and even received automated responses telling me the suggestion has been &quot;processed&quot; or similar. No change to the map though.')
