Cost would definitely be a benefit, but I&#x27;m less convinced of the value here.<p>I imagine though that this is literally the end of the hackintosh entirely. With control over basically all the hardware, there are no more workarounds or backward compatibility aspects. Hell, even external GPU aren&#x27;t supported as-yet.')
