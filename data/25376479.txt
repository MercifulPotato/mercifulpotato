I&#x27;ve already provided you with links and citations, but you&#x27;re ignoring them, so I&#x27;m not going to waste my time on that again, since you&#x27;re arguing in bad faith, and have already proven you won&#x27;t read them anyway.<p>If you support states rights so much, then why do you support Texas interfering in other states&#x27; rights, or does it only go one way?<p>&quot;States Rights&quot; is actually a racist dog whistle, as we all well know. People like Ronald Reagan who use that term don&#x27;t actually mean it at face value, but use it as a dog whistle to racists, since they actually support things like the federal war on drugs and don&#x27;t support things like gay marriage, both of which prove they don&#x27;t give a damn about &quot;states rights&quot;. That&#x27;s evidence that they&#x27;re not arguing in good faith, and actually mean it as a racist dog whistle, no matter how much fake moral outrage they inflect their denials of racism with. It&#x27;s about as convincing as saying &quot;I&#x27;m not racist, but ...&quot;<p>The point of using a dog whistle like &quot;states rights&quot; is so you can deny it by saying things like &quot;I can tell you, that my personal support of states rights, has absolutely nothing to do with racism.&quot; The cat is out of the bag, and that&#x27;s simply not plausible, especially given your other statements:<p>When you claim to support states rights, that directly contradicts your claim of supporting Texas&#x27;s frivolous lawsuit that explicitly interferes in other state&#x27;s rights, so it&#x27;s pretty obvious you&#x27;re not being intellectually honest or arguing in good faith.<p>You&#x27;re not fooling anyone by unquestioningly supporting a frivolous unconstitutional lawsuit that flagrantly violates states rights, and totally fails to prove its claims, then implausibly claiming you support states rights, but not in a racist way.<p>Once your precious Texas Hail Mary lawsuit is laughed and kicked out of court, what will you say then? Will you finally admit you&#x27;re wrong, or will you descend even deeper into conspiracy theories?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2007&#x2F;11&#x2F;what-reagan-meant-by-states-rights.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2007&#x2F;11&#x2F;what-reagan-mean...</a><p>&gt;Dog-Whistling Dixie. When Reagan said “states’ rights,’ he was talking about race.<p>&gt;The current row is about interpreting Reagan’s defense of “states’ rights” and his choice of venue. Was this language, in this place, an endorsement of the white South’s wish to reverse the 20-year-old trend of using federal laws (and troops when necessary) to protect the rights of African-Americans? Or was Reagan’s remark just an expression of his well-known disdain for “big government”—and his choice of Neshoba County an unhappy blunder? In the ambiguity lies the answer.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reagan%27s_Neshoba_County_Fair_%22states%27_rights%22_speech" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reagan%27s_Neshoba_County_Fair...</a><p>&gt;&quot;I still believe the answer to any problem lies with the people. I believe in states&#x27; rights. I believe in people doing as much as they can for themselves at the community level and at the private level, and I believe we&#x27;ve distorted the balance of our government today by giving powers that were never intended in the Constitution to that federal establishment.&quot; -Ronald Reagan<p>&gt;He went on to promise to &quot;restore to states and local governments the power that properly belongs to them.&quot; The use of the phrase was seen by some as a tacit appeal to Southern white voters and a continuation of Richard Nixon&#x27;s Southern strategy, while others argued it merely reflected his libertarian economic beliefs.<p>And we all know about the Republican Party&#x27;s racist Southern Strategy, of course:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Southern_strategy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Southern_strategy</a><p>&gt;In American politics, the Southern strategy was a Republican Party electoral strategy to increase political support among white voters in the South by appealing to racism against African Americans. As the civil rights movement and dismantling of Jim Crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s visibly deepened existing racial tensions in much of the Southern United States, Republican politicians such as presidential candidate Richard Nixon and Senator Barry Goldwater developed strategies that successfully contributed to the political realignment of many white, conservative voters in the South who had traditionally supported the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party. It also helped to push the Republican Party much more to the right.')
