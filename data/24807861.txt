Overheating wire would instantly lose superconductivity and vaporize into an open circuit. The same thing a fuse does.<p>Current wires have enough bulk to heat up and melt slowly. This is more opportunity to burn things and set stuff on fire. Vaporized plasma is low density which probably won&#x27;t concentrate energy enough to light surrounding materials on fire. Plasma also disassociates quickly in air, again way less time for fires.<p>For mechanical stress, it may be sufficient to just ensure the stress is evenly distributed in all directions. This way the energy will be driven into shockwave and heat rather than motion. The wires might make a big bang but this isn&#x27;t very harmful underground or high in the air on lines. Explosions are way less dangerous in open air than they are confined')
