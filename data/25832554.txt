They&#x27;ve also broken a bunch of user-facing features and made it slower; it seems a common complaint here that maps now is a worse product than it was 5 years ago.<p>Search - They seem to have gone all-in on AI, and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people complaining here that it&#x27;s now harder to find things than it used to be.
