I am more familiar with Pearlmutter&#x27;s work on automatic differentiation, but was was unaware of this work with Houghton.<p>A new hypothesis for sleep: tuning for criticality: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zero.sci-hub.se&#x2F;2153&#x2F;6c1cfbc1b78d23ef2e1cb7102dd8339f&#x2F;pearlmutter2009.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zero.sci-hub.se&#x2F;2153&#x2F;6c1cfbc1b78d23ef2e1cb7102dd8339...</a><p>There is also a related paper on wake-sleep learning from UofT, of which I am sure you are aware:<p>The wake-sleep algorithm for unsupervised neural networks: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.toronto.edu&#x2F;~hinton&#x2F;absps&#x2F;ws.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.toronto.edu&#x2F;~hinton&#x2F;absps&#x2F;ws.pdf</a><p>Are you aware of any recent work investigating the role of sleep in biological and statistical learning?')
