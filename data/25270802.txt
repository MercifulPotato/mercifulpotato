Was relatively easy to re-glue.\nIt&#x27;s a common issue.<p>But I was most fascinated to see the hardware inside. It&#x27;s crazy how miniature it is when the actual body&#x2F;face of the watch is detached.<p>I actually stopped wearing it simply because I found even the basic notifications I had set were affecting my brain -- an issue with any smartwatch, not just the BIP.<p>One cool hack I worked out was combining MacroDroid + BIP to trigger any phone action (Intent). So, you can use the BIP as a remote trigger for your camera, to start&#x2F;stop music, send an SMS, etc. I added a tutorial to Reddit a while back but can find it if you&#x27;re interested.')
