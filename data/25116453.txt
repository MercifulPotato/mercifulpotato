The real threat is the next Instagram that walks through the door that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> sell to FB. Basically, the biggest threat to FB is the fact that people don&#x27;t really care about FB, they just want something to look at on their phones. It&#x27;s totally in FB&#x27;s best interest then to make it more difficult for competition to invent new ways to look for people to look at their phones.<p>Banking and finance in general is probably the best example. It&#x27;s so difficult to start a bank these days that your best bet is to acquire a failing one.<p>However, on this point:<p>&gt; Point to any large company that is in a position of market dominance and I will show the government regulations that allow them to operate in that way<p>I don&#x27;t really see how Apple falls under this category? I can see it for Amazon, Netflix, Walmart, Google, Facebook, etc... but what about Apple?')
