Blizzard seems to have taken a game that many people grew up with and made it easier for casual players (some of those same people who grew up with it who now have jobs&#x2F;kids&#x2F;fuller life) to still be involved. I find it great that I can just click a button to find a raid group for the few hours I have  a night to play. I can still experience the end game content without the time consuming grind to get the right gear and people to do it. Even if I still <i>want</i> to do that, I can with the heroic&#x2F;mythic difficulties. Convenience has made the game way more accessible to way more people.')
