But,<p>&gt; Display output on success, but keep it brief.<p>Strong disagree. If everything went OK, or something is in progress, I don&#x27;t need to be notified; it&#x27;s distracting and makes me instinctively think something has gone wrong and needs my attention. <i>The Art of Unix Programming</i> got it right, &quot;Silence is golden.&quot;[1]<p>I&#x27;m disappointed that `git push` is their example of good CLI output, because I&#x27;ve truly hated git&#x27;s entire CLI design and philosophy for years. Git&#x27;s CLI is the opposite of what good CLI design should be in almost every way: a noisy, confusing, inconsistent, staggeringly complex misery. Do I really need to know that `git push` is enumerating obects? That it&#x27;s using delta compression using 8 threads? That it&#x27;s counting objects? That it&#x27;s compressing objects? That information is useless plumbing output that clutters and distracts for no purpose. Just do the work and keep quiet, with <i>at most</i> a progress bar for a long-running command--and even then it should be optional.<p>If people really want chatty output, include an optional --verbose flag, or even levels of verbosity with -v, -vv, -vvv, etc.<p>&gt; Use symbols and emoji where it makes things clearer.<p>Please, no. This is a fad right now and it&#x27;s also really distracting. Symbols and emoji don&#x27;t have common meanings and a symbol next to a header or plain text is not helpful, because the plain text already says what I need to know without the symbol. Does having an insect icon next to a header that says &quot;Error&quot; really improve clarity, or does a colorful icon in a sea of plain text needlessly distract? Should the icon have been an insect, or a stop sign? Or an exclamation mark in a circle? Or a traffic cone? Couldn&#x27;t all of those mean &quot;Error&quot;?<p>Their example of good emoji use includes a red X next to informational--not error--text (leading me to believe that an error occurred or something stopped unexpectedly) and some kind of duck-beak icon next to the text &quot;When the YubiKey blinks, touch it to authorize the login.&quot; Huh?<p>Despite what Unicode wants you to believe, emojis are not &quot;plain text&quot; and translate poorly to professional workstation-based communication. They are difficult to type on a regular keyboard, are tedious to copy and paste, and don&#x27;t belong in other plain text contexts like data storage or CLI pipes. Additionally emojis render differently for different users so you never truly know what your CLI might be displaying.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linuxtopia.org&#x2F;online_books&#x2F;programming_books&#x2F;art_of_unix_programming&#x2F;ch11s09.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linuxtopia.org&#x2F;online_books&#x2F;programming_books&#x2F;ar...</a>')
