It&#x27;s obviously highly simplified but if you have spent your entire life on the consumer&#x2F;worker side then you will never get to experience even a tiny bit of the complexity of running a real business and how economic theory works out in practice. When you aren&#x27;t actually running your own business you often get hung up on high profile edge cases like monopolies where it&#x27;s in your face that the economy is not in your favor but you never ever stop and think for a second about the parts of the economy that do actually work out just fine. Things like water futures are a net positive compared to the previous situation. Instead everyone in this comment section assumes the worst and thinks about how this system is going to get broken and abused because that is what they experience all the time in far more complicated situations like health care.<p>Free markets aren&#x27;t ideal in every situation. That&#x27;s true but there are also situations in which they are excellent. The closer you get to a prefect market the more effective the free market. Health care is the ultimate counter example to a perfect market and managing it as a free market will not yield efficient results.')
