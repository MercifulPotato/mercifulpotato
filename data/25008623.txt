It has a 825GB NVMe, so that means the OS&#x2F;system default is ~158gb. That seems super high to me. Considering when you think of the size of MacOS or Windows 10, that seems like a very poor optimization on their end. Especially when you consider most triple A titles these days are getting upwards of 200gb (looking at you, latest Call of Duty games). You think they would have optimized the system and OS files a ton more to get it down to at least 50gb or less.<p>But that could just be a bad personal take, someone technical please correct me if that ~158gb is justified somehow...<p>UPDATE: I get that it&#x27;s not just PURELY OS size probably, but even ~158gb seems incredibly large RESERVED space compared to your average computer for the system to need. It still smells like poor optimization on the developer end to me.')
