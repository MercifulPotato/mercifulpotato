You want the userspace to do obvious things with those internals. You don&#x27;t want magic in between. Understanding internals is a feature, not a bug.<p>I picked Debian over Red Hat since, at the time, I could understand how .deb packages worked, and look over the state of the system. Red Hat had more opaque internals. If something broke on a Debian system, rare as it was, I could go in and fix it manually. If something broke on a Red Hat system, it was generally in a binary database file, and meant a reinstall. Red Hat also broke more often, I think for very similar reasons in design philosophy.<p>If I were making a tool for grandma to manage her photos, that&#x27;s be something different. If you&#x27;re making a coding tool for 3rd graders, perhaps you want to hide more stuff too, but even there, many modern coding environments translate blockly into Python&#x2F;JS&#x2F;etc. code, and show the code to kids so they can see under the hood.<p>I have a car, and as a car user, I want thinks to just work. As a car mechanic, I&#x27;d like things to be understandable, fixable, documented, and transparent.<p>git is like that. It has simple internals. Once you understand them, the userspace become very understandable too. The upsides of the elegant internals far outweigh the downside of a slightly clumsy userspace, which is why it&#x27;s the dominant VCS right now.<p>It took over precisely from things which &quot;just worked&quot; with a simple userspace, and clumsy internals, like SVN and CVS.')
