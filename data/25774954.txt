But even the tweet linked in OP refers to a tweet that shows how to abuse the now removed whitelisting by piggybacking your traffic through one of those whitelisted apps. On a locked down system like Android or iOS this isn&#x27;t that trivial, but in a classic desktop OS use case it&#x27;s easy to abuse another app to exfiltrate data.<p>&gt; In essence it&#x27;s about raising the number of independent failures required to result in a compromise.<p>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t hurt, minus maybe the case that a vulnerability in that firewall itself is used.<p>&gt; If you imagine the application firewall on the device has its policies managed rather than selected by the user, it starts to make more sense.<p>That&#x27;s a requirement I guess. You don&#x27;t want accountants and HR people handling popups by a firewall app. :-)')
