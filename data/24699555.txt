Of course you can just use an integer for it, but that is a slippery slope, in the end you&#x27;ll find that you can use strings or byte arrays for everything and you end up with no type system at all.<p>The surprise here is not that the type has limits but that they are so awkward and that there is no better strongly-typed alternative.')
