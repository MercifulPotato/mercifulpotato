This might sound weird if you&#x27;re used to other languages, but it&#x27;s how every language used to work in the good ol&#x27; CGI days. PHP doesn&#x27;t break backward compatibility easily, and I don&#x27;t think it will ever break this one. Besides, once you get the hang of it, PHP&#x27;s execution model is highly intuitive and beginner-friendly. You simply don&#x27;t have to worry about a whole class of concurrency-related problems. Those problems are solved in C, not PHP.<p>Nowadays everyone uses PHP-FPM (again, written in C) which manages a pool of processes. Once a process is done serving a request, it is cleaned up and becomes available for serving another request. You can tweak the number of processes to control how much concurrency you want, or leave it to PHP-FPM to decide on its own. The process pool is much more efficient than the CGI method of setting up and tearing down a process every time, while preserving much of the conceptual simplicity.<p>PHP has had a built-in HTTP server since 5.4, but few people use it in production because PHP-FPM is so stable and performant.')
