Item(by='think814', descendants=None, kids=[25257246, 25235390], score=None, time=1606537347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25235126, text='&gt; Government usually pays well-below-market salaries<p>That may be true for base salaries, but if you take into account overtime and pension&#x2F;health benefits that is not the case. If what you say is true, gov&#x27;t emplpyees would quit en masse; however that&#x27;s not happening. I know from personal experience people that get government jobs and act like they won the lottery.<p>&gt; Public sector unions have almost nothing to do with that, though, since the labor is almost entirely contracted-out (so, private sector unions, to the extent unionized), and anyway the main cost drivers aren&#x27;t labor costs but MTAs horrible contracting process and NY State contracting rules.<p>In NYC at least, public projects like subway construction use by law or by convention only union labor. That&#x27;s a huge cost driver. You are right that that&#x27;s private unions when it comes to construction, however when one considers the enormous operating costs of the MTA (the other side of the same coin) that&#x27;s all public unions driving costs up and resisting any modernization that would make the system more efficient.<p>You are also right that contractor oversight sucks and that&#x27;s also a cost driver; both are valid issues.')
