Would anyone be interested in a Personal HSM?<p>I&#x27;ve created an HSM with a Raspberry Pi and have integrated it with an add-on Security Module. The API has over 30 functions including Cryptographically secure RNG functions, hash&#x2F;HMAC functions (supporting 40+ hash algo&#x27;s), Pub&#x2F;Priv key functions, and also has a CA Authority on it.<p>I am using it for storing my AWS API secrets, private keys, and a CA Authority for all my SSH keys.<p>The add-on chip provides:<p>- Multifactor Device ID &amp; Authentication\n  - Unique ID token created using multiple device specific measurements\n  - Cryptographically derived ID token never exposed\n  - Changes in host configuration trigger local API responses, policy dependent<p>- Data Encryption &amp; Signing\n  - Strong cipher suite includes ECDSA, ECDH, AES-256, SHA256\n  - AES-256 encrypt&#x2F;decrypt data service\n  - Integrates with TLS client-side certificates\n  - TRNG – true random number generator, suitable seed for FIPS PUB 140-2, 140-3 DRNG.<p>- Key Storage &amp; Generation\n  - Private keys never exposed outside of silicon\n  - Fusible keys available, policy dependent<p>- Physical Tamper Detection\n  - Perimeter breach detection circuits\n  - Accelerometer shock detection\n  - Power rail monitor\n  - perimeter integrity circuits detect breaks in user defined wire loops&#x2F;mesh<p>- Real-time Clock\n  - RTC clock service, available to client applications\n  - 20ppm accuracy (standard). 5ppm accuracy (precision, temperature compensated)<p>- Hardware Root of Trust\n  - Hard to penetrate dual secure-processor architecture\n  - Secure elements from Microchip – ATECC608, ATECC508\n  - Secure microcontroller isolates and supervises services\n  - Hardware based crypto-engine and key-store')
