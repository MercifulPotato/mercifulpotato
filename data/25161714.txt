It is not, it is a python orchestration framework that just happens to have a configuration state module.<p>Deployments I&#x27;ve written in Salt just use the Python API (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.saltstack.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;ref&#x2F;clients&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.saltstack.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;ref&#x2F;clients&#x2F;</a>) to make changes to machines or infrastructure.
