Oh wait, I forgot, you&#x27;re &quot;sporty enough&quot;, right, you mean, you&#x27;re &quot;rich enough&quot; to live inside the city, you have that nice, well paid job in an office that&#x27;s always magically clean, and everything is always magically ready for you in Paris.<p>The city of love really IS magic for little privileged people like you. Go ahead and keep it up telling how other should live, and if they can&#x27;t it&#x27;s their fault: they just had to have your little privileged lifestyle, of a &quot;nanti&quot; as we say in France. First hit on the poor, who live far away from paris and come down to clean your office, and &quot;hope this will help finding a solution&quot;. I guess it&#x27;s their fault, they should just have been ... privileged like you.<p>Have you any idea of the pain it has become to use a car in Paris ? Does it really strike you as if people really had a better choice ?')
