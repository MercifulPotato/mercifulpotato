Paying 1,000 per year on registration fees on a domain that can potentially have an unlimited price increase means the value of the domain in any sale will very rarely compensate for the money I invest into it.<p>The key thing about .com is that once you buy the domain, the annual registration fees are more or less nominal — that’s what allows for very high sale prices. If I could buy my .dev name in .com for even 10,000 I would do it. Alas it is easily in the millions, IMO at least 10m+ as  apart from protection for future material hikes in registration fees, .com is still THE gold standard.<p>For me, it made sense because I am actually using the domain, and I can make it my brand name, eg “Name.Dev” incorporated. This helps me from a trademark perspective as well, so for a small time guy with an idea, it’s a great feeling to get a chance to get a good name that I can put to use.')
