You can&#x27;t just check the first instruction and then the second. It&#x27;s entirely possible that instruction 1 has 6 different micro op fusion patterns and you have to read instruction 2 to cut down on the number of potential patterns. It&#x27;s also possible that the second instruction is not relevant in determining the pattern meaning you have to scan 3 instructions to determine the pattern. You have to start this pattern search on the beginning of every instruction you decode which limits your ability to add more decoders. Of course with enough spare transistors this is merely an extremely difficult problem, not an impossible one.')
