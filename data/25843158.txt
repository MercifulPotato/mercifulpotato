The reason China&#x27;s isolationist policies work is their massive population is big enough to form a mini world without a ton of knowledge gaps.<p>The US and maybe western Europe could be in a similar position, if they wanted to.<p>IMO the reason you don&#x27;t want to be isolationist(as a big country) is more about political clout than tech. China has no &quot;soft power&quot; because their firewall works both ways.<p>The US and western Europe have military prescence and political allies worldwide because the free flow of information and technology fosters all sorts of political, corporate, and cultural mixing.<p>What influence China has on its neighbors (and worldwide to an extent) is maintained through pressure and threats, because frankly, their ultra nationalist policies just don&#x27;t make many friends. I personally don&#x27;t think this is sustainable long term but it is yet to be seen. Instead of allies wanting you to succeed, other nations are encouraged to obstruct as much as possible to weaken you and your unwelcome influence. You can see this unfolding in the last few years with increasing tariff and trade restrictions on China. And I don&#x27;t see it letting up until Xi is out')
