That&#x27;s not going to happen now.<p>I feel bad for people who put more work than I did into using the API. It seems kind of short-sighted to me, I&#x27;d have thought anything promoting book-reading would be good for Amazon&#x2F;goodreads.<p>Hopefully it&#x27;s the catalyst for a good alternative to appear. I know developers weren&#x27;t happy with the API, or users with the site in general.')
