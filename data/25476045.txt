Much more:<p>1) the value of the painting and the careless way it was handled suggests subterfuge.<p>2) Where was this painting during the War? Specifically, after 1933?<p>3) Is it the subject of any claims?<p>4) Was this an instance of self-help by descendants of owners who were forced to sell cheaply given the situation in Germany, who had previously not succeeded in their claims?<p>5) Siemens no longer gives briefcases full of cash to secure foreign contracts.

Seller wires funds out from Israel from time to time, raising no suspicion or tax inquiries.')
