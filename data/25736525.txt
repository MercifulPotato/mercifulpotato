This is elementary.<p>Read the PRC&#x27;s constitution some time and see all the rights that it guarantees, yet no one actually enjoys those rights. They exist on paper only.<p>You continually ask questions that attack positions which no one has suggested. I&#x27;ve had to ignore about 80% of your comments because they are just diversions. No one said a word about &quot;corporate personhood&quot;, for example, and no one is even talking about legal representation of corporations. It&#x27;s not possible to have a meaningful discussion like this.')
