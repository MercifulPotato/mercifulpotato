Item(by='baby', descendants=None, kids=[25327652], score=None, time=1607295053, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25327345, text='&gt; Further, it is not a &quot;public document&quot;. If it were public, I could demand that (for example) the license bureau give me a copy of yours.<p>That&#x27;s not what &quot;public&quot; necessarily mean, what you have in mind is published in a public registry, while public here means that there are no secrets involved. Your ID is being circulated, and scanned, and copied, between different people and companies and organizations that you want it or not, because there is no way you can get around in the US (or in most countries) without sharing your ID, or a photo of it, or a photocopy, or the content in it.<p>&gt; As well, there is a massive difference between showing it for a second to a person, and uploading a digitized image of it. In the former, there is no copy or record of it made. It is merely examined for authenticity, against my face or signature.. then immediately returned.<p>It&#x27;s a negligible distinction IMO, some people can make an effort to remember what&#x27;s on the ID, or to sneakily have a way to take a picture of it. Once you&#x27;re displaying your ID to somebody&#x27;s eyes, or handing it to them, it&#x27;s fair game.')
