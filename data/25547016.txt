By this logic we shouldn&#x27;t use batteries either because the energy you get out of the batteries is always less than the energy you put in. Also, where are you introducing additional natural gas? It&#x27;s merely meant to be used as a temporary storage technology to allow a greater renewable share.<p>To be more blunt. Investments into storage technologies allow more renewables to be introduced into an electric grid. Nobody cares about the efficiency because that was never the goal in the first place. The goal is reducing the usage of fossil fuels to an absolute minimum and that means using less natural gas, despite the inefficiency.')
