The automatic approach is a copy collector, which is typically the more often approach of a generational garbage collector. Since a copy collector typically works by following references, this also increases data locality for machines with a small amount of L1 cache.<p>Garbage Collectors and JITs typically work best with hardware support, as you need to check pointer reads and writes as objects are being moved around or code is being rewritten. A lot of these systems use MMU gymnastics, such as mapping the same memory page into multiple locations with different permissions.<p>You also have systems where you create the objects knowing that they will be tiny and short-lived with a fixed lifetime, which can be hugely efficient. This is how Apache Bucket brigades work, since they know that other than a few special cases all memory allocated while handling a request will be garbage once a response is returned.')
