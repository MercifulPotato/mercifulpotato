Things like this are only a problem when politicians decide they&#x27;ll be more popular if they treat enforcing the laws of the land as a PR tactic instead of an obligation. The only reason rioters anywhere manage to do as much damage as they have is because every time there&#x27;s a new BLM or Proud Boys rally every politician decides they&#x27;ll look better if they yank the leash instead of letting the police enforce local laws.')
