Having more dependence on them is like having more dependence on Linux&#x2F;Windows&#x2F;OSX. It&#x27;s a pipedream to think they will remain consistent and&#x2F;or shrink in use case.<p>Like it or not, this is here to stay. What we should fight against, imo, is not browsers as an idea - but the lack of diversity. We&#x27;re in a reality where we all but only two&#x2F;three browsers - it would be as if we only had Windows and OSX. The answer wouldn&#x27;t be to get rid of Windows or OSX, but rather create a rich ecosystem of complementing operating systems - ala Linux.')
