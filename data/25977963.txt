The problem now is really in the department&#x27;s that are only tangentially related to the subject of the debate - e.g. the economics departments are usually, even amongst the increasingly rare Marxists, educated  well enough to argue for either side but the social sciences and humanities are often definitely overrun with leftists. As you would expect, really, but still.<p>I do believe that all university students should be required to take part in a debate like this - the side could arguably he random, although practically I&#x27;d let the choose. Being able to debate properly is a very useful skill - some people I&#x27;ve met really don&#x27;t like being debated, so I don&#x27;t bother, but sometimes you have to.  And on top of that it has a nearly capitalistic approach to challenging your beliefs - the argument formed by (say) 50 students vs. another 50 will catch many more people on different hooks than one lecturer.')
