When I’m coding by myself or on a team with code ownership, I naturally seek 100% understanding of the code I’m working on and worry about anything less.  I am drawn to the thorny parts of a codebase (that nobody understands because ten different people have been playing bug whack-a-mole) so I can clean them up.  Just as if one corner of a room had mold or bugs in it I would want to clean that up upon moving into a group house.')
