Most people spend whatever cash they get. Which is why automatic savings plans are commonly recommended - if the money is never seen you don&#x27;t spend it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure the above is entirely bad - when you die the money is gone. (this is a religious question - not all agree) You need some savings for unexpected, retirement, planted larger expenses, and other situations.
