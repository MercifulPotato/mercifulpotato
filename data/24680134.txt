Have you seen grocery store prices lately?<p>Most of the housing in smaller cities is getting very old, built to very poor standards. Requiring constant maintenance. The owners often still stuck in 25 year mortgages, fixing houses that will fall apart in less time than that.<p>Many of Schools haven&#x27;t been updated in decades, despite having asbestos insulation.<p>I visited a former Eastern Block country this past summer. New roads, infrastructure and buildings everywhere. Built to a much higher standard too. \nMuch better food in Restaurants too.\nThinking of moving back to Europe.<p>Considering the 300 billion deficit this year alone, declining credit ratting, higher taxes. The money for infrastructure will be hard to come by in the next decade.')
