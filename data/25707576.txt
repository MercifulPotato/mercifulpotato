I have an Apple Watch.  An Android phone works very poorly&#x2F;not at all with it.  I have an iPad.  An Android phone does not easily sync between them.  I have a Mac laptop.  An Android phone does not sync well between them.<p>I think the UI on the iPhone is much more intuitive.  I can&#x27;t get that on Android.  There are a bunch of apps that are only available on iPhone.  The iPhone has better apps for my kids.<p>I could keep going on, but my point is, there is a lot my iPhone can do that an Android can&#x27;t, <i>for me</i>.<p>&gt; If you are choosing the former it strongly suggests you don’t care as much about the latter.<p>It doesn&#x27;t in any way suggest that.<p>&gt; Being on a system that allows sideloading is a serious step down in security especially for the non technical majority.<p>I agree.  So make it hard to do. Put it behind a set of options.  Make me have to install a text file on a BSD machine and then sync my phone to enable it.  Just make it possible and let <i>me</i> assume the risk.')
