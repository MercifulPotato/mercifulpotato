Sorry, but that&#x27;s like expecting the FCC to do something that would benefit US citizens vs US corporations. I think we&#x27;ve seen that&#x27;s just not something they are interested in doing. Maybe a new administration will put as the head of the FCC someone that is &quot;good of citizens&quot; minded and uses a normal size coffee cup, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath for anything other than pro-corp rulings from the FCC')
