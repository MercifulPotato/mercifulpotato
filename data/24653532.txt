In today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted. On Hinge, there are no rules, timers, or games. Instead, you’ll meet your most compatible matches and you’ll have unique conversations over what you’ve shared on your detailed profile. It’s a natural way to find a great first date. Currently, 3 out of 4 first dates lead to second dates, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.<p>The backend team is hiring for two positions:<p>- Engineering Lead (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;matchgroup&#x2F;5fa5ad5b-8e6f-49d1-be81-414d90510723" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;matchgroup&#x2F;5fa5ad5b-8e6f-49d1-be81-414...</a>)<p>- Associate Engineer (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;matchgroup&#x2F;249bbd9a-f629-4d8e-ab4a-c9aeffdfb5be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;matchgroup&#x2F;249bbd9a-f629-4d8e-ab4a-c9a...</a>)')
