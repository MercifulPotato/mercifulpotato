I am sure that some people will not agree with what I said to my kids and told their kids something else. That is fine and between you and your kids. I knew that my grade school kids were bound to find out some version(s) of what happened so I knew we needed to talk about it. These are the things I told my kids.<p><i>Very angry supporters of the President attacked the capital building to try to force a change in the results of the election.</i><p><i>They did so because for months they have been lied to about the election being stolen and that they believe that President Trump won.</i><p><i>We know that these people were lied to because none of the many legal challenges suggesting that the election was stolen were successful and that even the President&#x27;s lawyers admitted it when in court.</i><p><i>This attack was not the same kind of protest as others we have seen over the last year and the President seemed unable or unwilling to do anything to stop the attack even after the police had become overwhelmed.</i><p><i>Brave people like the VP and others stepped forward to call for and authorize the use of more police when the President would not.</i><p><i>Thanks to reinforcements, the police were able to re-control the building and make people safe.</i><p>At the time, I was actually afraid that many politicians would be found and lynched by the attackers. I did not tell my kids that and thankfully my fears were overblown.')
