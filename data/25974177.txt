Given identical inputs, it will <i>always</i> produce the same output.<p>This is the entire principle behind ACID, and mutation of global state is a common approach for functional programmers regardless of whether they they are using a DB or not.<p>If a DB were not fully transactional, or if your queries of the DB are not deterministic themselves, then weâ€™ve moved out of functional territory.')
