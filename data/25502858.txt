Item(by='graderjs', descendants=None, kids=[25503713], score=None, time=1608611426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25498549, text='Probably MOND is a &quot;good enough first approximation&quot; to the whole story, which might come out later, and include more terms. I think it&#x27;s interesting some people are doing the complex (to me, anyway) maths from a theory point of view to find ways to get it to spit out MOND. I have almost zero understanding of all this, but none of the theories I read seem physically insightful. They say MOND a_0 constant is close to cH_0, but not exact. I wonder if some of the difference (if that is significant) could be c altering.')
