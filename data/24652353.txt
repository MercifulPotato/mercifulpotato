Item(by='bluntfang', descendants=None, kids=[24652624], score=None, time=1601567631, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24652253, text='Nah dude there are hidden features where if you&#x27;re not participating they way they want you to participate they give you an auto downvote.<p>edit: i just got my posts rate limited for making this comment. Basically they think I&#x27;m a &quot;bad&quot; participator, so instead of being transparent about what they&#x27;re doing and telling me how to participate correctly, they say things like &quot;Slow down. You are posting too fast.&quot; when you try to make a new post. It&#x27;s gaslighting and immature. They don&#x27;t want a community, they want to squash dissenting opinions and they don&#x27;t want to be transparent about it.<p>Meanwhile the comments section on political posts are full of racist dog whistles and reek of the stench of male white privilege prevalent in silicon valley.')
