And the fundamental EU principle of non discrimination based on nationality should ensure that for example a Rumanian worker in France has the same &quot;right to disconnect&quot; as a French worker.<p>I can&#x27;t see why Swedes can&#x27;t decide that they don&#x27;t mind work emails during the weekend while Germans decide they want to have email free vacations.')
