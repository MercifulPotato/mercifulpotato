You cannot play copyrighted music in a stream or YouTube video without jumping through hundreds of hoops with licensing. Especially if you are listening to a variety of songs (e.g. Spotify or a radio) this is a nightmare.<p>You are right that many (not all) YouTubers and streamers are businesses, but pinning this on streamers for being cheap&#x2F;greedy and not wanting to pay ignores the reality of the situation. If this was in any way realistic you would see a certain percentage of streamers pay and legally play popular music. Instead, that percentage is zero.<p>There is no reasonable path to pay for playing popular music, and that is entirely the fault of the record companies.')
