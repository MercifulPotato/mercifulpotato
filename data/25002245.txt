Sort of like trying to double-blind broken bone procedures with a hard cast for the experimental group, and an Ace bandage for placebo.  All parties can tell the difference while it’s being applied.<p>Maybe it requires a different kind of experimental structure that still allows for single-blind follow-ups.  Imagine the subjects talking a different set of therapists or researchers after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months.  The patients&#x2F;subjects would have to be instructed not to talk about whatever they experienced during the psilocybin&#x2F;placebo phase, only about their personal development since then: outlook on life, lifestyle changes, etc. The therapists would have to self-invalidate if anything was divulged by a patient.  It would probably have to be a large group, since with 1000 people you might only get 300 therapist-blind reports.')
