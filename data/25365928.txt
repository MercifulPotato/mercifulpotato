I am responding to the claim that there are zero exceptions (“buts” in this case) to freedom. That is simply not the case and there is widespread agreement on many exceptions to certain freedoms that are a net benefit to society. We can (and will) debate the specifics of these issues and their trade offs for the rest of time. I’m pushing back on the notion that there is nothing to debate because any exception to freedom is somehow equivalent to tyranny. This assertion is wildly simplistic and does not represent the reality of freedom in the US if we’re discussing facts (actual polity).')
