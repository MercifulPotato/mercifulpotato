June 9, 2016 Meeting at Trump Tower<p>On June 9, 2016, senior representatives of the Trump Campaign met in Trump Tower with\na Russian attorney expecting to receive derogatory information about Hillary Clinton from the\nRussian government. The meeting was proposed to Donald Trump Jr. in an email from Robert\nGoldstone, at the request of his then-client Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian real-estate developer\nAras Agalarov. Goldstone relayed to Trump Jr. that the “Crown prosecutor of Russia . . . offered\nto provide the Trump Campaign with some official documents and information that would\nincriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia” as “part of Russia and its government’s support\nfor Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. immediately responded that “if it’s what you say I love it,” and arranged\nthe meeting through a series of emails and telephone calls. </i><p>At the same time, that wasn&#x27;t enough evidence to charge most members of the Trump campaign under existing laws.<p><i>C. Russian Government Outreach and Contacts<p>As explained in Section IV above, the Office’s investigation uncovered evidence of\nnumerous links (i.e., contacts) between Trump Campaign officials and individuals having or\nclaiming to have ties to the Russian government. The Office evaluated the contacts under several\nsets of federal laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents who operate\nin the United States. After considering the available evidence, the Office did not pursue charges\nunder these statutes against any of the individuals discussed in Section IV above—with the\nexception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates based on their activities on\nbehalf of Ukraine.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;storage&#x2F;report.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;storage&#x2F;report.pdf</a>')
