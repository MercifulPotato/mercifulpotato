Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601580193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24654274, text='&gt; Do devs really say horrible things like this at the workplace?<p>Workplaces vary a lot.<p>In some, yes people do.  This sort of thing and much stronger stuff is circulated in company-wide &quot;joke&quot; emails too.  However there does tend to be an element of self-deprecation, in that you&#x27;ll get people circulating jokes about inept women, and also jokes about inept men.  Rarely in the same email of course.<p>In others, you&#x27;d be fired after a few repeats, as you say.<p>With Europe, as someone commented, some of these things can be understood in a slightly more humorous way if it&#x27;s about other &quot;friendly&quot; European cultures, because some of the cultures are quite friendly with each other.  They&#x27;re not at war, so it&#x27;s intended (and really meant and to some extent understood) in a more playful way.  There&#x27;s plenty of it, including on magazine covers.<p>Between England and France there&#x27;s been culture jokes for a long time; I&#x27;ve always imagined that&#x27;s a healthy modern echo of more serious hostility from a long time ago.<p>Similar to the way you&#x27;ll see black music groups using the N word affectionately, and it&#x27;s not offensive because of who is using it.<p>But for example even in Europe, if someone in say Germany started making ambiguous joke&#x2F;not-joke jokes about modern fascists in Hungary, I don&#x27;t think it would be regarded as just friendly humour for long because it touches a nerve.  And when I lived in France I heard people talk about Serbians as though they are &quot;all&quot; quite unpleasant.  So the European cultures aren&#x27;t all friendly with each other.  There&#x27;s history there, and some kind of inter-cultural meme evolution.')
