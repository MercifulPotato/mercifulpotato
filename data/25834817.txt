Especially if they’re using a 300-400W (sustained) consumer router as their spindle as this article suggests.<p>Cutting forces at this scale are in the single-digit pounds. Nothing a common NEMA23 can’t handle with plenty of margin. Trying to push a low-powered spindle through the workpiece on a low-rigidity hobby machine causes more problems.')
