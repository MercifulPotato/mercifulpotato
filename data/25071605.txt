They don&#x27;t seem to disclose the network architecture but claim it has 100s of weights (parameters), a hidden layer of 25 neurons and 3 neuron ouput layer (x location, y location, leak rate) and lastly we are told it takes minutes to train on a 2018 MacBook (so probably trained with the CPU).<p>It is trained on simulated data so it essentially creates a small inverse model of the gas leak simulation, and it appears to work on the real world. This shallow model could easily be deployed on the edge.')
