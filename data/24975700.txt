I&#x27;m Omar Olivares, focused, hardworking and proactive Junior Software Engineer, I got more than 5 years of CS and Engineering study on my body (from Microcontrollers to the Web), plus some industry experience. I really value first principles thinking (like Elon) and I enjoy solving problems. I want to work in a place where I can learn the most from real humans, while delivering high value and detailed oriented products. I&#x27;ve worked with React&#x2F;Node.js in the past, and love the Python community in all its forms but I consider myself a language agnostic person, whatever that solves the problem at hand. Plus, I&#x27;m a big fan of YC, I think I&#x27;ve watched all the lectures already.
