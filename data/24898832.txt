Most rebinds have always been part of the xkeysnail config.<p>If the Overlay key is set then Kinto will undo it so that you will have 3 unhindered modifier keys. (Overlay key is of course mapped to Cmd+Space) If you remove Kinto the Overlay key will be set back to Super of course.<p>All remaps are self contained in the ~&#x2F;.config&#x2F;kinto&#x2F;kinto.py config file and ran as part of the xkeysnail service that Kinto sets up for you. In the config file the Left side is the physical keys you press on either side of the spacebar, and the right side are the keys you are virtually pressing.<p>Also note that the Left side, in the config, is impacted by a modifier swap that occurs early on in the file, so you may not immediately recognize that but the 1st key left of the Spacebar is RC (Right Control), 2nd key is M (Alt) and the 3rd key is Super.<p>During terminal usage the 3rd key, Super, is swapped out with LC (Left Control), but some Super keybinds will still appear to work on LC just fine - like Virtual Desktop switching.')
