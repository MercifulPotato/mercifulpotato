One of my favorites is that he points out a sharp distinction between the &quot;codical&quot; domain and the domain of &quot;interactors&quot;.<p>Interactors are the physical organisms that interact with each other and the environment. The codices are the information stored in the genes. He makes this point to emphasize that the world of information has its own rules that are different from the rules of physical bodies, and that the interactors seem to exist merely to ensure the continued propagation of the information.')
