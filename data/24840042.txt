I just bought my son a Lenovo laptop because he needed Windows.<p>I&#x27;m dismayed at where Apple is going, so I&#x27;m considering a Dell Linux laptop as my daily driver.<p>I need to do some video editing, so for a while I&#x27;ll use my son&#x27;s laptop, and possibly get a Mac Mini if I really need to keep up with video editing.<p>My thinking is I&#x27;ll buy the minimum I need to keep up with my video editing but make more aligned choices for my daily drivers.<p>Sitting on those thoughts more has left me entirely cold to the iPhone 12 announcements last week.')
