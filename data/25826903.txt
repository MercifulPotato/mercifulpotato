You could sell more small hedge funds by knocking on more doors but you understood that the big players took months and years to decide. And of course we always tried to hone the sales org and process to arm the sales people with tools and data to move faster. We certainly held them much more accountable than devs.<p>It&#x27;s actually not a fair comparison - software development is often like golf - the only limit to your velocity is you while sales can&#x27;t really move faster than  customer&#x27;s process in many cases.<p>(Yes I obviously know dev processes can have external dependencies too)')
