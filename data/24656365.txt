Multiple MacBook Pros, Switch, Quest, iPad, thumb drives, external drives, monitors, portable monitors, XPS13, and more.  Never had a problem with a cable, and never had a problem with a power adapter.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just luck?  Maybe it&#x27;s because I generally avoid the cheapest items on Amazon?
