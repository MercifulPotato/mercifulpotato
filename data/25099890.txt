Item(by='tails4e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605435505, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099771, text='I have a system called KNX, its not wireless but each switch is independent of each actuated function (light, blinds, etc). The main advantage is the wiring is simple, a bus for all switches and all lights go back to a relay board. Switches, sequencing &#x2F; grouping can be assigned at any time after install, scheduled on&#x2F;off, easy to extend later, etc. For example I built a garage 10 years after my house and by running a single cat 5 between  the buildings, I can now press a button (any button I wish) in the house and turn all garage lights off. I can also see the state of any light or actuator at any time, etc. So there are some nice advantages, but I&#x27;m glad it is wired for sure..')
