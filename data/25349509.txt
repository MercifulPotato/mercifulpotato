[...] One popular and recent conception of the distinction is that sympathy represents &quot;a feeling of care and concern for someone, often someone close, accompanied by a wish to see him better off or happier,&quot; while empathy represents &quot;a person&#x27;s ability to recognize and share the emotions of another person, fictional character, or sentient being.&quot;</i>')
