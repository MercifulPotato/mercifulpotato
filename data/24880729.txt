Item(by='DOTHEDA', descendants=None, kids=[24881519], score=None, time=1603561357, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24880302, text='I really got into these retro handhelds recently and I love them, but I would like to suggest some more options as Odroid has stock issues a lot of the time (do go for them if they&#x27;re in stock, though, the shipping times are much better than other retro handhelds.)<p>For cheap, I&#x27;d suggest the Pocket Go, [1] but for my favourite I love the RG350P, [2] which is a little more expensive but has a community with a lot of homebrew behind it and it can run pretty much anything from PS1 downwards. There is also the RK2020 [3] with a little more oomph than the RG350P, the RK2020 is a pretty brazen Odroid-Go Advance clone, so if Odroid has the Go Advance in stock, get that instead, but they rarely do.<p>If you find these just a touch too expensive, they can be found on Banggood for small to hefty discounts. I got my RG350 (not RG350P, the RG350P is a minor improvement over the RG350 but at around the same price) for $60 on Banggood. Also, expect 1-2 month shipping on these consoles, but in my opinion it&#x27;s so worth it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retromimi.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;handhelds&#x2F;products&#x2F;pocketgo-retro-gaming-system" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retromimi.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;handhelds&#x2F;products&#x2F;pocketg...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retromimi.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;handhelds&#x2F;products&#x2F;rg350p" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retromimi.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;handhelds&#x2F;products&#x2F;rg350p</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retromimi.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;handhelds&#x2F;products&#x2F;rk2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retromimi.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;handhelds&#x2F;products&#x2F;rk2020</a>')
