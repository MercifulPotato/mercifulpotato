Content policies for YouTube is something that needs to be worked out by the content team. I&#x27;m talking about internal debate and activism around contentious topics.<p>&gt;so they encourage engineers passionate about a topic to use proper channels to weigh in on sensitive subjects<p>Sure they do. I&#x27;m sure they are perfectly OK with engineers being passionate about Trump, pro-life, religion... Yeah..<p>It&#x27;s clear as day that pretty much everyone in this thread has a blind-spot because they just so happen to agree with the culture of a San Francisco company pushing progressive values. If you moved to rural Alabama and now you were inundated with conservative values and politics to the point where you were worried about your job if you did not consent, for example, signing your name on some conservative petition, I bet you would see the value of keeping the workplace neutral.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this first hand. There is a Director at my workplace that goes on pro-choice rants all the time. Her assistant confident to me that she&#x27;s actually pro-life but feels like she has to agree publicly (and like her Facebook rants) because she needs her job. How is that good? What&#x27;s the point of engaging in a pro-choice vs pro-life debate at work when you&#x27;re trying to build a widget.')
