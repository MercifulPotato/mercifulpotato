But this project was surely years in the making and the tech had to be available back then. This isn&#x27;t a huge company. This is a charity&#x27;s first attempt at creating a low-cost microcontroller with first class documentation and support. And considering Upton&#x27;s ARM background I think the ARM choice is the obvious one.<p>Your point about the ecosystem and the documentation is important here, this is extremely valuable considering their mission and simply would not have existed at the same quality level if using some brand-new ESP chip - is it even available to buy anywhere yet (I can&#x27;t find a seller)? And if you haven&#x27;t had a look at the RP2040 datasheet[0] yet, please do - it is really something with multiple real-life examples and hints that goes a long way beyond what you usually get. If they had built something around the C3 it&#x27;d be a long while before anything near the same level could be created and in the hands of kids. They want an established ecosystem to build on, not a cutting edge one. I do not think it&#x27;s a good fit (yet).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datasheets.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;rp2040&#x2F;rp2040_datasheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datasheets.raspberrypi.org&#x2F;rp2040&#x2F;rp2040_datasheet.p...</a>')
