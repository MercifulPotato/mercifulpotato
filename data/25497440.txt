Item(by='squirrel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608573530, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496166, text='Early employee at a UK startup that started in 2001. In 2007, exercised options for a cost in low five figures. Company loaned me the money to exercise and I continued to work there. When I left in 2012, I paid off the loan with cash. Company sold in 2018 and the ROI was substantial - received a sum in the high six figures.<p>In the next company, I bought shares outright during one of the investment rounds for a few thousand pounds, and later, in an acquisition, I had the opportunity to sell my shares again - for Â£0.<p>Lessons learnt: be patient (I held options or shares in the first company for 17 years!) and don&#x27;t bank on shares as the route to riches.')
