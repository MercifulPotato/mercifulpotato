While it may not be clear who is in charge of a firm as a whole, that is not the case at the project level. <i>Every</i> project&#x2F;audit must be signed off on by a partner, and that partner is the responsible party for any and all firm activity that happens on that project&#x2F;audit.<p>The water gets muddied because that partner may not <i>actually</i> be involved in the project very much, and in controversial situations they may try to blame someone else (such as a lower level firm employee who was involved) for any mistakes, but at the end of the day the partner who signed their name to the contract is the person held accountable.')
