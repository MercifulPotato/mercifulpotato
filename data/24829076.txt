I learned how important controlled burns are in boy scouts -- this isn&#x27;t exactly a well kept secret. Before any other explanations are suggested, this one should be addressed.<p>I&#x27;d also venture that the state of California would prefer if the fires were outside of their control rather than caused by forest mismanagement. I will neglect to mention any other political reasons that might influence what these fires are blamed on.<p>Can anyone who rejects the controlled burns hypothesis explain the basis of their beliefs and also explain what they think would happen if the frequency of controlled burns were increased?')
