Without generics and the current error handling story, it almost feels like Go makes large codebases <i>necessary</i> in the projects I&#x27;ve used it, compared to other statically typed languages such as Kotlin, Java, Rust, and C#.<p>Go 2 on the other hand looks like it will solve this problem, and I eagerly await its release.')
