Then you only need to be &quot;pandering&quot; to their engineered beliefs, even re-enforce them while you&#x27;re at it. Which of course is exactly what&#x27;s happening.<p>&gt; <i>It&#x27;s well known not to work for a long time</i><p>It only needs to last for the active career span of the politician.')
