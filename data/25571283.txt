In the worst case, maybe Google will expect 20 minutes extra time entering France or entering Antwerp when it&#x27;s actually 30 minutes this particular day. But that&#x27;s a very acceptable error on a 2-hour trip.<p>Of course, this was true in 2019 but I didn&#x27;t have the occasion to keep doing these trips in 2020. Also, I can&#x27;t compare with Apple Maps which isn&#x27;t available on my smartphone.')
