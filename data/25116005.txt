Item(by='earthboundkid', descendants=None, kids=[25117118], score=None, time=1605555384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25115820, text='&gt; I&#x27;m struggling to find compelling and valid reasons why we can&#x27;t pursue a general solution that involves us giving all this &quot;private&quot; data to a government entity for legitimate investigations, fraud prevention and crime-solving whilst keeping that data free from abuse.<p>Because that&#x27;s not logically possible. It would be nice if it were, but just think about it: if you give data to the government, humans can look at it. Can we ensure that the humans who look at it are good humans? No. Is there some mathematical way of signing and encrypting such that only good humans can look at it? No.<p>Okay, so it&#x27;s logically impossible to keep bad people out mathematically, but maybe it&#x27;s a practical problem and it doesn&#x27;t matter in practice? Except no, there are tons of evil governments (CCP being the most obvious, but pick your poison), and even good governments are subject to the problem that people can bribed and secrets can be stolen if there is sufficient motivation. It&#x27;s just not compatible with human nature to say &quot;collect all this information on people, but only use it For Good Purposes.&quot;')
