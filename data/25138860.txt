I&#x27;m not &quot;dying on a hill&quot; either when I do this because nobody will care. Nobody that I work with will care and nobody that looks at my source code online will care.<p>If and when someone does care about what I name my branch, it will be an easy way for me to identify a person that I would rather avoid working with.<p>The reason I care enough to even change it back is because I think the whole idea is driven by stupidity and it&#x27;s my personal policy to not give into stupid demands. I simply don&#x27;t do political correctness. If people don&#x27;t like it, they can just fuck right off.')
