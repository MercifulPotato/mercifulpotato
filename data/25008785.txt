Public opinion quickly gets tired&#x2F;bored of a specific issue, while lobbyists <i>never</i> stop pushing.<p>On the other hand, a politician that makes one of his&#x2F;her main goals to shut down (or block if not in US) the GAFAMs (or any other giant company), might be actually able to make a real and long-lasting change.<p>(Or the other way, to change a few of the most important laws that describe how ALL companies can function â€“ also could be a main policy point.)')
