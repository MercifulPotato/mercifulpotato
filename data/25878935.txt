The developers who worked on the feature argued against it (among other things it was almost impossible to tell which window was active since &quot;Black on White&quot; isn&#x27;t easily distinguishable from &quot;Gray on white&quot;).  Selfhost feedback said the same thing.  It didn&#x27;t matter - the designers had their mocks, the PMs sided with them, and that was how it shipped.<p>The public response was entirely predictable (for &quot;not being the target customer&quot;, it turns out that we knew how they think pretty well) and soon enough we added a toggle for color and APIs to control title bar colors back in TH1.')
