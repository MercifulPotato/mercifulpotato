The obvious way to think about a graph using ownership is to start with a root node, then to say that nodes own other nodes through their edges. But that model won&#x27;t generalise to disjoint graphs (eg, social network with separate friend groups) and it isn&#x27;t always clear which node is the &quot;root&quot; node.')
