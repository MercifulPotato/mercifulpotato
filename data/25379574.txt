You can go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elections.wi.gov&#x2F;elections-voting&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;turnout" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elections.wi.gov&#x2F;elections-voting&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;turnout</a> grab `Voter Turnout Partisan-NonPartisan Through August 2020.xlsx` and see that turnout percentage is computed as `number of votes cast` &#x2F; `voting age population`.<p>This is funny -- here&#x27;s a single example from the WI.gov page to show how little care is given to cultivating and maintaining this data...<p>HINDI: 56184<p>County: ST. CROIX COUNTY<p>Municipality: VILLAGE OF SPRING VALLEY<p>Total Electors 2012:   4<p>Voting Age Estimate 2012:  6<p>Voter Turnout 2012: 66.67%<p>Total Electors 2016: 319<p>Voting Age Estimate 2016: 10<p><i>Voting Turnout 2016: 3190.00%</i><p>So I can find slivers that support wild claims too. I think the more productive discussion is just doing a side by side of signatures and rolls - not that hard, no real argument about it - and everyone can stop trying to dig for little things and becoming unbearably pedantic with each other.')
