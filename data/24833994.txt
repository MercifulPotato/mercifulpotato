From day one, every single course was strictly &quot;on topic&quot;. Maths, Electronics, Programming, Computer theory, compilers, real time programming, Java, C++, Real Time Programming, Digital Electric Design, Data Comms, more Maths, Digital Signal and Image processing, Game Design, Personal Software Process, etc. etc.<p>In the four years I studied (plus another for a placement in the workforce) I never studied a single moment that wasn&#x27;t directly Software Engineering. Not a single English or history or anything course.<p>My knowledge is very deep, but not nearly as broad as someone that took all those other courses.')
