The default should be that I do nothing and my computer continues to be able to do what it already did.<p>It&#x27;s wrong every time I have to do something to allow my computer to continue doing something it already did. This is why I have to be exceedingly careful not to install updates on those dwindling platforms where I still have that control.

(Yes, yes-- I know that we&#x27;re getting into the whole &quot;But that old device firmware has security bugs! Think of the Internet!&quot; discussion.
