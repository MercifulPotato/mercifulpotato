She had a hard time finding a job as a teacher though. I was discussing this situation with her and asked &quot;What is it you want to do?&quot; and she was like &quot;Get a job as a teacher?&quot; and so I probed further, &quot;So you just want to get the job with title teacher, regardless of the duties?&quot; And she was like &quot;I dont care about the job and the title, I want to teach kids and see them grow&quot; .  To which i pondered with her, &quot;so go volunteer as a tutor?&quot; . Yes, she did want to earn an income, but her real goal and actualization was by doing the thing... She was able to do some tutoring in the meantime and it really really improved her outlook and was a great outcome for the kids too!<p>So often the things we want to do only have the barriers we&#x27;ve constructed&#x2F;adopted.')
