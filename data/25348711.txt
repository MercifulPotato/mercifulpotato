I disagree that hackathons are the solution.<p>Hackathons are usually what management comes up with when they think about this problem.  However, I guarantee you that this conversation regularly happens among your developers at Friday happy hours:\n- So how&#x27;s that project Z going?\n- You know, same old.  Looks easy in theory, and every little task is a slog.  I spent this whole week fighting the Blorgifier again.\n- Wait, that abomination is still in our codebase?  That was a hack we came up with at 3am during one of those death marches last year when we needed to ship something for the Initech demo.\n- Yeah, you know what they say.  Nothing more permanent than a temporary bandaid.  I wish I could have a week of my time back.\n- Yeah... cheers!<p>There will always be very important seeming bugs that have a great definition and visible customer impact.  Unfortunately, obscure poorly-defined tasks like &quot;rewrite the Blorgifier&quot; immediately trigger a response of &quot;that&#x27;s just developers wanting to have fun&quot; in managers.  And they end up adding a tax on every single one of those important fixes until eventually the whole thing collapses under its own weight.<p>How to solve this?  Ask the developers what&#x27;s important to fix?  Nah, they don&#x27;t know how to plan a project and don&#x27;t understand the customer.<p>Does this mean that developer pet projects need to get 100% time allocation?  No.  But in most companies their time is undersized by a factor of 1000 or more.')
