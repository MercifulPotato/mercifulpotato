For €24&#x2F;year it will auto sync any changes automatically 24 times per day.<p>- Use the Astiga app (Android) or any SubSonic app (on iOS play:Sub is passable) to browse this library from your phone<p>To be honest, stuff like Apple Music is way more convenient. But I have my baseline of albums I “need to have” in lossless (and where possible hi-res) format in Astiga, perfectly tagged. Especially in case my rented access via Apple Music to this music is suddenly fucked with.')
