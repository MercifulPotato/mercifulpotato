There will be exotic materials that can only be produced in orbit. This will encourage a lot more extra-planet activity, and bring more and more capabilities off planet. As these capabilities increase there will likely be increasing economic pressure to utilize extra-planet resources further increasing our off planet capabilities. I see a positive feedback loop that is sort of inevitable in the next several hundred years.')
