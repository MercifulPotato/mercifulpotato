Maybe class related status bullshit?<p>I enjoy wine, but I also recognize a lot of the snobbiness about it (particularly at the high end) is a mixture of snake oil and rich people looking for a place to buy more status.<p>I remember some interview on NPR with a wine expert. The host was asking why in all the double blind trials people aren&#x27;t able to consistently rate wines or even have consistent preferences. The wine expert complained that it&#x27;s the fault of doing it double blind and &#x27;when they&#x27;re present with the people&#x27; (and likely giving them obvious clues about what&#x27;s supposed to be good or not) &#x27;they can tell the difference&#x27;.<p>There&#x27;s good&#x2F;bad, like&#x2F;dislike, but there&#x27;s also true and fraud, high status and low status. Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference, sometimes there isn&#x27;t a difference.')
