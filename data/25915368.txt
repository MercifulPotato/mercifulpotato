Much of that stuff is either on personal web sites and blogs (often with unknown licensing) or behind corporate paywalls.<p>There ought to be a place this stuff goes, and is forever archived, searchable, and usable.<p>I&#x27;d actually extend that beyond software too. Educational materials. Service manuals for my car or vacuum cleaner. There&#x27;s lots of stuff which ought to live forever for the benefit of humanity. And perhaps software itself. I ought to be able to pull up Netscape 2.0 or Flash and run it in a sandbox.<p>Archive.org is designed to archive everything on the web. I&#x27;m thinking something thoughtful and deliberate where people (even paying for it) stick content into a permanent archive. If I&#x27;m running a startup, and I&#x27;d like to give you a guarantee of long-term support, I stick my support materials there, and they can outlast me.<p>Hmmm...
