The user taps the login button, a separate identification app (that basically all swedes have) is launched, and as soon as the authentication is completed the user is navigated to the logged in view. It&#x27;s a very seamless experience, and a lot of swedish apps work this way.<p>On the other hand it means that it&#x27;s impossible to determine which user is logging in until the proper auth is complete. And thus you cannot have &quot;special accounts&quot; using this flow.')
