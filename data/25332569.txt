Item(by='cmrdporcupine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607352534, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25332175, text='Apple has taken several kicks at that can over the last couple decades and each time it&#x27;s been a flop. Not because the hardware wasn&#x27;t good, but because it&#x27;s just not the kind of market that makes sense for them and their business model. They&#x27;re not interested in low-margin commodity bulk product.<p>They&#x27;re a luxury brand and they make money off of selling personal lifestyle computers. Often good quality, and, yes, the M1 looks fantastic (literally just bought my wife a new M1 MacBook Air) but this is a company that doesn&#x27;t even really sell a commodity desktop machine. I cannot see them going head to head against SuperMicro.<p>Maybe, _maybe_, they&#x27;d license M1 out, but I doubt it.')
