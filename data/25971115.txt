It&#x27;s also a relatively mature platform, used previously for their Ebola vaccine which passed an European Phase III trial, but wasn&#x27;t the earlier one that made such a difference in the last outbreak.<p>The other vaccines you might get are less mature platforms, AZ&#x2F;Oxford 2 doses 21 days apart has less efficacy than Janssen&#x27;s 1 dose (Oxford had not before 2020 ever tried testing their platform on more than 40 people at a time), the mRNA vaccines I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard all about, but I wouldn&#x27;t make any bets on when Pfizer will be able to provide you a dose from their currently? closed Belgium plant.')
