This claim is false, based on that political view being the dominant view on Facebook.<p>You can say that <i>despite that</i>, we should all be concerned about Facebook&#x27;s power to suppress political views, and I would definitely agree. First they came for the trade unionist, and so on. But saying that <i>despite</i> the evidence disproving the first point, we should still be concerned is very, very, very different from saying, no, this evidence against the first point is actually evidence of something completely the opposite of that. That&#x27;s not how evidence works.<p>Please, don&#x27;t say nonsensical things that run counter to how reason or facts work. Thanks.')
