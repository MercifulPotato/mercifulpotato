You begin with the skin which can arrive either pre-cut or in rolls. You then heat it in a large scale oven usually based on ceramic heating modules. Once pliable at a polymer-specific temperature use your aluminium mould to obtain a desired shape in combination with positive and&#x2F;or negative air pressure. The alumnium&#x27;s conductivity assists with cooling the part to set the new shape. Then withdraw the mould.<p>For super high speed boat building, you could use a combination of this and maybe ultrasonic welding to rapidly fuse multiple sheets and build up a higher body. The challenge would be fusing to a superstructure while maintaining integrity.<p>Currently, this process is only used for dinghy-scale vessels.')
