I&#x27;m saying at a casual glance or quick look, or grainy-surveillance footage level, they do look strikingly similar.<p>Another factor though we may not be considering in general regarding facial-recognition is identity theft. I&#x27;ve dealt with that sort of thing before, and if you&#x27;re not careful the government might get <i>really</i> confused as to who the &quot;actual&quot; person is, and who was the one that stole the identity is. Again, not the case here, but it is something that police need to consider.')
