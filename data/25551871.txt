However, after checking latest mongodb documentation, it seems they have magically solved those issues in the last few years<p>how about these assumptions or myths?<p>a. treat it as in-memory document database. expect to lose data if it does not successfully write to disk periodically.<p>b. concurrent reading and writing. it claims that it is resolved for specific scenario in multiple document-level concurrency,while put a lock on single document issue.<p>c. Total data storage should not be bigger than memory, although it was fixed in v3.2 with new database engine.<p>d. multi document queries introduced in 4.2 and 4.4, however it is conflicting with their own recommendations that says Each document should be independent, denormalized data model.<p>I like their syntax, feel so natural. postgres jsonb syntax is unreadable, a bit hacky for me. should i be concerned with mongodb myths?')
