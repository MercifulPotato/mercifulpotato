The model I keep coming back to is some giant cellular automata embedded in a some sort of higher dimensional compute structure —- perhaps what we call the “big bang” was the randomly initialized start state, and everything since has been its update algorithm ticking along with an encoding of what we call “physics”. This plays interestingly with things like quantum mechanics - perhaps they’re the underlying implementation of “Math.random()” and things like entanglement are implementation details leaking through. Similarly, perhaps wave&#x2F;particle duality is the result of some sort of legacy code built to deal with light as particles that got shoehorned into the current implementation’s wave-based approach (easer to simulate at-scale), and it only gets activated when the results are under observation!<p>It, like every proposed answer to the existential question, is both unverifiable and unrefutable, making pondering it somewhat pointless. Though it is good to know even our proposed higher-dimensional overlords haven’t solved the problem of leaky abstractions!')
