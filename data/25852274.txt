Article II, Section 1, Clause 1 of the Constitution simply states: &quot;The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.&quot; Sections 2 and 3 describe the various powers and duties of the president, including &quot;he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed&quot;<p>They&#x27;re constitutional--in the sense that the President has the legal authority to issue orders to the rest of the executive branch--but they are certainly <i>not</i> an explicit provision of the Constitution explicitly modeled after the royal decrees of the British monarchy.')
