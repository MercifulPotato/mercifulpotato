Which should be pretty obvious. Nobody mixes by accident the speed at which you travel with the distance you have to travel. Nobody says &quot;My car can pull off 200kms&quot; or &quot;I have 120km&#x2F;h to cover&quot; yet the same happens for energy vs power on a daily basis, even in publications.')
