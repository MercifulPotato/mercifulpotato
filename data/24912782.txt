You can just manipulate the DOM and the state stays with the DOM, so there&#x27;s nothing to sync internally within the JS app. You only serialize from DOM and to DOM at the server API boundary. No need for the &quot;rendering&quot; in response to state changes. You just change the DOM intuitively, and that&#x27;s that.<p>And that makes &quot;vanilla&quot; browser apps easier to write too.')
