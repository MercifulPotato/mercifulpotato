Item(by='Proven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612078514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25971037, text='&gt; To make your software “free” is to promise that its users will have freedom – as the saying goes, code is “free as in speech” even if it’s not necessarily “free as in beer.”<p>That&#x27;s simply untrue. Everyone knows that copyleft licenses disallow certain forms of free speech (with code), for example the GPL 3.0. In fact the GPL 3.0 was designed <i>specifically with the intent</i> to constrain the &quot;excessive&quot; liberties allowed by the GPL 2.0 (which isn&#x27;t very permissive to begin with).<p>If you want to make your code free, release it to Public Domain. Copyleft proponents pretend they&#x27;re above the detested capitalists and IP enforcement but in reality they use &quot;IP&quot; to enforce their agenda just like all other people who license their IP under non-permissive licenses.')
