Your previous comment contained no such qualification, leaving an open ended implication which seemed to be intentional.<p>Most people responding to this example are pointing out the problems with it, and they don&#x27;t seem to have any issue being quite frank about how this evidence doesn&#x27;t show fraud, doesn&#x27;t show systematic error, doesn&#x27;t show that the election outcome would be different.<p>No one interested in the facts should be willing to take <i>that</i> as a starting point and proceeding to entertain this kind of meandering, open ended, unprovable and vague speculation that you seem to want to steer the conversation toward.')
