It’s easy to forget how useful it is to be able to solve a system of equations like that. It lets you find optimal settings for complex systems with multiple constraints. Fitting a machine learning model is just one application for this... there’s a whole academic discipline called Operations Research that focuses on using optimization to find solutions to practical problems.<p>Just another example of the huge power in creating accurate digital models of the world.')
