If I&#x27;m looking through historic commits (to understand why a change was made, or perhaps to debug an issue) I&#x27;ll often `git blame` the line and diff that commit. If the commit is super granular, I can&#x27;t get the context of the whole change: I need to dig for the merge commit then look at that, which is faff.<p>If there&#x27;s a way that I don&#x27;t know to show merge commits in blame rather than the actual source change commit, then I&#x27;d be all over it. Until then, single (whole) units of change per commit.')
