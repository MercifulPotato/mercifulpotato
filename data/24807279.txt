The typical site that many kids and teenagers will use to get unstuck in a game. The pop-up listed over 1,500 companies that would get my data. And many of that companies seem aggregators that would share my data further. 1,500!<p>I have mixed feelings of the government accessing my data. There is a balance to be found between privacy and security.<p>But that 1,500 companies from around the world would start tracking me, or anyone that visit what seems an innocuous page, is gruesome.<p>Targeted advertisement is creepy as hell.<p>It is mind-disturbing to know that each step I do is tracked by thousands of companies, to know that tens or hundreds of thousands of employees have access to my data.<p>That each time I search for a video game, a place to go on vacations or a an answer to a job related question, I will be evaluated by algorithms that are creating a profile of me, as a human being, to predict what I want or need.<p>Advertisement has its value. But, that level of intrusion is humiliating and attempts against everybody dignity.<p>I hope that GDPR watchdogs get more founding and fines start punishing hard these criminal behavior.')
