In my younger years, I was pretty hardcore about hacking devices and having complete control of them. But SO MUCH TIME was spent debugging issues and staying ahead of the &quot;bad guys.&quot; And I couldn&#x27;t count the literally years of time I&#x27;ve spent fixing broken devices.<p>Nowadays I just don&#x27;t have that time. And the bad guys have evolved from mischievous to felonious (and I have a lot more to lose. I still harp on privacy and security, but now I do it behind a couple of walled gardens. I love that my devices &quot;just work.&quot;<p>I know it&#x27;s a trade off, and I&#x27;m certainly fighting for more regulations of FAANG. And I am supporting the FOSS&#x2F;open device movement, and look forward to the next phase where those &quot;just work&quot;.')
