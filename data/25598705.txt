The [SelfHosted](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;selfhosted.show&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;selfhosted.show&#x2F;</a>) podcast is great, but it&#x27;s hard to search back through.<p>A couple points I&#x27;d like to see more on:<p>1. WireGuard on a VPS seems like a great option for services you want to access externally from your network. If I&#x27;m on my network, I&#x27;d like to access the services using the same method as externally (e.g. going to nextcloud.example.com) without having all my requests go through the VPS. Any recommendations for doing that (I imagine some local DNS redirecting would be enough, but I&#x27;m not sure)?<p>2. If someone had the budget and space to do so, would running two separate boxes, one for data storage and one for services make sense (i.e. if you could get a 2.5 or 10 Gb connection between them, would their be enough of a perf impact to make it a bad idea)? I like the idea of separating the two (can keep just the data server on UPS, focus on stability with your data, make it less dangerous to play around with the service box, etc), but not sure if it&#x27;s worth the headache.')
