I&#x27;m a super .. socialist _(or w&#x2F;e)_ in that i believe in tons of government programs, but homelessness is something i almost don&#x27;t believe in. It feels either a problem of:<p>1. Social safety nets to support working individuals experiencing tough times <i>(i support tons of safety programs)</i>.<p>2. Or.. more controversially, mental health issues that shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to exist in this state. Ie, if we had #1 then &quot;no one&quot; would be homeless - and those that are despite that, are too mentally unwell to be allowed the freedom to make such a decision.<p>Though, i know nothing on the subject - and advertise as much. Nevertheless, i feel far less supportive of the homeless as a result - i split it mentally as either people i want to support via social nets - or mentally unwell people needing of hospitalization. A bit off topic perhaps, but i&#x27;m always interested in peoples opinion on the subject.')
