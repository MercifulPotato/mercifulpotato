They&#x27;ve been around for a long time working for other companies. But the things they&#x27;ve been doing for those other companies prior to spacex didn&#x27;t wow anyone or made the headlines, did it?<p>Then Musk enters the stage and all these amazing things happen. Yes, the engineers figure all that stuff that makes rockets turn back around from orbit and land on a platform in open waters, but none of that existed before Musk, even though it was, apparently, very possible.<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s the synergy between a general and the troops. Shitty troops will lose the battle no matter how awesome the general is; a shitty general will lose battle regardless how awesome his men are. In USA there is plenty of awesome talent (troops) inhibited by tons of shitty generals (entrepreneurs) that have no vision or courage to use that potential to make great things. So when someone great show up, like Musk, it&#x27;s more than appropriate to commemorate them.')
