(But you don&#x27;t need to allow them to insist they have not made a mistake.)<p>I especially appreciate this. Far too often I see people reacting to people&#x27;s mistakes with anger and hostility, instead of first trying to 1) understand the situation, and 2) help the person who made the mistake (if there even was one) understand the mistake.<p>A little kindness goes a long way.<p>[Edit: formatting]')
