Item(by='dvt', descendants=None, kids=[25799295], score=None, time=1610758082, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25798460, text='&gt; I think the problem is you called it a &quot;reliable&quot; route to financial independence, when the variance is actually pretty high. Anyone who can get a job at a large tech company in SF&#x2F;Seattle&#x2F;NY has a much more reliable route to financial independence.<p>I feel like I argue this ad nauseum here on HN. No, being engineer #3489 won&#x27;t ever make you financially &quot;independent&quot; (and by that, I mean having FU money). Financial <i>comfort</i> is something else entirely. Making 100-200k (even including stock bonuses) somewhere like SF&#x2F;NY where <i>rent</i> for a 1 bed 1 bath is like 3k (and houses&#x2F;condos <i>start</i> at $1 million) will never have the same upside as starting your own company. Let&#x27;s ignore for now the very real chance of getting laid off, or otherwise fired in favor of a younger engineer that gets paid less than you do (when you hit your 40s).<p>But again, financial independence is just <i>one aspect</i> of &quot;winning&quot; at a startup. Everyone conveniently ignores doing your own thing, freedom, self-reliance, self-determination, etc. -- these are <i>non-existent</i> at BigCorp (where you&#x27;re treated, at best, like a cog). I personally value freedom much more than I do money -- which is why I accept the risks of every few years throwing my hat in the ring and seeing what comes of idea X or Y.')
