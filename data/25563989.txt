I don&#x27;t know why he thought that was a good idea, especially since the thing was noisy as hell.<p>It stopped suddenly.  I don&#x27;t know if someone called the police, or hit it with a tennis racket, or what.  But by Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day he was back to racing his remote controlled cars up and down the block, instead.')
