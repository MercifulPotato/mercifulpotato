In 2016, the Victorian state government announced new renewable energy targets. By 2020, 25 percent of Victoria’s electricity will come from clean renewable energy. By 2025, that will rise to 40 percent.<p>Their target is 50 percent by 2030, but I’m overly optimistic based on runaway rooftop solar deployments and the current utility scale projects in the pipeline. It is highly likely most of Australia is 100% renewables powered (electrical, doesn’t include transportation) by 2032, 2035 at the latest.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reneweconomy.com.au&#x2F;australia-can-be-powered-100-by-renewables-by-early-2030s-says-garnaut-16846&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reneweconomy.com.au&#x2F;australia-can-be-powered-100-by-...</a>')
