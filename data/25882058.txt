It’s outlived its usefulness. It’s now in old age, and has outlived its design parameters.<p>I think it’s time to build a rotating space station.<p>We’ve got all the knowledge from a microgravity space station, as we’re going to get. The conclusion is that it sucks.  Humans are not meant to live in space without gravity. The muscle and bone deterioration is too great. And the eye damage is too great.<p>We need gravity. The question is whether we can get it from centripetal acceleration instead, to provide a long term habitation in space for humans.')
