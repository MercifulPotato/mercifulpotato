The article makes it seem like have an ego _at all_ makes one morally incompetent. We can genuinely strive to help, and we can also want to glean an egotistical sense of self-worth&#x2F;importance at the same time.<p>I think that one is morally incompetent when they _only_ strive to advance themselves through acts of kindness&#x2F;helping, or when their shallow act of do-gooding harms those who need help more than it helps them. But certainly we should be allowed to like helping because we feel good about ourselves, right?')
