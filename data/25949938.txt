Speculation, undervalue, overvalued, etc.  This does not seem like an open market if people cannot buy and sell at their own risk.<p>Sudden changes to what is allowed in the market could also cause some unknown shift to how it works.  If things are let to be, at least, at some time, things will settle down ... whether that takes a few days, weeks, years, decades.  I think that is how the market works.  There appears to be added controlling factors into the market.<p>I would rather be with a brokerage where I can make my own decisions.  Not one that suddenly controls what can and cannot be done.<p>TD &amp; Robinhood restricts certain trades:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;robinhood-app-td-ameritrade-restrict-trading-of-gamestop-amc-stock&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;robinhood-app-td-ameri...</a>')
