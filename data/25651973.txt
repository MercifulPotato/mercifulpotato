Or sometimes people do do this, and they get swept out of the market when a downturn happens.<p>Same thing with bonds, mortgages, and loans: there&#x27;s default risk.<p><i>Taking out debt</i> at a negative interest rate has no such default risk: since you borrowed the money in the first place, if you default the lender is out the principal, not you.<p>(It&#x27;s also worth noting that there <i>are</i> a few risk-free assets that offer yields higher than 0%: U.S. Treasuries, and U.S. savings accounts.  And there is a predictable carry trade of firms borrowing at 0 in the EU, converting their Euros to dollars, and then depositing in the U.S. at &gt; 0.  The risk then becomes currency risk, the chance that the dollar will depreciate, which is <i>also</i> happening.)')
