Neither this post not the front page of your brand vantage website say what your service actually does, or what problem it solves. Instead it piles jargon on top of jargon and seems obsessed with talking about brands, despite the product you are offering not having anything to do with brands or branding. On mobile at least all that is above the fold on Brandvantage is a meaningless statement: &quot;Data driven brands stand out&quot; That seems to have no connection to the service you are actually offering - a way of extracting structured data from websites. It wasn&#x27;t until I got to your use case page on brand vantage via the bottom footer that I managed to work out what your product does, which actually looks cool! You might have started by trying to build a &quot;digital brand expert&quot; Whatever that is, but that isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;ve ended up with so I&#x27;d suggest to stop viewing and promoting it via this lens.')
