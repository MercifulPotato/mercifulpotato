Whatever default Emacs can provide will be suboptimal for most users and cause additional dissatisfaction. People have a more open mind when when they <i>know</i> it doesn&#x27;t include an IDE and may have to work to get one up and going than if they simply see the default one and think that&#x27;s the best they&#x27;ll get with Emacs.<p>To give you an idea, I used Emacs as a programming editor for a decade, and only about 2 weeks ago did I first set it up as some kind of IDE (or rather, I just installed elpy and it did it all for me). I was perfectly happy without using it as an IDE - knowing the constraints that come with it.')
