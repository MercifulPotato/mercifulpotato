The man could have been a cult leader. He had and maybe still has power in his ability to speak. Any question we asked (and we were interns, we asked lots of them) he had not just an answer but a <i>good</i> answer. He spoke of his failures well too: &quot;They ask if we should make a video game console or a phone, and I chose the console- I should have said &#x27;both&#x27;!&quot;.<p>But nobody cares about how well you can speak. People want results.[0]<p>The original schedule for the event actually got cancelled at the last minute- there was a huge announcement that had to be made, a big deal that was going to change the face of Microsoft, and it overlapped with our time. He was very apologetic about that, and rescheduled us for the next week, and then spoke at length about this incredible thing that was about to happen.<p>That big announcement? Bing was teaming up with Yahoo on Search. (We all remember the day of that earth-changing event, right?)<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GrhSLf0I-HM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GrhSLf0I-HM</a>')
