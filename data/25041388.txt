(As long as you use decent frameworks and tooling.)<p>There are definite downsides versus eg REST (notably performance, which becomes harder to reason about), but it’s an acceptable trade-off for us.<p>I’m also optimistic about the great tooling that is improving all the time - eg Hasura, Postgraphile, Graphene-SQLAlchemy all solve N+1 today.')
