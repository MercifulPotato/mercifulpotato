Item(by='cycloptic', descendants=None, kids=[25860015], score=None, time=1611241468, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25859382, text='I am not saying don&#x27;t be pissed off, I am saying please channel that energy to help to fix the underlying problems&#x2F;attitudes. I can give suggestions on how to do this, if you&#x27;re interested to hear it, so we can maybe have a chance to finally get some issues fixed. Beating the same dead horse going on  years now is just not going to help this, regardless of what your perceptions of certain developer&#x27;s attitudes are.  If complaining about lost goodwill was ever a substitute for being persuasive and getting things done and taking initiative to restore the goodwill, it would have worked years ago, and we wouldn&#x27;t be here talking about this now.<p>And just to be clear, harassing developers who have said &quot;no I don&#x27;t want to work on feature XYZ&quot; is never acceptable and never has good results. If somebody says no and is just not interested, we leave them alone and we find someone else who does want to work on that feature.')
