I have a helper script (written by an ex-coworker&#x27;s father ...) that fetches + updates my master branch head to the proper place, without changing away from my current branch.<p>If I want to have things-from-master in my current branch, I either rebase my branch onto master or merge master into my branch. (I&#x27;m lucky that my branches are short-lived enough that rebasing on top of master is almost always easy and the right choice.) If I have unfinished things, I&#x27;ll make a &quot;WIP&quot; commit, that I will unroll later after doing the rebase.<p>I nearly never use `git blame` on the command line, but have a very frequently used hotkey bound to it in my editor to show the blame annotations.')
