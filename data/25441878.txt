I&#x27;m pretty sure kids are highly marketed. Toys, breakfast cereal, video games, etc... there are regulations and in the case of vices, outright restrictions... but at least in Europe and North America, advertising to children is  very common... much to the chagrin of parents who are currently being spammed by their kids for a Rocket League season pass because they were spammed by the ads on the Xbox.')
