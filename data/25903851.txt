We didn&#x27;t plot the performance for larger page sizes because in our machine they performed poorly, as you can already see from the configuration with 1024-byte pages. So we&#x27;re not favouring our approach at all.<p>Note also that next-gen memories have smaller and smaller access granularities. For example, the Intel&#x27;s Optane DC Persistent Memory accesses blocks of 256 bytes, while the Intel&#x27;s Optane DC SSD accesses blocks of 4 KB. I guess that data structures with blocks of 16K-256K are disproportionate in these cases.<p>About LSM-trees, nothing prevents you to use a PGM-index (which you can construct during the compaction of levels, thus without scanning data twice) to speed up the search on a long immutable level. Or also, to use a PGM-index on data which is organised into RLE-compressed disk pages ;)')
