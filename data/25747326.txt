I can also just imagine revoking old devices because I don&#x27;t use them anymore or have reinstalled them. In that case I wouldn&#x27;t want the things it signed to be revoked. (Really just saying don&#x27;t trust this key for anything in the future, but past things are fine).<p>Maybe the best solution would be revocation after a date. So you can say &quot;don&#x27;t trust anything after {time-i-lost-the-device}&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t trust anything after {now}&quot; and it does the right thing. However that could be complex to implement correctly in software. Lots of bookkeeping.')
