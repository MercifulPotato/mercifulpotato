They have a bunch of evolved survival-enhancing responses to specific stimuli, but it&#x27;s an over-generalization to say they have a generalized instinct to survive.<p>I really think you&#x27;re making something out of nothing, and this is no different from humans, and the entire argument over sense of self is an irrelevant tangent to everything I&#x27;ve said.<p>My ability to avoid dangerous situations and survive is philosophically no different from an amoeba, and I think all your arguments to the contrary are nonsensical.  You can easily concoct situations where humans would die too.  I&#x27;m getting weird Bible vibes honestly, since you seem to think humans are somehow special.')
