Item(by='maximente', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610606528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25772105, text='let&#x27;s take this to the logical extreme:<p>- everyone gets a flat payment<p>- in order to support this, taxes are raised on income<p>- ... however, ostensibly this is progressive (read: not flat and scales up with income) insofar as we don&#x27;t want to tax those who just received necessary payments<p>so, the best we can end up with in a theoretical world is a negative income tax by another name, with the 0% tax rate exactly at whatever the &quot;living wage&quot; is for NYC. this seems largely like means testing by another route (what is a &quot;living wage?&quot;), but i guess it&#x27;s simpler than bolting on another welfare matrix with cliffs, rules and such. pragmatically: good luck getting there.')
