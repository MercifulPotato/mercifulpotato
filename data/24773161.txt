That can easily be contrasted to Manhattan that was cleaned up by &quot;broken windows policy&quot;.  In SF the petty crime was rampant. Cars broken into, vandalism, drug use, theft and vagrancy(too bad it&#x27;s not illegal in SF).<p>There are no borders and nothing stopping people from moving their tax base down to the Peninsula (where the weather is better, schools are great and no one shits on your doorstep).<p>Good luck sf, you&#x27;ll need it.')
