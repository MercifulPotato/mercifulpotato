So I checked the code sizes for latest versions of both vim and neovim (from github):<p>- vim is at 900k (717k without po files)<p>- neovim is at 677k (562k without po files)<p>Savings of only 25% of code size is unfortunate. It&#x27;s even worse if we ignore the po data files (only 22%). I would like to see a fully-capable modern editor&#x2F;IDE for under 100k of clean, readable code. Until then, the quest goes on.')
