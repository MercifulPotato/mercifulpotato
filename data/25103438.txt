Item(by='davidhbolton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605464930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25102794, text='I lived in London for 20 years until I escaped five years ago, 15 years in a terrace street where parking occupancy was 85% or higher most of the time (except when Google last scanned it) and almost 100% in the evenings.<p>It was sometimes hard to get parked here never mind near your house or by a lamp post. Take a look at the street on Google street maps (Link below). These are old houses built over a century ago and many are now multiple occupancy with 1-3 cars per house. Counting lamp posts and cars (when full) there&#x27;s probably one lamp post to every 15-20 cars. So lamp post charging is not going to work practically here and this is typical of many such streets.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@51.5646881,-0.0087098,3a,75y,68.33h,78.95t&#x2F;data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sIOxp8RinqMxlmlvNTlM8ag!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?hl=en-GB" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@51.5646881,-0.0087098,3a,75y,68...</a>')
