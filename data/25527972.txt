Testing is not the only way to verify software additionally the error surface area of certain languages is simply much much smaller in most languages outside of c++.<p>This had nothing to do with a language saving your arse. This has everything to do with the simple non-existence of a type of bug in other languages, for example memory safety in rust and python.<p>Additionally c++ often simply does not tell you where an error occurs and you have to use a coredump to figure everything out. It&#x27;s not an offensive programming strategy by default. Python on the other hand makes every single type of error read like a c++ syntax error giving you a line number and an error type by default.<p>Another thing to consider is raw speed and lower memory requirements. These are the only advantages of c++. If your hardware isn&#x27;t strict on the above requirements consider micropython.<p>I&#x27;m finding c++ programmers have this very narrow and cocky view of the world. They turn their nose up at languages like python without truly experiencing how much life is easier and more productive in those worlds.')
