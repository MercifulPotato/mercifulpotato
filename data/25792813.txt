I&#x27;ve also been doing skin disease and illness detection, like Acne, Herpes, etc.<p>I haven&#x27;t been allowed in the App Stores as it&#x27;s been considered a Medical &quot;Diagnosis&quot; tool, which it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s an attempt at detecting and also state everywhere, it is NOT a diagnosis.<p>But, yeah, that&#x27;s what I have been doing.<p>Note: In time it will be better, I keep asking Vets and Animal shelters for photos of animals with Cataracts.')
