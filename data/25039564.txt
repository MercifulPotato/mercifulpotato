Are they pointing at the jump in D vote share, and then pointing at the influx of Milwaukees ballots? Milwaukee is excessively blue (86% to Biden). Why wouldn&#x27;t the vote share change drastically as that county came in? This is basic math. How does this point to fraud?<p>Also hilariously, they&#x27;re basing their whole argument off of this apparent &quot;trend&quot; that they haven&#x27;t supported of mail-in ballot share shifting from D to R... But then they provide an example of Georgia, where... that isn&#x27;t at all the case... and then gloss over it. Laughably bad analysis.<p>Took 20 minutes to confirm the &quot;trend&quot; and immediately none of the following states follow the &quot;trend&quot;: Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland --- aaaand I&#x27;ve stopped looking because this is silly.<p>Full disclosure, this was just a quick visual inspection of the data presented, plotting x=&#x27;vote_share_dem&#x27; against &#x27;timestamp&#x27;.')
