That&#x27;s a crap argument.<p>First, because enlarging some things (which necessitates belittling others) can help put an end to them.<p>Second, because forced labor and slavery are not that far off anyway. Both are depriving a person of their agency and steal their time and effort.<p>Third, because slavery itself was historically a spectrum. There were &quot;domestic slaves&quot; (sorta like Stephen in Django), cooks, nannys, teachers and &quot;butler&quot; types in charge of estate work in ancient Rome and Greece, etc.) that were treated and worked more or less like modern employees (except from the forced labor), even slaves in management of other slaves, and slaves that were chained, worked to the bone, beaten, raped, etc.')
