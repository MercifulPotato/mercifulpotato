At the same time it’s pretty impressive to have found this painting, it’s also pretty amazing that the vast majority of human history is almost entirely unknown to us.<p>For scale, this reaches back in time roughly 10-15% of the way to when Homo Sapiens first emerged.<p>Then again, it took us 66 years to go from the first human flight to landing a person on the moon, and 60 years hence we’ll have settled Mars, solved worldwide energy generation and storage, and invented AGI.<p>It’s just too bad we are unable to intellectually or socially progress at anywhere near the same rate as we scientifically progress.')
