Your firmware might not even need to be modified, though there is work being done on Klipper to run firmware directly on the steppers so each one is treated as an six board responsible for a specific function.<p>Nothing against your advice just providing another option that uses steppers that donâ€™t skip an occasional step (that is to say that if you ask for more torque from a stepper than it can handle, smart or not, it will not produce more torque out of thin air).')
