There is no guarantee.  It depends on what evolutionary options are available and what pressures are selecting mutations.<p>Pre-symptomatic infectiousness  has about the same selection pressure as low mortality rate IMO.  Low risk viruses circulate well because people donâ€™t care about transmission very much.  High risk infections cause people to take precaution and thus eliminates those stains.  SARS-COV-1 and MERS were that way.<p>But pre-symptomatic infectiousness (SARS-COV-2) makes this calculus immaterial for most people; they transmit it without knowledge.  This reduces the pressure on high mortality &#x2F; morbidity strains &#x2F; variants.')
