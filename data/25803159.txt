The EE went to Target and bought the card. The instructions including to reply to the e-mail with the card # so the CEO could include the number in the birthday card and not need the actual plastic.<p>The spoof was believable at first glance. It used the CEOs actual first name and obscured the actual source e-mail address with his company e-mail as the name. What should have given the engineer pause (among other things) was the context. There was no reason that the CEO would ask an engineer to do this task at my company.
