Brits have had that since the 70s with radio 4 producing great audio programs. Everything from science to history to drama to comedy. Their programming makes up a big chunk of the best podcasts and another chunk are ripoffs of BBC shows.<p>Streaming? BBC iPlayer was the trailblazer in that space.<p>And we&#x27;re still not done.<p>The UK has a similar problem to US media: its mostly owned by crazy right wingers and what isn&#x27;t spends a lot of time navel gazing and sharing cat in tree stories. Not the BBC, they keep breaking big stories. They don&#x27;t care or have to care about the editorial line or commercial interests of their advertisers or even their viewers prejudices. And educated, informed voters are one reason we have maintained (just) decent healthcare and a semi working benefit system. They actually force other media to be better. That&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t have Foxx news and our antivaxx movement is smaller than the US or Frances.<p>I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re perfect. I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re always right or they couldn&#x27;t do better.<p>I&#x27;m just saying, we need more than just the commercial model, be it ads or subscription based. There are 1001 things it doesn&#x27;t do well. It does other things great. But it can&#x27;t give you everything. Why not keep both?<p>Thanks for reading my rant.')
