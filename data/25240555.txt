And we&#x27;ve always measured the max value of all metrics, even when they are not exported to some external output and we just show the end-of-test summary.<p>It has been a while since I watched these Gil Tene talks, so I might be missing something, but I think the only remaining task we have is to adopt something like his HDR histogram library [2]. And that&#x27;s mostly for performance reasons, though we&#x27;ll probably play around with the correction logic as well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k6.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;using-k6&#x2F;scenarios&#x2F;arrival-rate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k6.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;using-k6&#x2F;scenarios&#x2F;arrival-rate</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;loadimpact&#x2F;k6&#x2F;issues&#x2F;763" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;loadimpact&#x2F;k6&#x2F;issues&#x2F;763</a>')
