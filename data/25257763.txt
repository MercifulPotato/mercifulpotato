Why does HN like being so pedantic about the definitions of words? This is an interesting post regarding AI and cellular biochemistry. \nDo we really need to add a philosophical debate about the meaning of &quot;solution&quot;? Personally I think anyone who can&#x27;t add to the discussion about AI and protein folding should just not comment, instead of settled on adding to the what does solution mean &quot;debate&quot;. I&#x27;d love to see a blanket rule flagging pedantic posts.')
