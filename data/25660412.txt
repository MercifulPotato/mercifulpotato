It&#x27;s internal data though.  It&#x27;s at the scale where no single machine could ever handle it though.  It&#x27;s replacing large proprietary systems like mainframes and teradata.<p>We wrote a framework to heavily simplify writing these ETL flows. No developer of the ETL flows is using Scala unless something custom is required. I wish we could opensource it.')
