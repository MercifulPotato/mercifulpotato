This mode requires a network connection at software installation time.<p>Reduced Security: Allows any version of signed operating system software ever trusted by Apple to run.”<p>⇒ it appears ‘other’ still requires OSes signed by Apple, but it allows you to run an OS even if Apple has no longer trusts it. Or am I misreading that?<p>So, there might be Apple-signed Linuxes, but I wouldn’t hold my breadth for that.')
