Respondents were presented with 13 options (including “Other” and “Don’t know”). We then grouped these options into four buckets:”</i><p><i>“We created and defined the variables based on the survey data result.”</i><p>Grouping questions after questionnaires were filled in (and, reading that second quote, taking the answers into account) opens the door for (possibly unconsciously) introducing bias.')
