In many of them not having an active registration&#x2F;inspection is grounds to having your vehicle seized. Even if it&#x27;s only used on private roads.<p>[Citation needed]<p>In all jurisdictions I&#x27;ve lived, you can put your vehicle into &quot;planned non-operation&quot; status, where it no longer requires registration.<p>&gt; Where is the outrage of this happening right now? We&#x27;ve already crossed that line.<p>I find civil asset forfeiture outrageous. There you go. We&#x27;ve discussed it a lot here, and most of us hate it and see it as nothing more than legalized theft.<p>&gt; And &quot;punish&quot; only works if you&#x27;re not offered compensation. If the government says &quot;hey as your representatives we&#x27;re going to ban xyz for this health reason, and provide compensation for buying them back from you&quot; then it&#x27;s fine.<p>Compensation for a buy back is very different from compensation for <i>seizure</i>. From a policy perspective a buy back is probably a great idea, but let&#x27;s not pretend that it&#x27;s anywhere near the same legal ballpark as seizure, even with compensation.<p>&gt; Again I&#x27;m not saying the government should waste resources going and finding wood burning systems and seizing them. However the government can ban the operation of it.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that banning ownership and banning operation are very different beasts. Leaded gasoline is illegal (well, for cars); if you have a car that for whatever reason needed leaded gasoline then operating it is illegal. But it&#x27;s not illegal to <i>own</i> a car that requires leaded gasoline. The legal leap from &quot;you can&#x27;t run this because it will hurt people&quot; to &quot;you can&#x27;t own a thing that was once legal and now isn&#x27;t because you <i>might</i> use it and that would hurt people&quot; is immense.<p>For the record, I&#x27;m fine in principle with banning inefficient fireplaces, although I think that such a ban would be effectively impossible to enforce. I think that optional buybacks for inefficient wood burners and incentives to upgrade to (increasingly tightly regulated) stoves is a good policy move. What I don&#x27;t support is the leap from &quot;this thing is bad, and therefore we should make it illegal for you to own&quot;. That is an immensely bad habit to get into, for the reasons I&#x27;ve mentioned above.')
