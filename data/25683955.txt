A tick appears beside it. You can continue to tap on other chats to select multiple chats. A Bin icon will appear at the top to delete them.<p>I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so difficult about that.<p>[and, like a previous commenter, I never delete chats either but I sussed that out in about 2 seconds by following the standard Android convention of tapping and holding on items in a list, to make multiple selections.]<p>I also find it odd you condemn Telegram for its &#x27;poor interface&#x27; when it&#x27;s generally recognised as being one of the most polished of the various chat apps you list.<p>I&#x27;ve recently come to Telegram after years of using Wire and becoming frustrated with its stagnated development and user-hostile dev team. Before settling on Telegram, I also kicked the tyres on Signal and several other secure messengers and Telegram was lightyears ahead of them all, in terms of features and usability.')
