That would make it about 3-4% of &quot;high finance&quot; positions* so far moved out of the UK into the EU. That&#x27;s not an exodus yet, but it&#x27;s not nothing either.<p>Then again, a lot of the transitions aren&#x27;t finished yet either, and a lot of it is dependent on the final Deal or No Deal. It also takes time to do the groundwork if you want to move, like create the legal infrastructure and entities and the associated due diligence, rent office space, hire or relocate people, and so on.<p>So, it&#x27;s too early yet to conclude anything in either direction, in my opinion.<p>[*] Hard to tell what is the true number of &quot;high finance&quot; employees in the UK. Given there are roughly 180K finance and insurance employees in the City of London, and most of the &quot;high finance&quot; is concentrated there, I&#x27;d guestimate 200-250K such &quot;high finance&quot; employees in the UK total, but I could be massively wrong. There are numbers putting the full time financial and insurance employees in the UK at 1.1M employees, but that includes bank tellers dealing with people wanting to buy a house and agents selling life insurance, etc.')
