For context, I am 27, live in Finland and don&#x27;t have full bonuses.<p>Granted, the online prices usually suck compared to what you can get once you call (or get called by) an agent. If I tried buying my current insurance for my car it&#x27;s giving me 1100 €&#x2F;year whereas my actual price is 940 €&#x2F;year.<p>A 2015 Mercedes-Benz GLA45 (49,000 €) would cost me 1380 €&#x2F;year or 2040 €&#x2F;year with all bells and whistles.')
