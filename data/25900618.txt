It analyzes your usage of features in your current operating system, and uses Deep Learning to provide you with source code with just those features as efficiently as possible (uses approximate solutions to NP-complete algorithms), scoured from open source projects meeting your specified license requirements. Paid features include finding the fastest + bug free drivers. For substantially more money you can get a machine-generated proof of theoretical correctness of a component, including Deeply Learned bug fixes. (Not to be confused with AIX, which is still handmade, or with AIX11 which uses convolved neural networks run on the hn-x11-complaints BigData-set to write a custom X11 server that is still remoteable but also Modernly Designed)')
