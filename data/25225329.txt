This could hopefully accelerate mini-CPU companies springing up with their own ARM64 chips producing their own hardware running Windows ARM64. Google is rumored to be designing their own CPUs for future high-powered Chromebooks and Pixel phones. Qualcomm has an ARM64 chip powering the Microsoft Surface ProX but it’s nowhere near the performance levels of M1. Microsoft is starting to experiment with CPUs with the Pluton chip, maybe they will design an “M1” flagship chip going forward for their own Surface product line.')
