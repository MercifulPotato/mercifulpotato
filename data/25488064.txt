It just argues that the survivors are more genetically fit for survival. This aligns with GP&#x27;s comment.<p>The Selfish Gene theory argues that behaviours among the group tend toward preservation of the genotype. Family over strangers, generally.<p>I do take issue with GP&#x27;s &quot;evolutionary purpose&quot; -- these two words cannot be combined in a meaningful way. But, interpreted as &quot;evolutionary contribution&quot;, it could make sense.<p>All that said, I also don&#x27;t think that GP&#x27;s idea floats, nor does it hold water. Genetic predisposition to depression is very poorly understood, but seems (to me) to be just ordinary phenotypical noise in the signal. Quasi-random variation which is to be expected in any sufficiently complicated system.')
