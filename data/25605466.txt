I joined a team that was on a project behind schedule.<p>Our manager was a brusque, no-nonsense sort of dude. But he clearly had anger problems. On the team were 2 senior engineers, me, and a junior engineer that had just completed his internship and was on a work Visa.<p>As the project got closer to the deadline, and the scope increased, the manager got agitated. In our team meetings, he would start yelling at us. People down the hallways would stare at us with those &quot;looks.&quot; In our 1:1s he told us we might not have a job if our product doesn&#x27;t ship on time (we were competing with another internal team to beat them to the punch.)<p>The two senior engineers decided they&#x27;d had enough and quit the team. The manager told us to work overtime (no overtime pay, but we had to for fear of our job). He promised us that if we did it that we would get a month of vacation on him, and that he could secure it for us.<p>The product released. After countless nights of overtime we did it. Our manager left, our guarantee of a month of vacation evaporated, and for the next three months, us two junior engineers were left on 24&#x2F;7 primary&#x2F;secondary on-call for a critical service. It was a nightmare. Calls at 3 AM, 6 AM, on weekends.<p>Our manager got a promotion and is fairly high up at Apple now.<p>Horrible experience. I left for a new company that pays me nearly double.')
