Applications go. Applications come again and go again. But - the data, the data - oh, it stays and stays and stays and is used by application after application after application. And if you store your data perfectly for &quot;the first application&quot;, it&#x27;ll not be good for the future ones. And I don&#x27;t see tons of data that isn&#x27;t used by many applications (need many views of the same data). See, my goal is the data - knowing that applications are like Mayflies but data is more like a tree.&quot;')
