Out of those three&#x2F;four, only one tries to keep devices working and up to date as long as possible...<p>iOS&#x2F;OSX allows central updating, but drops phones older than 5 years, and desktop&#x2F;laptops from 5-7 years depending on the product series; users cannot maintain the OS themselves and are forced to abandon the device.<p>Android allows users to update the OS themselves against the wishes of the phone&#x27;s OEM, but Google cannot force OEMs to continue supporting a phone within a reasonable timeframe (ie, no phone younger than 5 years should be dropped, yet is an unfortunately frequent occurrence with Android-hostile OEMs).<p>Microsoft tries to keep Windows running on PCs an absurdly long time, but users choose to fight Microsoft on this even when its in their best interest (ex: people still willingly run 7, even though 10 performs better, with less crashes, more performance, and less security bugs).<p>Alas, the dream of a Windows Phone is dead. Other than that, its most certainly an odd phrase in that article given what iOS does, since the user can still choose to go the third party Android ROM route if their OEM has truly abandoned them.')
