People start to inflate the number of reports and no longer care about proper severity assignment as long as it get them that coveted &quot;security bug&quot; checkbox. I mean I can see how bounty programs and projects like hackerone can be beneficial, but this is one of the downsides of it.<p>CNA system actually is better since it at least puts some filter on it - before it was Wild West, anybody could assign CVE to any issue in any product without any feedback from anybody knowledgeable in the code base and assign any severity they liked, which led to wildly misleading reports. I think CNA at least provides some sourcing information and order to it.')
