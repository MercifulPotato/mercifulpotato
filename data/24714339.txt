Item(by='sizzle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602116130, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707409, text='Maybe include any class action lawsuits, recalls issued, Etc.<p>Also don&#x27;t let pissed off people derail product ratings because they are unhappy.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of a Wirecutter product research methodology and wiki below to list breakdown of materials, where they were sourced, changes in materials by manufacturer in later product updates, etc.<p>Let the users duke it out in the discussion section.<p>Basically avoid being Yelp and full of amateur reviews and people gaming the review system.<p>I would love for this to be an open source &#x27;consumer affairs&#x27; product quality watchdog&#x2F;authority. Too many times do manufacturers do a bait and switch where the first version has durable parts then subsequent versions are tweaked with cost cutting measures and you have inferior pieces that breakdown when they&#x27;ve captured a large market share of customers.<p>Unlike software, there is no &#x27;what&#x27;s new in this update&#x27; readme overview and you never really know if the manufacturer decided to cut corners by using a factory in Shenzhen that mass produces cheapo materials when they were previously made in a factory in middle America with a higher standard of quality, etc.<p>Thoughts?')
