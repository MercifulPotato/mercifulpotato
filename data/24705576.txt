But candidate no. 1 likely would not qualify.<p>You seem to think that the H1 program should place candidate 1 over candidate 2.<p>Let me give you a counterexample: Suppose you are hiring candidate 1 to write an app that will help you single men find hot women to date in a 5 mile radius in your 4-billion dollar, VC-backed startup.<p>The second candidate is being hired into the body shop that has been contracted to develop a UI for a CAT scan machine produced by a major healthcare company.<p>Now tell me who should be preferred.<p>It&#x27;s possible to make many value judgments like you and I have done, but at the end of the day they can&#x27;t all be incorporated into the immigration law. Making the market the arbiter of what&#x27;s valuable appears to me to be the least bad option, and strengthening that is the best, given the constraints. It still won&#x27;t make the law conform to everyone&#x27;s tastes, though.')
