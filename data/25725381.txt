My understanding is 100% of the gun deaths were from guns in the hands of law enforcement officers who were perfectly capable of defending themselves when pushed. There are a bunch of instantly iconic photos [0] with basically no weapons in the hands of protestors. They clearly didn&#x27;t plan on breaching the Capitol or they&#x27;d have realised that they were all about to go to jail forever.<p>This is a not a mob out for literal blood.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edition.cnn.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;capitol-mob-deaths&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edition.cnn.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;capitol-mob-deaths&#x2F;ind...</a>')
