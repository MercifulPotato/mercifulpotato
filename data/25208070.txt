Item(by='kwhitefoot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606303085, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25207724, text='&gt; Why would you subsidize food production within a geographical region for any other reason than food security?<p>Here in Norway food security is only one of the reasons, at least it seems that way.  Another very important one is that a farm requires workers, machinery, and material.  The workers need doctors and their children need schools, the machinery needs mechanics, the material (fuel, fertiliser, cement, wood, etc.) needs transport.  So by subsidizing a farm thousand metres up  a mountain we generate enough business to keep a small community alive and prospering where otherwise there would be no one.  This in turn means that there will be people nearby who will see an opportunity for other businesses such as tourism.<p>This means that on the 700 km journey through the mountains from Oslo to Trondheim you are rarely more than a few tens of km from the nearest petrol station, fast food outlet, hotel, and that it is rare to drive more than a few km without seeing a house or cabin.<p>Without farming in the valleys there would be no secure employment in these areas because the only other income is from tourism which is very seasonal and also easily disrupted by events such as COVID or any downturn in the economy.')
