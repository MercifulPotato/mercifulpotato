Best to avoid that, especially in case like this when the topic is likely to be interesting to the communityâ€”it will probably have the opposite effect to what you intend.<p>I&#x27;m going to put this post in the second-chance queue [1] because, like I said, it seems like the community may find it interesting to discuss, and also the project hasn&#x27;t had much discussion on HN for a few years. But please avoid this kind of thing in the future!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11662380" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11662380</a>')
