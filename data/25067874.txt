Think of the axiom of choice, the law of excluded middle, the axiom of inaccessible cardinals, etc.<p>For the second, understanding why and actually proving something can be related but they&#x27;re not equivalent. Of course, the intuitive ideas can lead to the right formal technicalities but it is not always the case.<p>There are two aspects of mathematical proofs-communication of ideas and formal verification. Confusing these distinction can be dangerous and this is why mathematicians led to the area of type theory and formal proofs.<p>Voedovsky, you can google him to find who he was, lost his faith in &quot;human proof checking&quot; after some error on his peer-reviewed and published result was accidentally discovered after years of nobody doubting its validity.<p>He dreamed of the world where people do and enjoy mathematics freely leaving the boring parts to computers like mathematicians in nowadays don&#x27;t worry about how their writing will be published and communicated. What we do is write a proof and leave actual typesetting to the computer. It&#x27;s called (La)TeX.<p>What you&#x27;re saying is like claiming this program is correct because its logic is correct without ever knowing whether the code itself would get compiled or not. More extremely, there&#x27;s no value for having more and more pseudocodes that we don&#x27;t know they&#x27;ll ever terminate or not.')
