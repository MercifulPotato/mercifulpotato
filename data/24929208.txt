Of course if you stick to small changes it tends towards the patch model. However thete still some cases where two or three commits at once make sense. Even rarer there are cases where marging a bunch of changes into a &quot;staging&quot; branch before merging to master makes sense. I think this added flexibility is valuable, of course keeping the &quot;patch style&quot; single-commjt review great should probably be the priority.')
