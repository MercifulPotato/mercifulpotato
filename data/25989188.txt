My org is moving from a largely managed network into AWS, and now we have to configure the whole network and external gateways ourselves? What engineer wants to do this?<p>VPCs are virtual, but I don&#x27;t need VPCs, I need the entire network layer virtualized and abstracted. As you suggested,just grouping devices in a single network and saying &quot;let them all talk to each other, let this one talk to that one over this port&#x2F;IP&quot; should be all I describe. Let AWS figure out CIDR, routing, gateways, etc.')
