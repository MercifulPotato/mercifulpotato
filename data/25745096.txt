Item(by='kjksf', descendants=None, kids=[25745203, 25745205], score=None, time=1610448747, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25743726, text='So much discussion about a lawsuit that is nothing but a conspiracy theory formatted as a legal case.<p>I encourage everyone to read the first few pages of filing.<p>Parler alleges 2 things:<p>1. Anti-trust: Amazon kicked off Parler because it colluded with Twitter because Parler is a competitor to Twitter hence they violated The Sherman Act.<p>The reason this will fail is because Parler presented 0 evidence to support their allegations.<p>Evidence is the thing that differentiates a wrongdoing that can be litigated from a crackpot conspiracy theory.<p>This is a crackpot conspiracy theory and I can&#x27;t wait to read the rebuttal from Amazon&#x27;s lawyers. It&#x27;s going to be a hoot.<p>2. Breach of contract: &quot;it says we get 30 days notice and we didn&#x27;t get 30 days&quot;.<p>Apparently Parler conveniently left out other parts of the contract.<p>One, the part that says you don&#x27;t always get the 30 days.<p>Two, the part that says contract disputes are resolved via arbitration, not litigation.<p>So it&#x27;s not going to fly either and is pointless to begin with.<p>The only remedy Parler could ask for is money and I&#x27;m sure Amazon will happily refund them 3 months of fees if for some unimaginable reason the court finds they did indeed breach the contract.')
