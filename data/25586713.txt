Works great with both USB-PD and regular USB-C chargers and cables. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nullsum.net&#x2F;posts&#x2F;usbc-mod-new-2ds-xl&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nullsum.net&#x2F;posts&#x2F;usbc-mod-new-2ds-xl&#x2F;</a><p><i>Now, in the days of complex calculated power delivery negotiation, a hack like this would be impossible.</i><p>The only devices I&#x27;ve seen _require_ USB-PD are PC&#x27;s. All the modern phones, headphones, and gaming handhelds I&#x27;ve seen with USB-C do not require USB-PD and charge just fine with a USB-A to USB-C cable.<p>Better yet, these devices all use a standard USB-C port instead of a proprietary one. The only gotcha is that some USB-C devices break spec and don&#x27;t work with some USB-C to USB-C cables. Both the Pi 4 and RG351P suffer from this.')
