I remember once seeing a comprehensive guide on code signing, but over the years it appears to have been scrubbed from their documentation resources. In its place is a much less helpful (but prettier-looking) guide.<p>In comparison, I&#x27;ve noticed Android has FANTASTIC developer documentation. I&#x27;ve found full guides for everything. Even esoteric classes that are rarely used have at least a little bit of documentation.')
