This is very different from saying &#x27;we have disproven the possibility of x&#x27;, but this is the way it is generally understood by the general public. Healthy skepticism is important, but it often devolves into emotionally charged ridicule (see Richard Dawkins for an example) which has nothing to do with objective science at all.')
