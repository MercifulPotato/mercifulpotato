There are objective measures for certain types of productivity: library downloads, Stackoverflow points, blog views, GitHub stars.<p>I see developers adding high value features to the Apache Spark codebase that&#x27;s used by hundreds of thousands of people.  The top Apache Spark Stackoverflow question responder has hundreds of thousands of points (their answers are always the best).<p>Some folks build libraries that get thousands of downloads a day.<p>There are even popularity gauges that can be used for internal projects.  Who is building the code that everyone is using and who is building stuff that gets thrown out.<p>This article also makes the fallacy of equating productivity with working hours.  Working hours + productivity are correlated (top Spark devs seem to work constantly), but I also see people that work really hard and can&#x27;t get traction for any of their open source &#x2F; internal projects.<p>The power law is at play in software.  A relatively small number of developers write the code that gets used the most.  Yea, that might not be true for a given web app, but it&#x27;s definitely the case for software overall.')
