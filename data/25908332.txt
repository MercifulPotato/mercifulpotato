Why on earth should we <i>trust</i> Google will limit their collection to this one method? They&#x27;ve lied over and over about what they collect. Been caught multiple times breaking laws to collect information only to say &quot;Oops, it was a rough engineer&quot;. They&#x27;ve been caught bypassing the no-tracking flag in browsers. They&#x27;ve been caught abusing location data after users disabled it.<p>As the saying goes: Burn me once, shame on you. Burn me 750 times, why in the fuck am I still using Google?')
