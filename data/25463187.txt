Yes, if you got fat, you consumed more calories than you used up. The solution will require getting closer to balance.<p>2. The actionable way to achieve that is non-trivial. Different foods with same amount of calories have different physiological effects, including which hormones are produced with what timings and what neural circuitry is activated. This leads to different degrees of psychological fullness, cravings and potential for addiction. They may also promote more laziness or more fidgety behavior which itself can make more difference than often imagined.
