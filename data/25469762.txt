While the mental gymnastics performed to convince everyone onboard that this is the case are fun to watch, it tragic to see nearly all good projects slowly devolving into ways of tricking the users... and in most cases still losing money.\n&lt;&lt;&lt;<p>As an anecdotal point of one, I can confirm that literally none of that is true for the startup I am working for, and we are doing quite well.<p>Of course, it probably helps that our founders have actual industry and startup experience, and are not pushover adult children like you might find on the Silicon Valley hbo show.')
