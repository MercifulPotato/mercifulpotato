This will come with a huge risk of losing everything.<p>A core element of finance is that risk and return are not just related to each other, they are sort of like inverse sides of the same underlying thing. Reward is always a premium for risk, because if something had a reward with no risk it would be consumed infinitely until there was none of it left. If something had risk with no reward why would you do it?<p>So the only real answer to this question is to figure out what risks you are willing to take in life that reach the maximum level of reward. This could be career risk like being an employee in a startup, this could be financial risk like buying a bunch of bitcoin or even just general life risk like saying the whole thing isn&#x27;t worth it and going to travel.<p>The only advice I can give you generally is that financial reward comes to those who make themselves valuable to people solving problems with high financial stakes, that could be as an employee or owner themselves. If you figure out the biggest problem you can solve in the area with the most money at stake you are likely to benefit monetarily.<p>Also I disagree that statistically, shuffling between startups is a good bet and it has a large number of outcomes where you do really poorly.')
