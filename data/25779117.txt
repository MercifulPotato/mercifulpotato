Companies might love to talk about how important engineers are, but at the end of the day, if you can&#x27;t directly link someone to revenue, they get viewed as a cost center and take on second tier status in the organization. Then the same companies complain that they can&#x27;t find enough (or retain) engineering talent. Not many places get the balance right. Silicon valley treats engineers well because for the most part, the value they bring is more obvious (and also, they don&#x27;t threaten the existing hierarchy in the company). Curious to hear if anyone has had the opposite experience.')
