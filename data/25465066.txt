Apple benefits from their revenue stream not being dependent on advertising, but they&#x27;re just as unjust in locking down their devices and preventing competition and open computing.<p>At the end of the day, I think lack of freedom is worse than eroded privacy. They&#x27;re both bad, but freedom is essential.')
