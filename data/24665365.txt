Item(by='Arnavion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601662484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24659429, text='I use it too, because it&#x27;s the best one for my use case - it&#x27;s not a website, it&#x27;s in my distro&#x27;s repo, and I just need something I can copy the links to feed items &#x2F; open them in a browser rather than read them in the reader itself. (Most of my subscriptions are youtube channels.)<p>But it&#x27;s very buggy. Every so often it pops up an old feed as if it&#x27;s unread. Sometimes it adds new unread feeds with empty titles. I like to delete feeds after I&#x27;ve read them, but sometimes the delete option doesn&#x27;t do anything, but if I change to another directory and back the item is gone.<p>There&#x27;s long-standing open bugs for some &#x2F; all of these.')
