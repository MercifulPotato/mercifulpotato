Nothing in the federal statute allows an entity to terminate copyright, effectively putting works in the public domain.<p>The United States also allows authors (and heirs), except work-for-hires, to clawback copyright transfers and terminate licenses after 35 years. This is an inalienable statutory right, which means it cannot be waived even with a contract.')
