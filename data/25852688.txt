You will find that the same same man who judges art by the artist, will also easily be convinced that the exact same dish tastes better, if he be told it was more expensive.</i><p>If someone perceives the exact same dish as tasting better because it was more expensive (and&#x2F;or in a fancier setting, with fancy table linens and silverware, a live quartet playing classical music, etc) then to that person it IS better.  Perceiving something as being better is literally all that matters.<p>To look at it another way, removing one&#x27;s sense of smell will make the same dish <i>taste</i> worse.  Smell is a factor in one&#x27;s perception of taste, as are other environmental factors.')
