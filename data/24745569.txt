When most people talk about investing in index funds they&#x27;re largely talking about funds like eg. $SPY, not total market funds like $VTI.<p>There&#x27;s certainly a case to be made that increasing passive investing in certain indices (like $SPY) causes companies within the index to be overvalued simply because of the nature of passive investing. You often see companies getting a big boost in their share price simply for joining the S&amp;P, even though reason would dictate that there&#x27;s nothing fundamentally different about the company.<p>The usual counterargument to this is that we should reach an equilibrium where active managers will then be free to invest in companies that are undervalued simply because they&#x27;re not a part of an index, but of course that also is making a number of assumptions.<p>Without reading the article too deeply I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s Burry&#x27;s specific criticism, but it&#x27;s one that&#x27;s not uncommon and certainly isn&#x27;t completely outlandish.')
