The very first thing I associate with obtaining power via class divides is Karl Marx. There&#x27;s also Mao, Lenin, Pol Pot, and anybody in modern USA politics who complains about the &quot;1%ers&quot; or &quot;income inequality&quot;. I&#x27;m really really not seeing how that matches up as you claim it does. I think you need to accept the uncomfortable and obvious conclusion here.')
