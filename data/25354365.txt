The more knobs you add the more complex your support becomes (both front line and automated tests) and your support costs skyrocket (now 1% of your users are turning on knobs you haven’t tested and those are 30% of your support costs). There’s a balance to be struck for sure and OSS can some times try to ignore the support cost because it’s just “spare time”. There’s still a cost though.<p>There’s also something to be said for sensible abstractions. Even if the power users don’t have the control they want, the solution works for 90% of all other users. For an example of this look to Apple. They regularly sacrifice the power users for the security and convenience of the general customer. From a profit, support and just pure “% of satisfied users” that’s the right balance. Don’t get me wrong. They don’t get it right for every single little thing, but in aggregate when there’s a conflict and your market is the “general” user, trying to stay appealing to the power users is still likely the wrong choice.')
