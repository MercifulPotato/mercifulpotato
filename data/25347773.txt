I think the distinction between taste-driven preference vs technical superiority is important (maybe a more interesting discussion would surround the juxtaposition of audio gear and organic&#x2F;non-gmo food marketing).<p>But, I do think the same kind of &quot;objectively irrelevant&quot; upsell _does_ occur with the other non-taste-driven markets (electronic peripherals, sporting gear, etc).<p>I&#x27;m not trying to come across as combative - I&#x27;m just trying to figure out why the consumer side of the &quot;audiophile&quot; market gets such a bad wrap. As I commented elsewhere, I think a majority of people who are &quot;into&quot; sound gear don&#x27;t buy into the snake-oil of special ethernet cables... just as I don&#x27;t think most consumers opt for gold-plated display cables. However, there are distinctions between different monitors and TVs; people seem to agree that they are perceptible, and they don&#x27;t bat an eye at someone spending a bit of their time figuring out the optimal display for their situation and price point. I think I&#x27;m just trying to understand why, when someone compares headphones to other headphones based on pricepoint, they are assumed to be ceramic-cable-buying elitists.')
