The number of single-threaded benchmarks are irrelevant to this point: when the M1 was compared to the 5950X in a multithreaded comparison:<p>* The 5950X was 2x faster\n* The 5950X was using 4x the power (28W system vs 105W+ for the processor).\n* The M1 only has 4 performance cores, the 5950X has 16.<p>Even counting the high-efficiency cores as full cores in the comparison has the M1 with 8-cores providing 1&#x2F;2 the performance of the 5950X with 16-cores, i.e. it implies that the lower performance cores are providing as much as the 5950X cores.<p>That is certainly not the 5950X obliterating the M1, as the article stated (and was the quote that started this thread) the M1 is giving the 5950X a good run for its money. If you think otherwise could you provide some kind of argument for why you think so?')
