I told you it was rigged!&quot; for another two months, again without presenting any evidence at all.<p>They those very same folks turn around and say &quot;people are concerned that the election was rigged?  How could that be unless there are questions that need to be answered!&quot;<p>Widespread fraud in US elections is damn near impossible.    Each county runs their own elections, all 3,143 of them.<p>And each of those 3,143 counties have their own election boards, election commissioners (of both major parties), poll workers, polling&#x2F;canvassing observers (for each candidate from every party on each of 3,143 different ballots).<p>There are tens of thousands of people involved with interested observers from all sides watching the voting and the counting.<p>As such, some sort of widespread conspiracy makes no sense.  As Ben Franklin is purported to have said, &quot;three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.&quot;  Thousands?  I think not.<p>What&#x27;s more, more than 60 lawsuits (heard by judges of all political stripes, many of whom were appointed by Trump himself) in seven states showed no evidence of voting irregularities that could have affected the outcome.<p>Note that I said &quot;irregularities&quot; and not &quot;fraud&quot; or &quot;cheating.&quot;  Because except for those whack jobs Powell and Lin, who were laughed out of court for, not lack of evidence, but <i>no</i> evidence at all, none of the other lawsuits even alleged, let alone provided <i>any</i> evidence of fraud.<p>It was a prime example of The Big Lie[0].  And it worked.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Big_lie" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Big_lie</a>')
