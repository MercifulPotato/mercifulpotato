They usually break the carbs down by sugar and other.  It is also by g.  Also under a particular amount per serving they are allowed to say &#x27;0&#x27;.  For example a box of tic-tacs is almost nothing but sugar.  But it says 0.  So serving size maters.  It is also another way they will play games is by fiddling the &#x27;serving&#x27; size.  When everyone really knows the serving size is 1 container.  It may say 2 or 3 per container.  Or they may measure it by &#x27;1 cup&#x27; which for something like chips is a small amount of chips.  But they are high in carbs.  So you have to know the games played there too.  That varies by manufacture.  You could say better if those games are played there.<p>The thing is until you look you do not realize how much sugar is in everything and how many different &#x27;types&#x27; there are.<p>A good rule of thumb when shopping in an american store is stick to the edges.  The middle is full of processed stuff that usually has sugar.  Not all processed is bad.  For example a nice salsa is processed but not terrible for you and a decent time saver and usually tastes nicer than anything I have come up with.  Like you point out you have to watch the labels.')
