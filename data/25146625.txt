I&#x27;m in a part of Australia that had a lockdown and we&#x27;ve rolled back most of the restrictions because we&#x27;re successfully basically eliminated the virus in our state (in the community that is - we have a few cases in quarantine of people arriving internationally every couple of days).<p>The feeling is that people want to get back to normal, but understand that most of the regulations were necessary given the seriousness of the pandemic. I feel absolutely no sense that people are more willing to submit to Government control now or anything like that, and it&#x27;s the same even talking to people down in Victoria that had a big second wave and way longer lockdown than we did. Their willingness to comply was to stop the spread of the virus so they could get out of lockdown, and it worked, and now the restrictions are being rolled back.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating to hear people in the media here crowing on about &#x27;authoritarianism&#x27; and &#x27;government control&#x27; over this, especially because the State Governments that are in charge of pandemic restrictions have demonstrated little desire to maintain restrictions longer than was sensible given the virus. But at the same time, these conservative commentators who are aligned with our right-wing Federal Government happily ignore actual authoritarian, draconian laws that the Feds are passing to give police and intelligence services unprecedented powers for warrantless mass surveillance etc. over the last decade...<p>I&#x27;d even go as far as saying that the pandemic would actually be a really bad time for a Government to try and &#x27;normalise&#x27; increased government control, because there&#x27;s no legitimate or logical reason to maintain it once the pandemic is over (if we get a vaccine for instance). The desire to throw off all the restrictions once the virus is gone is just too strong.')
