Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=[25603400], score=None, time=1609510182, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25602950, text='I&#x27;d like to see more government investment into domestic industries, however I believe that the semiconductor manufacturing market is already heavily saturated. R&amp;D is welcome but beyond ensuring independence from foreign manufacturing there are not that many benefits that you would expect from this example of government stimulus. This industry primarily hires high skilled workers but unless they also directly fund the education of those high skilled workers it&#x27;s not going to result in less underemployment.<p>I mean come on, the existing semiconductor industry in the EU has found it&#x27;s niche. It&#x27;s already well developed. If there really was a shortage of domestic semiconductor products then these companies would have been able to make a killing with their local fabs because corona related shipping restrictions resulted in a lack of supply from foreign nations. They wouldn&#x27;t need the government stimulus and stand on their own.<p>It would make more sense to use this government stimulus on reducing CO2 emissions because most nations do not have economic incentives for reducing CO2 emissions. With our current economic models environmentalism amounts to charity and charity is one thing the government is very good at. The reason why I bring up CO2 reductions is because they are inherently domestic. You cannot put CO2 or electricity on a container ship and move the problem to a different country. A lot of the work also involves simple manual labor which helps with the underemployment problem for low skilled workers.')
