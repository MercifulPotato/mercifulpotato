Why make a new rowing machine when Concept 2 is the calibration standard all athletes use and has a relatively open USB interface?<p>For those not in the know, rowing machines all have different calibrations.  C2 is the standard because they&#x27;re very consistent across machines and are by far the best made allowing for many thousands of hours of use without failures. Most experienced rowers won&#x27;t touch anything other than a C2.<p>Edit: reading further, the &#x27;moat&#x27; here appears to be electrically controlled 100lb high resistance settings.  Be VERY careful with this.  It&#x27;s well established that most non-trained athletes will hurt themselves with this feature as it&#x27;s a common trope on C2 machines.  The rowing posture can be rather dangerous for high weight if misused.')
