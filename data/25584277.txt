The blog itself doesn&#x27;t feel like a discussion platform to me like HN, reddit, etc. Those platforms have systems, rules, moderators, etc. for dealing with more free-form discussions.<p>I personally never read comments on blogs and I find having a &quot;Contact Me&quot; link at the bottom is better. On my blog I use a gmail account and a template for new articles so I get `[Contact Me](emailto:my.email+shorttitle@gmail.com)` so they&#x27;re easy to categorize.')
