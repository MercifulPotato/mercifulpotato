I&#x27;m addicted to youtube, just spent ~6 hours watching an assortment of videos, starting with reactions and ending with people scamming scammers. Having to work remotely has made my job even harder, now I can watch youtube without someone noticing. Every morning at the standup call I have to think of new excuses and invent things that I haven&#x27;t actually done.<p>I have tried leechblock, but then I just install a new browser. I have a firefox, chomimum and and the latest addition Brave.<p>Is there a way I could make watching youtube harder for myself. Nothing seems to work. And it al starts with: &quot;I will just watch this one videos...&quot; and few hours later I&#x27;m so frustrated that I will just continue watching because I don&#x27;t want to face the consequences.')
