If that wood is burned in a campfire, you get back CO2 in air, and water as vapor, and minerals as ash, and (some of) the sunlight as redder light and heat.<p>A related common misconception is to forget that plants, like us and most life, burn carbohydrates to CO2.  Rainforest trees for instance, are only <i>net</i> consumers of CO2 for a couple of hours around noon.<p>I&#x27;d like to see science education content that weaves stories like this into a coherent tapestry.  A rough-quantitative tapestry.  Enabling transferable understanding.    But we&#x27;re a long long way from that.  If anyone knows of a community pushing in that direction, I&#x27;d love to hear of it.')
