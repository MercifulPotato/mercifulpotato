The defining characteristic of roguelikes is exploring game mechanics amidst permadeath.<p>The problem is no one agrees on what those defining characteristics are. You&#x27;ve given your opinion, but it&#x27;s just an opinion. It&#x27;s highly subjective. I hear people all the time say the same thing &quot;it&#x27;s self evident!&quot; and then go on to list &quot;turn based&#x2F;grid based&quot; as the self evident requirements.<p>The author and I disagree on this topic (I wrote the linked article &quot;The Roguelike War Is Over&quot;), but.... I do feel for fans of traditional roguelikes. They had a well understood genre of game for about 30 years that meant specific things: turn based, grid based combat with random levels and real permadeath. Many of these fans just can&#x27;t get into action games and they have a hard time finding what they&#x27;re looking for these days.')
