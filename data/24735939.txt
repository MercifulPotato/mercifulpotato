I have seen a lot of articles like this misleading the public about the issue. Apple didn&#x27;t force them to monetize anything. It was monetized. Apple told them to use IAP or don&#x27;t direct to your own payment system in the app.<p>Either these journalists aren&#x27;t capable of doing some basic research to understand the issue or are outright trying to deceive the public. Either way is saddening.<p>Another deceiving post:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;8&#x2F;21506995&#x2F;apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;8&#x2F;21506995&#x2F;apple-forced-in-...</a><p>Edit: I see a lot of downvotes. Don&#x27;t downvote! explain how is this &quot;forcing to monetize&quot;. Webster dictionary: monetize - to utilize as a source of profit. Forcing to monetize means the app wasn&#x27;t selling anything and Apple forced them to sell something. This is not the case! Apple forced them to choose between using IAP for payment system instead of their own system OR don&#x27;t direct users to external payment system from within the app.')
