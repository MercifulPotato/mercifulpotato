The main thing people are questioning is the ridiculous amount of money they spent for a painting more and more people are convinced isn&#x27;t actually a Da Vinici.<p>Secondly the painting hasn&#x27;t actually showed up in any museum yet, and in fact no one knows for sure where it actually is.<p>Anonymous Oil Sheiks drastically overpaying (and shattering the old art sale record by over $150 million) for a painting  that probably isn&#x27;t a Da Vinci only for the painting to completely disappear makes for a fun story.')
