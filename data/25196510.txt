I distinctly remember that all the RDP packets went inside the TLS connection.  Perhaps they just delay the cert warning until after RDP has been started?  I&#x27;m sorry but it&#x27;s been 14 years and I&#x27;ve tried not to look at RDP in the interim. You may revoke my &quot;expert&quot; status.  :D  I&#x27;d guess that even with TLS enabled you&#x27;re still vulnerable to MITM since hardly anyone is going to use certs that can actually be validated against a root.')
