Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603729419, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24884785, text='It&#x27;s distressing how much your choice of a lawyer affects your life. I would have absolutely no idea how to go about choosing an FMLA lawyer.<p>It&#x27;s true that you often make choices in life based on insufficient information, but this isn&#x27;t like picking an auto mechanic who screws up your engine. The engine doesn&#x27;t look at you and say, &quot;Well, you picked the wrong guy, so I&#x27;m not going to start&quot;. There&#x27;s a judge here who is watching the lawyer screw it up, then clutches their pearls and declares that they&#x27;re just ruling on the lawyer&#x27;s performance.<p>It&#x27;s a deliberately antagonistic system, and the consequences are people&#x27;s lives. You absolutely, positively cannot engage in it yourself because you don&#x27;t know how -- but neither do you generally know how to choose somebody to do it on your behalf, either. And even if you get &quot;close to, but just off of, the right one&quot;, you lose -- even though there are at least two other human beings involved (the judge and the opposing counsel) who could nudge you in the right direction. They&#x27;ve deliberately conceived the entire setup to make that impossible.')
