While the language has been getting better over the years, especially with the introduction of types, I still felt at one point that I wasn&#x27;t growing. I had a try at Haskell, and failed miserably. I tried OCaml, but still something felt unnatural to me, although what really intrigued me was the sound type system and the guarantee that if it compiles, then it&#x27;s probably going to run well. I then tried Elixir, and I love it. I think Elixir is a wonderful transition language, but something that I wouldn&#x27;t mind keeping close in my toolstack. The Actor model, immutability, pattern matching, meta programming, these are all concepts that uppended my way of thinking. PHP&#x2F;JavaScript array sort functions feel so weird to me now for doing the sorting directly on the variable. But to be honest, I wish Elixir had types. I don&#x27;t trust myself writing functions that can return different things.')
