This comment was substantive, responsive to the parent comment, and cordial; it didn&#x27;t provoke a flame war nor could it be expected to, it didn&#x27;t include any quips or <i>sick burns</i>.<p>If you don&#x27;t like moderating after all this time, and I wouldn&#x27;t blame you, at least understand I can&#x27;t help other people spamming the <i>flag</i> button because they disagree with people&#x27;s good-faith interpretation of facts.
