Not anybody to call. Nobody.<p>It is hard for me to imagine this. I&#x27;m currently following a guy on Twitter who&#x27;s released from prison recently. While in prison he got an arts scholarship, was a prolific writer and published a _lot_ of magazine and academic articles. He mixes a truly entertaining Twitter feed with naked calls for money, as he has nobody except his small Twitter following to turn to as he tries to rebuild his life. It&#x27;s heart-breaking. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;PeterJMWayne11" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;PeterJMWayne11</a>')
