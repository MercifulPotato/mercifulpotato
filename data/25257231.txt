Until then, the point is that the delta between any two experimental determinations of folded structure is approximately the same as the delta between an experimental determination and an AlphaFold guess. So the AlphaFold guess may as well be an experimental measurement. Except the AlphaFold guess happens fairly trivially (once you give it the DNA sequence[1]), where as the experimental method is involved and expensive.<p>[1] Or the primary structure, I&#x27;m unsure what inputs are given to AlphaFold.')
