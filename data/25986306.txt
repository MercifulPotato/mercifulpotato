Those people are well paid, because the GDP per capita in Switzerland is quite high and the salaries of people in this industry is high.\nYes, a Seiko gives you the same, but a Swiss Certina also gives you the same for a much lower price.\nThere are over 100 swiss watch brands and you don&#x27;t have to pick a luxury brand to get a decent mechanical&#x2F;automatic watch. You won&#x27;t get all the hand-made stuff or heritage for that price though.')
