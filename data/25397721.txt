As an alternative, you could use a mathematical programming code like Concorde [1], and solve the problem <i>to optimality</i> in under a second.<p>&gt; If we’re willing to accept that we don’t need the absolute best route between all of the landmarks, then we can turn to smarter techniques such as genetic algorithms to find a solution that’s good enough for our purposes.<p>The particular TSP instance tackled heuristically in this post (i.e. without any optimality guarantees) is about the same size (50 cities) as that solved by Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson <i>to optimality</i>, <i>by hand</i>, in <i>1954</i> [2].<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;tsp&#x2F;concorde.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;tsp&#x2F;concorde.html</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;tsp&#x2F;uk&#x2F;history.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;tsp&#x2F;uk&#x2F;history.html</a>')
