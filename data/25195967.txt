What they&#x27;re looking to do is carve out space in Ring 3 that Ring 0 can&#x27;t touch.<p>Which is <i>precisely</i> what you would want if you were building a DRM scheme - you just aren&#x27;t being imaginative enough. It&#x27;s always important to keep in mind that bad actors are typically just as smart and capable as you are.<p>User hostile practices across the board benefit greatly from the ability to attest to the precise combination of binaries that were booted. Locked down devices are built upon that foundation - no custom ROMs, no jailbreaks, walled garden app stores, and DRM.<p>Unfortunately, those capabilities are a fundamental building block for securing devices <i>in general</i>. The same technology that can be used by an abusive manufacturer, publisher, or government to secure a device against the user can also be used by the user to secure the device against others. The key difference is in who holds the keys for the root of trust.<p>(To that end, some modern secure boot implementations manage to get this bit right by allowing you to specify your own set of public keys before locking down the UEFI interface with a password.)')
