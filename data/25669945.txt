It also couldn&#x27;t detect words that had personal pronouns or determiners with an apostrophe, I had to type the apostrophe manually which is a no-go for me.<p>And it does not support having multiple languages at once which is incredibly inconvenient when you frequently have to switch between 4 languages when typing and when you often mix some of them.<p>But if you type without the autocorrect and the predictions, it can be great, I guess.')
