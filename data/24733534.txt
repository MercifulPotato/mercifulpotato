For non-lispers: Macros evaluate from the outside, which means the defroutes macro will expand before the (comment ...) macro. For this to reliably work, you need a reader macro that removes the code before macro expansion. I don&#x27;t know if clojure has that, but common lisp and some schemes have utilities for it.')
