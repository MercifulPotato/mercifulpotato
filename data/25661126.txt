With mere casuality&#x2F;determinism nothing is up to us, everything is just another reaction caused by some initial condition.<p>Logically, we can&#x27;t have it both ways...<p>&gt;<i>and we will likely take it upon ourselves to investigate and disseminate, and hopefully start a larger conversation</i><p>You can&#x27;t &quot;take it upon ourselves&quot; since we have no agency, if we have no free will.<p>&gt;<i>and hopefully start a larger conversation</i><p>Without free will, we can&#x27;t start anything that not already casually chained to start, so predetermined anyway.<p>Whatever we&#x2F;you do or don&#x27;t do can&#x27;t change anything (even the idea that we can &quot;do or not do&quot; something is an illusion. Without free will we can only do what the casuality chain has us do  and think what we&#x27;re predetermined to think about it).')
