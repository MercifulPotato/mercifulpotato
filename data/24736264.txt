There is some minimum you need to pay people in order to get them to work. Once that’s done, you have some excess. You could distribute that to front-line workers. You could distribute it to the software teams, but you sure don’t have to. In practice, human nature being what it is, what will most likely happen - in the absence of specific government policies incentivizing other choices - is that management will distribute it to themselves and their shareholders.<p>We in the US once had a number of tax policies that were designed to disincentivize this kind of payout, and encourage companies to maintain full-time workforces with decent benefits, invest in R&amp;D and facilities improvements etc. Other countries still have those policies. But we here in the US got rid of a lot of them. The result is that excess productivity benefits have been distributed in exactly the way you’d expect - with frankly alarming effects on our political stability.')
