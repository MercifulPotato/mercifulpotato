It has beenestimated that approximately 25 % to 30 % of the total landice contribution to sea-level rise over the last decade camefrom the Greenland ice sheet<p>7.4 m corresponds to 24 feet so their claims are accurate.<p>Also, 58.3 m.... that&#x27;s shocking. Predicted sea level rise until the end of this century is well below that but imagine the massive effort needed to deploy 69 m tall walls at our coastlines... scary as hell. Likely we&#x27;ll just give up a lot of land.')
