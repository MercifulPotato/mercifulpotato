Rents and real estate prices are trending down towards sanity, the city&#x2F;county government has managed to get a large number of homeless folks situated indoors, restaurants are getting outdoor seating space, and initiatives to massively reduce the amount of red tape small business have to work through are getting fast tracked.  All that, and the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths are extremely low relative to the rest of the country, even as businesses re-open.  The post-pandemic San Francisco has a decent shot at being a livable city again (though the property crime problem isn&#x27;t yet on a path to being solved).')
