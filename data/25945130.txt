The vast majority don&#x27;t care about any of these stocks. Also, by making trading so easy RH has a responsibility to protect amateur investors from making terrible financial decisions. If you really want to buy game stop stock or whatever there are plenty of ways to do so. So they are by no means &quot;screwing&quot; their customers.')
