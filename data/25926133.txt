Or so I thought. When my critical 4TB external failed, I discovered that Backblaze hadn&#x27;t had my system backed up for almost a year - there was a multi-TB backlog and at the throttled speed I had set for the sake of the office network, it would take 10+ years to catch up. Just something for everyone to stay aware of with cloud storage.<p>I currently back up to two drives at ingest, one being a per-year drive (e.g., 2020 jobs source media) that is rarely accessed. For major projects, I factor in one or two 1-2TB drives that receive an extra copy of source media and then are stashed. Not perfect, but so far so good.')
