A plain PDF&#x2F;A is the simplest thing to scrape for text.<p>You know what is a nightmare to deal with? Html with javascript: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymail.co.uk&#x2F;home&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymail.co.uk&#x2F;home&#x2F;index.html</a><p>Try a screen reader on the above nightmare and tell me what you hear. For me it&#x27;s: iframe-iframe-iframe-iframe-iframe-iframe-iframe-iframe-iframe... turning it into a png and trying to scrape text doesn&#x27;t help because there is literally zero predictable structure to the text, is it one, two, three or 8 columns wide? Depends on where in the page you look.<p>So again, thanks for the outrage, but we don&#x27;t need people like you who don&#x27;t understand the first thing about what we go through defending us and shitting on people trying to make the world better.')
