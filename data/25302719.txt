If I were reviewing her paper, I would certainly not want to be known to her, especially if I were critical of it. The possibility of retaliation from her is very real and she often uses her considerable twitter following to do exactly that. I believe she thinks she&#x27;s doing the right thing, but from a disinterested party&#x27;s perspective she seems like a bully.')
