And if we use nuclear for that, it significantly reduces the amount of storage we need for renewables.<p>Also, nuclear combines well with thermal storage because you don&#x27;t incur double conversion losses. If you store heat from the reactor during the day when solar is generating, use it during the peak demand in the evening when it isn&#x27;t, and then run directly from the reactor overnight, you don&#x27;t really need any other storage.')
