Either of the yogis I mentioned in my previous post point out variations. I am surprised how poses I thought I had become advanced at in the beginning were actually just surface level as I developed better interoception and realized the way different body parts and focus could be stretched. It is hard to explain. Just do yoga and over time you’ll know exactly what I am referring to.<p>Re rounding your back - this is an example of what I am talking about above. If you are rounding your back as you touch your toes, this is an example of not focusing on the right thing. You should be hinging at the hips, not the lower back. If you can’t touch the floor without rounding your back, then either don’t touch the floor or bend your knees enough to let you touch the floor (each of these options focuses on stretching different things).<p>Good luck &amp; Namaste!')
