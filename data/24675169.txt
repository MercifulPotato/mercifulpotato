America is a liberal democracy seeking world peace. China is an Orwellian nightmare of a single-party authoritarian dictatorship. A world under US dominion (e.g the 1990s) would be a paradise. A world under Chinese dominion would be a living hell.<p>I would rather my data be in the hands of the National Security Agency than the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.<p>I realize that pro-US views aren&#x27;t popular on HN, but I couldn&#x27;t care less.<p>For the record, I have a college degree, I&#x27;m in my late twenties, I was raised in a liberal household, I&#x27;m a liberal, I have no religious beliefs, and I&#x27;m voting for Joe Biden.')
