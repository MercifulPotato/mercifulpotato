So what controls we did have, weak as they were, were clearly not functioning in many critical locations, as evidenced by videos and court testimony over the last week. Without confidence that the controls are working, the results become suspect, especially when the mistakes appear aligned in one direction. This is what the auditing world would call a material deficiency. It’s that simple - how do you restore faith in the process when people won’t just take your word for it? This is a problem set with known solutions.<p>Forget this election and the outcome you want to see, Biden’s the president barring something crazy - but there’s a systemic problem here that’s getting worse (let’s say relative to the 2000 fiasco).<p>We still aren’t conversing, as a nation, about how to bring more integrity to the process to allay the very real concerns half this country has. The institutional narrative is that there is no problem. To then willfully deny that this disagreement really matters forestalls the conversation. We’ll see how this ages, but the answer here isn’t for one side to just shut up. The answer is to take meaningful steps to demonstrate that the process has integrity. Videos of poll workers denying poll watchers access don’t create an appearance of integrity. Denying observation of the ballot counting process also doesn’t support the integrity of the results.')
