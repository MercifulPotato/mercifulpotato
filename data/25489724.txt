The location of the mutations in the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein raises the possibility that this variant is antigenically distinct from prior variants.<p>Four probable reinfections have been identified amongst 915 subjects with this variant but further work is needed to compare this reinfection rate with comparable data sets.<p>• The committee discussed the geographic extent of spread of the variant:<p>- Within the UK, the variant is concentrated in the London, South East and East of England but has been detected in various parts of the UK.<p>- Few cases of this variant have been reported internationally but one confirmed export from the UK to Australia has been reported.<p>It was noted that other countries have lower sequencing capability than the UK.')
