But it&#x27;s also nice to have access to my personal mailbox, password manager, rss reader, personal machines, etc. on my company laptop.<p>For now, I have an encrypted disk volume (so everything is in one place and it&#x27;s easy to remove from the machine) and a separate browser profile with an SSH tunnel as SOCKS proxy, but maybe using one of my personal machines via some remote desktop solution would be the cleanest solution to this.<p>I guess it could also depend on how severely restricted and monitored said company machine is.')
