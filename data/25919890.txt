Now due to maturity, code complexity, and the simple fact that there are a lot of &quot;users&quot; means that its a lot bigger deal if a random patch breaks something.<p>Its the result of the success of the project more than anything. Now the maintainers have to start acting like real developers and do the difficult&#x2F;unsexy parts of maintaining something rather than just hacking at the fun bits.<p>It really points out that much of what people considered the strengths of the opensource model were illusions that evaporated when the ratio of users&#x2F;developers got very large.
