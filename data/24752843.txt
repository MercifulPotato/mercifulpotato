I&#x27;d like to consider myself as wheat(ish) and I&#x27;m good at what I do. But there are a lot of of poor devs, and recruiters&#x2F;companies are looking for... I&#x27;m not sure. Glossy CVs with major tech stacks, usually with Big Data or ML or somesuch.<p>Trouble is, most of those companies don&#x27;t have any need for this. It&#x27;s plain line of business and basic data management they need but they&#x27;re after more, more, more. Unicorn guys&#x2F;gals. It&#x27;s unreal.<p>So I&#x27;ve got to stand out. And I don&#x27;t really know how. Any suggestions? I&#x27;m working on a project that should show my creds, and I know they like that (and that makes sense) but any other suggestions?')
