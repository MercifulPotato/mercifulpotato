Or indeed that many people don&#x27;t view rubbish separation as &#x27;work&#x27; imposed on them, to the extent many local authorities collecting household waste have to threaten fines or at least noncollection of waste to enforce compliance.<p>As for less developed countries, they usually have an abundance of flytipped waste because they don&#x27;t pay [enough] garbage collectors and whilst there&#x27;s the occasional eyecatching &#x27;clean up this beauty spot&#x27; activity nobody wants to play the garbageman game all year round...')
