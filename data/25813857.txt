Another thing would be to disable 2FA.<p>All they have to do to achieve this is to use the phished credentials to immediately login with the original site, trigger 2FA and then show a field to capture it and pass along. Then capture all the cookies.<p>The best defense against phishing is to use a password manager that does domain matching.')
