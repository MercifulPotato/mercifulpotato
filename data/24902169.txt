Item(by='StavrosK', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603750650, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24901893, text='&gt; This I don&#x27;t understand at all because for me the second button from the right in the top bar literally is the notification button.<p>Sure, but it&#x27;s not one of the main, prominent buttons. It looks the same as &quot;search&quot; and &quot;menu&quot;, IIRC. I definitely keep getting confused by it every time and click groups, which is useless to me.<p>I hate the new design, and not just because it&#x27;s different.')
