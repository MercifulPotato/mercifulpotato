Go solves two out of three, but it really dropped the ball hard on error handling which is very disappointing IMO.<p>Things like generics and garbage collection involve some deep tradeoffs, so I get Go&#x27;s take on them, even if I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with it. On the other hand IMHO Go&#x27;s crappy error handling boilerplate is not something I find acceptable in a modern programming language.')
