In case you&#x27;re curious: The graph is git-like structure, but a tree. Trees of close-to-b-trees specifically, where each (key) value can point to another tree. There&#x27;s really no limit to how wide these are, or how many connected trees there are - so i&#x27;ll have to put artificial visualization limits on this. Still, i&#x27;d like to be able to view large trees of trees, with thousands of nodes in a performant manner.<p>Most demos i&#x27;ve seen on JS libraries have been laggy with just a handful of nodes - but they&#x27;re also trying to do fancy animations&#x2F;etc by default. Hopefully i can hook up D3 with some minimal effort - or perhaps render it in a game library. &#x2F;shrug')
