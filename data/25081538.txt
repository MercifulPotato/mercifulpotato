Pretty obvious in the case of coronavirus. It&#x27;s an endemic exponentially growing phenomenon. There is no way to avoid being infected within a few years timeframe. All we can hope is to mitigate the severity of the impact. Survive the disease. What the control people sell is a pie in the sky &#x27;we can eradicate it via vaccines&#x27; in some nebulous future. This is wildly unproven, we have never eradicated such a virus at planet scale. Its exponential growth behavior is a good indication that we never will.<p>As of climate change, there is no solution either. We&#x27;ve stumbled over a nutrient rich carcass, we&#x27;ve multiplied like crazy, and now the party is over. Populations will crash to reach the historical equilibrium, perhaps even further. You are correct, there is massive war and destruction on the horizon. Learn to build walls, and pray they hold.')
