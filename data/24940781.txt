And unfortunately, back then, because it was still running on top of SDL1, it used a software renderer, which made it very painful to implement these features as well. Features that require whole-screen updates, such as smoothly zooming in on a tilemap, were just impossible to implement in a way that would still give you 60fps. This may have improved with the switch to SDL2, but the fact that you have to handroll a lot of things has not.<p>I consider Pygame to be a good toy for beginners: it has relatively little complexity, while at the same time still feeling like an actual API and in principle gives you a foundation that really cool and fun things can be built on (unlike turtle or other things that are only toys). But if you&#x27;re not looking to play, you&#x27;re looking to make a game, it&#x27;s obviously a wrong choice.')
