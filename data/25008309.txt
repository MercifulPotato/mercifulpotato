I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that bad here.<p>Most employers offer private healthcare and even if you buy the insurance yourself its inexpensive. I also disagree that difficult cases aren&#x27;t dealt with properly on the public side, in my experience it&#x27;s been the opposite: simple cases are ignored, but serious ones are taken care of properly.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of English language daycares and plenty of non IT jobs for non-Finnish speakers in both smaller companies and medium sized ones as well. IT consultancies are a different story.<p>Winter is no worse than in mainland Europe or Britain and if you go a bit inland, you see a lot more snow.<p>If you use a big bank like Nordea then you get great English service, at least in my experience, same goes for other services.<p>I grew up in Finland and wanted desperately to get away when I finished high school, but having lived in the UK, Germany and Russia and spent some time in the US, my views have changed.<p>An aside, if anyone reading this is interested in relocating here as a developer, we at Toughbyte can help.
