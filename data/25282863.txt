That all said, a Normal number definitely has this property and I don&#x27;t think having this property implies normality, but I don&#x27;t know either way.<p>An interesting fact though is that almost all real numbers are normal, which means pretty much every irrational number has this property, though not every irrational number. However, we still don&#x27;t know if pi, e or square root 2 are normal.')
