One day I sat him down and showed him how I debug a bit of code, and the lightbulb went off that I was doing a very similar thing to what he enjoyed doing with engines.<p>We understood each other better after that day.<p>(Of course, now that I own a home, I wish I&#x27;d done more of the engine tinkering... I learned what a carburetor is and how to clean it via FaceTime.)')
