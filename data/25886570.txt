Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=[25886736], score=None, time=1611439442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25886192, text='Glad we mostly agree :)<p>&gt; I doubt you think it&#x27;s true: &quot;Before a measurement takes place, the movement of electrons is predicted by a deterministic equation, there is no probability.&quot; That sentence goes against conventional wisdom so I doubt you meant it litterally.<p>I meant that very literally, and it is very important to understand. Quantum mechanics contains two fundamental postulates:<p>1. The Schrodinger equation: any quantum system can be described by the Schrodinger equation, which is a linear partial differential equation - i.e. it is completely deterministic. The solution of the Schrodinger equation is one or more wave functions - complex-valued functions which have some value for every point in space.<p>2. The Born rule: when a measurement is made of the state of a quantum system, the probability that a particular result will be observed is equal to the square of the amplitude of the wave function. To predict the state of the system after the measurement, the wave function must be updated to have the exact value of the measurement and no others.<p>Without the Born rule, QM is completely deterministic, and predicts that particles have multiple positions. This prediction is actually correct until you measure anything. For an example, let&#x27;s say you have a particle P0 whose wave function has some non-0 amplitude at far away locations A and B. Say you also have two other particles, Pa and Pb; Pa has amplitude almost 1 at point A and 0 elsewhere, while Pb has amplitude almost 1 at point B and 0 elsewhere. The positions of both Pa and Pb will be affected by the properties of P0. So, P0 was essentially in both places at once.<p>However, if you add detectors for P0 at positions A and B, what you will notice two things:<p>1. If detector A detected P0, detector B will never see it, and vice-versa. The probability for each of them will correspond perfectly to the square of the amplitude that P0 had at that point.<p>2. If detector A detected P0, the position of Pb will no longer depend on any property of P0, and vice versa.<p>So, the measurement changes the wave function of the P0, Pa and Pb system. The equation before the measurement is deterministic, and the equation after the measurement is also deterministic, but the switch from the first one to the second is probabilistic.<p>By the way, an excellent resource on this topic is Sabine Hossenfelder&#x27;s blog, for example this post:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;backreaction.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;what-is-quantum-measurement-problem.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;backreaction.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;what-is-quantum-mea...</a>')
