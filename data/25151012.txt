It&#x27;s much better than learning yet another DSL.\nHowever, there&#x27;s one thing I find annoying, and that&#x27;s the lack of a structure for parameters.<p>Following the `# Arguments:` convention is redundant (I get it&#x27;s petty, but I&#x27;m annoyed every time I write it), but more than that it&#x27;s error-prone and limiting.\nBecause arguments names are just a convention that&#x27;s not strictly enforced, it&#x27;s not automatically checking the naming is correct, and it limits the ability of tools like cbindgen and flapigen (love them both) to transform param specific docs.')
