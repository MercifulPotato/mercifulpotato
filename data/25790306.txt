Yahoo also paid $40,000 for the initial replication support (for W - E HA.)<p>For your case, there&#x27;s 2 forks:<p>1) If it&#x27;s a non-developer-specific tool, then small businesses will automatically use your SaaS product over installing an Open Source distro and managing it themselves.<p>To understand why this is so, remember a large program you wrote. Then imagine re-implementing in a language you don&#x27;t know, like Haskell or Scala. Feel the pain of doing something strange?<p>A possible exception is if you provide a free Docker image that &quot;just works&quot;, then that could cannibalize your business.<p>2) If it&#x27;s a developer-specific tool, then Open Sourcing it might work, or it might not work. In the case of MySQL, 1&#x2F;1,000 sales worked well-enough for them. For curl, it took 10 billion installs to support one person. :)<p>The counterexample is programmer editors, which developers pay for but don&#x27;t expect source code. (Brief and JetBrains made millions.)')
