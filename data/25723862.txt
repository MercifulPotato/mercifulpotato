Harry Reid (Former House Minority leader) also discusses at length the abundance of information that is kept secret and how even the President doesn&#x27;t have access to it.<p>I&#x27;m not making it up, just repeating what these folks are saying. There are countless interviews of Government officials (Senators, Congressional members) basically being told to fuck off when looking for answers or information.<p>Why not educate yourself and instead of dismissing them as nonsense.')
