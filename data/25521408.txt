At the time, futures were well fleshed out but the community hadn&#x27;t caught up, so we were lacking a futures-compatible postgres and redis client. We wrote the redis client ourselves, and for the main project using rust that was sufficient. But for postgres, that was a show stopper for any other projects we were working on. So we ended up deciding between typescript and go for those.')
