I&#x27;ll even go one further: we won&#x27;t actually know the exact moment that Level 5 arrives.<p>Cars with level 4 + remote assistance will be driving people around for a decade or more, phoning home less and less over time until one day someone notes that no car has phoned home for an entire year. Then maybe a car will phone home and the clock will start again. Decades from then, people will shut down the last remote assistance center.<p>But at that point, nobody will care about declaring Level 5 because we will have been riding around for decades in cars without steering wheels that we don&#x27;t have to drive.')
