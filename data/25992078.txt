Highly productive framework, very well written documentation. You get jump started right away.<p>Only caveat with async python. Might be tricky when using &#x27;sync&#x27; libraries. It&#x27;s not always straightforward and you&#x27;ll find yourself wondering why your server is blocked from time to time. It&#x27;s not a problem of FastAPI, but you need to be aware that if you do a blocking call (function is not prefixed with &#x27;async&#x27;) to a db that it blocks the event loop.')
