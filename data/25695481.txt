While it is not a smoking gun, it definitively establishes that the known facts are consistent with the assertion, and it is relevant to any honest treatment of the topic.<p>Honest historians and journalists would note that it&#x27;s completely plausible and reasonable to believe that substantial election fraud occurred, even if it could not be proven sufficiently in court to nullify the results. If they were honest in covering the election, they would not force the words &quot;no evidence&quot; or &quot;without evidence&quot; into every sentence, as though a smoking gun is the only good reason to believe anyone has ever done anything.')
