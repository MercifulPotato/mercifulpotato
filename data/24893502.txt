Someone living near the main office (or if the company is fully remote just near the rest of the team), can attend face-to-face meetings with their team, they can be there for in-person client demos without needing prior notice and plane tickets, they&#x27;re in the same time zone for remote meetings, if the team is international then people in different countries cost most for buying services and dealing with legal stuff..<p>Having staff live and work remotely <i>does</i> come with additional costs, and there <i>are</i> downsides, so it&#x27;s not unreasonable to suggest the value <i>isn&#x27;t</i> the same. When you&#x27;re assessing the cost of staff you don&#x27;t only look at the outputs.')
