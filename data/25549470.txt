I understand we never used a mRNA vaccine on humans at scale before, so it is still somewhat experimental. It may work great but we can’t completely exclude an unexpected side effect in the long term.<p>Also a few weeks shouldn’t change anything. We are talking about a 6-12 months vaccination campaign.<p>I suspect the 80% number you mention is to eradicate the virus. I think at this stage it is a bit unrealistic. Between poorer countries that will not be able to vaccinate everyone and animals which can carry this disease, I would imagine the virus is here to stay. I think the primary objective is for it to cease to be a major public health issue. That it keeps contaminating people at low intensity in the background shouldn’t be a major concern.')
