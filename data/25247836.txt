It is basically the reason it uses b-trees. It&#x27;s in the name!<p>For example, when dedupping in block level it needs to know (right?) how many times a block is being used, so it can be collected when it runs out of uses.<p>ISO9660 can also express dedupped (hardlinked) files with the Rock Ridge extensions. I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m wondering it could even do block-level dedupping if the generating program abused the format a bit..')
