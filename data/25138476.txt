It is also the only practical solution if we want EVs.<p>I really don&#x27;t buy the whole &quot;electric cars have less moving parts&quot; argument. As I said in my original comment - how many cars get scrapped or sold due to electrical issues, compared to ICE issues? You should know, in France ;) Replacing mechanical moving parts with integrated circuits that have features on the nanometer scale that <i>must not</i> move, and putting them in the harsh automotive environment, is not a step forward in reliability.<p>I understand that technology and processes will improve, but that&#x27;s not really a good argument to invest in the technology today. Maybe I should wait, and buy an EV in a few years or decades, when the environmental impact is a lot less.')
