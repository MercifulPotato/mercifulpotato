It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how that works out. The vendor won&#x27;t support running it on debian or ubuntu server or anything else.<p>I would say that out of all the possible distros of Linux, RHEL is by far the one that I see with the most rare, weird, expensive paid software that gets developed for it, due to its extensive use in government and fortune 100 type environments. In which case I don&#x27;t think much will really change since the same customers will go right on buying RHEL paid yearly licenses.')
