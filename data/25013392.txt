Groups are less likely to see other groups as enemies if they&#x27;re neighbors and take the same train to work every day. Poor people are less likely to feel  excluded from society if they have friends from the middle class than if their whole neighborhood is on welfare.<p>Walkable neighborhoods with good infrastructure where a mixture of all strata of society live are, in my opinion, quite important if you want to prevent problems. Carcentric city planning is directly opposed to that.')
