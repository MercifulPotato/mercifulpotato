It is somewhat harder than the basic-block argument case, but that&#x27;s because basic block arguments rely on the data binding being put in the head of the edge and we&#x27;re pushing data from the head into the edge. The next step of checking if all incoming edges are identically 0 would be easier in the phi-form, since the data binding is in the tail node, and we&#x27;re pulling data from the edge into the tail.')
