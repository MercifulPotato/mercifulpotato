What thet just did, is forced every bank they work with to enforce their &quot;right to audit&quot;. I believe that on the next contract updates, EVERY client, will make sure for the two following things:<p>1) right to audit (in case they don&#x27;t already have one), and<p>2) 4h notice (or something equally small&#x2F;ridiculous. The 4h is a minimum in order to ensure that names&#x2F;passport numbers, photos, etc are exchanged to ensure security.<p>EDIT: extra point:<p>3) I believe (since in the banking internal audits everyone knows everyone else)(especially on the Director&#x2F;CAE level), some banks will <i>ahen</i> coordinate their audits and give them  a group visit.. I want to see GW showcasing the same bag of coins to 10 clients at the same hour..')
