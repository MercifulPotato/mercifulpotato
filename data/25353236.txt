I found that interesting because I actually question it: I think there has been no lack of good evidence flu causes economic loss and so corporates want staff vaccinated against flu. Or, that old people in care homes have higher risk. But, the original post said something I wanted to riff on: I think post covid, ANY story for investment in vaccine will secure funding and interest: we&#x27;re now primed to believe this is &quot;worthy&quot;<p>I absolutely agree with your conclusion: its net beneficial in and of itself, if we could stop needing the 4 and 3 variant flu shot and go with a viral stem-based semi-constantly applicable vaccine, I&#x27;d be very pleased.')
