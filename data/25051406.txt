Item(by='sheepdog', descendants=None, kids=[25051582], score=None, time=1605039925, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25048565, text='I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m in the &quot;heathy pipeline&quot; stage.  But I have a small number of repeat clients, and have landed a good number of $49k to $60k projects over the last five years.  I currently do most of the work and use 2-3 subcontractors as needed.  And during year one I did a lot of sub-contracts for 5-10 person shops.  So I&#x27;ve been able to see what works.<p>I guess the TLDR version is that you need partnerships.<p>For example, if you are working primarily with AWS or Oracle or whatever, you need to have really good relationships with their account executives.<p>You&#x27;ll also need partnerships with other agencies.  For example, if your projects are often referrals from marketing or web design shops, you&#x27;ll need to cultivate relationships with several of those.  And that usually means referring web-design projects to them as well.  (I&#x27;m not great at sales, so many of my projects came from this source.)<p>But if your projects run &lt;$50k each, you&#x27;ll never build a $1M sales pipeline without a sales team.  Hire somebody with existing relationships in your industry, so they can open up their address book and land 1-3 clients right out of the gate.<p>My partner account execs are constantly telling me to focus on a niche.  I work with a specific SAAS product that&#x27;s a bit higher-priced.  So that naturally brings me clients with some semblance of a budget.  But they recommend even more specialization, such as &quot;growth clients in the fintech space with A round funding&quot;.  That&#x27;s tough for me, since I&#x27;m a generalist and like to work everywhere.<p>Lastly, remember that it&#x27;s ok to be small.  If you don&#x27;t have a huge team, you can pick and choose projects to ensure maximum success and minimal stress.  People always ask me &quot;what&#x27;s your growth plan&quot;, and are surprised when I tell them that I don&#x27;t plan to grow this year.<p>Good luck!')
