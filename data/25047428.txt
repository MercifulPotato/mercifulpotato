Let me try to untangle this.  The fork happened, yes, but it did not take the market as you claimed. Also, not “nearly all developers” but barely a dozen of the forkers’ closest friends left ownCloud. I currently have around 50 colleagues in engineering and support alone. ownCloud is doing rather fine, thank you, both as an open-source project and as a company, both with community users and enterprise users.<p>There are multiple open-source file sync and share platforms. The reason is quite simple: There are multiple ways to implement a digitally sovereign file platform, and different needs call for different feature sets. ownCloud focuses on code quality, reliability and features that security conscious companies and institutions have come to expect. You do not have to like ownCloud, you do you. To your open standards point: I posted here because we use go-micro in our current rewrite, which is by the way under the Apache 2.0 licence. We cherish and embrace open standards and open source, so I don’t exactly get what you mean by “more open standards”.
