This is not a fair distribution of responsibility. The fairest system would be a lottery: picking people completely randomly, without regard to socioeconomic status <i>or</i> &quot;merit&quot;.<p>Given that we want the most competent people to be in positions of responsibility, &quot;winning the genetic lottery&quot; is ok, because some people are just born with natural talents. But &quot;winning the socioeconomic lottery&quot; is not ok, because there&#x27;s no apparent correlation between the wealth of your parents and your personal competence.<p>Again, fairness is tangential to this problem.')
