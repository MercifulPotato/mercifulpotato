If you concede that design can impact a user&#x27;s behavior, then it becomes a question of &quot;how much&quot; and the ethics of how to use that power. The irony is that by placing the burden on users to counteract the tendencies that are openly being encouraged by the software we absolve ourselves of <i>our</i> responsibility as designers, engineers, and architects to consider ethics in our work.<p>Do <i>we</i> bear no responsibility at all here for what we <i>build</i>?')
