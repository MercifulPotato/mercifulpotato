Think of a material as a sponge for heat. When I squeeze the material, I raise the temperature, and that causes heat to leak out. The temperature of the material doesn&#x27;t really tell me how much heat is in it, so this experiment is suggesting that it is the heat itself that prevents superconductivity.<p>Now a superconductor is just a conduit for electrons that doesn&#x27;t generate heat. We know from Landauer&#x27;s principle that heat is only generated when you destroy information. If I take a pair of entangled electrons, those electrons contain exactly one bit of information (in the von neumann sense). If I cannot add energy in excess of the energy required to disentangle them, then that bit of information is never destroyed.<p>Whether or not a given interaction between the electron pair and the substrate has enough energy to disentangle them is not a function of temperature, it is a function of the actual energy that may be imparted to my pair. Which is proportional to the actual heat in my material, rather than its temperature.')
