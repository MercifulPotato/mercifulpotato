I have a late 2011 Macbook Pro that finally died a few months back and I want to get a new machine. Because of Covid I haven&#x27;t needed or been able to travel so my desktop has sufficed. Once things open up again I&#x27;ll need a mobile option.<p>The touchbar is neat but almost entirely useless for my workflow. It just takes up space and is honestly the main reason I haven&#x27;t bought another machine.\nI love magsafe and would like to see it come back but if it just had USB-C that would be fine.<p>No touchbar, new apple silicon, more ports (ethernet please!) - i&#x27;ll be getting one.')
