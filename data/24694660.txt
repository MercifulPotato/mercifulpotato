In fact, there are many instances in which information flow has to be legislated in order to help the market operate; from nutrition labels on our food to real estate transactions in which information flow is necessitated, and for example making insider trading illegal in which information flow is prevented.<p>&gt; Non-market systems hide incentives under opaque covers and increase the potential for catastrophic failure.<p>Market based systems can and have done this too. Most recent example is the 2008 crisis in which in the name of <i>financial instrument innovation</i>, toxic assets were blended under opaque covers <i>and people bought them</i>, leading to catastrophic failure.<p>Information flow and markets are mostly unrelated. Think of the stock market; only information it can tell us is the current and historical price points, everything else has to come from side channels, which will never add up to telling if a stock will go up or not for sure.')
