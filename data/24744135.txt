When I used to export vehicles to Afghanistan, I noticed that they didn&#x27;t like dark colors at all. I was specially told by my broker to stay away from sending black cars or cars with darker shades i.e blue, because demand for them was very low.<p>The highest demand was for white cars, reason being is that the areas are quite dusty. So if you have a white car, it won&#x27;t look very dirty with dust on it. In contrast if you have a black car, even the slightest dust will make it appear dirty. Its harder to keep a blacker color clean.<p>Also, for some reason green toyotas (sienna, tercel) always sold like hot pancakes in Cameroon. To this day I still don&#x27;t know why.')
