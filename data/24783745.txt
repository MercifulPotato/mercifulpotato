It seems to be just moving existing mesh nodes in the normal direction which is an extremely simple operation to implement. The more you sculpt, the worse the mesh quality gets until it starts self-intersecting, and you can&#x27;t extrude from the side of an existing extrusion. I work on 3D meshing software and the hard problems are ones that involve modifying the connectivity of the mesh not just moving nodes around.')
