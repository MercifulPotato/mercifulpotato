AMD has some good options, but I haven&#x27;t seen a thin&amp;light style AMD based laptop come out yet.<p>Check out System76, their Linux support is unparalleled. The lemur pro is interesting. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ll find the specs for the screen&#x2F;speakers, though.<p>I got the XPS 13, myself, but it still requires &#x27;tweaks&#x27; - like running thermald master so your system doesn&#x27;t throttle down too much after a short &#x27;boost&#x27;, and running kernel 5.10 because it allows your CPU to enter the PC10 power-saving state (Ubuntu&#x27;s oem-5.8 may have this backported, I haven&#x27;t checked).<p>As always, install your favorite user-agent spoofer as well. I just ran into a problem with some web videoconferencing software that works fine, but you have to tell it your running Win&#x2F;Chrome.<p>This is why people say desktop Linux isn&#x27;t here yet. It kinda is, but only if you&#x27;re an expert (or want to be forced to become one)... I still love it, though, and always will.')
