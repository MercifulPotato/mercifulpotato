For example, take left-pad. At the time of its infamous removal, it was relied upon by thousands of packages, including Node and Babel.<p>But does that mean that it was worth millions of dollars? Of course not. Because if it wasn&#x27;t available, anybody could have replicated it in a few hours of work.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the case for this project, but just wanted to note that &quot;being used by &lt;multi billion dollar company&gt;&quot; does not necessarily mean that you&#x27;re providing that much value.')
