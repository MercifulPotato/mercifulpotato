I&#x27;m not coming out of nowhere with this criticism.<p>With that being said I fully understand where their system is better than current MEO&#x2F;GEO systems for low-latency rural deploys. I&#x27;m just not in the cult of Elon, physics&#x2F;money&#x2F;practicality have their limits.<p>I&#x27;d honestly be more excited with Starlink if they were primarily using it as a replacement for satellite backhaul on very remote cell sites. That way you don&#x27;t need residential roof antennas and a ton of power to communicate with the network, just need your main power at the cell site. That&#x27;s more practical for poor rural countries but isn&#x27;t as big of a writeoff, doesn&#x27;t look as sexy.')
