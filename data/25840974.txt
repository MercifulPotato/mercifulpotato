Item(by='bigiain', descendants=None, kids=[25841557], score=None, time=1611102331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25838966, text='I reckon this is the actual product here.<p>Almost nobody needs a drone to deliver their packages. Many many people would like a solution to porch pirates (or untrustworthy neighbours). A somewhat securely bolted down &quot;Amazon prime standard carton&quot; sized mailbox with a remote unlockable lid and some digital signature type of delivery notification sounds like a product to me. Something short of &quot;secure against a determined thief with a crowbar&#x2F;anglegrinder, but effective against casual swiping of parcels left by front doors - and priced appropriately (so the crowbar guy doesn&#x27;t assume only people with expensive parcels would bother).<p>&quot;Drones&quot; makes good clickbait though.')
