DDR5 comes with &quot;chip level ECC&quot; [1] of which the main purpose is to be able to better sell highly complicated memory chips with minor defects.<p>But as a consequence as I understand, it <i>will</i> allow for the correction of single bit memory flips. With regular DDR4 or previous generations, you don&#x27;t get any error correction. Any bit error in your DDR4 modules has the potential to corrupt data. If you want to be protected from that, you will need to get ECC memory.<p>Unfortunately, anything with &quot;ECC&quot; in hardware for unfortunate reasons gets labeled with an &quot;enterprise&quot; sticker. And that means a certain price level, and a certain power consumption. (Yes I know you can get Ryzen boxes that work with ECC, but that&#x27;s still PC sized hardware for hundreds of dollars).<p>If DDR5 can bring error correction to the masses - like in single board computers, 10W NAS boxes, smartphones - that would be pretty cool. But I&#x27;m not sure whether my reading of that is correct.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;comments&#x2F;15912&#x2F;ddr5-specification-released-setting-the-stage-for-ddr56400-and-beyond&#x2F;708566" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;comments&#x2F;15912&#x2F;ddr5-specification-...</a>')
