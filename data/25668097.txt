Trump IS an authoritian - if today isn’t proof of that to you then I don’t know what to say to you.<p>His last and final tweet was literally to tell everyone to go home and not cause violence. He literally said he wanted peace. Either you haven&#x27;t listened to it or your hatred is so strong nothing will quench that fire.<p>Trump could have told them to occupy the building and they would have. He is the first president in my lifetime to not start a new war. He let cities burn and didn&#x27;t send in any people unless states asked for it.<p>In what fucked up world do you think Trump is authoritarian?')
