This is not uncommon for Europe and may be a cultural differences with other places.<p>Those who have the intent to comply and are at least complying in spirit are not at any legal risk. Attitude matters.<p>And the spirit is obvious: get consent if you enable a third party to unique identify a user in reality. I.e. if it&#x27;s private data or if you enable correlation across websites.<p>It&#x27;s correlating and sharing you need consent for. Don&#x27;t worry about a server log.<p>It is not about what you make possible. It&#x27;s about what you do. Technically any sysadmin can access some information they should not. It&#x27;s unavoidable.<p>But that&#x27;s quite a far way from commercially exploiting databases of people without their consent.<p>Honestly they should just ban the sale of personal information. Most internet marketing vendors are not actually in the business of selling personal data.<p>Now the good ones suffer because of the bad ones. And the bad ones either pretend they have consent or find a way to get it.')
