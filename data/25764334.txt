That&#x27;s not AT ALL what happens on sites like these (imageboards). These sites have the same risk of having a few psychopaths as sites like Facebook. Actually there are more on Facebook. And these sites have moderators. Do your own research. Browse for awhile and you&#x27;ll see how ridiculously the reality is different from what you&#x27;ve been getting from the mass media. That&#x27;s why these sites are censored. Not because there are criminals plotting schemes on them, but because the discussions there are so against the &quot;official&quot; narrative that there are people scared that more and more will realize just how brutally they have been lied to by governments, wealthy organizations, etc.')
