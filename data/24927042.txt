I&#x27;m trying to say that what happened _wouldn&#x27;t_ have been fine _even if_ OP had committed a grave misdeed.<p>If communication had been better, I bet they could have talked this through without OP getting emotionally fucked up to the point of swearing off giving talks altogether. Like it could conceivably have been a chat like &quot;oh no the other person is my friend and cool with this&quot; &quot;oh ok&quot;.<p>I remain confident that the JupyterCon people are in favor of critiquing ideas and that they would not have barred OP from doing so in the talk, even if the situation had been different and this had happened in advance of the conference, if productive communication had been possible.<p>And while I don&#x27;t think it would be _fine_, I suspect OP would have preferred to be uninvited in advance for bad reasons instead of having this awful experience after the fact.')
