In that regard, AMD developing an &quot;M1&quot; competitor, when they already have class-leading x86 processors, doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Renoir -- AMD&#x27;s current-generation mobile and desktop processors -- is already competitive with M1 (although integrated GPU performance is lackluster), and their next-generation Cezanne processors are right around the corner.<p>On the server side (since that&#x27;s mentioned elsewhere in this thread), AMD previously released ARM-based Opteron processors, but they were slow and unpopular, and further work on that lineup was cancelled in favor of EPYC. Given that EPYC has single-handedly killed the entire ARM server ecosystem practically overnight (with the survivors being relegated to custom processors for supercomputers and hyperscalers), it&#x27;s highly unlikely that AMD would revive their ARM efforts for this market.<p>The only situation where an ARM-based AMD processor would make sense, would be as a custom processor where someone else is footing the R&amp;D and manufacturing bill. The only company that I could potentially see interested in such a thing (and would want an ARM-based processor specifically) is Apple themselves -- they need a high-performance ARM processor for the Mac Pro&#x2F;iMac Pro, and a Threadripper variant with an ARM ISA might make more sense than developing their own in-house high-performance processor for a low-volume line. But even then, it would be an M1 complement, not a competitor.<p>Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in this particular rumor.')
