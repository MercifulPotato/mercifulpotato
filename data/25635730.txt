He wen to HK, then was supposed to fly to Chile or Argentina through Moscow... But US government decided to disallow that.<p>So no - he didn&#x27;t &quot;flee to an adversary&quot;, as much as he was &quot;forced to stay at advesary&#x27;s&quot;.<p>PS: US &quot;justice&quot; system would have granted him no justice.
