For everyone who gets upset at the &quot;it&#x27;s simple...&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s just...&quot; (CICO, eat less, stay out of the kitchen, <i>etc.</i>) tone-deaf preachiness, remember that their satiation mechanism works very different from yours.<p>Figure out how to hack your satiation (it is very different for different people), and you have started to unwind the stack on how to address your intake challenges. Start your rabbit hole research with the search string &quot;long term induced satiety&quot; (but without the quotes), and branch off from there. That starts you off with physical and chemically-constrained satiety, but there are cultural, mental, social, financial, and many other factors at play as well that might be dominant in your particular situation so go in those directions if it makes sense to you. YMMV.')
