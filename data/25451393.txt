The right is meaningless in practice. You will be threatened with arrest and likely arrested for resisting arrest if you actually are in danger of videoing anything that&#x27;s important. The actual act will likely be obscured by policemen who will stand in between, block the view, or shine their flashlights into your camera.<p>If I see the cops doing something obviously insane, I will turn and walk away. I didn&#x27;t see anything. When you engage with power, you know not to threaten it.')
