I added HN home page as a “web app” on my Home Screen, works perfectly. Another “web app” I use this way is a Grafana dashboard, and it even hides web browser GUI, so I’d say it looks and feel “native” enough, and very useful for quickly reviewing charts.<p>What I wouldn’t like for battery and privacy is if a web app could have _background_ activity — sending data to its servers, having access to mic&#x2F;camera&#x2F;sensors, running JavaScript spaghetti non-stop when I am not having the thing in the foreground.<p>You could reasonably say that it’s exactly what a native app would do, but:<p>1) native apps are reviewed by an authority I trust, upon every app update — and developers are responsible with their money and ability to make future apps, which makes the apps better for privacy, more conformant with the current OS best practices and UI&#x2F;accessibility guidelines,<p>2) native apps are also mostly native code, so they are easier on the battery without sacrificing responsiveness.')
