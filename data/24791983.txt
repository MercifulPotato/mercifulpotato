Truly game changing for me.  I can iterate an idea 5 times faster at least, not to mention hundreds of times cheaper (in some cases $800 part down to ~$5 part)<p>Even faster would be better, but print speed often isn&#x27;t the bottleneck, solving engineering problems often is.<p>That said, of course faster would be better.')
