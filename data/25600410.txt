Item(by='cambalache', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609470094, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600330, text='&gt; So, bitcoin doesn&#x27;t really benefits Venezuelans, the only thing that benefits venezuelans is the localbitcoins escrow service, but this is not because its cripto or because its bitcoin, it&#x27;s just because noone else offers an escrow service to sucessfully exchange currency, that&#x27;s pretty much it.<p>This is the argument. I dont need to address anything. BTW, not that it matters but I dont hold bitcoins , I am not a trader and I dont have any association with localbitcoins, I even agreed with the points presented in the article (check my post history) now check OP&#x27;s.')
