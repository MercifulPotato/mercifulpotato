USB 3.0 uses one pair per direction for 5 GBit&#x2F;s. The analog bandwidth of USB 3.0 extends to 3+ GHz. 10GBASE-T only goes up to ~400 MHz or so.<p>Running at much lower frequencies makes it reach much farther, makes it more immune to EMI and makes it more reliable (because the margins are much fatter when you are only using 10 % of the possible minimum cable length).')
