Assuming everyone knew one of their grandparents, it&#x27;s more like 40 interpersonal &quot;links&quot;.<p>I honestly feel like if Europe didn&#x27;t have the Early Middle Ages (~500-1000AD), we would feel pretty connected to all the history that happened before in the same way that we feel pretty connected to Copernicus developing Heliocentrism or Columbus arriving in the New World.<p>I wonder whether civilizations with seemingly more continuous histories like China feel more connection to the rest of their history. India&#x27;s history was sort of interrupted by Islamic invasions starting from the 1200s. The Middle East, despite its tremendously long history, experienced a significant shift in culture with the rise of Christianity and then Islam.<p>If Chinese people don&#x27;t feel that historical connection, on the other hand, it might mean that our disconnect with ancient history might more just be a product of Modernity and the rapid change of the last couple centuries.')
