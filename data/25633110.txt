It&#x27;s definitely not <i>most</i> money but yes there&#x27;s a lost of waste because it&#x27;s a 12 figure industry with lots of politics, perverse incentives, thousands of vendors, and a complex global supply chain.<p>Fraud is a special case because it&#x27;s criminal activity and has nothing to do with advertising. It happens in every industry but it&#x27;s especially easy with online technology spanning multiple countries and data that can be easily faked. Uber was exceedingly oblivious here but I wouldn&#x27;t extrapolate advertising efficacy from these examples.')
