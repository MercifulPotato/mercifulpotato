Item(by='seanwilson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604202927, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24956938, text='&gt; document.getElementById(&quot;asdf&quot;)<p>&gt; document.getElementsByTagName<p>For what it&#x27;s worth I usually wrap these functions to e.g. throw an error if they don&#x27;t find any items as that&#x27;s what you usually want to happen but forget to write checks for. It&#x27;s rare I&#x27;ll use getElementById and expect it not to find something.<p>Lots of undefined + null values crop up from situations like this  where you want to fail when something you expect to be there isn&#x27;t found e.g. file handling, dictionaries, web requests.<p>It&#x27;s a no-brainer to use TypeScript as well if you want robustness from these kinds of bugs, where returning undefined or a value is more practical because TypeScript will force you to check for undefined. I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would willingly give up to type checks like these as it&#x27;s obvious to me you can&#x27;t compete with automated checking.')
