Flat white image compresses far better, so that portion of the file doesn&#x27;t take as much space.<p>Depending on what your layers look like (how many, how much they cover, etc.) it&#x27;s not too surprising that the preview image could take a substantial fraction of the total file size (sounds like ~20% in this case!)<p>* I believe this behavior can be toggled off with an option.')
