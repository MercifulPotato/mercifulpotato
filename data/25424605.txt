I also got an x-ray which doesn&#x27;t tend to indicate gout, but did show some mobility issues (hallux limitus&#x2F;rigidus) which were treated with increasingly expensive orthotic inserts.... and it went away after the initial issue for <i>five years</i>. Then it came back, new <i>custom</i> inserts (and some naproxen), went away for another twenty months. When it came back, it kind of stuck around, not the full on pain, but a dull aching that just wouldn&#x27;t quit, thus the more thorough investigation.<p>In my case, I think the causes were a combination of gout triggers - not enough hydration, alcohol intake, high protein diets, etc.')
