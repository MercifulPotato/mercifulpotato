Wealth is exclusionary control over finite resources, and coercive control over others (particularly their labor). My ownership of my car literally means the right to exclude others from the usage of it.<p>&gt; Bob creating more wealth than Fred does not mean that Bob took it from Fred.<p>Yes it does. Property law violently denied it from Fred, on behalf of Bob.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s nothing unfair about Bob creating more than Fred.<p>Yes there is. Wealth isn&#x27;t creation, it&#x27;s about control (ask any open source developer about this). It&#x27;s about Bob forcing Fred to work for sub minimum wage in his chain of stores because Bob inherited them from Bob Snr.')
