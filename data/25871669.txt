Item(by='majewsky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611323837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25871190, text='My daily wardrobe features a rotation of 15 T-shirts, paired with another rotation of longsleeves for cold seasons, all in plain generic colors to make it easy to match.<p>My accounting data says I got those shirts in August 2018. I have worn one of these 15 T-shirts everyday since then (with very few exceptions, e.g. when formal wear was called for). Let&#x27;s round that to 2.5 years, i.e. 912 days, i.e. about 60 wears per shirt. I&#x27;m not seeing any significant degradation on these shirts, so I can easily see myself wearing these at least another 3 years, which would be over 130 wears per shirt.<p>For reference, this is the model I&#x27;m wearing right now: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gildan.se&#x2F;en&#x2F;o61001-en-grey" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gildan.se&#x2F;en&#x2F;o61001-en-grey</a>')
