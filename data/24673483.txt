Item(by='justinlloyd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601746530, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24666968, text='That website only seems to list two TV&#x27;s (with Amazon Affiliate links) and I conjecture it was written by an outsourced writer who has never owned either of the TVs.<p>Sceptre, from my understanding, is an LG or Samsung panel with off-brand electronics. But I could well be wrong on that point. I read a write-up on the company a year or two ago.<p>If you are looking for a dumb TV, in any size, with any combination of features, or &quot;not so smart&quot; TV that has Android and a few other features, there are two sources to consider. The first is Aliexpress. Many of the manufacturers sell their TVs directly on to eBay for a small markup. You will find dumb TVs or semi-smart TVs without all the nonsense, and lots of features, for very reasonable rates. The problem will be the warranty, quality and life cycle. Spare parts are abundant and cheap, so long as your panel is good (and you can even replace that), then most repair jobs are &quot;swap out this board for that board.&quot; If you can absorb that risk, many people who buy at Best Buy or other big box store want cheap price and convenience and low-risk, then this is a great option. If you have seen something at a trade-show (flexible TV, 120 inch TV, transparent TV, double-sided TV), you will find an Aliexpress vendor that has that exact model for around 20% to 40% of the price of the manufacturer. They are buying the exact same panels, the exact same electronics, and putting these TVs together in a generic, non-branded plastic case. Sometimes the bezels are a little larger. Sometimes the remote is a piece of junk.<p>I have a 55&quot; dumb TV on my wall that runs a Linux based OS with SSH access that can also run Android apps. I don&#x27;t want regular TV on it. But I can pipe video games to it, let me watch a Youtube tutorial, have a Google Meetup for work, or a bunch of other tasks that don&#x27;t require a computer, and the TV leaks no data outside of the network. Cost was around $300 several years ago.<p>In storage, for my wife&#x27;s conference business, we have two, dual-sided 60&quot; TVs with 20 point multi-touch that run a weird flavour of Android in a dual-screen setup. Cost per device a few years back was something like $450.<p>We&#x27;re considering a 4K 90&quot; wallpaper TV with 20-point touch to mount on our dining room wall to replace our aging kitchen computer. I expect to pay about $2,500 for it. The reason it is under consideration because we&#x27;re also contemplating a 55&quot; version that has the hardened glass overlay. I would expect to pay under $600 for that.<p>I&#x27;ve also contemplated replacing the digital ceiling in my wife&#x27;s studio with cheap 4K screens from Aliexpress. But I am procrastinating on that as I don&#x27;t want to have to re-render all the art.<p>If you want quality with a long warranty, service &amp; repairs, and can afford a little more, every major manufacturer out there builds a hospitality line of their product. LG has an amazing line-up of dumb TVs or semi-smart TVs that sport all of the normal input features, often with LAN control, sometimes with higher brightness or dynamic ranges, and available at any size you desire, and without any of the network leakage you expect because hospitality businesses don&#x27;t like that kind of shit. You can get a 55&quot; 4K LG commercial display TV for around $700 brand new. For a while I had a 55&quot; LG 4K TV with 20-point multi-touch and variable viewing angle overlay in portrait orientation at my desk. I used to project 3D scenes on to it (when I wasn&#x27;t using it for work) of rainy or snowy landscapes because it would trick your brain in to thinking it was an actual window. It was as close as you could get to Portal technology for under $1,500.')
