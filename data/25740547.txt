That&#x27;s how corporate capitalism works. Most of things people buy, they drop second day and forget about it. To give a prosaic example - if people use phone for calling they don&#x27;t have to buy new phone every year.<p>People are also conformists so they believe new is better. Most of them don&#x27;t want to wait for this better to arrive, if they wait, they imagine things how this new stuff will look like and create false dreams.<p>They didn&#x27;t invested time, they wanted to have things they imagined to be good - nobody imagine bad stuff for themselves. They lived in this imaginary world for long time and created pyramids and flying cars and as always at the end reality hit them hard. The bigger your imaginary world grow the bigger slap you get at the end - that&#x27;s simply called life.<p>The real problem is people don&#x27;t have much freedom these days besides internet and games due to how other things outside looks like. And world looks like this cause of the same people who think they live in the world they imagined not in the real world. The insanity grows bigger and bigger and sometimes blows. When it blows people are angry and fight. After that there is peace cause they go back to their imaginary world full of borders they already created.')
