One would expect blockchain based systems or at least a cryptographically based system to exist. The fact that they don&#x27;t even have a national voter ID. Like seriously how much does it cost to have one and give it for free to every person? Poorer countries have done so with more success. The calls arguing voter suppression are the dumbest, if you are not smart enough to get a card and vote, then maybe that vote should not count.')
