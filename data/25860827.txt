That’s why many people who have only the remotest prospect of ever making their way into the top income-tax bracket nonetheless favor keeping that tax rate low, and why people who have no chance of inheriting money from a taxable estate passionately oppose “death taxes.”<p>Wouldn&#x27;t you say it&#x27;s a bit one-sided to attribute <i>all</i> support for lower income&#x2F;inheritance tax rates to naïve&#x2F;aspirational optimism? I&#x27;d say most people in this group are well aware that their odds of making it into the top income brackets are slim; but even so they still feel that it&#x27;s fundamentally wrong to <i>steal</i> from people, even ones who are currently better off than they are, in hopes of slightly improving their own circumstances. I also think they understand (far better than certain political economists, at any rate) that the existence of others who are wealthier than themselves is no threat to their own well-being, and that we&#x27;re <i>all</i> better off helping each other to improve rather than dragging down anyone who dares to get ahead.')
