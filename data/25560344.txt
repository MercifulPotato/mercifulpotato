But what he&#x27;s saying isn&#x27;t that there&#x27;s nothing to be scared <i>of</i>, just that this particular type of BS is just as often written about things that actually aren&#x27;t real problems.<p>This is the exact same tone the anti-vaccination crew consume constantly - it holds no numbers, and threatens us with words like &quot;poison&quot;, &quot;unique properties&quot;, and &quot;have confirmed links&quot;, without specifying how strong those links are, or how much actual impact they have.
