Previously it was &#x27;Developer&#x27;s response to “WireGuard: great protocol, but skip the Mac app”&#x27;.<p>Neither of these are the actual title, so that can&#x27;t be the rule it was operating under, and the fact that it&#x27;s a developer (as opposed to some other user or Apple&#x2F;Wireguard fanboy&#x2F;hater) does change the context, at least for me.')
