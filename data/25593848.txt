I was irritated by constant WP and plugins updates, which often cause incompatibilities and break things, all of the sudden. Not even mentioning security holes, and monster MySQL as a single source of truth.<p>There was one thing that struck me when I finally migrate to JAMstack. How to optimize blog posts SEO as I used to do by using Yoast or The SEO framework. These tools were so essential for my workflow that I even consider them as a part of WP core.<p>I was Googling hard to find any solution but nothing popped up. So I decided to build a simple web app to React just to fulfill basic needs:\n- optimize post title and description length\n- make sure the title and description has all targeted keywords\n- make sure post content keyword saturation has the right balance, not too little not to much<p>I build it with Gatsby over the weekend, and it worked well. Then I decided to polish it a bit and share it with the public as a free tool, and so I did.<p>The goal is to make this tool user-friendly and updated to follow current best SEO practices. It&#x27;s much easier to achieve that goal when the product is available for everyone, and it&#x27;s free to use.<p>I launched it today on Product Hunt - my first PH launch ever. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;jam-seo-tools<p>I know the current workflow may be a bit clunky - we have to copy &amp; paste content back and forth from markdown files - but it has all the basic and most of the premium features of mentioned WP plugins. I&#x27;m open to any suggestions on how to improve it.<p>Let me know your thoughts about it. Do you need such a tool at all, and if so, how to make it better?<p>Thanks')
