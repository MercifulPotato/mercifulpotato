It&#x27;s not really years away what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>The intention is to gather interest&#x2F;feedback, then build and repeat, not the other way around. This is how I know I&#x27;m investing my time on features that my customers actually want.<p>I failed miserably in past products by working for a year on a &quot;feature-complete&quot; service, only to realize there was no product-market fit. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m turning things around this time.<p>And thanks for sharing your thoughts, this is valuable feedback for me and I now know the landing pages need more work :)')
