While it was difficult at the start, after a while you get used to it. And I lost a ton of weight without even trying.<p>I don&#x27;t eat bread, fruit (barring a small amount of lemon&#x2F;lime juice in food), or <i>any</i> grains or root veg (potatoes are worse than table sugar for spiking blood glucose!).<p>I do eat meat, eggs, and lots of low-carb veg - leafy veg, broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, chicory, aubergine, courgette, peppers, tomatoes, carrots, onions etc.<p>I also eat plenty dairy too - cheese has no carbs, and a small amount of milk&#x2F;cream has very little.')
