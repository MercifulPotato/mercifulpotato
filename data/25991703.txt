Is there a way to see which products&#x2F;services are available through Angaza in a particular country? Specifically Kenya<p>Angaza is a B2B SaaS company. We don&#x27;t distribute physical products ourselves, but we provide sales, IoT, and operational software used by last-mile distribution companies [1] in many different countries.<p>Some of the hardware we work with is listed on:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devices.angaza.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devices.angaza.com&#x2F;</a><p>A typical distributor imports and sells only a small subset of that entire ecosystem, though.<p>Kenya specifically is a huge market for Angaza customers! Sun King and Mwezi are two examples. To be clear, Angaza and our customers focus on relatively small solar + DC appliances for rural and peri-urban households. If you&#x27;re in Kenya and looking for a larger solar installation (1 kW+), you&#x27;ll need to work with a local solar installer instead.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25638647" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25638647</a><p>[1] e.g., <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globaldistributorscollective.org&#x2F;our-members&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globaldistributorscollective.org&#x2F;our-members&#x2F;</a>')
