This would be similar to calling someone an idiot. Or &quot;you program like someone that&#x27;s never taken a class in it&quot;.<p>These are difficult to take positively because nearly every connotation implies that they&#x27;re somehow lacking something.<p>Rather than speaking about how someone is lacking, it&#x27;s wiser to speak about how what they&#x27;re doing is a positive.<p>&quot;You didn&#x27;t go to college, did you?&quot; is negative; but, &quot;Are you self-taught?&quot; is a positive.<p>Self-taught implies a sort of stick-to-it-iveness and discipline, where as not going to college, again, implies a failing on that person.<p>Does this make sense?')
