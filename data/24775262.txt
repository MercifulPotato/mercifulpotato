It&#x27;s not like Hindi and Urdu, where (I&#x27;m told) people with no previous exposure to the other language can communicate pretty readily.<p>But there are a huge number of words which are simply pronounced a bit differently; and the differences in pronunciation have a lot of predictable patterns.
