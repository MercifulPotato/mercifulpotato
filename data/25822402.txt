It can be quite difficult to determine someone&#x27;s capability at interview-time. But company B had lots of competency &quot;false positives&quot; (in my view) whereas company A had very few. That&#x27;s the value of a technical interview.<p>That said, of course the XOR solution would never be the only one accepted, but it would probably get you brownie points here.')
