I need to compile bits of information from each page, and then I never need those pages again.  Why would I use bookmarks?<p>For example, last week I was shopping for a very specific, very expensive ceramic thrust bearing.  I had 20+ pages open from 10+ suppliers and documentation sources.  I needed those open all week while we decided on which one to buy.  This was a minor background task, so I also had 60 other tabs open for my normal work flow.<p>Just because people use a tool differently than you doesn&#x27;t make them wrong.')
