It&#x27;s not like human drivers are perfect; for decades, long-haul truckers have been known for drug use just to keep awake. [1] And trucks break down for all sorts of reasons, so &quot;robot has issues and pulls over&quot; could plausiblly be just another one of those.<p>I think the economics of remote backup drivers is working for Waymo, so I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work for truck drivers, which are higher value. And for the you-need-somebody-on-site problems, there&#x27;s already a network of tow and repair services that will surely be willing to send someone out.<p>Fueling seems similarly surmountable. Semis have very long ranges, and fuel up at specialist facilities that are just off the highway. I don&#x27;t think it will take much persuasion for truck stops to offer full service fueling on a $500 fill-up. And it&#x27;s not obvious that security will be worse. An automated truck is going to have a lot of high-quality cameras and be in continuous contact with a staffed operations center. The vehicle may be effectively impossible to steal, and transferring a semi&#x27;s worth of cargo is not a fast process.<p>I think it&#x27;s also important to note that to start it doesn&#x27;t actually have to be better. It just has to be a) within shouting distance, and b) exciting enough that some exec thinks they&#x27;ll get a promotion out of it.<p>[1] e.g. this from 1973 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;genius.com&#x2F;Jim-croce-speedball-tucker-lyrics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;genius.com&#x2F;Jim-croce-speedball-tucker-lyrics</a> and this from the Trucking Alliance: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;truckingalliance.org&#x2F;new-study-supports-projection-of-drug-abuse-in-the-trucking-industry&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;truckingalliance.org&#x2F;new-study-supports-projection-o...</a>')
