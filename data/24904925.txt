India has one of the world&#x27;s &quot;best&quot; anti-business systems that will create hurdles all along the way to the top. If you do get to the top, the same systems will become your ally (as you would have learned to grease those).<p>Apart from the regular business troubles and risks, the unease of doing (not just starting) business in India is a huge growth barrier. And it is worsening. The bureaucracy is just horrible and spiced with corruption all over from taxation to approvals. The leaders have little control on that. And it may not visible for first 1-3 years of business growth time, it consistently hits and threatens you as you grow further.<p>Having said that -  Any economy focused strong leader in India could flip that view in a matter of 6 months or a year. It might require reducing the bureaucracy resources by 70-75%. Otherwise the country might be selling the same hopes &amp; dreams for next 50 years or more. India has talented resources and is potentially a talent goldmine, but they are mostly hidden, misused, abused, suppressed, unaware or just moved out.<p>I guess this will attract a lot of downvotes')
