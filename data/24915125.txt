Additionally, I had no idea the old hangouts app icon was Google hangouts, as I never used it. But evidently the icon itself wasn&#x27;t enough to get my attention as being Google&#x27;s<p>The only icon I don&#x27;t like is the Google docs one as the icon itself doesn&#x27;t really convey what it is.
