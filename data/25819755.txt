We both want to make sure we don&#x27;t get bogged down with superfluous stuff, so we give them to people who will appreciate and use them, but we also see it as an opportunity to not support corporations that do not have our (societal) best interests in mind.<p>The less stuff we buy, the less our money is used for purposes we disagree with or even abhor, in many cases. By buying the few things we <i>do</i> buy from small companies with responsible profiles, that&#x27;s another step towards our money going to better purposes.<p>I don&#x27;t really believe in the &quot;power of the consumer&quot; or &quot;voting with your wallet&quot; (both of which just lead to unnecessary consumption), hence why we try to buy as little new stuff as possible and prefer buying second hand whenever possible, but at least the little money we <i>do</i> spend won&#x27;t be going (directly) to the exploiter&#x27;s pockets.')
