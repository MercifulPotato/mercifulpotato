I followed a conversation about James Joyce novel which was hinted that there is a difference between the two names and Joyce didn&#x27;t pick &quot;Ulysses&quot; randomly. I&#x27;d like to know if you went through the same process.<p>UPDATE: Ok, I mis-read the comment, I though the name of the Novel was Ulysses, apparently it is an app.')
