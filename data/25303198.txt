Even in absolute terms. It makes me realize there are things out there that I&#x27;m obviously not even aware of that cause us to pump all this CO2 into the air.<p>Or maybe the transportation and power generation sectors pollute far more than what I read and believed?<p>Or maybe clothing manufacture? Or food?<p>Who knows? But it&#x27;s made me really curious about what it is out there that hasn&#x27;t gone down during COVID? (And not just because I want to make a fast buck. It&#x27;s genuine curiosity.)')
