Item(by='sudosysgen', descendants=None, kids=[25954827], score=None, time=1611872179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25949785, text='There is a very simple definition for things that absolutely aren&#x27;t productive. Things that produce nothing are not productive. Owning land is not productive, and should not be profitable at all. It is settled economics that the profitability of non-productive actions (often called <i>rent</i>-seeking) is bad.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter what your threshold for affordability is. Rent is increasing faster than economic growth, on average. It will continue increasing at this rate until a large part of the population literally cannot afford housing. You&#x27;re never going to be able to solve the issue of people not being able to afford rent once it stops being economical to increase density, because there will be no incentive for landlords not to push up rent until people can&#x27;t afford it anymore and start to move out (which is what we don&#x27;t want to happen).<p>There are no cases where rent control literally did not affect mobility. There are many cases where there <i>is</i> rent control, <i>and</i> high mobility. The city in which I live has around 40% of renters move each year, which is more than enough mobility, and rent control. You do this by using the additional regulatory framework to make it easier for people to move.<p>Your first paragraph is literally meaningless. No one here said anything about zoning except you. If you want argue against someone else, then argue against someone else. The arguments I put forth and your response were completely orthogonal.<p>The rest is simply pure ideology. If you want to convince people or build a coalition with people that disagree with you, put your free-market absolutism aside and focus on solutions and problems.')
