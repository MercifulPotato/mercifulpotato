It&#x27;s people who are putting every penny of their money on Tesla calls and spending every hour of their day making sure to spread the good news of Tesla and metaphorically stoning anyone who dares speak against Elon Musk.<p>This will almost certainly not end well at some point, especially since the valuation exceeds even a scenario where Tesla becomes a global monopoly in a number of industries.  How long will it take for the cult to realize this?  Maybe never.')
