When I bother, I just recommend a credible book instead that talks about it and supports it with lots of evidence.<p>Actually, I am going to suggest it here just now because it is a great book and I would like more people to have a more accurate view on addiction: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;global.oup.com&#x2F;academic&#x2F;product&#x2F;addiction-and-choice-9780198727224" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;global.oup.com&#x2F;academic&#x2F;product&#x2F;addiction-and-choice...</a> (Addiction and Choice: Rethinking the relationship by Nick Heather and Gabriel Segal). It is from 2016, but most people&#x27;s views on addiction is more than a few decades old, and all things considered, it is still fairly recent and all recent studies support these views. Please, if you are interested in addiction, have a read. :) It will get you up to date with it, and dispel lots of misconceptions that are still in the head of laymen.')
