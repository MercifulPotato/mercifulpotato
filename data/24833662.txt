By 2000 I&#x27;d put probably $60M into gcc alone.<p>You mean the tools that are maintained by huge teams in large companies, because the they are critical to the paid products or services sold by these companies? Sure, technically it&#x27;s free software, but de-facto they are decentralized loss leaders behind fairly solid business models.<p>&gt;It just seems odd you are so casually dismissive.\nI&#x27;m just talking about my own expectations and experience.
