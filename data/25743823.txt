Get a large number of &quot;not very active, but known and generally acceptable&quot; people. Spam reports for any old posts that can be taken the wrong way. Wait for any success story. You&#x27;re bound to find someone who isn&#x27;t currently protected, or someone who will make a review mistake.<p>To be clear: I&#x27;m not saying this is what happened. Only that we know targeted mass-reporting to get people banned happens and is successful, so it&#x27;s one of possibilities.')
