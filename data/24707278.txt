Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602071610, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24705979, text='&gt;In my experience most kitchens don&#x27;t actually own them, they rent them with a maintenance and supply cost attached to them, which get very costly.<p>Most kitchens can neither in-house maintenance nor wash dished by hand (because health code) if the machine goes down.  If you can in-house the maintenance and can afford to wash dishes by hand for a week while a new widget ships from China then commercial machines are cheap enough to own (up front cost not withstanding).')
