(Or any other percentile.)  If not, what would falsify that statement?<p>Singapore is an interesting case.  You are right about ownership.  I am basing my estimate more on eg the low rate of government spending compared to total GDP, general ease of doing business, light touch regulation.<p>Close to my heart (coming from Germany) is the absence of pervasive occupational licensing in Singapore.  Similarly the absence of minimum wage laws.<p>&gt; The rest of the paper goes into detail explaining how the government routinely intervenes with subsidies and tax policy in order to force the market into whatever shape it deems fit. So I think the fact that people view Singapore at anything close to a free market is more a testament to just how effective the propaganda that has been pushing free market economic thought has been.<p>I am currently living in Singapore, and so far the &#x27;propaganda&#x27; has been so effective that even living here I still see that it&#x27;s fairly pro-market.<p>And that includes talking to &#x27;normal&#x27; locals, and also to people running businesses here.<p>Malaysia is useful for contrast.  The government is a much bigger drag on the economy there.<p>The paper you quote is fairly old, and also doesn&#x27;t seem to reflect the consensus of economists.  (It&#x27;s nonetheless interesting though.)')
