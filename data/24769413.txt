This has several subjective benefits: more light can be used for shorter exposure time or lower ISO (sensor gain) each leading to a sharper image. Also, it creates a shallower depth of field or &quot;more blur&quot; which separates the subject for a more pleasing picture. (This may be irrelevant on sensors as small as on a phone, which counteract shallow depth of field effects.)\nIt may reduce the image quality if the lens of of lower quality, as it is more expensive to build large-aperture lenses.')
