I&#x27;d say a typical day had 2x 2.5-3 hour blocks of productive coding, the rest of the 8-10 hour work day was meetings&#x2F;conversations&#x2F;etc plus an hour or two of not-work (internet, walking outside, etc).<p>This varied quite a bit over time, based on team and project.  Greenfield projects, usually done in a group with lots of peer-programming and fast iteration were quite different than solo maintenance of legacy codebases.')
