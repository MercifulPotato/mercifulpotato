And then, all of a sudden, it wasn&#x27;t encrypted and didn&#x27;t take up space. But you don&#x27;t have access to it yourself - only Google does (and WhatsApp if it is recovering). This is a perfect way to provide all the data to various governments for 99.9% of users, without killing the E2E encryption.')
