Well I tried to make it work so that literally any project you have sitting on your system can be imported into the app.  In principle it should work, in practice the amount of block code elements can quickly become overwhelming.<p>At the end of wrapping up the beta version, I was using math inspector to create math inspector, this is how I wrote the TextParser[1] class, and there is a certain beauty to the way the files were synchronized, but since everything was still in development I finished up by running a test file from the command line instead, and have not had a chance to keep working on that aspect.<p>I think the more the app gets dog-fooded in this way, the more clear it will become what the optimal UI&#x2F;UX is.  Math Inspector is not an IDE, but it does create an additional visual layer that is kind of helpful during development, especially for quickly testing&#x2F;iterating any changes<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MathInspector&#x2F;MathInspector&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;mathinspector&#x2F;doc&#x2F;show_textfile.py" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MathInspector&#x2F;MathInspector&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;m...</a>')
