I grew up on C and C++ and went on to learn Python, JS, etc. Eventually I finally wrote actual code in Scala and thought it was fine. Didn’t love the syntax, not great at “thinking” functionally, but loved sum types and pattern matching.<p>I feel like Rust is the perfect mix for me because it gives me the aspects I like about functional programming languages (sum types, pattern matching, strong type inference) combined with composition based polymorphism and an almost C++ like attitude towards meta programming (though obviously with a clean slate.) I do think that learning to “think functionally” better would be good; maybe I should listen to the 4chan meme and read SICP after all. :)')
