Currently we have open source elements like agents which need to be installed on clients endpoints as well as SDKs and other helper tools to use the platform. We endeavour to expand on our open source toolkit and involve + incentivise broader community to build as well. The SaaS controller is currently closed sourced as well as our routers. We&#x27;re planning to follow a model similar to Terraform where main functionality and technology is fully open sourced and if you want to use the SaaS platform with additional functionality you use paid and enterprise accounts. We are also planning to deploy decentralized microservices to interact with open sourced agents in the future so some functionality can be used by decentralized systems themselves. You can find more information about the stack in our documentation page at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.syntropystack.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.syntropystack.com&#x2F;</a>')
