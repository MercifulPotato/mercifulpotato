In my case I got a rescue puppy, 5 months old. Didn&#x27;t have any shots. And wasn&#x27;t spayed - and we couldn&#x27;t due to her state - got to us full of all kinds of parasites and malnourished, not to mention the previous &quot;owner&quot; left the poor thing locked up in a dark garage ALL DAY, plus punishments whenever the dog would poop.<p>Needless to say, there were issues. Still, we were lucky that family members had pets (all sorts of pets), so we could socialize in a controlled environment.<p>Now we got a well-adjusted pet (minus some separation anxiety issues we have managed to control, but not eliminate). That is, well-adjusted, provided there&#x27;s enough exercising :)')
