That it could be evaded is IMO irrelevant if it usually isn&#x27;t. If people largely follow the law and use the legal process, then the law works.<p>Which you can see in Germany â€” people use the legal machinery to regulate speech on Facebook. Publish a swastika on Facebook and people will complain about you to the police (perhaps via Facebook), and the prosecutor will apply the law of the land. That you could evade it is true, that most people trust the law is significant.')
