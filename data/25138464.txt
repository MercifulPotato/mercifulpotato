Whereas, typing &quot;www.foobar.com&quot; directly does not trigger the message.<p>I’m not sure where the auto-switch from &quot;foobar.com&quot; to &quot;www.foobar.com&quot; occurs; if it’s in the browser, ideally Firefox would attempt this auto-correct first and try the HTTPS connection to the corrected location, to minimize the chance of triggering a warning.')
