The client won&#x27;t send a cookie from domain foo.bar.com to baz.bar.com, unless you set your cookie domain to *.bar.com, which may be bad for other reasons. Even if you get you cookie domains right, there has to be a single source of session truth across the system. This gets to be complex in distributed systems.<p>On the other hand, a client can usefully send a JWT to any other service that has the secret key to validate it, and once validated, the information the service needs can be in the JWT itself, so there&#x27;s not session lookup needed.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between giving a friend your parking stub so they can go pick up your keys from the attendant and bring your car back vs giving the friend a copy of your key and having him get the car from wherever it might be.')
