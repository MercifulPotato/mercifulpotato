Item(by='sokoloff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610885680, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25809205, text='Not permitting several weeks’ notice for a “last time buy” is crappy, though that’s fairly unusual and not a well understood action in the consumer segment as compared to enterprise, so I’m not sure that you or I could personally have gotten any in any meaningful way. They’re still available in-channel (NewEgg and Dell both have them at normal-seeming prices) right now for consumers who <i>need</i> them, which is effectively a “last time buy” in the consumer segment. I’d be surprised if Dell was not given a last-time buy notice.<p>I’m not nearly as convinced that “Intel once stopped selling Optane drives for consumers; you can’t trust them” is anywhere near as likely (nor valid) as “Intel has made major mis-steps in microcode resulting in serious degradation of performance after the sale for mitigations, seems to be struggling with their next process step change, and is facing major pressures now not just from AMD but now from ARM and Apple”.<p>In some sense the Optane decision is like the Google one. “Should I bet something important on this technology that isn’t making the company any money?” is a very fair question to ask.')
