Your take home pay is affected by the choice of your employer to spend money on the benefits.<p>Over time, which is what we are talking about here, the choice of the employer to put money into benefits in order to create an attractive compensation package means they are <i>not</i> putting money into wages (assuming for simplicity that those are the only two buckets to consider).  So wages can stagnate while total compensation goes up.<p>Yes you can conclude from this that your take home pay is stagnant, what you can&#x27;t conclude is that there hasn&#x27;t been an increase in compensation. And if you are trying to determine if compensation is correlated with productivity gains (i.e. the original article) then you can&#x27;t just pretend those benefits aren&#x27;t part of the compensation equation.')
