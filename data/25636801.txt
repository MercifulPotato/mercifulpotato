Alibaba&#x27;s backed by and invested by Jiang&#x27;s families.<p>Xi has been purging Jiang&#x27;s people&#x2F;influence on the Central Government for the last few years to strengthen his ruling. Originally he was going to leave Ma alone as he has proven himself to be useful.<p>But 2 things happened- 1. people start to idolize Ma the businessman over the party&#x27;s absolute rule. 2. Perhaps as a result Ma is embolden to speak out against Xi&#x27;s government directions.<p>So now Ma has to go. Ma knew this and that&#x27;s why he resigned from Alibaba&#x27;s Chairman position, but it was too late. Ant Financial, with its main backers from Jiang&#x27;s gang, was put to a standstill. This is only the first step. Expect the party to eventually to take over the Alibaba group (国进民退). No private civilian will be allowed to gain this much power again.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5926062&#x2F;jack-ma&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5926062&#x2F;jack-ma&#x2F;</a><p>“There is no so-called [Ma] era,” read a recent headline in the CCP mouthpiece People’s Daily, “but only an era that has [Ma] in it.”<p>Anyway, to quote House of Cards-<p>“Such a waste of time. He chose money over power, in this town, a mistake nearly everyone makes. Money is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years. Power — is the old stone building that stands for centuries. I cannot respect someone who doesn’t see the difference.” - Frank Underwood')
