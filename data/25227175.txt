The community, and more specifically &#x27;comment SNR&#x27; in Hacker News is really fantastically high, and you deserve a lot of praise for that. I also very much like the fact that the website is basically html 1 and loads very quickly. I&#x27;m not interested in the business &#x2F; startup scene at all, but the sheer breadth of expertise and community in all areas of life is very much something to celebrate.')
