Item(by='effie', descendants=None, kids=[25167075, 25167060], score=None, time=1605817761, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25145230, text='&gt; <i>&quot;for any given mass added to the hole after all those things are taken into account, there are many different possible combinations of objects falling into the hole that can add that mass.&quot;</i><p>Approximately, sure, best scales can do around 5 significant digits and null measurements can get us few more digits. But we can&#x27;t verify equality of mass to arbitrary precision. For elementary particles of same kind, we can assume their masses are the same. But there is infinity of digits available. Perhaps there are no two differently composed bodies that have the same real number as mass (too many options to be different). Then maybe any mass addition to mass of the black hole can encode all the information there is about the body.')
