From my research into the subject, including the article about the first cat  skeleton found with no teeth, indicating humans had fed it, is that they only associate with us because of our habit of debris and sloppiness that attracts their prey. Otherwise, feral felines are still unrepentant killing machines that will try and trip you while walking up the stairs just to feed them so they&#x27;ll stop yowling.<p>Source: Personal experience with a feral kitten I have &quot;domesticated&quot; and would probably feed on my corpse for a few days if I trip and fall and die even though she&#x27;s ~11 human years now.')
