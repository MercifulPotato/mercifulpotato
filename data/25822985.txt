Item(by='NoOneNew', descendants=None, kids=[25823211], score=None, time=1610985459, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25822615, text='The nurses in US schools (I&#x27;ve been out for 15 years, things may be different now) are mostly there if a kid gets a bloody nose, deals with a kid&#x27;s allergic reaction, verify a sudden extreme temperature to dismiss the kid or generally stabilize before a paramedic arrives if it&#x27;s serious. In high school, one kid cracked his head open on the gym floor from slipping while playing indoor soccer. Pretty much all she could do was slow the bleeding. Plus, school nurse isnt a cert nurse&#x27;s first pick in jobs. Which I dont blame them. Who would want to deal with kids all day trying to fake sickness so they can skip class? A simple cough and low fever wouldn&#x27;t get you out of class. You needed head lice, vomit 3 times within 1 hour, vomit blood, or a 101f fever to get out of class back in my day... or a cracked skull.<p>But &quot;infirmary&quot;... it&#x27;s a $25 first aid kit (at best) and like 2 EpiPens. I carry a better medical kit in the trunk of my car just because I like being prepared.')
