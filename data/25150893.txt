The author talks about the alert in terms of a dark pattern, but the notification directly lies to the user stating &quot;cannot be opened.&quot; In fact, the app <i>can</i> be opened by simply command-clicking and selecting open. However Apple lies to users in an effort to prevent them from using these applications. Sounds like a possible tortuous interference claim, or possibly fraud. Surely this &quot;warning&quot; serves to prevent users from using apps where Apple doesn&#x27;t get a cut, and cases them to use apps that Apple does profit from.')
