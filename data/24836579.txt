Basically, anything can be anything - depending on the context. Thus, an Arturo script can manipulate its own code, the way it can manipulate any other type of data.<p>Regarding Arturo&#x27;s implementation: It&#x27;s written in Nim (though I have written it in the past in almost every language you can think of... lol started with C++, went to D, then to Nim, back to C, and now in Nim again). Basically it&#x27;s a Stack-based Bytecode Virtual Machine. And yes, Forth&#x27;s influence is also important - although (intentionally) not that obvious at first sight.<p>The source text is parsed to an abstract structure&#x2F;tree of words and symbols. That&#x27;s the part that happens in translator&#x2F;parse.<p>Then if it&#x27;s an executable block, it is evaluated (as valid Arturo code) into Bytecode (this happens in translator&#x2F;eval), and then this bytecode is executed by the virtual machine (in vm&#x2F;exec).')
