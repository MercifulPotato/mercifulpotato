I myself moved to the US from Canada a decade ago.  The brain drain is real.<p>If you&#x27;re open to a move, good companies like the ones on this list will generally take care of healthcare to the extent that you won&#x27;t need to worry about it much, but I still do miss the Canadian model where money generally didn&#x27;t even enter into the equation.  They&#x27;ll usually take care of the immigration as well, and pay for the relocation.  Highest income would be in the Bay Area, but consider if you want to own a home and the costs involved in that; you might find another area to be a better deal (I&#x27;m biased toward Pittsburgh).  I personally found the Bay Area unworkable when I was looking before, mostly due to the fact that I had a family and wanted a home.<p>If you want to stay, your best bet would be to join a large multinational (Big N) and work at a Canadian office.')
