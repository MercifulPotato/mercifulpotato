You&#x27;re right that crossing 5 secs before the light turns green is one of the safest moments, but as I will happily demonstrate if you&#x27;d make it to the Netherlands, intersections need not be traffic arenas. Those solutions are halfbaked and still within an ill conceived approach to traffic.<p>Reducing speeds is essential, increasing predictability too, and naturally cyclists are no exception.')
