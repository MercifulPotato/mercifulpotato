If we take from <i>them</i> we&#x27;re perpetuating the same sort of theft? I agree if we were omniscient it would be &quot;right,&quot; but we&#x27;re far far from that.<p>Also, let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a reparation payment, but it doesn&#x27;t rectify inequality, because there are more systemic problems at play, like local tax revenue funding local schools, so poor towns have poor schools. After &quot;reparations,&quot; you don&#x27;t think voters will think &quot;we paid reparations, stop complaining.&quot;<p>If the purpose is &quot;righting a wrong&quot; I think the tool is too blunt and will create many more wrongs.<p>If the purpose is to &quot;fix inequality&quot;, I think it won&#x27;t address the underlying structural problems, but will &quot;check the box&quot; and absolve responsibilities.')
