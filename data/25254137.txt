This is pretty important -- without stack traces, it is very hard to make sense of error messages like &quot;Cannot open file &#x27;none&#x27;&quot; -- the filename is clearly wrong, but where did this come from.<p>- <i>chained exceptions</i> so you can add context trivially. Doing &quot;try: ... except: raise Exception(&#x27;Cannot load config&#x27;)&quot; will print both error messages and two stack traces, so you know both original error and better description.<p>- <i>verbose by default</i> so if you don&#x27;t put any effort into error handling, you get lots of details. This is somewhat controversial -- when some people see large stack traces their eyes glaze over and they just stop reading. But as a program&#x27;s author, I love this -- the stack traces are informative enough I can often figure out what&#x27;s wrong immediately.')
