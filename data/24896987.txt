Website developers should focus on bloat and address that. That doesn’t seem to be happening on a larger scale though.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s excellent that browsers consider privacy, but it looks like anything can be misused for tracking purposes these days.<p>Of course. Every bit of information you provide to a site will be misused to track and profile you. That’s what the advertising fueled web has gotten us to (I don’t blame it alone for the problems).<p>I wasn’t aware that Safari had handled the cache privacy issue in 2013. It seems like it has always been way ahead on user privacy (thought it’s not perfect by any means). I’ve been a long time Firefox user who has always cleared the caches regularly, and I’m curious to know if any browser has consistently provided more privacy out-of-the-box than Safari.')
