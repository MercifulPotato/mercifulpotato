A base-b representation of a number is a sequence of digits. A sequence is a function.<p>This is not a large conceptual chasm. It is boilerplate for actually talking about decimal (or binary or hex or whatever) representations of numbers. Here is one version of that boilerplate, spelled out:<p>Think of a base-10 representation of a natural number as a function with domain N (the set of natural numbers) and codomain {0, ..., 9}, where f(0) is the ones digit, f(1) is the tens digit, f(2) is the hundreds digit and so on. (This function will be finitely supported, i.e. all but finitely many inputs to this function will give output 0.)<p>If f and g are the representations of two numbers n and m, then one can say the following about the representation of their product n * m:<p><pre><code>  (1) Extend the codomain of f and g, to N, i.e. think of them as functions N -&gt; N instead of functions N -&gt; {0, ..., 9}.\n  (2) Compute the convolution of those two functions, giving you another (still finitely supported) function h: N -&gt; N. Usually at this point h will have values that are larger than 10.\n  (3) Do all the carrying (e.g. repeatedly take the first n for which h(n) &gt; 10, and subtract 10 from h(n) and add 1 to h(n+1)). Now all the values of h are in {0, ..., 9}, so you can think of h as a function N -&gt; {0, ..., 9}.\n</code></pre>\nThe resulting function h is the base-10 representation of the product of the two numbers that f and g represent.')
