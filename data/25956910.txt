I cannot stress enough how much the US lockdowns resembled nothing like what some of the countries that got the virus under control did.<p>Groceries restricted number of simultaneous customers, but I could go anytime and as many times as I wished.  Restaurants were open for takeout.  Parks were open, and capacity was not enforced.  Transit was operational.  I could get in my car and drive wherever, Uber was running, etc.  Iâ€™m fairly certain flights were running through this.
