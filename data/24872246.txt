Honestly, your comment seems remarkably ill-reformed.<p>Last 100 years? I was thinking more towards the last 2500 years or so of Chinese and Western history. Will edit my previous comment to clarify.<p>&gt; It is actually quite anomalous for a non-democracy to see these sorts of quality of life improvements.<p>Could you give some counter examples to these non-democracies that went from 0 to very powerful (in terms of geo-politics, economy and science and technology) in a matter of decades: various kingdoms before the year 0 (Syrians, Persians, Babylonians, etc), the Romans during and after Ceasar, the old world European exploring kingdoms (Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, English), old Chinese Dynasties, modern Singapore, China, USSR.<p>So what do you mean &quot;The &#x27;&quot;nice&quot; thing about a totalitarian king&#x2F;emperor&#x2F;dictator is that improvements in prosperity come quickly&#x27; has historically almost never been the case.&quot;??')
