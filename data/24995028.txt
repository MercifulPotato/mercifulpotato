I hadn&#x27;t met him yet, but the reverence the second-year students had for him was more than enough to convince the whole department to attend.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  The values and ethics he built into the ETC made it a truly amazing place, and was great to hear his story.<p>As we are on a forum for startups - I sometimes think about how Randy might have been sharing his Mission&#x2F;Vision&#x2F;Values with us, but by other names; how his personal beliefs could be imbued into his lessons and the department itself.  He did an amazing job.<p>Seriously - watch the video.  You&#x27;ll be inspired.  You&#x27;ll cry.  You&#x27;ll want to program really odd VR games just for fun :D')
