Even stats from places without a huge population of &quot;trashy people&quot; (what a disgusting thing to call people) it is still necessary to ban them because <i>they are dangerous</i>. Not all of the world have huge slums, lots of drug dealers, trailer parks, dog fighting, etc. Look at dog ownership in places like Scandinavia and you&#x27;ll see a completely different pattern - and yet the breed is deemed too dangerous, because it <i>is</i> the breed and not just the owner.')
