If this happens again with an Intel split then we have only TSMC left, off the coast of mainland China in Taiwan, in the middle of a game of thermonuclear tug of war between the West and China.<p>While Capitalism will likely be part of the solution, through subsidizes for Intel or some other form, it must take a back seat to preventing the scenario described above from becoming reality. We are on the brink of this happening already with so many people suggesting such a split and ignoring what happened to AMD and GF.<p>The geopolitical ramifications of completely centralizing the only leading process node in such a sensitive area between the world&#x27;s super powers cannot be understated.<p>Full disclosure: I&#x27;m a shareholder in Intel, TSMC, and AMD.')
