It&#x27;s sitting right there in the bloody register!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s the biggest problem I have with debuggers. Interestingly, with rr you can usually reverse-stepi a little, and get the value from a slightly earlier time, where its location was known to the debug info. A life saver, although depending on what the code does to the value, that might not help entirely. If only rr was available on all platforms... I guess TTD can help similarly on Windows.')
