SQLite is rock solid, has write ahead logs, transactions etc. You can presumably do backup at the file system layer via RAID&#x2F;ZFS&#x2F;whatever.<p>The main issue with SQLite is it&#x27;s insanely loose type checking. Column types are completely ignored, as are foreign key constraints by default. Not a good way to build a robust system. But if your schema is pretty simple and you don&#x27;t anticipate much data I don&#x27;t see a problem with using SQLite.')
