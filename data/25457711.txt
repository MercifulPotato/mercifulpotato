Unbeknownst to him, a friend-of-a-friend faked some of the thefts - I think potentially for additional compensation, but I&#x27;m not sure if that was the right motive.<p>I thought he handled it honestly and professionally - people noticed something off in the video, shared their data, he investigated, concluded what happened, edited the video to remove those thefts, and added an apology upfront.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;markrober&#x2F;status&#x2F;1075767629703372800?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;markrober&#x2F;status&#x2F;1075767629703372800?lan...</a>')
