Standard economic models also have this problem, they also have other problems, but this particular example is just doubling down and then some. What is particularly unfortunate is that there are people out there trying to create real agent based models based on actual simulations of the Economy that are far more advanced than this (realistic markets, accurate simulations of the Banking System) but are not getting any of this kind of exposure.<p>Salesforce obviously is backing its own product, but the MIT Technology Review should really know better.')
