I think Fiber is proof that that isn&#x27;t strictly true.<p>Revenue is still a solution, but you have to use it differently. People who just see all the technical problems their current ISP has assume that running an ISP is a technical problem; if you dig a little further (pun intended), it looks like an infrastructure problem, but that&#x27;s not the root of it. Google Fiber is proof that running an ISP is fundamentally a political problem: how do you work around the many many things all trying to stop or kill you? (Hypothesis for one reason why ISPs are mostly terrible: the ones that exist were not optimized for good technology or good customer service, they were optimized for surviving politics, or built by companies who already had.)<p>There was a broader spectrum of decent ISPs when modems were cutting-edge, because then you &quot;just&quot; need to run a dial-in service. There were at least some decent ISPs when DSL was cutting-edge, because in theory you can buy your service from anyone. But now that fiber is cutting-edge, there&#x27;s no solution anymore, because fiber wasn&#x27;t treated as infrastructure from day 1.<p>There&#x27;s a major reason why many &quot;technology first&quot; companies look into wireless and satellite to reach people. Not because those provide fundamentally better experiences or technologies, but because they can dodge the vast majority of local politics.<p>In an ideal world, we&#x27;d have fiber to every home as infrastructure, connected to a local meet-me room, and you could contract any ISP you like to light up that fiber, with a tiny flat fee going to cover the infrastructure. And then we&#x27;d have a spectrum of ISPs again, from budget to full-service to tech-friendly.')
