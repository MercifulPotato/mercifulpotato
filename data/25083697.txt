So i embraced that idea, and am attempting to make my fiddling concrete, repeatable, documented, etc. My tool for this is NixOS.<p>That&#x27;s a big leap, as i quickly fell into NixOS, Nix package language, Flakes (for concrete repeatable builds), and Home Manager (moving my dotfiles from Git).<p>The process took me a solid few days of confusion and frustration, but after that i&#x27;ve had a really nice experience. I can experiment with issues, like bluetooth drivers - and revert as needed, and document any forward progress.<p>I&#x27;ve reinstalled my OS once since embracing this model, due to a new hard drive, and it worked really nicely. It also pointed out any configuration i didn&#x27;t track - like my XFCE configs, since those are not (yet) tracked by my Home Manager setup.<p>Food for thought :)')
