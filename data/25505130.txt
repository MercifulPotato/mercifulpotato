I doubt many people, even erudite\npeople, could push well beyond the basic frontier of Bach, Beethoven, and\nMozart.<p>Let me see- without asking the internet, off the top of my head:<p><pre><code>  Tchaikovsy\n  Wagner\n  Verdi\n  Vivaldi\n  Brahms\n  Schubert\n  Musorgsky\n  Skalkotas\n  Soshtakovich (spelling?)\n  Satie (sp?)\n  Rostropovich (sp.?)\n  The guy who wrote Hungarian Dances?\n  The guy who wrote Per Gynt?\n  The guy who wrote the opera Amleto?\n</code></pre>\nWell I guess you&#x27;re right. That&#x27;s how many names I can conjure off the top of my\nhead after scratching it for five minutes. I would recognise another dozen names\nor two though, with a bit more scratching.<p>Edit: OK, after looking up stuff, Brahms wrote Hungarian Dances but I was\nthinking of Béla Bartók; Grieg wrote the _Peer_ Gynt suite (not Per Gynt); and\nFranco Faccio wrote Amleto. Correct spellings: Shostakovich; Satie is correct;\nand Rostropovich was a musician, but not a composer X)<p>Oh, crap- I forgot Dvorák. How could I fogret Dvorák?<p>I think the above is more evidence of my memory needing more coffee, than my\nknowledge of classical composers.<p>... but I think you&#x27;d be surprised how many classical composers people who don&#x27;t\nconsider themselves particularly erudite will know. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re right.\nI have many friends who play classical music instruments and who listen to\nclassical and love it and know the composers&#x27; names almost as well as I know the\nnames of obscure black metal bands :)')
