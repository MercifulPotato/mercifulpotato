Item(by='rezonant', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602550385, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24760139, text='All the platforms (GCP, Lambda, Azure Functions) have fairly long cold start times, but some platforms let you essentially pay for one or more cold start instances that are always on (I saw Azure had this, others are sure to follow). According to the article this &quot;undermines&quot; the model, but I disagree, as instance start time measured in the seconds is crazy difficult to achieve when doing VM automation. Typically it&#x27;ll take 5m to get a fresh VM into the load balancer during scaling, could be as low as 1-2m if you do it just right. Buying one or two instances and then having the rest of the requests billed per invocation with a fast scale up time is very appealing.')
