When I did a first aid course the instructor said something like 30-40% of people who receive CPR will have fractured ribs as you need to put <i>a lot</i> of pressure on the chest to do it properly.<p>&quot;If you haven&#x27;t heard a crack you are not pumping hard enough&quot; was the rule he went by although they are mostly talking about the sternum but if you hear&#x2F;feel a rib crack you don&#x27;t stop. You keep on pumping until a paramedic arrives if you can. A few minutes doing CPR on someone is <i>exhausting</i>. I did 5 minutes on the dummy and after I felt like I was going to pass out.<p>Thankfully I&#x27;ve never had to use it.')
