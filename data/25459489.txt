I had a lot of folks reach out to me about this change. We&#x27;ve heard y&#x27;all loud and clear that you want a better code search. The goal of this change was to balance performance and search relevance while we work on a new code search backend. The vast majority of folks shouldn&#x27;t notice a change in their search results. The folks that will are those that are using code search to count things across all the repositories in GitHub. That&#x27;s a use case that we don&#x27;t expressly support as part of code search but we know folks are doing it anyway. My goal for publishing this was to be open about the change and for those folks that are using code search for analytics not have to guess at what happened.')
