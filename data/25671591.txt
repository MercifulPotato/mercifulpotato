Of course the goal is reproducibility from a broader point of view, but that&#x27;s not an excuse to do research in a one-off way where nobody is able to show how to get those numbers again, after a year or so from publication.<p>The coding standards are often abysmally, unexpectedly terrible. Often not even the help of the original authors is enough to be able to produce the same figures from a paper because things and settings and commands get forgotten. Some part of the analysis was done in one language, another part in Excel. Some of the code has now disappeared. Some of the libraries are no longer working. Some people left and their academic storage space was wiped and therefore the intermediate steps and results or notes are deleted. You wouldn&#x27;t believe it.<p>Once a paper is published researchers are not really incentivized to document things or maintain the materials. They got the publication, they put it on their CV. On to the next project! No time to waste on work that&#x27;s already completed. New work leads to new publications, messing around with the old code for the sake of a potential later person interested in it is a waste from the point of view of a researcher, career wise. Also most papers are never attempted to be reproduced ever.')
