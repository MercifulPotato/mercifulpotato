Either that or what I was saying didn&#x27;t fit your American centric narrative.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth,<p>&quot;statistically, aboriginal people commit more crime. Studies have shown that this is because of chronic health and economic issues which have never been adequately addressed by any Australian government&quot;<p>Was pretty much the gist of what I was getting at but I thought that was pretty obvious given the context and adding the context doesn&#x27;t really make my statement any more or less factual. More credible maybe, but if you took my remarks on good faith it wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem. But that is the problem with this American narrative, everyone is too busy trying to win, nobody is trying to look at facts for what they are and find the common ground therein.<p>These facts don&#x27;t make aboriginal people any less human or any less successful as a people. They&#x27;re just shitty truths about the world.')
