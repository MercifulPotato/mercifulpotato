But let&#x27;s think in a more broader terms. For example in my house we organize good by type. Fruits go in one place, meat in another, milk and milk products in third etc. But, isn&#x27;t a context-oriented organization more reasonable? Food for breakfast goes in one place, food for dinner in another etc.?')
