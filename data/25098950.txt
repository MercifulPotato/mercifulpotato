And in particular in Congress, calling them subservient is problematic. Believe my I know about the spending they do on congress and what happens to people who run against the policy platform.<p>And for better or worse, Evangelicals are US citizens and their crazy as religion is not more crazy then other religions. If they want to vote for pro-Israel policy, however misguided, this is their right. Democracy kinda sucks sometimes. These Evangelicals are powerful force in US politics because they successfully vote as a block.<p>I would also say however that some of the dumbest polices of the US in the middle east are grown on US own heap of intellectual idiocy. The people who wrote the plan for &#x27;The Next American Century&#x27; while clearly very pro Israel, were also all former basically Ratheon lobbyist. So blame Israel, blame military-industrial complex, blame the idiot Bush who got convinced by the pathetic argument for those policies.<p>Israel for 30+ years wants the US to make war on Iran and however much their influence is, its not enough to get that done.')
