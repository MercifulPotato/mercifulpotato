I&#x27;ve found myself watching quite a bit of bike races I never used to. What I love about on screen graphics is that it makes the race consumable for viewers that aren&#x27;t hard core fans, or like me, new to the sport.<p>Looking at sports popularity in the USA, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that viewership coincides with on screen graphics. NFL goes above and beyond what &#x27;football&#x27; does, as an example.<p>A commentator will be hard to replace completely. They are scripted and fed a myriad of information, providing context to the game, the history of the player, and the significance of a move in a race or play in a game. This lowers the bar of entry for casual viewers.')
