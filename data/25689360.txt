It&#x27;s that governments (both good and bad) have pressured those companies behind closed doors to censor content governments don&#x27;t like but which they haven&#x27;t (or can&#x27;t) go to the trouble of making illegal. This creates a huge accountability gap - these are government decisions in reality but can&#x27;t be challenged in the same way they could be if out in the open.')
