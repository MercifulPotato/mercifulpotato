Being able to send push notifications requires a browser-level popup dialog that the user explicitly has to opt into, for each individual website. There&#x27;s no drive-by API that lets you spam random website visitors with push notifications.<p>I don&#x27;t see how you could &quot;make a website that abuses them just to make [your] point.&quot; No one would bother enabling notifications for your abusive website, and even if you managed to convince them to do it, they&#x27;d just turn them off for your abusive website as soon as you started spamming them.')
