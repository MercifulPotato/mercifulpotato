The conspiracy theory is not that Trump is taking on the deep state; it&#x27;s the existence of the deep state to begin with.<p>&gt;If deep state&#x2F;swamp&#x2F;etc is interpreted as a vague reference to the Washington&#x2F;New York professional classes who populate government in huge numbers and tend to share very similar worldviews and beliefs<p>Speaking of grotesque distortions of the truth, that is not what the &quot;deep state&quot; has ever referred to. It&#x27;s always been, by definition, a conspiracy theory. It generally posits that the country is actually run by a group o unelected individuals in secret that orchestrate events in this country up to and including the selection of presidents.')
