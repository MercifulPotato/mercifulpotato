I think that terminology is right.<p>So yeah, repointing the kubelet to containerd directly works fine, but it won&#x27;t be the same thing as running docker containers.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;containerd&#x2F;containerd&#x2F;blob&#x2F;9561d938&#x2F;docs&#x2F;namespaces.md#how-does-multi-tenancy-work" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;containerd&#x2F;containerd&#x2F;blob&#x2F;9561d938&#x2F;docs&#x2F;...</a>')
