Two small children and a wife, not making a lot of money, and being a fairly average developer, working at a shitty company that heavily exploited their devs and relied on people not knowing they could just leave.<p>He eventually talked to a recruiter and told that recruiter about his situation and shyly asked whether he had anything for a developer of his skills. The recruiter reassured him, told him he&#x27;d find something for him and sent him home. The next day, he called my friend and asked him when he had time for an interview as he had two companies that were interested to meet him. They agreed and about a week later, he had signed a new contract and quit his old job, with a pay raise and a much nicer team.<p>My friend never wrote about it online. I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s plenty of similar stories, but you won&#x27;t hear about them, you&#x27;ll only hear about the negative ones.')
