(I pressed the brake, the car didn&#x27;t stop)<p>But there is no excuse for artificially injecting avoidable breakage by having things <i>decide</i> not to work, on top of the unavoidable honest breakage.<p>It is ultimately, and fundamentally, wrong to try to predict all valid actions ahead of time and provide some sort of managed answer for all the actions you though of and decided are the universe of valid actions.')
