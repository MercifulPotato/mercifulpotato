Force Apple to allow installing a non-Safari browser; you&#x27;re still running iOS, you&#x27;re still using Broadcom chips, you&#x27;re still indirectly supporting the CCP, etc. But good for Apple because these token changes keep people from leaving their product altogether.<p>The sad irony is that these actions will further entrench established firms by diminishing&#x2F;obviating competitive advantages of would-be competitors, and&#x2F;or yield worse outcomes for consumers. This has been the case throughout the entire history of &quot;anti-trust&quot; law.<p>Aside: Competing is not &quot;anti-competitive&quot;. A &quot;competitive market&quot; is not determined by counting extant competitors, but by whether or not would-be competitors are interfered with by third-parties.')
