Or at least not as serious and gritty. I kind of agreed for awhile, but I&#x27;m actually rewatching both and appreciate the different styles more. One thing that strikes me is the acting - The Sopranos is filled with amazing performances, particularly the dynamic between Edie Falco and James Gandolfini. I <i>hate</i> Tony Soprano and really dislike Carmella, but I&#x27;m so conflicted about both.')
