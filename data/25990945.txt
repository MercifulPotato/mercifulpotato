If you read what the ultimate intent of the &#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets crowd is, they&#x27;re not just trying to exercise the same right to make money off of the financial system that billionaires have.<p>A year ago, the person that started this detected a situation where GME was a company that didn&#x27;t have long term prospects, wasn&#x27;t losing money, but was still shorted to 140% of it&#x27;s value.  It&#x27;s not supposed to be possible to go over 100% any more since 2008, by the way.<p>Because of the shorting, he deduced that hedge funds and other influential people in the financial system were planning to encourage GME to go bankrupt, thus getting their short shares forgiven, because a bankrupt company is written off as a loss by the actual share owner.<p>So the hedge funds&#x27; plan was to short shares at some price as much as they could get away with, then make the shares worthless by encouraging bankruptcy.  Since the shares would then be written off, they would pocket all the money they took from selling the shares they borrowed to short.  Nice racket.<p>What WSB did is make the price go in the opposite direction, which is important for a lot of reasons, but one huge one is that the risk of shorting is proportional to the reward.  If the price of a shorted stock goes up, then the borrower (person doing the short) still has to return it to the owner.  No matter how high the price goes.<p>So they realized if they drive the price WAY up, then the people who were doing the 140% shorts on a company they planned to drive out of business would get screwed by their own system.<p>Some of the folks on WSB are making money and lots of it, but many of them just want to see the whole unfair system burn.  By exploiting this weakness, they&#x27;re trying to force the government to reform the whole finance industry.')
