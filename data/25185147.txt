Within certain parameters it doesn&#x27;t matter which specific RNA sequence you produce, it always works the same way and you can use the same facilities for this. There are potential cost advantages there, if you can use a generic, validated process to produce different types of vaccines or drugs without having to develop, tune and certify the core production from scratch every time.<p>I don&#x27;t know the economics here, but I would assume that cost advantages are much more likely to appear for small-scale products here than what we have now, producing a billion doses in large factories.')
