Want to reset your password? It&#x27;s often by email.<p>Storing passwords in the same account creates a single point of failure. If I get into your Gmail account I have total control of everything.<p>Third party stores separate passwords from logins, including for the email account itself.<p>Now I cannot get complete control of all your accounts just via your gmail&#x2F;logins account. At best I can control them for a short period of time. Which means I maybe get your Skype account for a day or so.<p>It&#x27;s all about making it harder for an attacker to get something valuable. The harder you make it the less likely they are to succeed.<p>Because the login accounts and passwords are separated an attacker has to do more work basically.<p>Addendum: the single point of failure actually becomes the third party password store. Which is good in some respects and bad in others.<p>Addendum 2: also, iirc, Google stuff doesn&#x27;t ask if you <i>want to create a password</i> for the account, only if you want to store it. Which encourages password reuse.<p>Password managers often have the ability to generate a random password up to the maximum allowed length, meaning no account passwords are ever the the same and are harder to crack.<p>Furthermore some of them can automatically update your passwords for you if they&#x27;ve become stale.<p>So all I have to do is remember (and regularly change) my one super strong pass phrase for the password manager.')
