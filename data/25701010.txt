You say that as if scipy is producing <i>any</i> warning messages? There&#x27;s an absolutely <i>colossal</i> difference between failing with a poor error description and producing a <i>completely wrong answer</i> with 100% confidence.<p>&gt; but you&#x27;re demanding a solution that doesn&#x27;t really exist<p>Doesn&#x27;t exist?! Have you even tried the other algorithms on there before writing this? Broyden1, anderson, etc. handle this just fine. Even the default hybrid algorithm itself would handle this just fine if they even cared to run <i>that very algorithm</i> a couple more times to get convergence. Is there an algorithm that solves every equation in the world? No. Does it need to? No. Does it need to be able to handle the most basic cases? Yeah.')
