Ford is a survivor head and shoulders above the turbulent waters.<p>Some established coach makers prospered with the arrival of the automotive age (simply supplying the faster buggys the motor companies needed for their mechanical horsepower) while things like highly innovative EV&#x27;s never got past the prototype stage or off the drawing board.<p>Ford succeeded in creating a new mass market for his particular invention, which only allowed participation by others having products of great similarity, but could not keep them out within IP limitations.<p>He had a low cost advantage that lasted years also.<p>A very bold vision to insure worthwhile copies of his invention were available, and if popularized, many copies, each adding value to raw materials beyond the financial gains attainable.<p>Him and Edison seem to have a lot in common and enjoyed spending some time together real well.<p>He must have gotten a hold of more resources to work with compared to your average used horse salesman too.')
