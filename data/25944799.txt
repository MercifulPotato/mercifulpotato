Ethereum had just launched. There was a sense of everything being in beta.<p>2. The Ethereum stakeholder set was very small, so obtaining consensus for such a controversial hard fork was much easier to accomplish than it would be today.<p>3. The economy on Ethereum was very small, so<p>a) a hard fork was far less disruptive than it would be today.<p>b) an undermining of Ethereum&#x27;s commitment to neutrality&#x2F;immutability jeapardized far fewer decentralized application projects than it would today.<p>4. Smart contracts were completely new, so there was a sense that people could be forgiven for their mistakes.<p>5. The Ethereum Foundation had promoted the idea of a DAO on their website, and several Ethereum founders had promoted the specific DAO that ended up being hacked. These facts made the DAO appear to be more than a completely third party app.<p>Ethereum is very different today than it was in 2016, and a DAO-like mishap would never lead to a hard fork again.')
