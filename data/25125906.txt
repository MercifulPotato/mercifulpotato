Similarly, you can beat the M1&#x27;s GPU with high-end Nvidia or Radeon desktop cards—but only at a massive disparity in power, physical size, and heat.<p>...So, given that, and <i>assuming</i> that Apple will <i>attempt</i> to compete with them, I think it likely that they will, at the very least, be able to match them on even footing, when freed from the constraints of size, heat, and power that are relevant to notebook chips.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;hands-on-with-the-apple-m1-a-seriously-fast-x86-competitor&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;hands-on-with-the-ap...</a>')
