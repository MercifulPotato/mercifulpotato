You can’t do that by a long distance, though. The goal is 8 yards wide, so if you move a yard from the center, one goal post is 5 yards away. That leaves too large an opening.<p>Luckily, you don’t have to do it by a large distance. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repository.lboro.ac.uk&#x2F;articles&#x2F;Imperceptibly_off-center_goalkeepers_influence_penalty-kick_direction_in_soccer&#x2F;9617456" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repository.lboro.ac.uk&#x2F;articles&#x2F;Imperceptibly_off-ce...</a>:<p><i>“We asked whether a goalkeeper can, by standing marginally left or right of goal center, bias a penalty taker implicitly to kick to the side with greater area, thus allowing the goalkeeper to dive in that direction to make a save. We show that the penalty taker is unlikely to be mindful that the goalkeeper is off center, but nevertheless can identify the side with greater area and will be more likely to direct the penalty kick to that side than to the other side.”</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal.pone.0135423" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal...</a>:<p><i>“implicit influences of the goalkeeper’s position on goal side selection were overridden by the (conscious) perception of the direction of the goalkeeper’s dive, but only if the penalty takers deliberately monitored the goalkeeper’s action and the goalkeeper committed early enough for penalty takers to respond. In all other combinations of penalty kick and goalkeeper strategies more than 60% of the kicks were directed to the side of the goal with more space”</i>')
