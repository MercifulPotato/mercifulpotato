Item(by='patrec', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606412928, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25221040, text='C++ completely dominates games, browsers (and a few things you don&#x27;t list, such as competitive programming). It is certainly not marginal in the other areas you list either, but were do you get the weird idea that <i>most</i> operating systems  and drivers are written in C++ (let alone most compilers, servers or &quot;major applications&quot;)? Unix has completely won the OS market (what percentage of OS installs these days are unix derivatives? 99%+?) and I can&#x27;t think of a single one that is predominantly or at all written in C++. Apart from lacking a browser, I&#x27;d be surprised if you couldn&#x27;t run a fully functional linux desktop after deleting every single C++ application and library on your system.')
