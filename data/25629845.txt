If it&#x27;s &quot;free market&quot; that gave them those stupidly high salaries, it&#x27;s &quot;free market&quot; that will take it away.<p>Developers from the whole world that get paid 1&#x2F;10th(or less) of those SV engineers that the only differentiation factor they have is an American citizenship would happily take their jobs.<p>I like this situation because it won&#x27;t take long until all software work is moved elsewhere outside America. I doubt companies will accept that kind of shit from employees, because if they do, they will lose money. And if they don&#x27;t, employees are spoiled, they think that those high salaries are a right, will make a big case of it and caos.')
