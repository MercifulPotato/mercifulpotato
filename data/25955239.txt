At the end of that time, you check the state of the watered tree: Is the soil moist enough, is the tree well, are the leaves green, etc. (Obviously this is just an example as this test would be complex in real life, but it is to get the idea across).<p>2) Interaction: We place a flow meter, a device that registers how much water is flowing through the device and at what times. At the end of the day, check that the device has been called the correct number of times, with the correct amount of water each time, and we don&#x27;t worry about checking the status of the tree.')
