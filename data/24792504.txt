There&#x27;s a wide spectrum of hearing disabilities that need different solutions.<p>What you&#x27;ll read below comes from second-hand experience because my dad lost his hearing in one ear after an operation.<p>Hearing aids aren&#x27;t that expensive because of the hardware. In fact they&#x27;re quite cheap to produce and because how fragile their camouflage design makes them they tend to break all the time and generally get replaced for free for life. Everything else is what makes them expensive.<p>Consider a hearing disability like my dad has. Complete loss of hearing in one ear after the surgical removal of a tumor on his hearing nerve (acoustic neuroma, luckily no other complications besides this expected outcome - it being pretty much brain surgery), and his other ear isn&#x27;t too great either.<p>He spent a lot of time trying out various hearing aids for one week each while an expert guided him through the process and configured each to his needs. Because he has trouble hearing sounds that come from his deaf side he wants those transmitted to his other ear.<p>There is some audio processing tricks that can be applied here which will make it easier for you to gauge which side the sounds are coming from, filter out noise, amplify the voice of people you&#x27;re facing etc.<p>The whole process of adjustments to the hearing aids and trying out different ones took 2-3 months of sometimes bi-weekly trips to the specialist.<p>Nowadays when a hearing aid breaks (happens from time to time, they&#x27;re not very sturdy) he can go back to the specialist and walk out with a replacement already configured for him.<p>This is what you&#x27;re paying for with the 0k-10k euro price tag (your insurance should cover the first x000 euros). The whole support experience around the hearing aids, not the aids themselves.<p>Can&#x27;t really get that with AirPods or whatever.')
