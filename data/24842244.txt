Item(by='mLuby', descendants=None, kids=[24844078], score=None, time=1603227021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24838383, text='&gt; People who can contribute but choose not to are pretty quickly pushed out.<p>&quot;Pushed out&quot; meaning what exactly? Shamed? Debtors&#x27; prison? Homeless? No medical care? Left to starve? Euthanized? Plenty of options, none befitting a decent society.<p>Also, fairness (which literally everyone supports) depends greatly on framing:<p>1. Alice pays taxes, Bob doesn&#x27;t, Bob gets free stuff from the government, so Alice is paying for Bob&#x27;s selfish laziness.<p>2. Alice and Bob both pay 30% of their income in taxes. The government guarantees all its citizens a decent standard of living, and so gives Bob, who falls below some threshold, assistance.<p>3. Alice is physically and mentally healthy, so she compounds her advantages and resources. A portion of her financial gains go to the government as taxes. Bob isn&#x27;t so lucky, struggles with physical or mental illness, experiences personal or family tragedies, etc. He struggles to stay financially afloat, and can&#x27;t consistently accumulate a safety net to weather multiple bad outcomes. He turns to the government for help sometimes.<p>It comes down to whether you&#x27;d rather punish the guilty and innocent alike or would rather help the downtrodden and seemingly slothful alike. I choose to be kind, but I get that it&#x27;s hard to act that way if you feel threatened.')
