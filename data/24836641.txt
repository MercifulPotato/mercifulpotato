Moms in Switzerland also have difficulties to return to work, although I cant find statistics now. Where I live, programmers earn almost double average salary, so I am pretty sure that it would be possible for their wifes to stay at home if they wished financially.<p>Childcare price is issue too and sometimes pushes opposite way.

There are also practical aspects of &quot;is it expected of me&quot;, &quot;is it possible to manage school, activities and work&quot; and &quot;do I want to stay at home&quot;.')
