At the moment I&#x27;m only focusing on soccer because that&#x27;s what I know best : ) However, I can easily see this being extended to other team sports.<p>The main bottleneck is obtaining data around the teams that a player played for. Right now I&#x27;m depending on wikipedia because the soccer data is very rich and easy to parse. I&#x27;m not sure this is the case for other sports. The data could always be crowdsourced if there aren&#x27;t any good data sources for other sports.')
