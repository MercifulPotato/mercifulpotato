So what? The algorithm still achieves its purpose. You are still focused on cards you are least likely to have permanently learned. No matter how you use or abuse space repetition algorithms they ensure your study time is well spent (assuming flashcards are the right thing to be studying at all).<p>I learned this from experience. I have some math concepts I&#x27;d like to have memorized. I made some flashcards in a space repetition program. I haven&#x27;t review them for about 6 months. It is what it is -- at least I know all my progress wont be gone when I finally do return to those flashcards. I will have forgotten some cards, those cards will be shown to me frequently. I will have remembered some cards, those cards will get a boost because I&#x27;ve remembered them for 6-months without review, and will rarely be shown to me. The spaced repetition algorithms still work; they are robust.')
