If you don&#x27;t prioritise safety early then you run a high risk of discovering when you try to retrofit safety later that you need to rule out a lot of existing code. Even if you haven&#x27;t promised stability, breaking existing code hurts the ecosystem.<p>Therefore when setting priorities for language evolution it seems better to identify work that is less likely to result in breaking code, and prioritise safety over that.')
