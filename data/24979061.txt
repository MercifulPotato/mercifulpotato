Imagine a toy town where only two goods are produced on opposite sides of a river. To trade them, risky river crossings risking product and person must be attempted.<p>A bridge removes that risk and cost. The town will become wealthier for having the bridge despite its cost. (Same for <i>e.g.</i> ancient Mesopotamian, Mesoamerican and Hohokam canals.)<p>&gt; <i>the government makes some money</i><p>If the government prints money to fund its deficit then inflation “taxes” everyone. It is analogous to a company selling stock to do something useful. The share count went up but the aggregate value (hopefully) will too.')
