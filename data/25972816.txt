Unless it lives directly on the fabric of space or something like that, matter is discrete in the universe. You settle on planets that are not everywhere, or in space stations built with Oort cloud or asteroid belts materials, but it takes time to settle and expand in each new ground you get. You are not talking about the speed of light anymore there.<p>Of course, here I&#x27;m trying to think like an alien civilization that is far ahead from us in technology and scientific knowledge, besides having an alien way of thinking, but the same goes for the article.<p>In any case, if that is like any disaster spreading through the universe at the speed of light (big rip?) not only we won&#x27;t have time to notice, we won&#x27;t be able to feel the effects neither.')
