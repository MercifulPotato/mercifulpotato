If we could understand human thought at a similar level, we MIGHT find out that &quot;the feeling of red&quot; is not fundamentally different than &quot;the understanding that 1 + 1 = 2&quot;, and we could come up with quantifications of it in different ways, from the physical representation in the brain to a certain &quot;bit pattern&quot; in the abstract model of the human brain computer.<p>Note that the argument for qualia is not one that proves the existence of qualia - it is essentially only a definition. We have no reason to believe that the thing which the term qualia describes actually exists in the world, beyond our own personal experience, which is circular in a way. The argument goes &quot;I feel like this thing I&#x27;m experiencing is a qualia, therefore I assume that things similar to me also have qualia&quot;, which sounds logical enough. But then, &quot;things similar to me&quot; is actually defined in such a way that it basically assumes qualia exist, since an AGI whose internal state we could probe precisely enough to prove that qualia do not exist for it is then assumed to be outside of &quot;things similar to me&quot;.')
