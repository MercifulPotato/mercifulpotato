I never do any non-trivial tech project without learning some lessons about how I would do it differently next time. So we go out and see what&#x27;s on a particular asteroid, but we also see things about the task. The next time, we try a modified approach and go see what&#x27;s on a different asteroid. We build out our knowledge of what resources are already out there, and where, while building out our knowledge of how to get out there, do things, and get back.<p>And when you get both A and B, the relative value of A vs B may be as claimed, but what really matters in the cost&#x2F;benefit analysis is the value of A+B.<p>And even the value of the science is an interesting question, because science that finds what we &quot;already know&quot; has some value, but not much, but science that finds what we never expected changes history. And in our estimates of scientific value, we never expect to find what we never expected.')
