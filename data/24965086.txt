My goodness, paired with a fast lens, what a difference to my MacBook webcam, even with these ml blurred backgrounds!<p>It&#x27;s only 720p and around 15fps but real shallow dof, very little sensor noise, autofocus works. Well worth trying if you have a Sony camera from the last few years.<p>Sensor size and good optics still wins. Having said that,the effort and detail gone into this feature is very impressive, enjoyed the blog post. Also webassembly SIMD looks super cool, looking forward to a new class of webapps using wasm.')
