For example, you need a republican and a democrat to co-host a show. Does the republican need to be pro trump? Does the democrat need to be anti trump? Do you think a Liz Cheney and AOC hosted show would be politically neutral? You seem to have this idea of what a &quot;textbook&quot; conservative&#x2F;liberal is, and I think that sort of binary representation is harmful to political discourse at large. You&#x27;ll find democrats care more about government spending than some republicans. You&#x27;ll find anti gun republicans, and pro gun democrats. Who represents each side? How do you make sure all viewpoints are represented (green and libertarian)?<p>This is the curse of dimensionality: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Curse_of_dimensionality" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Curse_of_dimensionality</a>. the more complex the subject the less likely it is for someone to actually be able to represent the &quot;Average&quot; of everything.')
