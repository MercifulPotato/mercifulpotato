Designers optimize for distinctiveness (&quot;branding&quot;) and good first impressions from inexperienced users. This results in anti-features like low contrast text, excessive whitespace, and mandatory animations. There&#x27;s no point complaining because it&#x27;s working as intended. The only option is to switch to one of the few remaining systems that still respects the users.')
