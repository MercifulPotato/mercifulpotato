The 1800 US Presidential campaign was very slanderous and personal [1]. <i>His Girl Friday</i> (1940)[2] starring Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant is a great comedy about journalism and the all the shady things that go on. Reading through all those events, the tricks are the same ones that we humans fall for time and again. Sure, FAANG and the like have made it faster, more up-tempo. But the lies have always gotten half-way around the globe before the truth put it&#x27;s pants on.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Yellow_journalism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Yellow_journalism</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1800_United_States_presidential_election#Campaign" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1800_United_States_presidentia...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt0032599&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt0032599&#x2F;</a> (No really, it&#x27;s great!
