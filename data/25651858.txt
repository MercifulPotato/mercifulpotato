The sanctions on Iran may well contribute to that goal. However, from the point of view of what&#x27;s good for mankind generally I&#x27;m not sure it wouldn&#x27;t be a good thing for Iran to have nuclear weapons. It would discourage other countries from attacking Iran and it would also give other countries an incentive not to destabilise Iran. There would, of course, be some obvious disadvantages - so it&#x27;s not an easy (hypothetical) decision - but Iran would probably be a safer and better custodian of nuclear weapons than at least one other country that already has them so I certainly don&#x27;t think it would be a terribly bad thing for Iran to join the club.')
