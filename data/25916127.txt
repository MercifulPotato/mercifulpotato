These expect `make`, the compiler, and needed libraries are installed, and some other generic unix tools, but do not expect users to have any GNU specific software installed. (Like the autotools).<p>The source repositories typically do not have these already generated (since checking in generated files is frequently frowned upon), and building them often require getting the right version of autoconf&#x2F;automake&#x2F;etc installed, as a different version may not be fully compatible.')
