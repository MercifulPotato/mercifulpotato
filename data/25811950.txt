Yes some printers have usb and maybe I should spend a day or figuring out ocotoprint but I usually just use my SD card and get on with printing.  My lap has a MacBook Pro 2015.  It’s both sturdy and has all the nice features plenty of usb-b ports and sd card slot...  newer PCBs are finally shipping with usb c support but I don’t see things like the teensy having usb c anytime soon...')
