One usually knows the serious risks of developing PTSD from being a soldier before entering. We do the same for Police Officers, and it&#x27;s for these reasons that cops end up so well paid in many places.<p>The medical field is similar. We pay them more as a way to compensate them for the utility they bring to the world despite the risks associated with their job.<p>If I am lacking in empathy, than so is the rest of the world, and my particular instance of this &quot;lack of empathy&quot; is tiny compared to others.<p>If anything, we should celebrate that market forces are giving mistreated nurses a way out. I think that if anything, we should be <i>very happy</i> that market forces are giving disgruntled nurses a way to stick the finger to their shitty hospital management (&quot;Oh, you won&#x27;t let me have new PPE? Fu*k you I quit and I&#x27;m taking a job that pays 10x as much...&quot;)')
