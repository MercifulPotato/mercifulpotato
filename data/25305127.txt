If  it&#x27;s the first time production is down and I&#x27;m already off, I fix the issue. Once it&#x27;s fixed I&#x27;ll tell my manager: &quot;we need on-call people. Please don&#x27;t consider me for that position because I value more my free-time than money. Thanks&quot;. The second time production is down, I won&#x27;t fix it.<p>If they fire me because I don&#x27;t do on-call, then again it depends. I would revisit my contract and if it doesn&#x27;t say anything about being on-call I would point that out. In any case, I would start to look for a new job asap.')
