It was always my speculation that the risky gambit of fast forwarding China&#x27;s development and economy and freely transfering crown jewels of technology was made with the conviction that the process of integrating with the West would naturally create a power base in Chinese society that would push aside the Communist Party. Tiananmen (&quot;June Fourth Incident&quot;) was a manifestation of this <i>correct</i> original prognosis of the planners of the deal, that it would cause political headaches for the CCP. A cultural instead of a kinetic overcoming by the West.<p>I think the consensus now in the West is that CCP armed with AI, pervasive networking, and the emergence of a digital society in the true sense, can stifle <i>any</i> possible organic formation of alternative poles of power in Chinese society. The only remining challenge to CCP were the Tech Mandarins (like the Senior Self Crowned Bozo in the West, a certain Bill Gates) and just this week Jack Ma was reminded as to who is in charge in New China.<p>And of course, Eric Schmidt et al. are now salivating at the &quot;Chinese Model&quot; and we&#x27;re gonna get the same, regardless of what little you and little me thinks about it.<p>&#x2F;end speculation')
