Item(by='tracer4201', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603602686, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24883326, text='&gt; Several Arab trade groups have announced their boycott of French products in response to incitements against the Islamic religion and insulting statements against Prophet Muhammad.<p>My husband&#x27;s family comes from a Muslim background. In their homeland country, there was recent rainfall that resulted in widespread flooding in a major city of 12 million+ people. Essentially the city doesn&#x27;t have functional sewage systems. The majority of people don&#x27;t have running water in their homes from an actual grid. They have to pay someone to come and provide them water that they fill up in local storage tanks. Supposedly there&#x27;s a water mafia that takes in billions in US dollars.<p>Despite all that, in recent weeks they saw Sunni Muslims led protests with people chanting death to Shiite Muslims – despite the fact that the Sunni population controls the vast majority of the &quot;private&quot; and city, provincial, and state governments.<p>Presumably, education is the solution, but I honestly don&#x27;t know.<p>Going back to the topic at hand – these Arab groups (and other Muslims groups) spend a mind boggling amount of time obsessed with depictions of the prophet. You can literally murder people in the streets in the city I&#x27;m referring to and there&#x27;s no accountability. But the moment you draw a picture of the Prophet, people in this city will riot and burn down their own businesses and shut down their stock exchange.')
