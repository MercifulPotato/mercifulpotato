To whom is money being redistributed? It&#x27;s punishment for holding dollars instead of investing them.<p>&gt; It would not be equivalent since with BTC you can&#x27;t just take away value of your share without making you explicitly pay, it removes invisible tax.<p>You&#x27;re not supposed to save currency, you&#x27;re supposed to use currency to buy assets, even if those assets are magic beans that live in your computer. That&#x27;s why we have inflation, because money only has value when it moves.')
