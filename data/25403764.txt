That takes a bit.<p>The actual file transfer is comparable to the GPU doing a memcpy. (You could also use pinned host memory if the GPU program is just doing a one-off read.)<p>GPU processing for simple operations really shines if your data is already on the GPU and your code is hot. Otherwise, it&#x27;s more useful if the process is significantly complex enough to make the overhead of a cold startup insignificant.')
