SQL simplified A LOT of underlying details. There are dozens of types of indexes. There&#x27;s partitioning and sharding. There&#x27;s online backups. There are transactions - local and distributed ones. There&#x27;s savepoints and rollbacks.<p>If SQL databases were like GIT - selects with joins using different indexes would have different syntax because &quot;you need to understand the underlying structure&quot; :)')
