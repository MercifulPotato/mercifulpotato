To get a boat legal to sell, you need to perform a relevant declaration,  reference to the correct EU regulations and their localised translation into law, pay someone qualified to prepare the paperwork and translate the regulations ... a nightmare of paperwork and very expensive.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting any bad-faith legistlation in the Recreational Craft Directive, I fully support very progressive environmental regulations, and not drawing the parallel too too closely...<p>But if you did want to curtail people&#x27;s freedoms through regulation paperwork, there are <i>all</i> kinds of places you could hide a gotcha.<p>Off the top of my head:<p>- How about the energy efficiency of the whole power train?<p>- Approved lubricants.<p>- Annual energy efficiency certification of the whole  vehicle from an approved organisation.')
