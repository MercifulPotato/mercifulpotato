I do more in 20 hours than I did in a whole work week. And I don&#x27;t have to drive. I only need one car. The savings and improved convenience is just ludicrous.<p>My one and only must-repeat tip: spend money on a proper office space. If you can, have a dedicated room. And prepare to spent a few thousand on a proper desk and chair.<p>Okay I lied, two pieces of advice: the point of a dedicated space is that you can walk away from it and not go back in until the next day or Monday. That&#x27;s absolutely critical to success.')
