For instance, under GDPR rules, most restrictions relate to &quot;personally identifiable information&quot;, which is defined as not only data which specifically identifies an individual, but any data which <i>can be used</i> to identify an individual.  So for instance if you collect detailed information about usage patterns which includes country of origin, and you have exactly one user in Sudan, data privacy rules would apply because you would know exactly which user the data is referring to.<p>I actually wonder how this product would have passed GDPR at all.')
