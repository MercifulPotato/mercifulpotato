My buddy knew enough to tell me that it was Basic and my computer came with QBasic.<p>I didn&#x27;t have anyone else to ask, didn&#x27;t know about any computer clubs (and didn&#x27;t think to ask). So I got very familiar with the built-in help. Spent hours looking through the help until I found the one I needed.<p>Didn&#x27;t help that I started learning English only a year before, so had no idea what most of the help said anyway. I vividly recall spending a week figuring out how to loop indefinitely. Finally I got to &quot;while&quot;. Was so pleased when it worked.<p>A bit later my buddy got a modem, and with that BBS access, so he downloaded snippets for me and programming articles, and things accelerated.<p>On the bright side, finding and reading documentation is now one of my strong points. Hanging on IRC I could usually help others within minutes with libraries I&#x27;d never even heard of, simply by diving into the documentation for a bit.')
