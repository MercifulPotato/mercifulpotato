Talks about privacy and then uses the least privacy-respecting carrier: AT&amp;T? Ok cool, so the customer bill says Librem... when this gets piped to the NSA with the location data, I&#x27;m sure they can&#x27;t handle putting a name to it. When it gets sold to location brokers with current location information, I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t have the unique phone number tied to it. Might as well wave and put a target on your head saying &quot;please de-anonymize me&quot;.<p>No clear definition of where deprioritization limits kick in or how it is to be enforced. Who cares though! The Librem 5 ships with a cat3 LTE modem. That is only <i>just</i> LTE on a single carrier, no LTE Advanced, no carrier aggregation. Forget talking about 5G, we don&#x27;t even have a modem that supports full 4G operating speeds. Stop hyping something you aren&#x27;t close to.<p>Now I get it, I&#x27;m sounding very harsh but understand that this is a company that&#x27;s selling a packaged virtue signal (sorta like Virtu used to) and is consistently over-promising and under-delivering. Making phones is hard, making them in the US is next to impossible. I&#x27;d rather have a piece of working&#x2F;shipping Chinesium (Pinephone) for a fifth of the price and use a sim card paid in cash from a prepaid carrier that I can load whatever to it and isn&#x27;t going to be gone in a year, if I cared to attempt anonymity.')
