I&#x27;m pretty confident that most of the services he is complaining about will last longer than his own blog post.<p>I can&#x27;t say I share your confidence.<p>Take Google Groups as an example.<p>Were it not for archival work being done by various volunteers, the content on Usenet was at real threat of vanishing from the internet.<p>This is hardly unique.

I don&#x27;t think so.<p>But it <i>is</i> a reason to retain your own copies of the things you care about, hence why, for my own blog, I follow the POSSE (Publish Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) pattern:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indieweb.org&#x2F;POSSE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indieweb.org&#x2F;POSSE</a>')
