Item(by='jml7c5', descendants=None, kids=[24893733], score=None, time=1603688716, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24892328, text='I feel like that warning symbol isn&#x27;t great. When you first look at it, you try to draw meaningful connections between the three items: radiation&lt;-&gt;skull, skull&lt;-&gt;person-running, radiation&lt;-&gt;person-running, but what was intended was (radiation-&gt;skull)-&gt;leave immediately. A sign split in two, with (radiation-&gt;skull) on one half and a person running on the other might be clearer.<p>If anyone is wondering, I prefer blue paint on bike sheds.')
