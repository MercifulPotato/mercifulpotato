East Germany could stop people crossing the border to West Germany (at least, those who weren&#x27;t willing to take the risk of being shot at). They couldn&#x27;t stop West German radio stations being broadcast back across the border.<p>Information control isn&#x27;t anything like border control, because information is permeable to your physical border. You can shoot-to-kill people crossing your borders, but good luck doing that with electromagnetic radiation.<p>At best you can jam it or attempt to control the flow domestically (by, for example, banning radios), but in both cases it&#x27;s easily circumvented.')
