A law like that would never pass in a functioning democracy, and if our democracy isn&#x27;t functioning, then I would say we have bigger problems than a single person be taxed of all their earnings.<p>Your second point would matter if making income is that was how people became billionaires. That simply isn&#x27;t the case. The vast, vast, majority of people with a 9-digit or more net wealth did not get there by income.<p>I also advocate for other taxes and methods of taxation that would handle high net-worth individuals&#x2F;families.<p>I&#x27;m not looking for a perfect system, nor am I looking for a system that appeases everyone&#x27;s idea of fairness, I&#x27;m advocating the system that I think is best for America moving through the 21st century and the threats it will face this century.')
