EMP protection is standard for military systems. The military already deals with the logistics problems related to batteries and fuel. The preferred energy choice might not be a battery.<p>Consistent usage of dumb tactics is unlikely. The robots aren&#x27;t going to just run across a huge open field, straight toward the enemy, with plenty of warning to set up a defensive 50-cal gun. They could leap through a window or low-quality wall, in complete darkness, while the target is sleeping.<p>Enjoy your nightmare. :-)')
