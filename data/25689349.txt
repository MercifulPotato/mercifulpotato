MSM (CNN, CNBC, MSNBC) is 10% as biased (to the left), Fox (probably 50% biased to the right), etc. Least biased is probably Reuters, AP, and PBS, and maybe NPR.<p>Local news is usually not so biased either.<p>But Washington Times, Breitbart, Random Youtube Vlogger, etc...none of those can be trusted. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re never linked to on Hackernews, except maybe in comments, I&#x27;d imagine.<p>They&#x27;re basically tabloids. Good to cross-reference with Snopes or Politifact if you are curious what&#x27;s true. Personally, I like to read multiple sources and google a topic to get a better picture to see other &#x27;takes&#x27;. Only way to not get bubble&#x2F;group think.')
