The story is that many civil engineers, while taking undergrad classes, had to look at, hold, and pass around a piece of the Tacoma Narrows bridge that had failed and collapsed. There is a story that some Boeing engineers kept on their desk a part from a plane that suffered structural failure (and cost the lives of dozens of people) to remind them of the stakes involved if they weren&#x27;t sufficiently disciplined in their job.<p>In the realm of software engineering I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;ve had a catastrophic failure where the infrastructure costs of repair were in the billions or there was tangible loss of life.  The biggest example that comes to mind was the explosion of the Ariane rocket because the software caused the rocket to rotate in the wrong direction so the ground-controllers executed a self-destruct... maybe pieces of a Tesla that crashed while on auto-pilot would be a candidate for physical objects we can hold in our hands to remind us that software bugs can kill?')
