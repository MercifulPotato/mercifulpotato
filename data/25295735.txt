Item(by='Zancarius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607032598, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25294643, text='&gt; when a flawlessly running driver degrades after an update (cough, intel e1000e, cough), it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.<p>Hah! I see I&#x27;m not alone. For me it was the iwlwifi drivers. In one kernel revision, they worked fine; in another, they&#x27;d randomly panic and bring down the interface. Downgrading the firmware packages didn&#x27;t do anything. Kernel upgrades have worked as of late.<p>Though, it may be hardware-related in my case. I&#x27;ve had nothing but trouble with that particular card. I was going to replace it, but it seems that Lenovo <i>really</i> likes Loctite on their M.2 screws and it won&#x27;t budge.
