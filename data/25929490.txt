HTML defines semantic structure of UI - DOM tree.<p>2. JS, as language-behind-the-UI, handles users events and updates DOM tree and its state.<p>3. CSS defines how that DOM tree is presented to the user in its current state.<p>These three tasks are so distinct that require their own languages that are optimal for the task.<p>That split has a lot of sense. For example, HTML and abstract DOM tree alone enables accessible access (a.k.a. Section 508). And so on.<p>There were, are and will be all-in-one approaches to UI, like Flutter or WPF for example. They will never be universal UI solutions for reasons outlined above, especially on desktop UI.')
