Authoritarian regimes usually have some nice prestige projects to show, which is really nice if you are a foreigner they are trying to impress, or a local that is in favor with the regime. Not so much if you are out-of-favor, whether because you opposed the particular approach they took for the prestige project or for some unrelated reason.<p>But, as much as I like HSR and wish the US would do it, emulating China -- whose ability to do it <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a mystery needing study, but well-understood -- isn&#x27;t a cost worth paying for it.')
