You can turn down (or turn off) the heat in the room and crank up the kotatsu and be very cozy.<p>It’s not the most practical source of heating since it doesn’t follow you around to different rooms like warm clothing does. But it’s good if you know you’re going to be in one place for a while (e.g. watching TV). The feeling to me is almost like taking a bath, where your lower body is at a warmer temperature than your upper body, and your circulation keeps your whole body warm. Definitely not miserable!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kotatsu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kotatsu</a>')
