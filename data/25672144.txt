Bytes read from a buffer at every horizontal scan line controlled the speed of the drive through PWM (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mwftr.com&#x2F;416F20&#x2F;Apple%20macintosh%20BYTE1984.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mwftr.com&#x2F;416F20&#x2F;Apple%20macintosh%20BYTE1984.pdf</a>. That probably changed later, as that method doesn’t cater for multiple floppy drives, and created a hard link between screen resolution and controlling floppy disk speed (the hardware driving the screen also processed the PWM bytes that controlled disk speed (and the bytes that produced audio output. 370 scan lines times 60Hz gives you 22,2 kHz))<p>And nitpick on note [1]: that code shows 5 different speeds (four if statements and one ‘otherwise’ return value)')
