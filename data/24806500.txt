I imagine it&#x27;s the same for Vim.<p>Emacs defaults are quite usable. I&#x27;ve been using Emacs for 15 years and I&#x27;m only altering a dozen variables. The rest of my .emacs is simply use-package directives. As I become more proficient, I trim down my dotfiles, not the other way round.<p>Some defaults seem to be there for historical reasons. When I see such a thing, I wait a few months. If I&#x27;m still convinced the default is legacy code, I try to lobby for a change. I&#x27;ve found that developers tend to be very receptive if changes can be well justified. E.g. there&#x27;s a long discussion now in emacs-devel on how to modernize many defaults and make the editor more friendly.<p>My goal is to push all my dotfiles upstream, and end up with almost empty configurations.
