Do you keep (or share with third parties) ANY data that would allow you to match an IP-address and a timestamp to a current or former user of your service? If so, exactly what information do you hold&#x2F;share and for how long?<p>2. What is the name under which your company is incorporated (+ parent companies, if applicable) and under which jurisdiction does your company operate?<p>3. What tools are used to monitor and mitigate abuse of your service, including limits on concurrent connections if these are enforced?<p>4. Do you use any external email providers (e.g. Google Apps), analytics, or support tools ( e.g Live support, Zendesk) that hold information provided by users?<p>5. In the event you receive a DMCA takedown notice or a non-US equivalent, how are these handled?<p>6. What steps would be taken in the event a court orders your company to identify an active or former user of your service? How would your company respond to a court order that requires you to log activity for a user going forward? Have these scenarios ever played out in the past?<p>7. Is BitTorrent and other file-sharing traffic allowed on all servers? If not, why? Do you provide port forwarding services? Are any ports blocked?<p>8. Which payment systems&#x2F;providers do you use? Do you take any measures to ensure that payment details can’t be linked to account usage or IP-assignments?<p>9. What is the most secure VPN connection and encryption algorithm you would recommend to your users?<p>10. Do you provide tools such as “kill switches” if a connection drops and DNS&#x2F;IPv6 leak protection? Do you support Dual Stack IPv4&#x2F;IPv6 functionality?<p>11. Are any of your VPN servers hosted by third parties? If so, what measures do you take to prevent those partners from snooping on any inbound and&#x2F;or outbound traffic? Do you use your own DNS servers?<p>12. In which countries are your servers physically located? Do you offer virtual locations?<p>Also, if you&#x27;re really private you can offer a canary whereby you post a piece of text on your website and update it every month and if one month it isn&#x27;t updated, we can assume you got a FISA warrant.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Canary_trap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Canary_trap</a>')
