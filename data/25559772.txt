From what I&#x27;ve seen, Vancouver real estate (and Toronto) is still ludicrous (given Canadian wages).<p>I&#x27;d also like to see a vacancy tax or perhaps an even more directed law prohibiting foreign ownership of a certain level. Then again, I&#x27;d also like to see Prop 13 not apply to commercial property, not be passed on in inheritance, and not apply to non-primary residences, but these ideas all seem to be nonsensical in CA legislators and citizens&#x27; minds.')
