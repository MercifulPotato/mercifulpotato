As I read the article and the comments I&#x27;m now not at all sure. We all are trying to come up with a good analogy to explain why APIs are distinct from implementations, why it&#x27;s &#x27;obvious&#x27; to a programmer how they&#x27;re distinct, and how their rules should be distinct.<p>But the more I think about it, and read feeble attempts to relate software to other industries, I am starting to think I was wrong. In my experience, especially where good design is encouraged and respected, I can spend far more time designing the API than implementing it! If I create a proprietary API shouldn&#x27;t it be protected? Or am I misunderstanding the nature of the debate?')
