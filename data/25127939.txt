But I totally agree with you, nobody forces people to have children and the ones who have them by accident and hate it afterwards is clear they have not reached a maturity level or preparedness for being a parent and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it at all, people have choices. But ones who consider children spoils or as curses or burdens or thieves of their unmitigated freedoms they used to have prior, it&#x27;s probably for the better to never have children  for they would be neglected or maltreated one way or another.')
