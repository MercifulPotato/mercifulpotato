See one flock of 20 Mourning Doves fly over and another flock of 30 later? Maybe it&#x27;s completely different birds in the second flock or maybe the initial 20 just picked up some friends? Truthfully the difference in data between entering 30 and entering 50 seems huge, but statistically it&#x27;s not. In all likelihood you are almost always <i>undercounting</i> common birds and there are probably many more than 50 around if you&#x27;re seeing a big flock like that.<p>Don&#x27;t let feat of uncertainty get you down. A good faith effort to put in estimated data is actually useful, but not entering any data adds nothing.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebird.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;counting-101&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebird.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;counting-101&#x2F;</a>  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebird.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;counting-201&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebird.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;counting-201&#x2F;</a>')
