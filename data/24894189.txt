You use the same tools and methods to accomplish similiar goals (to understand the reaction of people to particular treatments&#x2F;interventions.<p>This article, right: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nature11421" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nature11421</a> ?<p>So, this is a messaging experiment, which is pretty standard within psychology. The only interesting thing about this (and the only reason it&#x27;s in Nature) is the size, not the experimental design.<p>&gt; The difference between AB testing and Facebook&#x27;s experiments should be obvious to anyone familiar with those experiments, as the aim has been to research and alter human behaviour in general<p>This is what AB tests do. You change the colour of the button, and conversion rate (i.e. the proportion of people that give you money) goes up or down. How is this different from people taking an action (self-reported, btw so potentially garbage) around an election?
