A traditional vaccine would instead inject you directly with the proteins being made. Hows that any different for what it can do?<p>traditional vaccine: dumps a bunch of proteins (sometimes in the form of smashed up virus) into your body so your immune system learns to recognize them.<p>mRNA vaccine: gives your body a few temporary copies of the instructions to make a protein that looks like a bit of virus, so your cells make a bunch of it until the mRNA is used up and the immune system learns to recognize them. Effectively moving part of the production process into the human body instead of doing it in a lab (where it takes additional time to do and to design a process for the lab to do it).')
