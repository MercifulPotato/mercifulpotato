Item(by='xamuel', descendants=None, kids=[24851260, 24851226], score=None, time=1603304490, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24850509, text='&gt;Humans don&#x27;t receive infinite rewards<p>Maybe you&#x27;re right, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as obvious as you imply.<p>Consider this question. Can there exist hypothetical rewards x1,x2,x3,..., each one of which is significantly better than the previous, and at the same time another hypothetical reward y such that y is significantly better than each x_i?<p>If such rewards can exist, and if &quot;significantly better&quot; implies &quot;at least +1 better&quot;, then that necessarily means y must be infinite.<p>Now, how would you argue that such rewards can&#x27;t exist? If you say, &quot;because then y would have to be infinite&quot;, then you&#x27;re arguing in circles, assuming what you want to prove in the first place. It might well be that such rewards indeed can&#x27;t exist, but if so, the argument would have to be different, and I suspect nontrivial.')
