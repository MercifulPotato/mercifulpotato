It varies by country how much easier life is during the probation (easier in Sweden, not super much easier in Norway, not sure about Denmark). However, I&#x27;ve heard cases where HR people simply refuse to go through with the actual process because they don&#x27;t believe the case is strong enough.<p>Interesting you&#x27;ve experienced it taking a year in the US. I would&#x27;ve assumed with employment at will that it was easier, but I guess they want to cover themselves from lawsuits.')
