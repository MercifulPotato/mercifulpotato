Foucault&#x27;s work has enormously changed the way that people think about state power and its command over violence and surveillance, for example by updating Bentham&#x27;s model of the panopticon for a modern world. This is critically important to understanding the two largest political powers (US and China) and their relationship with information and communication. And for better or worse, history and political science was a huge influence on the development of socialist and communist governments and their influence on the world.<p>Teaching the population: The humanities teaches empathy and media literacy better than any other field I know, and 20th century work has expanded that skilset dramatically. This is very useful for people who don&#x27;t end up in &quot;humanities careers&quot; to have some experience with these practices, especially in the modern global world with deliberately crafted narratives all over the place.<p>Understanding technology: There is a moment in &quot;the social dilemma&quot; where the main activist (I forget his name) mentions that social media is not a tool because people are worried about its ability to damage civilization and he compares it to the bicycle, which he claims did not produce such worry. This is completely false, since the bicycle was absolutely a large concern since it enabled women to travel distances without their husbands. Had anybody involved in the doc thought to consult a historian of technology, they wouldn&#x27;t have put forward such a terrible analysis and weakened their argument (and the proposed solutions). There are numerous such examples of this sort of error where a little bit of humanities background would enable us to develop technology more precisely.')
