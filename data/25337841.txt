Trusted setup generates a point where the polynomial is evaluated on, and should it not be disposed of properly the consequences are devastating. (You shouldn&#x27;t need to trust people to use crypto).<p>* the fact the SNARKS are computationally expensive and no-one uses them. Thus opt in privacy and reduced anonymity set.<p>People just associate “zk-snark” with &quot;big-ass anonymity sets for free&quot; when really it’s “complex circuit enforcement enabled by verifier-efficient trusted proving system&quot;<p>I totally agree BTC + Privacy is the holy-grail of crypto, and Monero is the project that&#x27;s the furthest towards that goal with an actually competent team.<p>Take it from someone that does this for a living, use Monero instead.')
