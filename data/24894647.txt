The perception from the UK is that the US is much more polarised than it actually is - and from my perception the UK is even more polarised, but just refuses to believe it.<p>I think this is because minority populations are so much smaller in the UK. Minorities have less of a collective voice and influence on culture, and hence most brits &quot;collision cross-section&quot; with racism is smaller. Hence they think of it as less of a problem, but it isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve had Indonesian colleagues yelled at on a bus, Chinese friend shrieked at for using their phone, and my black friend who just feels like he wont ever &quot;be british&quot;. My Indian colleague can talk my head off about the racist hiring techniques he&#x27;s had to deal with. It&#x27;s not &quot;not a problem&quot; it&#x27;s just that most brits don&#x27;t even know someone who is a minority, let alone one that&#x27;s experienced racism.')
