If we use UBI to inflate the currency, everyone gets the same chance to use uninflated funds, which ends up benefitting those with less.<p>If we inflate via UBI, those on fixed incomes wouldn&#x27;t be hurt unless it was a fat fixed income, in which case it&#x27;s disingenuous to refer to them that way since they&#x27;re basically just independently wealthy, and most people think of fixed income means pension&#x2F;disability.')
