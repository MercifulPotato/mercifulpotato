I block them all, at home, at work, and do the same for friends and family. The only ads I see are the half second ads during my DVR playbook, and then skip. I pay for the Internet, for email, for the software I use. I&#x27;m not suffering through ads. One project I&#x27;m working on is sorting out how to get the Pi-hole to block YouTube ads 100%. I don&#x27;t see them on my Linux latops because of Nano Adblock, but my kids see them on their iPads. For some reason no one (yet) seems to be able to sort out how to block ad content on YouTube 100%. There has to be a way.')
