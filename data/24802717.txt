Back when I used to play classical music more I loved playing a few of Chopin&#x27;s Nocturnes repeatedly - they were about the right level for me so it was fun, and I could play them pretty well, I think.  But I also spent a lot of time learning a few harder pieces (like Fantaisie Impromptu), and I remember getting frustrated that it took me ages to learn them and, although in the end I could play them sortof OKish, my efforts just weren&#x27;t a patch on what a better pianist could do.<p>Looking back I can see that I shouldn&#x27;t have picked such hard pieces until I was really ready for them.  It was probably a big part of why I ended up quitting for quite a few years before taking it up again more recently with an entirely different approach.')
