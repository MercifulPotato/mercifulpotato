Prior to 2018, Tesla had delivered fewer than 500k cars total. By contrast, they are pushing to get 500k cars out the door this calendar year.<p>Toyota, GM, etc are sitting on mature product lines which are growing a few percentage a year. They can roll out a new assembly line and spend months fine tuning it before turning it up and shutting down the old one. Tesla has no previous assembly line to lean on.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear Tesla as a company values growth over delivering the best quality product.<p>The flip side of this is I&#x27;ve heard a fair number of people suggest that Tesla&#x27;s service is good... <i>stupid slow</i> but eventually good.')
