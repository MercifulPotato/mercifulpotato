In this case, I think that parsing either format is equally complex and that MarkDown&#x27;s complexity is greater than AsciiDocs when considering the lack of compatibility between extended features (e.g. I found subtle rendering differences between Github and Gitlab which were our public and private repos at my last position.<p>I think the real fallacy here is that it will cost too much to switch.  It really only took a couple of days for muscle memory to adapt from Markdown to AsciiDoc and so I&#x27;d challenge HN readers to give AsciiDoc a one-week trial.')
