It becomes a vicious cycle that feeds into itself.<p>I didn&#x27;t believe it at first. It seems so real, so profoundly difficult for me, but I was desperate and willing to try anything.<p>So I did. I followed the program precisely as laid out in the book. Made an Excel sheet and everything and gradually through cognitive behavioral therapy, I challenged the thoughts that I would never be able to successfully sleep again (along with careful measuring).<p>We tense up when we feel anxious. I can imagine that during times of great stress, the body reacts in certain ways that causes certain muscles to stay stuck or not heal, or even just have perceptional problems.<p>There&#x27;s already a precedent for it with insomnia. It makes sense.<p>Thanks for the book recommendation.')
