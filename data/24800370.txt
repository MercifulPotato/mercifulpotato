They want to work for a company and learn, but company won&#x27;t hire them because they don&#x27;t have money to pay for &quot;idle&quot; worker and the overhead to teach them. \nBut this is for the greater good. In the past you had companies who used their market share in particular city to drive wages down and people had a choice either work for them and starve or move to different city. Minimum wage stops this, at a cost of some people being unable to work for free. I can accept that.<p>There will be projects for sure that would love their software were used by AWS and other companies without paying them, but that will only create a race to the bottom. We should stop exploitation of engineers by these giant companies.')
