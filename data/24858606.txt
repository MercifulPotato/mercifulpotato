They&#x27;re getting together with friends, they&#x27;ve been going to visit family, they&#x27;ve gotten their kids back in school, and no one has gotten sick.  They think the rest of us are being ridiculous.<p>I almost feel like its the elephant in the room.  No official has come out and said &quot;I understand why these policies look like overkill, but if things go bad they will go bad quickly&quot;.   Now the reason no official has said that is because they think people will hear the first part and discard the last part, but it&#x27;s exacerbating the mistrust people already have about our government response.<p>I will say that I&#x27;m personally finding it hard, and I fall into cycles of wondering if the sacrifices I&#x27;ve made a are worth it. Family members are getting older and we&#x27;ve probably missed out on 4-5 visits we would have had any other year, plus we&#x27;re facing the possibility of seeing no one over Thanksgiving and Christmas.')
