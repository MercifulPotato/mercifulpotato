I am an Emacs user and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the world, but I know people that are increadible productive using just about anything.<p>When writing well-contained code where I can easily understand external dependencies I could just as well use notepad. Emacs shines when I want macros or multiple cursors, interactive development (I am a schemer) at just general code navigation. When doing things that are not scheme I could probably edit code just fine in just about any editor.<p>The only things I really miss in other editors (probably because I never looked) are the features for jumping around. I can jump to a definition (across files) in 1s which sets a &quot;mark&quot; from the place I left. Jumping back takes less than a second. I could of course do it, but it was more involved and I couldn&#x27;t do it without having to think and let go of what was in my mind at the time.<p>Anyway, you grow into your editing style. A friend told me he would likely get seizures by developing like me.')
