The Statute of Secrecy is clearly motivated by centuries of abuse of wizards, witch burning and the like. I don&#x27;t remember any indication that wizards &quot;rule&quot; the muggles in any way or affect them at all. Prejudice against muggles is the #1 flag for &quot;this person is evil&quot; and is pretty much always decried as wrong by the protagonists. The only thing that really holds is the mistreatment of squibs, but even if it&#x27;s wrong it makes a lot of sense - they would be hard-pressed to find good jobs in wizarding society for purely practical reasons.<p>So unless I&#x27;m missing something from some extended universe, this is an pretty unfair mis-characterisation of the books...')
