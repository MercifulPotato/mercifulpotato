One was quite a good programmer, interested in all kinds of technical stuff. He had failed secondary school because of, well, reasons, but he wasn&#x27;t dumb, and wrote decent code and was quite inventive. Another one was someone with a business school degree who had changed careers. Not a glitch in his school career, but his math was very weak. Not a great programmer, but he had a good feel for UI. I&#x27;ve also had a colleague with a math PhD. He was a very good programmer, although not very fast.<p>In my experience, you don&#x27;t need it if you work on the more conservative projects. If you want to build the next YouTube or facebook, you might find a good understanding of math invaluable.')
