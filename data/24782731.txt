Usually it&#x27;s at an inopportune time. Sometimes when I am showing someone my phone and then they see my home address. This has happened several times already and I should just delete this app at this point.<p>It is also a little strange that the app is nagging me to go home. I&#x27;m out and enjoying myself and the app is telling me to go home? As if I will look down and see that it will now take me 43 minutes to go home instead of the usual 45 and that would be the final straw that will cause me to end my night.')
