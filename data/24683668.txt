Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601860320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24683484, text='&gt;  In good times, the defense for landlords raising rents is &quot;they&#x27;re taking a financial risk by renting out their property others&quot; -- if that&#x27;s the case, then why is it the government&#x27;s priority to protect them more than the tenants these landlords are evicting?<p>It&#x27;s one thing if the risk is tenants don&#x27;t pay, and the landlord won&#x27;t get the rent, plus they&#x27;ll have to pay legal fees and what not to evict, plus they may need to fix damages that they will be unlikely to recoup from the departing tenant and then have the uncertainty of finding a new tenant. That&#x27;s the risk they signed up for in becoming a landlord.<p>It&#x27;s another thing if the government says hey, we know people can&#x27;t&#x2F;aren&#x27;t paying rent, but you can&#x27;t evict them cause it&#x27;s a bad situation for everyone. If the landlords then have trouble paying the mortgage and employees&#x2F;contractors and what not, if there&#x27;s no consessions that&#x27;s going to be a problem.<p>Maybe you tell the banks not to forclose and the banks have to eat it, because they&#x27;re banks and universally reviled. It seems easier to drop helicopter money and keep most bills paid, and maybe just slow down the courts rather than prohibit evictions and foreclosure. But helicopter money has to be federal, and states can block evictions and foreclosures, so that&#x27;s what we get without agreement at the federal level.')
