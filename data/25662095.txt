I didn&#x27;t get an offer. Their process was really quite rudimentary compared to the other companies I interviewed at, namely Google who I see as their most direct competitor for engineering talent.<p>* Every single coding problem was about iterating over a string or an array and doing something with it. Seemed like there was no coordination at all on what&#x27;s being asked from one interviewer to the next. For a senior infra engineer interview I&#x27;d expect them to touch on concurrency, or service architecture, or recursion, or debugging, or... anything besides strings and arrays (which I&#x27;m good at!).<p>* The system design question they asked me was about how to design a frontend feature for live-updating comment chains. I understand the ideal that the questions are so high-level that it&#x27;s an even playing field regardless of background, but the reality is that every problem is going to be close to _someone&#x27;s_ domain and far from someone else&#x27;s. I wish they had chose something at least related to infrastructure services, because I don&#x27;t even know the 101 on how social media frontends work.<p>* The interviews didn&#x27;t include any time for me to ask meaningful questions of the interviewers. I was assigned to engineers at random, rather than based on where I&#x27;d likely be working.<p>* None of the interviewers conveyed any enthusiasm about giving the interview. I could tell that speaking to me was a chore distracting them from what they wanted to be doing.<p>Overall the process felt haphazard and low-effort, like I was Candidate #24601 in the machine for the week. Stark contrast to Google, where the interviews left me _more_ excited about working there, despite Google being more than twice Facebook&#x27;s size. Fortunately I didn&#x27;t get the job so I didn&#x27;t even have to ponder any ethics questions :^)')
