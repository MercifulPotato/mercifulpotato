Interestingly they didn&#x27;t do it via customer support, but instead were directly in contact with Gandi&#x27;s legal department. Their legal guys approved the request&#x2F;order without thinking to actually verify anything at all. Funnily enough, I had way more trouble getting my domain back than the people who stole it.<p>As far as I can tell, Google, Cloudflare and Namecheap are really the only guys in town that don&#x27;t fall for stupid shit.')
