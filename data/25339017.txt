I’ve always thought of spoofing as a write only type thing where you can impersonate someone, but not have access to any of their existing data.  Email spoofing is a good example of this.<p>Token theft is WAY more severe because it gives you complete access to everything.  It’s total control.  You can exfiltrate data and that’s what I’d consider the biggest difference, at least in my opinion.')
