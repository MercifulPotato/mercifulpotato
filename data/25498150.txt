You need medical equipment to handle all types of injury&#x2F;trauma. You need advanced and very expensive diagnostic equipment (e.g. MRI, CT scanners). You need treatment&#x2F;operating rooms and all the supplies. You need physicians and nurses and supporting staff. You need lab services. All of your patients arrive more more or less at random, unscheduled, so you can&#x27;t really optimize any of it. It&#x27;s probably the most expensive way to deliver medical care that you could think of. Even if it&#x27;s only a minority of the care delivered, it&#x27;s very expensive to deliver it.')
