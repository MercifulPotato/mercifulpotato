But I do not agree that this is the only thing.<p>I agree with you, that very specifically targeted and created applications will get a response rate better by at least a factor of ten.<p>I am often on the other side. Reading applications and deciding whom to invite to an interview. As Inteverviews take time for at least me and 3 other colleagues I filter very strongly. For one hour of interview the amount of time it takes (preparation, discussion afterwards, and so on) can take up to 1 - 1.5 person days.<p>As I am working for an agency this means 1.5 days me and my colleagues can&#x27;t earn money for the company by working productively for our clients (even our managers work hands on on client projects at least part of their time).<p>So creating a well thought out application, one that is targeted and also shows the personality of the applicant helps me a lot in deciding whom to invite. Make it stand out without being obnoxious. Make it fitting for the company and the job.<p>An anecdote to exemplify my point:<p>I remember how my late father helped our neighbor&#x27;s son with his application. He was a carpenter and had specialized in restoration. He wanted to apply for a job at a workshop that had been set up to do just that.<p>My father and he then designed (and he made) a special application folder made of wood. This had very fine intarsia work and showed very precisely what skills the neighbor&#x27;s son had as a craftsman.<p>The cover letter and curriculum vitae were of course also well thought out and designed. No question.<p>An application - an interview - a job offer at one of the leading workshops for restoration work in Europe.')
