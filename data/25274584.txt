This doesn&#x27;t scare anybody?<p>Not really. mRNA starts to degrade within minutes of injection, and lasts maybe at most a few days in your body. It cant turn back into DNA, so once its gone, it can no longer have any effect on you.<p>&gt; Why has this not been approved before?<p>Its a relatively new technology that took a lot of work and money to make a stable, effective vaccine with.
