I delete most of the material I marked after some time. It also prevents me to chase the breaking news. When I go over a list, usually the &quot;breaking&quot; value is already lost so I can skip them.<p>I also have a two or three layer setup. I star the material in rss reader, then if it looks ok after some time, I add to Pocket. I skim the article in Pocket and if it looks worthy enough, I favorite it and an IFTTT rule adds it to Instapaper. I read once more in Instapaper.<p>In my opinion, if you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll revisit an article, it&#x27;s not worth reading even once.<p>Edit: typo')
