If yes, it would be helpful if you could point to resources that were helpful to you and any daily practice schedule you followed?<p>Self-learning piano is, overall, a boondoggle. You want a teacher.<p>I started learning piano in December 2018 at the age of 27. \nFor the first couple months I stayed on my own to build up at least <i>some</i> base knowledge before getting a (remote) teacher in April 2019. I mostly used a service called Flowkey (sorta like Synthesia for the web), the book Music Theory for Dummies, and a course on Udemy by Ben Westenra.<p>I highly recommend getting a teacher, even remote, using a site like TakeLessons.com. They&#x27;ll keep you motivated, answer your questions, and set accomplishable goals.<p>&gt; I have tried learning piano and I found a lot of stuff irritatingly hard to get right and got bored. Like for some reason I am not able to transition to other keys well when I am using both hands or when some finger involuntarily moves because of motion of neighboring finger.<p>Cumulative hours of practice are necessary to learn even a single piece, and short of Matrix-style skill uploading, there&#x27;s no shortcut to putting the time in.<p>&gt; Also, I seem to get finger fatigue which is surprising considering the amount of time I spend on keyboards anyway.<p>Not all keys are the same. :) Your fingers are getting a much different and more intense workout by playing.<p>Edit- Updated language since someone focused on pulling a &quot;gotcha&quot; on me for upvotes over the context (in this case, piano.)')
