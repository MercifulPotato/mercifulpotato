Automatically transferring footage to an internal affairs department there would distance it from the actual department, while preserving state control.<p>Aside from activating &#x2F; deactivating the camera (with clear guidelines and penalties for doing &#x2F; not doing so), and connecting it to a network at the end of a shift, it should be a black box. None of the IT functions should run out of the same police force.<p>Consequently, this <i>also</i> protects officers in the case of equipment failure: timestamp the activation &#x2F; deactivation signals in a separate log file. If the footage isn&#x27;t there, but they activated, then it&#x27;s no longer their reputation on the line, because they had no involvement in the chain of custody.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;State_bureau_of_investigation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;State_bureau_of_investigation</a>')
