My master password is long and I enter a lot of passwords. The most obvious attack vector is getting onto my computer while I&#x27;m working, not cracking the master password.<p>2) Losing my master password would be a _big fucking problem_. Once I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ve learned it I destroy whatever it&#x27;s on, but I can&#x27;t risk having no backup before then.<p>Both of these points could be addressed if I were safeguarding nuclear launch codes. But I think it&#x27;s silly to treat my passwords as national secrets. I&#x27;m not willing to abandon all convenience for the sake of safety.')
