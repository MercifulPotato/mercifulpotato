However, these impulses can be extremely subtle, and no matter how we struggle, I don&#x27;t believe that that any human being lives a life avoiding racist acts entirely.<p>Would you still argue that I&#x27;m a racist perpetuating a false claim as an excuse for my own racism?  I mean, I accept that I&#x27;m prejudiced and every once in a while racist despite my best efforts, so that part is true in a sense.  I&#x27;m don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m trying to excuse myself, though.')
