They just keep the wing in the water.  And so don&#x27;t have to deal with being not-so-great airplanes, so they can focus on being good boats.<p>Starship might end up even more robust to weather than airliners.  As are boats.  But seaplanes combine the vulnerability of planes, with the those of poor boats.  Taking off in a swell, is not a happy thing.  I suppose SpX could hypothetically do JATO rocket-assisted seaplanes. :P<p>But consider the number of passengers.  And choices of flying formations of existing seaplanes for each launch, or &quot;let&#x27;s create a brand new large airliner, and make it a seaplane too!&quot; (even without the seaplane bit, those can be &#x27;bet the aerospace company&#x27; gambles), or... order some ferries.  Maybe even rent them to start.')
