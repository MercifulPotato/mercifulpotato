At the beginning they were 101 and up, and my heart rate spiked over 100 for long periods of time (normally I&#x27;m in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s). Now the &quot;fevers&quot; are pretty low grade (under 100 but definitely higher than &quot;normal.&quot;)<p>I&#x27;m also experiencing the crashes you mentioned - fine one minute and crawling back in bed the next. It&#x27;s usually in the afternoons or evenings. But as you say, it&#x27;s much better than before when I slept ALL DAY for several days.<p>To end on a brighter note, I am back to exercising 45 mins, 3 days a week. And I go biking weekends, for 1.5 - 2 hours. My stamina isn&#x27;t what it was, but it&#x27;s building back. I even decided to go ahead with a (virtual) race I signed up for. I&#x27;ll walk&#x2F;run with the only goal of finishing.')
