Practically nobody is going to use that stuff; it&#x27;s just the stuff that&#x27;s been in textbooks for 20 years, and so people assume they need to teach it.<p>How far into this do you get before you learn how CBC bitflips work? Trick question! It&#x27;s never covered. The cryptanalysis slides are from 2013, sure, but CBC padding oracles were already pass√© by then.<p>It just makes me feel like people aren&#x27;t taking the subject seriously. Which is how a lot of this courseware reads to me! A recitation of random facts.')
