Learn who has power and start building your own. These kinds of things take years.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to do that, at least start donating to local politicians who you agree with, volunteer for them, tell your friends to vote for them. Local races are often won by dozens to hundreds of votes. You can easily swing that. And don&#x27;t focus on &quot;highest value&quot; work. Door-to-door canvassing is more important than any code you can write.')
