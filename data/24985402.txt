I only print about 10 pages a month but it has never jammed and I just put in my third toner cartridge.<p>It&#x27;s monochrome but I almost never need to print in color.  For photos I just upload to Walgreens and pick them up a mile away.<p>I went through 2 HP Inkjets and I don&#x27;t print very much and the ink always went dry after a few months and I know there was still ink in them.')
