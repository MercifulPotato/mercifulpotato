Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[24874814], score=None, time=1603486996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24872972, text='&gt; <i>It&#x27;s outrageous indeed that GH&#x2F;MS is complying.</i><p>Not really.  They&#x27;re legally required to do so.  The DMCA notice (despite what someone suggests downthread) is unfortunately quite properly served.  Even if it is flat-out wrong, GH&#x2F;MS has no reason (and likely no resources) to investigate whether or not that&#x27;s the case.  And if they did, and got it wrong, they&#x27;d lose their safe harbor status and be liable for damages.<p>If the youtube-dl author believes it to be bullshit, they can send a counter-notice, and GH&#x2F;MS will then put it back up.  If the RIAA still has a bone to pick, they can file a lawsuit.  Unfortunately, they very well may.<p>&gt; <i>It&#x27;s not that far from targeting wget or curl, were it not for the widespread use of them in industry.</i><p>I get really confused when I hear things like this, because this makes no sense.  Targeting a program called &quot;YouTube Download&quot;, which has the main purpose of downloading clean copies of YT videos, against the wishes of the content creators is absolutely not the same thing as targeting a generic HTTP&#x2F;FTP download tool.<p>I think the DMCA is garbage, but it feels like willful ignorance to be at all surprised about things like this, and to compare this to something obviously non-infringing.')
