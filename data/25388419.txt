I&#x27;m a big fan of Athlean-X and all that, but I think a lot of folks aren&#x27;t ready for even that level of workout.  Some of us are so screwed up that the first thing we need is a couple <i>months</i> of foam rolling, scapular activation, awareness training, etc.  If you go into face pulls without knowing what a face pull should feel like, you risk ending up with a shoulder issue.<p>I had shoulder surgery after blowing out my AC joint weightlifting.  I went to one PT place that, while good in some areas, focused on strength of my rotators and neglected my mobility.  My shoulders got worse after initially getting better and I thought I would need a second surgery.  Fortunately I screwed up my lower back so I sought out a new PT place(Catherine at Fields in Motion, Campbell, CA) which not only fixed my back, but identified what was wrong with my shoulder and helped me fix it.  It&#x27;s only now, after months of flexibility and lower-trap strengthening that I know what a face pull is supposed to feel like.<p>Keep those sternums out, shoulders rolled back, and always keep your core activated(squeeze your cheeks and tighten abs) when you do anything physical.  It seems so obvious now, but I went 45 years without figuring it out.')
