Basically there are three options:<p>- Have a public vote, direct legitimation (or via some extra electoral college or something) this means that judges have to be &quot;popular&quot; and run campaigns and question is, if that&#x27;s really smart ...<p>- Have the &quot;juristical class&quot; elect within, so judges from lower courts would lick somebody, or current judges elect additional ones. That would put judges into their own &quot;class&quot; and remove all democratic legitimation<p>- or do what is done and have a democratically elected body do it. In the case of the U.S. it&#x27;s done by a combination of president (nominating) and Senate (confirming) where the Senate represents the different states.<p>It is one of the tough problems.<p>For the pardon the idea comes from absolutist times where a King would pardon as he likes. The modern interpretation comes from correcting &quot;blind&quot; justice. Justice has to rule according to law. But sometimes one either might decide that a law was bad and than a pardon might be a way to correct that (ideally if law is rewritten as well) and sometimes there are hard cases, like the 90 year old who should get a chance to die outside of prison, for sake of family etc.<p>Generally the system assumes the actors act mostly in good faith and were removed (impeachment etc.) otherwise.')
