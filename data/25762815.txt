There&#x27;s nothing really preventing users from building the app themselves, and some of them do that. But building yourself is not something most users can do. So when talking about &quot;dropping support&quot;, I mean specifically stopping doing Mac builds myself. (Or rather not creating new builds for M1 Mac and similar, I&#x27;m okay with doing builds for old x86)<p>&gt; Personally though I think it&#x27;s weird that so many people are okay with distributing on platforms they don&#x27;t even own.<p>It&#x27;s not very comfortable, and I had a lot of inner discussions about this. I originally supported only Linux and Windows (platform I use and test on regularly), but inevitably Mac users came and wanted to use the app too. It&#x27;s quite difficult to reject such users when in theory a simple cross-build does not seem so difficult.<p>As mentioned before I&#x27;m using Electron and fortunately it does shield you from majority of platform specific bugs, so not testing each and every release on Mac turned out mostly OK. There are other issues though - Mac is very opinionated and many things &#x2F; conventions are very different from Linux&#x2F;Windows. As a result a simple cross build of my app is quite &quot;foreign element&quot; and users ask for mac specific features. My eventual solution was a compromise of &quot;I provide builds but don&#x27;t implement any mac specialties&quot;.')
