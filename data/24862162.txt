If you discourage holding stocks and things over other assets as stores of value, I think that could have some deflationary effects.  Not only that, but companies are then somewhat disincentivized from growing in valuation, but finding ways to grow in their reach&#x2F;authority&#x2F;power etc.  The end result seems deflationary... i.e. companies worth more for less dollars.')
