Outside of games, we all basically do those things: browser, email, text, spreadsheet, word process.<p>Those things were reasonably well solved almost two orders of magnitude ago.<p>Software never bothered to optimize for snappiness, despite so many opportunities. So we got stuck with the same kinda-good response, and for mobile, a much more questionable kinda-ok battery life of 3-6 hours.<p>I mean, on a couple of node shrinks where the efficiency improved (because clock speed wasn&#x27;t), could we have please attacked the battery life?<p>It takes an architecture change to highlight how inefficient desktop is. Unfortunately, desktop is an afterthought in terms of investment. The best hope for actual optimization is convergence with the phone OSs, which this is the first step of.')
