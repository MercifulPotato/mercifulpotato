But not all software is equal.<p>If you strip away half a dozen layers of indirection and translation, and replace gigs of code with hundreds of kilobytes of it, then there are <i>dramatic</i> differences. In performance, in reliability, in robustness, in maintainability, in safety.<p>WordPerfect for DOS, like all DOS apps, had to run in under 640 KB of usable memory -- 2&#x2F;3 of a meg -- and it shared that with the OS. However, that OS went through 20 years of development and polishing and it was very solid at the end.<p>WordPerfect ran on about a dozen different OSes and CPUs, and as such it was very clean, exceptionally thoroughly tested and debugged software.<p>When you have a honed, polished single-function app -- a  word processor and nothing else -- that runs in 200-300KB of memory, that can perform well on an 8MHz CPU, running on a 30-40KB OS that runs well on kit half that speed, and you run it on 21st century hardware, the result achieves a level of performance that is literally impossible with any 21st century OS with all its multitasking and multithreading and millions of lines of poorly-integrated code.')
