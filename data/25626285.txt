I have little experince with those lists except for going through one of them once and being shocked at what was in there.<p>The setup I use is customised for me, i.e., Rube Goldberg would be proud.  I can view and manipulate all traffic from outside the application and outside the origin computer.  I can strip cookies based on IP, domain or URL very easily.\nI also control DNS so only domains I approve would even return an IP address.')
