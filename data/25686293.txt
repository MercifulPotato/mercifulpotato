Item(by='Aachen', descendants=None, kids=[25688350], score=None, time=1610123224, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25685732, text='Warning that it&#x27;s vulnerable because it relies on a server for key exchange is like warning that water is wet and you shouldn&#x27;t let it loose in your house to prevent water damage. It&#x27;s correct, but redundant. The very definition of end to end encryption is not trusting the server, so you need to verify the exchanged keys. This is a requirement in Signal, Wire, Threema, Jami, Briar, Element&#x2F;Matrix, Keybase, OTR, and all other protocols. If you don&#x27;t do that, then yes, you rely on whoever owns (or &quot;owned&quot;) the server.<p>What might need a warning is that the server can push new keys to your phone at any time and, unless you go into your security settings, you will never notice. Being warned of key changes is opt-in. That&#x27;s why WhatsApp does, by default, opportunistic encryption.<p>But Moxie was involved in the implementation and got only a few million for publishing that claim so no worries y&#x27;all.')
