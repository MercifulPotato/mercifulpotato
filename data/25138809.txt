All this while the average payment processor take around %3.<p>And don&#x27;t forget the reason they&#x27;re doing it is to diffuse criticism of their monopolistic restrictions, to help them in their fight against Epic, which is actually <i>fighting</i> for the same rights that these small time developers really need.')
