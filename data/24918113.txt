I often see code that where a method sets an instance variable, then calls another method that does some work based on that instance variable, which is then not used until the next time that first caller is used. The instance variable is redundant, and the control flow is obfuscated. I think the principle is just to only expose something when you really have to (harhar), and that the 70&#x27;s suspicion of unstructured use of global scope should be equally directed to class scope.')
