If you want to make this about actual business presence, financial transactions, etc. that would fall under trade, then sure. But how are you suggesting to &quot;ban&quot; a Chinese website or app, other than erecting our own Great Firewall? And would you suggest using that firewall to ban all requests from China? Or just &quot;social media&quot; requests?')
