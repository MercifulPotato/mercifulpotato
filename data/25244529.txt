Not at all, in fact it&#x27;s so reliable that sometimes when I want to make changes I have to refer to my notes because I&#x27;ve forgotten what I&#x27;d done five, six or years ago.<p>I&#x27;ve only done the full exercise twice since 2012 (there&#x27;s been no need to do more).  The second was in 2015 when I fine tuned my installation and it has run like silk ever since. (I don&#x27;t consider doing other machines as fully redoing the exercise as I&#x27;ve a record of most of the adjustments from the original machine which I apply to the second, and so on.)<p>It&#x27;s not any more buggy than any other Windows system and the machine&#x27;s drivers stabilized years ago.  If you got the buggy idea from my comment about me blowing Windows up then it&#x27;s not the machine&#x27;s fault.  I  probably do more varied work on this machine than most, one moment it can be used as a prototyping test bed for some electronic project with the covers off and wires hanging out, another I&#x27;ll be experimenting with Windows&#x27; internals, and the next I&#x27;ll likely be writing a 20&#x2F;30 page report where I cannot afford crashes to happen under any circumstances.<p>It&#x27;s easy for me to crash Windows, and I do so often!  If I get the notion that, say, I cannot uninstall some part of Windows because Microsoft won&#x27;t let me do so from within the O&#x2F;S, then I&#x27;ll just load a Linux based utility like Parted Magic and simply remove the associated files anyway (and this includes all the file repositories and Windows &#x27;self-awareness&#x27;&#x2F;protection stuff which gets in the way when you&#x27;re testing things out — Windows starts complaining when you do this, so the solution is to also kill off the complaining&#x2F;monitoring bits).  Sometimes this approach can be very successful, sometimes it isn&#x27;t.  What I&#x27;m saying is that I&#x27;ve no qualms about pulling Windows&#x27; internals apart bit by bit to get it to do my bidding. Clearly, this can cause trouble and sometimes it does.<p>However, it&#x27;s never an issue because no useful user data ever resides on the O&#x2F;S drive and I can stream a complete, fully-installed working backup and I can be up and running within 6&#x2F;7 minutes. Alternatively, if I&#x27;m running multiple projects at once I just swap out the O&#x2F;S drive for another disk that already has the identical Windows O&#x2F;S installed and fully pre-configured.<p><i>BTW, I&#x27;ve found from testing it&#x27;s amazing what one can actually do with W10 going down that path, but that&#x27;s another story.  Even though it can be &#x27;tamed&#x27; considerably by using unorthodox methods, frankly, I&#x27;ve lost interest in Windows and Microsoft (so have the industries I work with).  I&#x27;ve wasted too much of my life mucking about with Microsoft&#x27;s proprietary code that&#x27;s written primarily to benefit Microsoft at the users&#x27; expense.</i><p>Oh, I forgot your point about support.  I&#x27;ve used MS products for an awfully long time and I&#x27;ve NEVER received any support from Microsoft (and I wouldn&#x27;t take it even if it were offered).  If you consider automatic updates as support then so be it.  If I buy any other type of product I don&#x27;t have to use it with an umbilical cord connected to the Manufacturer because it was so shoddy when it left the factory, so why do I have to do it with software? Patches and automatic updates are con jobs by a software industry who&#x27;s convinced everyone that updates are necessary to cover up their crappy&#x2F;sloppy workmanship—or these days to add in spyware that they forgot to install in the first place (witness Windows 10).
