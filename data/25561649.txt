At the time covid tests weren&#x27;t as readily available to be tested but I had many of the symptoms of covid including debilitating headaches like I&#x27;ve never had before. Eventually I recover and test positive for antibodies.<p>To this day I have issues sleeping and I&#x27;m not solely sure if it&#x27;s anxiety due to pandemic or because of my presumptive case of covid.<p>It&#x27;s gotten slightly better in recent weeks but for months now I&#x27;d wake up about 30 minutes after falling asleep with a pounding heart and and feeling of extreme anxiety. Not as bad as a panic attack but still not pleasant.')
