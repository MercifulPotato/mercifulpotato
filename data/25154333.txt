What makes you think that they&#x27;re currently respecting your network? A Google Chromecast will already ignore all of your network-wide DNS settings.<p>This removes a couple of avenues of attack you might have used to rein in some of those devices (but probably weren&#x27;t doing), but it&#x27;s just a symptom of the fact that using DNS for device control was always a really hacky, kind of awful solution to the problem of having rogue devices on the network.')
