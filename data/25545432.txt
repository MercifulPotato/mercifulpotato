If I can get 125 KwH in 30 minutes with your v3 charging that&#x27;s still a 6x multiplier, not really something you can ignore.<p>Now you need bigger charging stations because people are spending longer at the pump or else you&#x27;ll have longer lines. Adding to that, I sure as hell am not spending half an hour at a pump on an already long road trip.<p>The lack of population density in the US, especially in the middle of the country, makes electric vehicles not a great choice for many people. I&#x27;m guessing this is why we see higher adoption in Europe on a consumer and infrastructure level.')
