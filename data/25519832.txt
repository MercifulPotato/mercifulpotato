They&#x27;ve coasted on developing and publishing mostly just Bond films and a few reboots&#x2F;belated sequels to other properties, but beyond that they&#x27;ve operated more as an IP holding company than an active production studio.<p>It was almost a shame to see, given MGM&#x2F;UA&#x27;s age and original strengths.<p>Supposedly, Walt Disney always had a giant love&#x2F;hate relationship with MGM and tried to buy them or merge with them several times in his lifetime (if for no other reason than that he was extremely vexed that they got the rights to Oz before him). The modern Disney company probably isn&#x27;t as worried about buying MGM as Walt was, but it would be wild &quot;revenge&quot; for Walt if Disney ended up ultimately buying them.')
