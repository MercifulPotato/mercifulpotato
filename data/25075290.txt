For instance, &quot;0.5% of your subscription price, at most $x&#x2F;month&#x2F;subscription&quot;? That would keep it reasonable for low-cost subscriptions, and have high-cost subscriptions pay more, but the cap would make it feel much more reasonable to use Stripe Billing even for very large subscription costs.<p>With a structure like that, I&#x27;d want to use Stripe Billing for <i>every</i> customer, rather than considering any kind of special arrangements for high-value customers.')
