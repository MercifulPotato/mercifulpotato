Isn&#x27;t this true in most parts of world now. The whole Brexit campaign was fueled by misinformation.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s no free press (check press freedom indices), without which democracy is in name only.<p>I have read a lot of outlets from India which are anti establishment. Though I definitely think the press freedoms are nowhere at the level of some countries.<p>&gt; The government uses martial law to impose Internet lockdown for over a year on any citizens who resist govt&#x27;s crimes against them.<p>I think this refers to Kashmir. While I don&#x27;t support the restriction and definitely heavy handed and it wouldn&#x27;t have been possible in say a country like US now. I think you are triviliazing the situation when you think all the &quot;resistance&quot; is against government crimes.')
