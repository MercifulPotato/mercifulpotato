They had an academic tertiary source making these claims  extrapolated from reaearch by the same author that made both plausible claims but also included similar inferences. Being a very obscure group there aren&#x27;t many other academic sources discussing it. All literature that could disprove these claims comes from non-academics affiliated with the group which are a no-go.<p>As per Wikipedia rules (which took hours to figure out), there&#x27;s not much one can do short of getting some impartial or friendly academic to publish a more reasonable article.')
