Cryptocurrencies gives access to stock-like exchanges and financial tools to plebs and that&#x27;s something that should be reserved to coastal elites. You can also see it in how hard they pushed for ICOs being regulated by SEC, getting a chance to get rich by investing in early ventures is for billionaire VCs only, not plebs!<p>Also, many coastal elites missed the crypto boat and therefore would rather treat it as a scam they were right to ignore rather than admit their mistake even when mainstream financial institutions invest billions in it. They will deny it to the end.')
