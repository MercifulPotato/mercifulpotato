For example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nbc-2.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;national-world&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;police-found-a-pickup-truck-full-of-bombs-and-guns-near-capitol-feds-say&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nbc-2.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;national-world&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;police-foun...</a><p>Additionally a large noose and cross were erected at the scene.  The former is a symbol of violent white supremacy in the United States, and the latter is both a religious symbol and a frequently used symbol of an existing terrorist organization, the KKK.  Some of those involved were self-professed followers of a known conspiracy cult (QAnon).  Also at least one speech during the event quoted Hitler.<p>It&#x27;s hard not to use the word &quot;terrorism&quot; to describe what happened that day, given the breadth of violence, both implied and actual, and the wide associations with cults, terrorist organizations, religious organizations, and despotic figures.  All of those things are hallmarks of past terrorist acts both within and outside of the United States.<p>Not three months ago another event occurred, which Wikipedia describes as a &quot;domestic terror plot&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gretchen_Whitmer_kidnapping_plot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gretchen_Whitmer_kidnapping_pl...</a><p>I see little difference between that, a group of individuals plotting to kidnap and murder a government official, and the events at the Capitol which involved groups plotting to kidnap and murder government officials.<p>&gt; is just a way to trick a few more people into taking your ideas seriously enough to read to the end of the paragraph.<p>That was certainly not my intent, and I don&#x27;t believe your comment addresses the best possible version of my argument.')
