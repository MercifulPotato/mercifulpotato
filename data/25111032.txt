The CIA is per definition a lying, criminal, state-protected enterprise, which is accountable to no one. Not to the oversight committee and for sure not the president. They just keep lying, doing their own secret wars, media interference and election busting. Being fascist should also be concerning to some. There are tons of books on that.\nThe only oversight was the Church commission, once. They collect and fabricate so much dirt on everyone that oversight is impossible.<p>The NSA being accountable is also news to me. They routinely violate their own constitution, and many other laws. They also cooperate with said criminals, and similar criminal enterprises worldwide.')
