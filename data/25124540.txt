JavaFX proved to be really fast for us (internal tools as well). Used to control equipment (live) or do calculations. And we distribute in a &lt;200MB package jre included (modular builds), installs on a fresh windows or linux with no other download. For people that already have a jdk installed, i think we are around 100MB. There has been a lot of work on making &quot;small&quot; distributable java apps in the recent JDKs.')
