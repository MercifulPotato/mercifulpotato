Nor should a company be forced out of business by the effort required to prove illegal act(s) by a competitor.<p>But it&#x27;s not like customers are getting completely screwed by a &quot;competitor&quot; duplicating a product (provided the pricing isn&#x27;t malicious towards the original manufacturer): they&#x27;re getting low prices for presumably reasonable quality goods.')
