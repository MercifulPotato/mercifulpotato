Item(by='_underfl0w_', descendants=None, kids=[25564285], score=None, time=1609190842, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562894, text='&gt; They look uncannily alike to me<p><i>uncannily</i> ?   \nThe images aren&#x27;t exactly high-res, but that&#x27;s definitely two different guys.   \nThe first two photos (color one at the top and b&#x2F;w mugshot pair) are the same guy, but it should hopefully be obvious that the guy in the drivers license photo is someone else. Especially to the police, since we&#x27;re comparing low-res scans while the feds may have had a larger copy potentially in-hand when looking at the guy they arrested.<p>You may just be looking at the wrong photos from the article - in which case yes, that guy looks uncannily like himself!<p>The subtleties of the human face that change from person to person are things like cheekbone position, jawline, head shape, eye shape&#x2F;size&#x2F;placement, etc.   \nThey&#x27;re what enable someone to &quot;recognize&quot; you in a human-to-human context, sometimes even with a facemask on. They&#x27;re part of how you distinguish yourself in the mirror from other humans also.<p>However, if a significant portion of one race is indistinguishable for a given observer, they haven&#x27;t done enough <i>observation</i>. Certainly not enough to arrest someone based on their &quot;observations&quot;. A relative inability to identify facial subtleties in member of other races is a known phenomenon and has been studied - incidentally making it the perfect candidate for law enforcement training. Seems that wasn&#x27;t the case here in TFA, unfortunately.<p>For reference, I am a different race from these guys, and my SO is a different one still, but I don&#x27;t think it takes a particularly keen observer to distinguish between the two mens&#x27; faces.')
