It’s long and the organization is bad but the policy is reasonableish.<p>There’s street cleaning one day a week (year round) 11am-1pm, and you can’t ever park then.<p>It’s a school zone as well; when school is in session you can park for 15 minutes in the afternoon to drop a kid off or for 1 hour to pick the kid up. When school is out you just need to avoid the street cleaning.')
