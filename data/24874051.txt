Tried YTM which just a couple weeks ago lacked many basic features - you couldn&#x27;t go from a song to the album listing or the artist page, you couldn&#x27;t browse albums alphabetically, and many more - now it seems all those missing features are added. It actually looks decent now, so maybe I&#x27;ll consider it in the future - but I&#x27;m already migrated now - they needed up the launch badly.')
