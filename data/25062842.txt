I have done this successfully to get Cat5e everywhere in a house that used to have coax everywhere.  If you do it, I recommend attaching multiple pull strings to the coax, then pulling the coax out, then using one of the new pull strings for the Cat5e - otherwise you risk the Cat5e and the coax becoming detached from one another in the wall.')
