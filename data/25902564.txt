Considering that the grandparent mentioned that their service is actually reliable, I wish they were available here (South Bay, SFBA).<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even had a 50% success rate with the food delivery apps here, there&#x27;s almost always an issue with the delivery. At this point it&#x27;s just a toss as to whether they&#x27;ll deliver according to instructions (drop the package in front of the garage), deliver to another entrance (which is further for the driver), deliver to the neighbor, call for delivery instructions, or even leave it on a fence post.<p>It&#x27;s pretty crazy to think that on top of a 30% cut that they take from the food order, the delivery fees, service fees, tip, and other arbitrary fees (I&#x27;m almost expecting a &quot;fee collection fee&quot; at this point), they can&#x27;t even bother providing good service.')
