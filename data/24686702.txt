I think I never had that much fun from a game that cheap.<p>I also like how the game evolves over time. First you are mainly thinking about how to create specific shapes, while in the end it&#x27;s all about optimization and how to get more output from your &quot;machines&quot;.<p>Love it, clear recommendation!')
