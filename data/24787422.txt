It isn&#x27;t idealistic and it isn&#x27;t designed to prevent human rights abuses. It is designed to prevent nuclear war between SC members. The HRC is not going to prevent or even deter human rights abuses, it never has.<p>The UN isn&#x27;t a world government, isn&#x27;t supposed to be.<p>Basically, the UN is a moot point.
