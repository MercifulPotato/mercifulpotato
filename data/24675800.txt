Or the lobby trying to erase the history claiming than Leonardo Da Vinci, Cervantes and &quot;put your name here&quot; were really from Catalonia. Very sane behavior, for sure.<p>Trust me (or your gut if you prefer). You can find crazy people equally among bilingual, monolingual, translingual and people with just mischieving tongues. Just take a look at how mental asylums are distributed.<p>This is just one of thousands of articles that support a patriotic narrative so are published. Is politics disguised as science. The opposite idea would never reach the journals.')
