I also think we should actively seek to build diverse teams, primarily by more inclusive pipelines. I also agree that it was a long-term disservice to the employee who wasn&#x27;t getting the necessary feedback&#x2F;adjustments, because the CEO wanted to game the system unethically.<p>I just don&#x27;t think we should be biasing our <i>judgments</i> of a person&#x27;s value or competency based on their sex or race though, and unfortunately, I have a few experiences that point to conscious decisions in that direction. I&#x27;m not saying you are making this argument, but if there is an argument that &quot;we need conscious decisions to counterbalance the unconscious biases,&quot; then I really wholeheartedly disagree with that approach. Like you suggested, we&#x27;re not doing people favors when we shield them from honest feedback about their output.')
