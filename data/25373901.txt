Said news story also identifies the causes behind double-voting:<p>1. Delays in inputting data about who had voted in real-time.<p>2. Poll workers overriding machines to submit ballots.<p>Is there any evidence that these things happened at scale during the general? I would expect that poll workers would be better-trained and that the election would be generally smoother than the primary.<p>In addition, that article makes no mention of nursing homes as a particular source of double votes.')
