I actually find the ergonomics of this most comparable to Swift, the difference being that with Swift you get a ton of safety and speed for that trade-off.<p>If your whole stack is JS and you need a little bit of web scraping, this makes sense. If you&#x27;re starting a new scraping project from scratch, I think you&#x27;ll get far further, faster, with Python or Ruby.')
