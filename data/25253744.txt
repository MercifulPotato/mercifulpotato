The implication in this statement is the (plainly true) assumption that from the perspective of a listener, the greater difference a speaker has to their own dialect is what is always meant by &#x27;more&#x27; of an accent.<p>Furthermore, the presence of several dialects does not preclude there being a &#x27;central&#x27; dialect, with &#x27;less&#x27; of an accent, being most easily understood by all- eg the columbus oh &#x27;midland&#x27; accent being the traditional american &#x27;radio standard&#x27; for its neutrality and strong general pronunciation.')
