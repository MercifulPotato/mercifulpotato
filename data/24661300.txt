To quote the BBC <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-52623151" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-52623151</a>:<p>&gt; Around the time of the incident, a number of emergency calls were made, CBS News has reported. In one, a neighbour said a black man was seen at a home under construction. When asked if the man was breaking in, the caller replied &quot;No, it&#x27;s all open, it&#x27;s under construction.&quot;<p>&gt; The owner of the home that was under construction told CNN that, while his CCTV captured four short clips of a man that appeared to be Mr Arbery &quot;trespassing&quot; on his properly on 23 February, he had not reported any crime to the police.<p>&gt; &quot;I don&#x27;t want it to be put out and misused and misinterpreted for people to think that I had accused Mr Arbery of stealing or robbery, because I never did,&quot; he said.<p>&gt; A lawyer for the homeowner later said its their belief that Mr Arbery had been looking for water. Security footage shows he was not the only person to enter the construction site - children from the neighbourhood were also filmed playing at the site.')
