Windows 7 came out <i>11 years</i> ago in October 2009. <i>Mainstream</i> support ended January 2015, which is fine, but those who paid could get support up through January 2020. That’s just over ten years of support - same as Ubuntu LTS (10 versus the regular 5).<p>Not to mention Windows 8 came out in October 2012 (with 8.1 the next year) and Windows 10 came out July 2015. I think it’s reasonable for Microsoft to want people to upgrade within 11 years at least once. Especially since Windows 10’s been out for over five years.')
