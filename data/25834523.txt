Elastic could have released ES as closed source, but they didn&#x27;t, and the OSS ecosystem is better for it. They were hoping to make money off their product, which I don&#x27;t think anyone can fault them for, but instead Amazon came in and took a bunch of that money while not giving anything back.<p>Now Elastic is not happy, and I wouldn&#x27;t be either. As an end user, I&#x27;m grateful the circumstances exist that allow companies to make a living from OSS, and I want to encourage that. AWS is the fly in the ointment there, and I don&#x27;t see how blaming Elastic for not giving us stuff for free any more is anything other than entitled. We should be grateful that ES is OSS at all, and we should want an environment where companies that produce OSS can thrive, instead of blaming them for wanting to get paid for the work that they release freely into the world.<p>Amazon hinders that, period. I don&#x27;t think Elastic is in the wrong here, I think Amazon is.')
