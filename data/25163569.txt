However, Milk Street recipes tend to be simpler, less fussy and more internationally inspired. Everything I have made from them has been an absolute winner. They also have an outstanding high quality TV show free on Youtube. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCpGcoQ4AmidJSpDUXPZoq8A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCpGcoQ4AmidJSpDUXPZoq8A</a>')
