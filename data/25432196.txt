In that case it becomes more complex, you&#x27;d have to overwrite some of the existing buffer with a new mix of both drum samples. The complexity is not worth it for that kind of app.<p>For a simple app like a video player, the audio stream is much more predictable so you can buffer more. Volume changes and pausing can still be applied with no perceivable latency by modifying the existing buffered data [1]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freedesktop.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Software&#x2F;PulseAudio&#x2F;Documentation&#x2F;Developer&#x2F;Rewinding&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freedesktop.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Software&#x2F;PulseAudio&#x2F;Documen...</a>')
