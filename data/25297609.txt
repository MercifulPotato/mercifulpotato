But what about flexibly available when necessary?<p>Also, traditional household provides too little privacy, but living within 10 minutes walking distance is fantastic.<p>There are all these situations like &quot;grandma, I need to go shopping, could you please take care of the kids for about 30 minutes? maybe later if it is more convenient for you&quot; where having good social infrastructure is awesome, and I cannot imagine how more difficult life would be without it.<p>Seems to me that as a society we went from one extreme to the other, skipping over the point where things could work really great.')
