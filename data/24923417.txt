The bottom line is that someone previously using Windows 7 who followed the advice about promptly installing recommended updates would probably now be running Windows 10. To avoid that, you had to know what was going on and actively do something else, and there are plenty of anecdotes of people who tried to do so and still made a mistake somewhere and ended up on 10 when they didn&#x27;t want to.')
