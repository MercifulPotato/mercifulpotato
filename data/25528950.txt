I wish I would have had this a couple of years ago when I was working on improving a very old lossy image compression algorithm.  I don&#x27;t want to into great detail here, but there&#x27;s a highly compressed image format that&#x27;s designed so that it&#x27;s super easy for low power (think 1990&#x27;s embedded processors) to read and render.  Basically the decompression is a bunch of LUTs - not just palette lookups, but also pattern lookups. The hard part is creating the LUTs which can be done on fast computers.<p>As the images we were trying to compress got more detail in them we had to redo the compression algorithm so that we could keep as much detail as possible.  The key was to do the compression in a new color space and then undo the color space transform before we saved the LUTs.<p>I ended up creating an empirical color space that was the best for each tile we were compressing (think PCA), but now that I look at this, it might even do better since the perception is so consistent.')
