Anything that retracts comes with a risk that they get jammed in a retracted position due to rust, dust, debris in the mechanism, maybe heat, etc. Even if it&#x27;s not jammed much, it&#x27;s hard to get leverage on a flush surface, especially when you&#x27;re panicked.<p>I just can&#x27;t see that risk being possibly worth a small aerodynamic efficiency gain.')
