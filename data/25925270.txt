Its all about outside artist architecture, and its amazing. I would define outsider art as something which does intentionally not try to follow the conventional practices of the art form. Incidentally following them is unavoidable as some of these principals are just what makes the most sense in art forms. Like for works of Henry Darger he still incidentally follows a lot of rules of composition, but its clear its not intentional.<p>I was wondering if there are such examples of feats of programming. There is obviously TempleOS, which is even mentioned in the wikipedia page of outsider artists.')
