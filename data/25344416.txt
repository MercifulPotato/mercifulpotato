I know that isn&#x27;t true. It is ridiculous to think so.<p>&gt; (Also, including phrases like &quot;are you stupid&quot; in comments just makes you look foolish)<p>Making statements like &quot;In Europe the risk of having someone greet you with an assault rifle is non-existent, because people just can&#x27;t buy them.&quot; is stupid. Where I live (in the midlands outside of the cities) it is non-existant. In London or Manchester it is probably much higher.<p>Also there is no such thing as an &quot;assault rifle&quot;. I not even into firearms and I know the term is bullshit.')
