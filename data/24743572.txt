They seem irrelevant in our situation - we&#x27;re hiring people to write bug free code that works but is being optimized by someone more senior.<p>One of my favourite is architectural discussions. Tell them how the app is and ask them how they would do it. Show them a screen we plan to make in the app: How would you implement pull to refresh? What about this complex layout here? What about pop up dialogs? How do you prevent the pop up from crashing the app if a phone call comes in here? How would you suggest caching on this kind of screen? Now assume with have an architecture of X, how would you implement a cache within 4 hours without changing the architecture? Okay, on this page we&#x27;d like to take photos and make sure they&#x27;re not tampered with; you can ask help from the back end to verify but keep the workload to a minimum.<p>The good answers will propose a solution. The really good answers will offer some solutions and say which don&#x27;t work and why, and what factors might sway the decision. Acceptable answer is googling and showing the thought process of selecting&#x2F;rejecting that solution.<p>I think the only way to really prepare is to get good at making apps, maybe browse subreddits on the topic.')
