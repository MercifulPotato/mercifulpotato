Are they denying settled science, or just being pragmatic (masks <i>probably</i> help, so even if it&#x27;s not proven, doesn&#x27;t hurt to wear them)?<p>I think the emphasis on wearing masks is simply because that isn&#x27;t the norm in the West. Washing hands <i>is</i> the norm (or rather, should be, we&#x27;ve all been hearing it since childhood...).')
