There is false information out there - that is nothing new - but we&#x27;re in the territory where we are censoring opinions, viewpoints, and non-predominant theory. Is light a particle or wave? Ban everyone who believes X, they are fools and they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to infect others with their heresy.')
