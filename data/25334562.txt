Even if a 529 could not be used to offset taxes lottery winnings, they could just as easily gifted their grandkids that much money, tax free (federally, at least).<p>The only irony here is the fact that the grandparents spend a higher portion of their proceeds on education than the state (probably, every state is different), and still had plenty of money left over for vacations and other fun stuff.<p>The biggest selling point of state lotteries is that the money is is used &quot;for education.&quot;  Califoria is coming under fire for not giving enough of the lottery money to schools, and they only require 1&#x2F;3rd of proceeds to go to education, and allow about 1&#x2F;6th of the proceeds to be used for &quot;administration costs&quot; within the schools.<p>In other words, these people utilizes more of their winnings for education than the state probably did, despite using the majority of the money for non-education-related expenses.  Even though, most lotteries are sold as financing for education.  That&#x27;s what irony looks like.')
