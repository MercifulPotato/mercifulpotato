It was fixed only months ago, so it seems like this is a developing area and if I were on a red team or pen testing, I would play around with more.<p>I visualize the &quot;localhost hole&quot; problem of blindly trusting localhost as an air gap in a pipe (like [0]); anybody could come along and either drop poison in the pipe, or redirect the water coming from the top to their own bucket, or both.<p>I appreciate that Boundary gives completely generic identity-aware-authenticated TCP sockets, but I don&#x27;t know of a way, today, to make those not accessible to browsers through dns rebinding attacks.<p>This is probably much much too far in the weeds and this is unlikely to contribute to a major breach (unlike the aws-vault one where of course attackers would try to access the fake metadata service on the default port, because it&#x27;s high-value and on a well-known port), but I&#x27;m interested in the space.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23265509" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23265509</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;districtsales.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;tru-gap-2.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;districtsales.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;tru-gap-...</a>')
