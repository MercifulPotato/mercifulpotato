As a front end developer who has over the last several years started to adhere to using immutable objects and functional programming in JavaScript and subsequently TypeScript, which doesn&#x27;t matter as much from my point of view. All the bugs that arise in the python tutorials from data mutation and side effects in class methods (looking at you inplace=True in Pandas) is what disturbs me the most about my first exposure to Python.<p>I really hope to start seeing some immutable architecture and structuring in Python more than type checking, as my first impression.')
