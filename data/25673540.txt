For the last five or six years, every work laptop I&#x27;ve had at multiple jobs has sounded like it was trying to take off for a fair amount of the time I was using it.  This is especially annoying during Skype and Zoom calls, since noise reduction makes people&#x27;s voices very loud or soft at random times during meetings.<p>Offhand, I&#x27;ve been blaming Electron and Docker for Mac&#x2F;Windows, but maybe there&#x27;s something more fundamentally wrong?')
