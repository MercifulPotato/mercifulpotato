You couldn&#x27;t refute a single thing I said, the brokers can do something that: I don&#x27;t like, was self-serving, and good for shorts... but was also the least damaging call for retail... all at the same time.<p>It sounds like you&#x27;re taking a bath because you didn&#x27;t respond to the most blatant sell signal I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life and looking at someone to lash out at...<p>Pro tip for next time: If your plan works because people are buying and holding... if they can&#x27;t buy it&#x27;s probably going to go south.<p>It was a lose lose situation, the point of halting buys is to stop the pump... if it didn&#x27;t stop the pump they would have halted the stock.<p>In fact if GME breaks out and doubles again count how long until it gets halted <i>period</i> for an &quot;investigation&quot;.<p>Everyone was playing musical chairs and the music stopped.
