In the US driving is quite a bit different from much of the rest of the world.<p>#1 Driving is a big part of the culture and big cities are often pretty far apart.<p>#2 The electric charging infrastructure sucks. Tesla is seemingly the only network where you can drive 500 miles and be confident when you stop that a charge will actually take 20 minutes.<p>#3 Americans like big ass cars because ???<p>Most of the EV competitors here in the US are small cars and most have ranges which are far lower than Tesla&#x27;s. Even though most people rarely drive more than 50 miles a day, a lot of people are sketchy about getting into a car with 150 mile (320km) range. There are newer cars which are coming out that are closer, but many are either more expensive than the Teslas, have shorter range, or both.<p>And I expect a lot of people are going to buy those non-Tesla options for $60-80,000+, and have a really unpleasant road trip the first time they get out and can&#x27;t find a decent charging station.<p>The result is the Tesla is pretty dominant here for EVs and frankly I don&#x27;t see that changing for some time unless the charging situation changes.')
