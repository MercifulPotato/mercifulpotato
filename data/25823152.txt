Item(by='ocdtrekkie', descendants=None, kids=[25825675], score=None, time=1610986336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823107, text='Sure, but now you&#x27;re diving through an incredibly thick soup: Some of those issues might have been resolved&#x2F;fixed, as closed issues should be. Others might be current issues obscured because the maintainer hates their users and closes issues that are not resolved. Instead of having a clear marker on whether or not an issue is still a problem or not, you have to read the full text of every one.<p>It literally makes &quot;issues&quot; worthless as a tool for anyone but the one dude who has it in their head to do things focused solely on themselves and their needs and ignorant to everyone else.<p>And frankly: Issues is a terrible way to manage your own workload, so doing it harms you <i>and</i> everyone else at the same time. Use a project board or something, there are tools designed for this. Even on GitHub itself, labels and milestones and projects all can be employed to enable reasonable project management... closing user issues without resolving them is definitely not one of them. <i>Seriously, don&#x27;t do this.</i>')
