The OP had already made the point that Linux isn’t really practical. But that doesn’t mean that a micro kernel OS would be any better than GNU&#x2F;Linux. Ultimately you still have the same data stored into RAM (as others have said).<p>What nobody has (yet) mentioned is that micro kernels typically run slower than monolithic kernels because user space &#x2F; kernel space memory swapping is expensive compared to running everything in kernel space. This overhead would kill any performance you might get from a system with the hardware specs of an N64. So a monolithic design is absolutely the way to go (in facts that’s how N64 games are actually written —- one monolithic code base with shared memory).<p>Pragmatically the only way to write software for the N64 is to go bare metal. As the OP said, this Linux port is a fun technical challenge but no OS would be practical (that is unless you’re just using it as a boot loader for other software).')
