Apparently even without any critical thinking or common sense.<p>Many in the West would be shocked, about what an average (educated) Russians could tell them about Navalny .. but all of that is of course propaganda and lies, because Russian people can&#x27;t think for themselves. Fun fact: most people who ever made an effort to contact Russians and get at least some first hand stories about events in Russia, pretty much all found out how unreliable US&#x2F;EU media actually is.<p>But never mind .. if the US or EU end up in ruins one day, and won&#x27;t receive any sympathy, at least it won&#x27;t be hard to see&#x2F;understand why.')
