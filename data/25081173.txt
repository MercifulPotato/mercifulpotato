Yes, part of that is due to familiarity. On the other hand, some of it is inherent due to there being fewer restrictions with open source software.<p>Non-tech people don&#x27;t want (or don&#x27;t know how) to &quot;setup&quot;. The most user-friendly setup won&#x27;t ever beat &quot;no setup&quot; (e.g., macOS).<p>Besides, marketing plays a huge role as well. Ask people to name a few &quot;computer&quot; brands: Apple, Microsoft, Google. No one would name &quot;Linux&quot;. So, it&#x27;s not just that people should be able to buy Linux computers with no setup (Dell is selling them, I think), it&#x27;s also that these kind of computers should get enough marketing so people know about them.')
