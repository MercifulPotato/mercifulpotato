I think the main reason (now that Netflix et al block all VPN IPs) is generally that you gain privacy from your traffic being mixed in with hundreds&#x2F;thousands of other people&#x27;s originating from a single IP. With running your own VPN server, your IP is trivially tracable back to you as an individual. So now what do you get - encrypting vs. your ISP and&#x2F;or country hopping (with no streaming except amazon)?')
