They spent their money lifting people out of poverty while american empire was busy extracting resources from other countries and keeping them <i>in</i> poverty.<p>Note also that I&#x27;m not defending individual policies of the soviet union.<p>EDIT: wanted to tack on: if in 1989 the US and western europe had collapsed and become communist, I wouldn&#x27;t take that as proof -- or a particular reason at all -- that capitalism didn&#x27;t work. That would be idiotic -- we were engaged in a decades-long cold war with another giant power, and lost. I may have separate arguments about capitalism, as I do now, but the collapse has nothing to do with it.<p>Similarly, the collapse of the soviet union has everything to do with trying to eliminate poverty WHILE staring down the barrel of the largest and most powerful empire that&#x27;s ever existed.')
