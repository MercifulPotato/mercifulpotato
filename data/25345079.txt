The feature makes it feel like the sound is actually coming out of the iPhone &#x2F; iPad &#x2F; etc. When you turn your head, the sound source stays the same.<p>Note that the Airpods don&#x27;t actually know where your device is located. It simply sets a &quot;base orientation&quot; when the sound is started. This base orientation is updated when you keep your head in a new position for a longer time (&quot;resetting&quot; the approximated position of your device).')
