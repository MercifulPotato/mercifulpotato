I spent a several years living on $625&#x2F;mo (the residue after alimony and payroll taxes).  And no, I wasn&#x27;t particularly well off to begin with, left with maybe $500K net worth after the split.<p>So, beware.  On the other hand, being poor-ish makes you realize that possession don&#x27;t matter so much after all.  And drinking will pave over a lot of unhappiness.<p>As for sex toys and porn, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> to be said for them.  We might actually be far happier if we reserved man&#x2F;woman sex just for reproduction.  And even then, maybe artificial insemination would be the way to go.<p>One of the best things about the Internet is that one can read literally thousands of tales of relationship woe if one cares to.
