Item(by='Octoth0rpe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610374816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25728975, text='If fully autonomous long haul trucking was buyable today, then it&#x27;d still take 10+ years for it to be phased in. And even then, your 3.5M people number likely includes both long haul and short haul trucking. Short haul is entirely different ballgame. So, a more likely scenario than 3.5M people losing their jobs suddenly is that the trucking industry stops hiring, and mix of short&#x2F;long haul jobs shifts from its current mix to entirely short haul.<p>I&#x27;d also be interested in what the median age range is for truckers. If adoption is sufficiently long term (20 years wouldn&#x27;t surprise me), the economic pain might be surprisingly minimal due to people aging out of the workforce.')
