The building we used to live in did officially originally say the rent would be increased for the next year, but when we told them we weren&#x27;t staying, they pivoted and offered us three extra months for free if we signed on. I&#x27;m not sure if this is evidence for or against your statement that rent isn&#x27;t falling much in New York, but I thought it was an interesting data point.')
