This is a work which extends Bob Nystrom&#x27;s clox (of Crafting Interpeters fame) with a GC idea I&#x27;ve had for some time.  It was inspired by my work with ring buffers and HAMTs.  The basic idea is that by using 3 layers of HAMTs for object handle dereferences, the oldest 2 can be asynchronously consolidated into a new area before being  swapped in, making the GC an O(1) operation.  As all allocations are within a ring, this also gives consolidation.  I&#x27;m hoping this idea could be re-applied outside this proof-of-concept to VMs for more established languages, e.g. the Erlang BEAM VM.<p>Thanks for taking a look!  I&#x27;ll do my best to answer all questions posted here today (though I will be away from my keyboard at times throughout the day).  Also, and after that, please feel free to reach out to me by email.<p>--Dan')
