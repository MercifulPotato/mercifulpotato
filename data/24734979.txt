You&#x27;re making the claim that WHO &#x2F; CDC knew that masks work. So, let&#x27;s see the evidence that you think they had.<p>&gt; If they didn&#x27;t believe that masks worked, why would they do that?<p>Because a healthcare professional stuck in a room with symptomatic people is a different situation to a member of the public walking around.<p>Especially because HCPs are trained to use masks, they use them in combination with other PPE and routine handwashing; their PPE is made to standards and tested to make sure it complies with those standards; HCPs are audited on their use of handwashing and PPE.')
