Item(by='xiaomai', descendants=None, kids=[24740810], score=None, time=1602352460, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24738208, text='I used Arch for several years while Ubuntu was doing annoying stuff like shipping a broken&#x2F;out of date gnome-shell because of Unity.<p>It is soooooooooo nice to be back on Ubuntu. I appreciate the people that like and develop Arch linux (and especially anyone that contributes to the wiki is a true hero), but it&#x27;s not a good distro for your daily driver:<p>1. &quot;immature&quot; packaging.  It&#x27;s crazy to me how much manual intervention is needed during routine package upgrades.  This can be major break-your-system stuff (they have a mailing list for those types of changes so make sure to subscribe), or just stuff that could be done for you but isn&#x27;t (like updating your db during postgres upgrades).<p>2. Tiny official repos.  You&#x27;re going to have to rely on the user-submitted repos for most of your packaging needs.  It&#x27;s cool how easy it is to make a package and submit it to the AUR, but I don&#x27;t love the idea of installing random user-submitted stuff for the bulk of my software needs.<p>3. No debug symbols.  Maybe this doesn&#x27;t affect most people but it is very annoying that there is no (convenient) way to get debug symbols for a package &#x2F;lib.  If a program crashes on you and you want to fix it, the official solution is to rebuild a package (and all its dependencies as necessary) on your own system to get debug symbols.  In contrast, ubuntu&#x2F;fedora&#x2F;etc. will install a debug symbols package for you (automatically, I think) when a program crashes.<p>In terms of learning Linux fundamentals: arch could teach you some things (LFS would be even better--but I wouldn&#x27;t sue either for my daily driver when better options exist.')
