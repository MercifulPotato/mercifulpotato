Hydrow is closer to peloton. They both have instructor led classes. Our content is focused around shorter, intense workouts, in the form of video games, live races, and strength programs. Neither Hydrow or Aviron cater to the avid rower.<p>Our team is much smaller than you think and so celebrity following isn&#x27;t on the roadmap yet - but hopefully one day!<p>We are slightly less expensive than Peloton now, but I wouldn&#x27;t say we are their substitute. They are best in class when it comes to live instructors. We want to be best in class when it comes to high intensity video games, races, and other similar content.')
