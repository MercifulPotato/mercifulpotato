Item(by='brundolf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611941469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25954806, text='Yeah, so the problem here is that the value creation logic is non-deterministic; not only does it depend on hidden state, it doesn&#x27;t even do so predictably because you don&#x27;t know the order in which other threads might interplay. I established three categories of imperative-logic-return-values above:<p>&gt; The return value is either going to pertain to the state before the side-effect, the state after the side-effect, or the side-effect itself. The first two could easily be broken out into pure functions. The third, again, mostly comes down to error reporting.<p>So this definitely falls into category three, which makes the coupling legitimate. It&#x27;s possible I was wrong in my statement that that category &quot;mostly comes down to error reporting&quot;; it was just based on my own past experience.')
