On the one hand, I (probably rationally) didn&#x27;t worry about walking down Fifth Avenue or around the West Village late at night. On the other hand, there were definitely areas of the city where--if the kinda fear that if I screwed up with the metro express stops I&#x27;d be stepping out of the subway into a hail of bullets was not actually the case--I was probably also much safer to avoid certain areas. And something like 42nd Street late at night was pretty awful.')
