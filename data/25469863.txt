Im glad I don&#x27;t have to fight in a war where drones are the norm. When I was in our drones were still very much in the early stages and practical use seemed very far off. There is definitely some serious amount of money for anyone who can field technology to defend tanks, infantry, and artillery from this sort of onslaught.')
