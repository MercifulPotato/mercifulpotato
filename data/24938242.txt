I hate the brittleness of the ecosystem, the &quot;flavor of the month&quot; character, and the explosion of options, there are people who like that setup: small programs that you can plug and play to create your whole stack, I find that tiresome, I prefer big monoliths in which the best options and practices are universally agreed upon.<p>Ah and I hate Typescript, nice idea, but when you spend 30% of your time looking after all those custom types and end up using an &quot;:any&quot; hack to make it work, this leaves a bad taste in your mouth. If I am going to use strong types I would choose an actual strongly-typed language for that, C# is great.')
