Inhibiting COX-2 reduces pain and inflammation.  Inhibiting COX-1 inhibits stomach lining growth and the clotting process.  Pharma has created selective COX-2 inhibitors, but some of those have run into their own problems (blood clots leading to myocardial infarctions in the case of Vioxx patients who weren&#x27;t also on aspirin, IIRC... though, an increase in MIs would seem to be the natural and obvious side effect of intentionally reducing COX-1 inhibition.  IIRC, the increase in MIs was in contrast to the traditional Ibuprofen treatment, not compared to an unmedicated baseline.)')
