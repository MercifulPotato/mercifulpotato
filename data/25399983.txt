Those endless meetings become unproductive pretty fast. I suspect that in big part they become a self sustained cancer used to justify time and salaries of unproductive company members.<p>As for the subject itself: frankly I do not see any advantage of hosting on say Azure over hosting myself. Either requires a good deal of maintenance. And no you can not really rely on Azure doing it for you.<p>Uptime for me is probably just as good on my servers as each one I have in my office also has ready to use up to date shadow copy located elsewhere. Azure is way more expensive of course.<p>The amount of hardware&#x2F;processing power I have on my own server would cost me a fortune to have on Azure. Scalability does not matter much either because:<p><i>I am not Google and do not have to serve the rest of the world</i>.<p>On top of that my servers are usually high performance native C++ applications that can handle thousands of requests per second sustainably and without breaking a sweat.<p>Vertical scalability with modern CPUs and multilevel storage is absolutely insane.')
