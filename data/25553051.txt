The challenge with any form of wind power is that the propulsion doesn&#x27;t typically point forward - it&#x27;s at an angle with a forward component. So on a sailboat you need a long keel (or centerboard&#x2F;daggerboard) to translate the lateral propulsion into forward movement. That constricts the vessel from operating in shallow waters and causes the vessel to lean due to the opposing force under the waterline.')
