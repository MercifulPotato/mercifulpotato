It&#x27;s become so easy for them to cut through freedoms. \nMaybe some measures are needed, even strict ones, but the lack of serious discussion surrounding it is terrifying for me.<p>To give an example, where I live, they instated a nighttime curfew and mask wearing even outdoors. They did this when there were 10.000 cases a day. \nWe now have around 2-3000 cases (majority of them in some areas only) and still have the same measures country-wide.<p>A right is easy to loose and hard to gain back I guess...')
