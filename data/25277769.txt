It seems like driving up profit margins requires convincing people that existing foods are somehow unsuitable, and that &quot;innovative&quot; products are needed.<p>You&#x27;re right, it is a (literal) cut-throat business. But the price of synthetic meat has been falling exponentially [1]. Hopefully it&#x27;ll drop far below traditional meat. This is not a product you&#x27;d want to adopt if you&#x27;re interested in high margins.<p>&gt; I think vegan and ecological sensibilities are being instrumentalized to this end.<p>Organic is a better example. It&#x27;s simply a marketing concept designed to capitalize on the appeal to nature fallacy. It&#x27;s not healthier or cheaper or better for the environment [2].  Veganism is different: it&#x27;s the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rosiebosworth.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;8&#x2F;2&#x2F;price-will-trump-all-as-the-synthetic-meat-train-leaves-the-station" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rosiebosworth.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;8&#x2F;2&#x2F;price-will-trump-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;science-sushi&#x2F;httpblogsscientificamericancomscience-sushi20110718mythbusting-101-organic-farming-conventional-agriculture&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;science-sushi&#x2F;httpblogs...</a>')
