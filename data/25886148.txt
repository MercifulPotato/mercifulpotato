It would have taken a real masochist to compile C with a C++ compiler. I can&#x27;t guarantee that nobody at Apple ever did that, but the suffixes were distinct. In that situation, IDEs usually make the distinction automatically, and it&#x27;s not hard to write Makefiles to invoke the right compiler.')
