So in this particular case, it may be a wash.<p>&gt; But it also guarantees memory ordering that ARM doesn&#x27;t which is a drawback.<p>Yes, I wasn&#x27;t considering the memory model to be part of the instruction set.  I agree that in general this could be a big difference in performance, although I don&#x27;t think it comes up in Daniel&#x27;s example.<p>I added a comment to Daniel&#x27;s blog with my guess as to what&#x27;s happening to cause the observed timings in his example.  Feedback from anyone with better knowledge of M1 would be appreciated.')
