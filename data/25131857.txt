I don’t see anything wrong with this sentence. Replacing the semicolon with a period makes the editor happy, but does not seem like a positive change.<p>&gt; <i>If you see a red highlight, your sentence is so dense and complicated that your readers will get lost trying to follow its meandering, splitting logic — try editing this sentence to remove the red.</i><p>This sentence is highlighted in red, and yet it does not seem dense or complex. Even removing the suffix doesn’t fix the red.<p>This really feels like it’s literally just penalizing you from writing anything other than short sentences. Deleting characters from the end of this makes it turn yellow once i get it to<p>&gt; <i>… follow its meandering, splitting log</i><p>“logi” is red, “log” is yellow.<p>Who is this editor even intended for? What sort of writing would be improved with these automated restrictions?')
