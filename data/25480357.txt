I&#x27;d grown up playing nintendo, sega and PC games and never played the TurboGrafx before.<p>I have to admit, I found it kind of underwhelming. I had no idea about the expansion port though. That&#x27;s actually pretty cool.<p>I know we have raspberry PiS and arduinos and such now, still it&#x27;s too bad consoles don&#x27;t come expecting to be expanded ans hacked.<p>And I have to admit, rondo of blood is my favourite castlevania game. Sadly, the system I have is not Japanese and doesn&#x27;t have the CD attachment so that game is unfortunately not in my collection.')
