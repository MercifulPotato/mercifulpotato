People are extremely uncomfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty. In a variety of circumstances, ranging from the storms another commenter mentioned to your favorite political issue, people will happily make stuff up and believe it rather than accept uncertainty. From a certain perspective it&#x27;s hard to fault this instinct, since true certainty is almost never possible but we still have to make decisions in finite timeframes. If you&#x27;re careful, you can probably catch yourself doing the same thing.')
