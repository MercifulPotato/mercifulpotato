Please, allow me to explain :)<p>When you launch Firefox for the first time, you&#x27;re already being setup and prepared to be served to Google. Your data and more are being primed. The address bar serves as a key-logger, and your inputs (before ever explicitly navigating anywhere) are being sent to Google.<p>Brave&#x27;s ad notifications are opt-in; you have to turn them on. You decide their frequency. They&#x27;re built on privacy. Users in a common region (e.g. United States) share a regional catalog. Your browser downloads a copy of this catalog, studies it locally, and decides when&#x2F;if it should show any of the ads listed therein.<p>When a Brave Ad is displayed, 70% of the revenue goes into a digital wallet. When you see an ad in Firefox, there&#x27;s a good chance you just lost a little bit of your data, and received nothing in return. In Brave, these rewards stack up, and can be passively or actively distributed to the sites and properties you appreciate most online.')
