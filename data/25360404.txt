If NL feels like they already have an effective domestic industry for their needs, there is no need to sign-on and invest resources here.<p>However, for these other countries, they have concerns that are not strictly economic, but also related to national security and economic flexibility.<p>I don&#x27;t know their plans, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a pragmatic solution wouldn&#x27;t be to co-invest in domestic fab facilities with existing incumbents who agree to comply with domestic interests as relates to sourcing, labor practices, IP sharing, local hiring, training, and environment controls.<p>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean &quot;spend money to beat TSMC at the tip of the spear&quot;. I mean, at least, I hope it wouldn&#x27;t. Not at first.')
