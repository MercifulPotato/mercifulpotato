There is a manufacturer that offers an open source based printer that was better than it had any reason to be for less than $300.<p>My printer today looks nothing like the printer I started with, I’ve switched boards, recompiled my own firmware, the whole bit. I was confident in hacking on it for two reasons:<p>1) It was open source based<p>2) Replacement parts are inexpensive<p>I originally started with a Makerbot 2X which was closed source and $2500 (8+ years ago). Mind you, I didn’t have one at home- we had a couple at work for prototyping.<p>The slicing software was atrocious, the ability to fix it was hampered by what parts they sold, and the replacement parts were generally very expensive.<p>My $250 printer was better in every objective measure out of the box than the MakerBot was after years of practice and tuning.<p>This year my friend’s 2X died and a replacement motherboard was going to be almost as much as the cost of my printer new so he just gave it to me and bought a new printer.<p>With my newfound confidence from my “cheap” printer, I gutted the 2X and installed an open source motherboard and completely rewired it.<p>It all started with a printer good enough to be liked by the community and open enough to be modifiable.')
