But those are usually in the context of an employer, and I generally draw a line between work-use and personal-use.

If you&#x27;re in Texas, Central Market is a perfect alternative to Whole Foods. I have Arlo cameras instead of Ring, which is owned by Netgear (not that home cameras are exactly essential). You&#x27;re right that IMDB and Twitch don&#x27;t have great alternatives, though you can get a lot out of both of those without spending any money. I didn&#x27;t realize they let other companies use their shipping network, which is a more complicated case.<p>Still, even just foregoing the name-brand services sends a signal.
