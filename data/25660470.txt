In 2019, I interviewed at Google, FB, and Microsoft.  Each featured multiple System Design rounds and only one of two at FB was not very good.  While the others were very interesting and interactive, the not so good one at FB was run by someone fairly junior who clearly didn&#x27;t have much practical experience in designing complete systems, so it felt very one-sided and me constantly feeling like I was being patronizing since the lack of feedback really felt like lack of understanding.')
