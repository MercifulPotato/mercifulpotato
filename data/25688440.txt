Very surreal in some ways.<p>That being said, identifying that the support for Trump is about 50&#x2F;50 does not _really_ tell the right story here with thedonald.win -- this isn&#x27;t a representative of the ~half of us in the US who voted for Trump (or would if we voted)...it&#x27;s a representation of a small, extreme culture, part real and part just trolling.<p>I doubt OP would have apologized quite so hard for watching Fox News. Fox News&#x27;s editorial content is somewhat to the right of the average Republican voter, but not by nearly as much as thedonald.win -- that&#x27;s something that represents mainstream Trump voter (aka Republican voter) worldview.')
