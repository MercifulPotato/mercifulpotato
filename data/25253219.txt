If they subsequently move to the US and adopt rhotacism, are they now having &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; accent?<p>I think the issue is explained quite nicely here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20081008000501&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;linguist.emich.edu&#x2F;ask-ling&#x2F;accent.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20081008000501&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;linguist.e...</a>')
