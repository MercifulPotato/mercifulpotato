Right now, there&#x27;s a whole lot of problem with scaling for distributed ledgers.  Big markets do 20M trades per day-- and that&#x27;s just across the market itself..  This is like 50k TPS average (not peak) across a trading day; some distributed ledgers do better but compare to several transactions per second across Bitcoin and a few thousand TPS per second for most performance-oriented ledgers.<p>You might also not want to have a public ledger of all the ownership interests.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t exactly solve the problem.  You still have the prospect of double spend, etc, until commitment&#x2F;ledger settlement.  And for high stakes transaction you probably want humans in the loop talking about what to do when these things happen instead of some automated policy.')
