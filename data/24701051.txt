The moment once the horizon is crossed, there is no escape. The observer will find himself inside an ever shrinking “universe” of dust everywhere.</i><p>Makes me wonder. We used to believe that it&#x27;s possible for our universe to eventually collapse, reversing the Big Bang in a Big Crunch. From what I recall, current evidence points against it, but if we were to live in such a universe doomed to a collapse - wouldn&#x27;t that mean we&#x27;d be living in a universe-sized black hole?<p>(A black metahole if you like.)')
