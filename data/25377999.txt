Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607631377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25377755, text='I&#x27;m sure they might not have had silver spoons, but maxing out your credit cards is a luxury that people have when they don&#x27;t have families to support (not to mention moving to SF).  I&#x27;m not just referring to your own children, but if you have parents that need help, or siblings that need help.<p>For example, if I was in these 3 gentlemen&#x27;s shoes, I would have not maxed out my credit cards, because my parents were entering their 50s and they didn&#x27;t have gold plated health insurance from government or a F500 company, so I knew I had to play it safe and be ready to be there if and when they need me for assistance with healthcare expenses.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to detract from any of their achievements, surely they put forth effort into getting into the right schools, studying the right subjects, and focusing their energy on something that netted them a very high ROI.<p>The purpose of my comment was to shine a light on how being in a position to max out credit cards in SF in the first place without greatly negatively altering your family&#x27;s trajectory qualifies you as &quot;normal&quot; in a very restricted sense of the word &quot;normal&quot;.')
