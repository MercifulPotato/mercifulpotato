I hear more and more hand-wringing that conspiracy theories needs to somehow be addressed.<p>And it&#x27;s annoying that given how complex the situation is, and how little transparency in the market there is, we think that one narrative by authorities should be taken at face value.<p>If you truly dislike conspiratorial thinking, then it seems the best possible reaction is to reply calmly explaining to the conspiratorialists what happened and buttressing counter-claims of the skepticism where it exists.')
