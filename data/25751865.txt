Knowing your neighbors means you, if you&#x27;re unable to go up&#x2F;down the stairs for whatever reason, are not totally alone for days or weeks while infrastructure is restored. Based on going through hurricanes in the US South, it&#x27;s usually been better to know other people than to believe you&#x27;re truly self-reliant.')
