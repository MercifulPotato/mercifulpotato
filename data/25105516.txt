You worked alone, you did not build the product for one specific client and you did not succeed in building relationships with potential clients.<p>Sure, social anxiety might be part of the reason. But I think the biggest contributor to your lack of success was that you did not have a team around you to build the product. With a team, I&#x27;m sure you would have found it much more acceptable to cold email people and just feel no shame basically promoting the product.<p>But that&#x27;s one part of the whole picture. Sometimes, I guess, you just have to admit that people don&#x27;t want to buy your product. Maybe it&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t know how to market it or maybe it just doesn&#x27;t provide that much value.<p>I wish Jos√© best of luck to future endeavors and I recommend getting to know other start-up oriented people. Possibly salespersons. To start your next project. Don&#x27;t get discouraged, that&#x27;s my advice. With the right people in your team, I&#x27;m positive you can succeed.')
