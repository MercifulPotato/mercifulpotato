This is fine, it&#x27;s his turf and he can chuck me or anyone else out whenever he feels like it.<p>Since people here think Twitter is in the wrong, my question is when do I get these protections on HN? Do I have to implement them on forums I run? How big does a company have to get before they have to implement these protections? Who oversees and enforces these things? How is &quot;big&quot; defined anyway? After all, HN is already bigger than Twitter was at some point. Do we use MAUs, DAUs? Number of words&#x2F;day, etc?')
