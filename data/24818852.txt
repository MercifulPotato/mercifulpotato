In this case, I justify it on the grounds that I usually travel a lot and, especially in the spring, the lawn does need to get cut regularly. But I just get it done every two weeks. That&#x27;s on the long side in the spring but it works for me.<p>More of a luxury for me is having a housekeeper once a month although it&#x27;s nice to have someone give the house a good cleaning now and then. It&#x27;s <i>totally</i> unnecessary with me not traveling at the moment but I wouldn&#x27;t feel right about canceling them.')
