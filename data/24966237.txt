Checking it would solve the halting problem. And this predicate is the proof of Rice theorem.[1] (Granted, this may require some sufficiently powerful logic such as first order, not sure if this proof applies to LiquidHaskell.)<p>In practice, I think reasonably intuitive properties are already very difficult to formalize in refinement types.')
