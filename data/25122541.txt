I created a DNS wildcard certificate for a subdomain I own and use it for all my internal domains. A great way to get HTTPS on non-public networks.<p>HTTP over VPN is still weaker than HTTPS over VPN. For example HTTPS also handles authentication which HTTP doesn&#x27;t. If you&#x27;re outside of your VPN, a MitM could redirect you to <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;my-internal-domain.example" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;my-internal-domain.example</a> and resolve its DNS to an attacker&#x27;s website. Your browser would not understand the difference between this and your actual website in your VPN. It would send all the site&#x27;s cookies to the evil website, and if Service Workers[1] worked over HTTP, this would actually be a way to completely compromise an internal HTTP website. So it&#x27;s important not to whitelist such HTTP sites as if they&#x27;re secure.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;API&#x2F;Service_Worker_API" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;API&#x2F;Service_Wor...</a>')
