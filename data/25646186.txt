Item(by='BlueTemplar', descendants=None, kids=[25647617], score=None, time=1609858830, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644977, text='&gt; ciaLAB is not state of the art though in perceptually uniform colorspaces.<p>Which <i>are</i> state of the art ?<p>&gt; 1. It brings in perceptually uniform colorspaces to the discussion, while it&#x27;s completely unnecessary. Perceptually uniform colorspaces are mostly unsuitable for arithmetic on colors like any other non-linear colorspace.<p>I don&#x27;t get what you mean, linearity (dL&#x27;star&#x27;) being defined wrt perceptual uniformity, isn&#x27;t CIELAB 76 linear by definition (to an approximation) ?? And color arithmetic pretty much by definition implies dealing with distances and angles in a perceptually uniform color space, doesn&#x27;t it ??<p>(I would <i>really</i> like to know, since it actually is the very topic of &#x27;practical work&#x27; that we have to do for mid-January. We were told to do the transformations to CIELAB 76 and, after the modifications, back to sRGB, using the D65 illuminant.)<p>Otherwise, I didn&#x27;t mention the finer details about CRT transfer functions because it didn&#x27;t seem to be relevant enough.<p>&gt; This is the most widespread bug in computer color and you don&#x27;t need the history of CRTs to do that, and in fact this has nothing to do with perceptually uniform colorspaces.<p>Yeah, I know, and while just doing this kind of transformation might be just good enough for the most common color arithmetic, is it really good enough for <i>all</i> use cases ?  \nTo take an example from our practical work, seeing this kind of effect :<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Impression,_Sunrise#Luminance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Impression,_Sunrise#Luminance</a><p>You know what, I think I&#x27;m going to try and do this practical work in two versions, one using just linear sRGB (and back). I&#x27;ll see if I get noticeable differences. But that will have to wait a week or so, I&#x27;m too busy searching for internships right now (and have already spent too much time in this discussion...)')
