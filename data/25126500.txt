It can therefore only represent the first 65536 characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).<p>UTF-16 allows representing characters outside of the BMP by using a reserved area to split a single codepoint into two surrogates that form a pair.<p>This makes UTF-16 complicated and in some ways worse than UTF-8: the encoding is longer for many typical texts, but is still not fixed-width. The bug you typically see is that codepoints outside of the BMP are munged when clipping the text to a certain length (or reversing it, but that doesn&#x27;t happen in real systems generally.)')
