Can&#x27;t recommend them highly enough and their free tier is amazing for a solo-person.<p>For forming a habit 1) live tracking is essential and 2) make it as easy on yourself as possible. What I learned after many years is that the level of granularity I actually care about is at the project basis and not the task basis, so just logging stuff to big buckets, not sweating if it&#x27;s off by 5-10 minutes, and trying as hard as possible to always be logging. I almost exclusively only log time when I&#x27;m on my laptop which makes it easier to not forget.')
