Item(by='tines', descendants=None, kids=[25303764], score=None, time=1607096513, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25302527, text='&gt; The crucial feature of the initial market is that it exist.<p>Should &quot;exist&quot; be replaced with &quot;exists&quot; in this sentence? If you wanted to use &quot;exist&quot; I think you&#x27;d have to use a helper verb like &quot;should [exist]&quot;. Is there a name for the grammatical feature where someone omits the &quot;should&quot; and uses the conjugation that would go with it?')
