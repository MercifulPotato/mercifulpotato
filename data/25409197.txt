I have to say I&#x27;m shocked how obvious the PR has been for some of this stuff.<p>A favorite example is the Iraq war. Clearly a mafioso protection racket type of move. Nice country you got here, quit using Dollars and see what happens...<p>The 1970s in can be almost explained in the sense of a 1930s style run on the bank, except this time it&#x27;s allies and foreign countries after their gold. \nThe Saudi benefit from attacking Iraq probably even mirrored what France thought it was getting in &quot;French Indonesia and French Vietnam&quot;. You can almost imagine a scene playing out between French and U.S. diplomats where the French ask for their gold and the U.S. goes, &quot;well... here&#x27;s the thing about your gold, tell you what let us call it even and we will spend a decade or more at war for you?
