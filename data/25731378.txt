At the federal level, where I have personal experience, it seems like it&#x27;s entirely retribution instead of rehabilitation.<p>I was in a federal prison camp and it is primarily an exercise in leisure. The entire day was composed of well.. nothing. If you like reading, fresh air, and exercise you&#x27;re in luck. If you like alcohol, drugs, and facetime you&#x27;re in luck. There is very little programming activity to do. If you have the funds to support yourself you can get anything you want from the outside. You can have any book sent in or buy an illicit cell phone. There are so few guards to watch you and very little motivation to crack down on rampant offenses.<p>The First Step Act is supposed to make programming uniform across all institutions and reward programming with sentence reductions. That&#x27;s a fantastic idea and I hope that it works out well. There are very few levels to pull to incentivize people, but that should provide motivation.<p>The problem after that is the stigma that follows you around forever. I count myself blessed to have opportunities when I came home. It was unpleasant to work as a laborer in block masonry, but it lead me back to the shipyard. That has lead me to a better opportunity in the shipyard. This was only afforded to me because I went to a university with name recognition in a field with job prospects. That combined with my previous maritime experience is the only reason I&#x27;m not still day laboring will praying for a better opportunity. If you have limited work experience and were accustomed to a high(er) level of living before incarceration it will be difficult to adjust to life after prison.<p>There are so many thorny issues with the judicial system in the USA that reach into so many aspects of life.')
