Just write exactly that quote of your comment and post it as the rules of your chat server&#x2F;conference&#x2F;etc. It&#x27;s simple. All the multiple pages of CoCs for everything these days is just an argument waiting to happen. What is and isn&#x27;t racist, sexist, mean, etc. multiple people aren&#x27;t going to agree on.<p>Just write in the rules, don&#x27;t be a jerk, I and the mods&#x2F;admins&#x2F;volunteers decide who is and isn&#x27;t a jerk. Done. Why do you need a CoC? With a CoC you are begging for this kind of trouble. Eventually someone will performatively complain that your CoC isn&#x27;t enough. You can&#x27;t just have a code of conduct now you need a Covenant of Conduct or some other thing. And you didn&#x27;t include this ism and that phobia you only mentioned sexism and racism and you&#x27;re not being intersectional enough and this is exactly why tech isn&#x27;t diverse, blah blah blah. Why open yourself up to this at all?')
