Item(by='verdverm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610002688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25667676, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.builder.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.builder.io&#x2F;</a> can drop into existing websites, static and framework. Pretty cool stuff, though unfortunately the interesting part is closed source. You can request the page once from their API and then save it for serving (rather than using their default method &#x2F; setup).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapesjs.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapesjs.com</a> is an open source option, but will require some investment to get it working for your situation.<p>There is also Wordpress, Squarespace, and Webflow. Webflow has a CMS section. Netlify has some options here too, CMS system with a web UI.<p>I personally use Hugo (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gohugo.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gohugo.io</a>) and Webflow. Planning to use something with grapes+hugo to replace webflow.')
