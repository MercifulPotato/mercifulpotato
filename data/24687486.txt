Yes, in aggregate the costs are higher than each individual charge, and that works out at some visible % of your revenue, but it seems like all the things we&#x27;ve mentioned so far are necessary (inspections and such, I don&#x27;t know what a &quot;municipal bond&quot; is). I&#x27;d be genuiently interested in hearing people&#x27;s ideas to lower those costs though, as I am sure many business owners might be.<p>However, it seems like lowering the costs by allowing businesses to skip certain currently required things (at least of the ones mentioned) isn&#x27;t going to work, as I said before, unmaintained air conditioning is dangerous (I know of at least one case where it tragically killed most of a family in a hotel, and it can make you generally sick <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patch.com&#x2F;california&#x2F;saratoga&#x2F;dangers-badly-maintained-air-conditioners-0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patch.com&#x2F;california&#x2F;saratoga&#x2F;dangers-badly-maintain...</a>) and it doesn&#x27;t take much to imagine how badly maintained electrics could be a problem.<p>Given that we can&#x27;t rely on some people to maintain these things (even if they are trying to do it right) without checking up on them, and because we don&#x27;t know who those people are in advance means we need to check up on everyone. It seems to me that this is just the cost of doing business, and let&#x27;s face it, lots of businesses are still going despite the costs involved.<p>If you&#x27;ve got some examples of unecessary or silly things costs that governments impose on shops&#x2F;cafes&#x2F;businesses then I&#x27;m all ears but so far I&#x27;ve not heard any.')
