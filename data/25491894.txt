From my perspective it&#x27;s hard to differ between those because I think a lot of what makes the &quot;reactibility of a person&quot; is intertwined and feels like a really complicated maze that needs exploration to find a potential solution.<p>The problem is though, that when you try to explore &quot;this maze&quot; in a situation; usually people get very upset for me behaving not in an appropriate manner. So I guess that it&#x27;s very hard to figure out when these exploration parts are appropriate; and when they are not.<p>&gt; leaving them susceptible to being tricked, or unable to pick up on, say, whether or not a person is interested in dating them.<p>A lot of times in life people tend to exploit your character; and even when you realize it&#x27;s just friendship or a distanciated acquaintance relationship the hard part is still saying no when people ask for your help. Oh so often you help them; and when you need their help once for a little thing like helping you to move something around - years later - they&#x27;re suddenly not your friends anymore.<p>I often think that what keeps my sanity intact is &quot;keeping a score&quot; subconsciously... how often I helped or made space for somebody; and how often they did. While this is the jerk part to other people; it&#x27;s a necessity for me to not get exploited by others again.')
