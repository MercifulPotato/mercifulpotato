We almost always keep our cameras off during the meetings, but still video conference allows us to share the screen easily, which is immensely helpful (for IT people at least). Over a phone you can&#x27;t copy&amp;paste, you can&#x27;t share screens, you can&#x27;t draw on the screen, it&#x27;s way more limiting')
