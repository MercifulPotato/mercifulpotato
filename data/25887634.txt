(I also wanted a succinct example to post on the forum that people might be familiar with.) Please do share counter examples, as I&#x27;m genuinely interested.<p>One of the more complicated things I&#x27;ve had to do was  parseBest as part of DateTimeFormatter, which takes a TemporalQuery as an argument. It has a solution like this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clojurians-log.clojureverse.org&#x2F;clojure&#x2F;2019-09-06&#x2F;1567785740.204500" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clojurians-log.clojureverse.org&#x2F;clojure&#x2F;2019-09-06&#x2F;1...</a><p>I&#x27;ve also worked with JDBC libraries to wrap driver-specific features. JDBC drivers have been around for a long time, and driver-specific stuff can vary in how well it&#x27;s designed. I&#x27;ve also used jna through Java from Clojure when I was just starting out, which wasn&#x27;t all that hard for a newbie to the language.<p>From your comments in other Clojure-related threads we&#x27;ve participated in, it sounds like your experience is much different from mine, but often lacks in specific examples. Without seeing those, it&#x27;s hard to know what you&#x27;re describing. If you think Clojure isn&#x27;t the bees knees, that&#x27;s perfectly fine. I think readers would benefit from knowing specifics of what you&#x27;ve found frustrating.')
