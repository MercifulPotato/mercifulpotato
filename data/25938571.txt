Although the narrative being spun on WallStreetBets and co wants you to believe in a short squeeze, it doesn&#x27;t seem like any shorts were actually squeezed. This morning, Melvin Capital and Citron successfully exited their positions in Gamestop. Had there been a true squeeze, the whole point would have been to prevent an easy exit and force them to cause the price to balloon out of control. By exiting, they&#x27;ve proven that although shorts were obviously hurt a lot, the fabled squeeze never came.

It&#x27;s the latest Bitcoin and no one wants to miss out.')
