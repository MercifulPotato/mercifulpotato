Mostly for storage plus some side projects. I only had a little time for server maintenance and I ended up redoing the whole server every time a disk failed. I was using just regular desktop grade disks so that happened every 18 months or so.<p>This all changed when I started using ZFS. Not only it has support for raidz and mirroring (which I could get with LVM too) but it is tweekable and tunable easily. Plus commands like _zpool status_ will give you a great overview of the health of the array in no time. It might seem like nothing but it makes all the difference for me.<p>I can recommand for everybody running a (home) server. It will save you lots of time.')
