Item(by='Boulth6', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608233666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25454567, text='&gt; Hopefully they&#x27;ll also build something like Keybase&#x27;s proof integration <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;book.keybase.io&#x2F;guides&#x2F;proof-integration-guide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;book.keybase.io&#x2F;guides&#x2F;proof-integration-guide</a> as well.<p>As far as I&#x27;ve seen the proof integration is used only for Mastodon insurances and Keyoxide supports all of them by default: no need to ask for permission, no weird conditions to enter like, instance has to be bigger than N people.<p>I see this as a way to control who gets into Keybase. A perfect example of centralized control. The idea of programmable proofs looks good though.<p>&gt; If you have any suggestions as to which E2E (group) messaging+fileshare+git platform I could use as a replacement for Keybase I&#x27;m all ears.<p>Sadly I won&#x27;t help you with that. There are a number of services that want to eat Keybase&#x27;s cake now but neither of them hits all points on my scale. So I&#x27;m using mostly several different services to get a semblance of the Keybase experience.')
