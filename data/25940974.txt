Good federation does the same thing.</i><p>I think this completely misses Daniel&#x27;s point. He&#x27;s not talking about centralization.<p>Discovery is based on network effect and network effect alone: that can be present in a centralized &#x2F; federated &#x2F; decentralized system; the only question is which of these systems <i>currently</i> owns the network effect.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s inarguably Github.<p>One could argue that curl has a bit enough following that they &quot;use their influence for good&quot; that&#x27;s a different prerogative based question.<p>&gt; <i>But agreeing on a platform takes longer, so might as well build up some alternatives now.</i><p>Alternatives are easy to find, and perhaps more importantly, they come and go. If you&#x27;re not planning on migrating immediately, looking at the current set of alternatives is a waste of time; they may change.')
