Radar is a joke and Apple clearly doesn&#x27;t take public bug reporting seriously.<p>Meanwhile, Microsoft has a Github repository asking every day developers &quot;what about Windows gets in your way of development?&quot; and all issues are responded to personally by the Microsoft team and they have addressed quite a few long-standing issues people have in the OS in the form of automatic updates.<p>I logged a Radar with Apple about 3-4 years ago (maybe longer) about an API failure about their recycle bin. I&#x27;ve followed up, pinged them, etc. No response.<p>I don&#x27;t like either company overall, but Microsoft really has been trying on this front, and it seems to be paying off. Apple is decades behind (it feels like the savannah days, if savannah were completely behind closed gates).')
