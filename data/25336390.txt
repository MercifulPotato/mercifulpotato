A range hood that recirculates? I didn&#x27;t know that was even a thing. Must have a very powerful HEPA filter in there or something; not sure how safe I would feel with that.<p>I suppose I&#x27;ll just be more proactive using my indoor air monitor when cooking; albeit it&#x27;s hard to know for sure. The monitor always shows a non trivial ambient level of VOCs; so it&#x27;s hard to know what is safe, what is from cooking, what can be prevented, etc..')
