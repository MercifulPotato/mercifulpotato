That&#x27;s all.  It has nothing to do with &quot;specificity&quot; as often explained by others.  If the listener&#x2F;reader doesn&#x27;t know typically they will be triggered to ask.<p>- The indefinite article is a signal to the listener&#x2F;reader that they don&#x27;t have to know or care about &quot;which X&quot;.  It will trigger a listener&#x2F;reader not to ask or wonder.<p>- Proper nouns don&#x27;t take articles because usually the question &quot;which John?&quot;, for example, isn&#x27;t a concern.')
