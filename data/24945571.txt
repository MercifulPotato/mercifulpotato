I actually signed up for the Believer plan.  I&#x27;ve since switched to Obsidian though.  I was finding that Roam became very slow and laggy once documents started to get pretty long.  It started to hinder my note taking rather than help.  One simple example was how the cursor doesn&#x27;t focus when jumping to a new document.  That always really bugged me and despite bringing it up it was never fixed.  They seemed to prioritize other things like Pomodoro timer for some reason.<p>Maybe these things are fixed now and maybe I&#x27;ll try it out again one day but Obsidian has been great for me.  My files are local so it&#x27;s fast.  I also have them backed up via Dropbox and because of that I can view&#x2F;edit on my phone. \n Previously I used Atom for my note taking so this is very similar but now I have the additional benefits of linked documents and attachments and templates and so on.')
