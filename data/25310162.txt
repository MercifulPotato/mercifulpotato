The mileage is amazing but so is sitting in your car with the AC or heat running while the engine is off. It was also amazing when I left an interior light on while I was camping and ran my 12v battery dead; press a button to recharge.<p>I do pause at the thought of an all electric because I want to be able to do the long road trips we have in the U.S. I&#x27;m willing, however, to spend 30 minutes at stops every few hundred miles, when there are enough of them (which is very nearly now). Range is getting close to what I would need. Say, 300 miles per charge with an 80% charge on a fast charger in 30m. Looks like Tesla already beats that, at least on paper.')
