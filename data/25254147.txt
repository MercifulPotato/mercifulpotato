That would put you on the 45% tax in my country so you&#x27;d have to make 131k to be left with 72k after tax.  Maybe +30k to live on, assuming you commute out of the city.  So OP should be on something above 161k.<p>In the US the OP would be in the top 3% of earners, top 4% in the UK.  Even if you are in the top few percent you still have to spend most of your life working to be &#x27;free&#x27; for a bit at the end of it.<p>Of course if you are inside the top 1% you could probably get away with a 10-15 year sentence.  Where the average wage is generally life with a few years of poverty like freedom at the end.')
