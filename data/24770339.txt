If loans are 2% instead of 4% then that may induce people to take one up to do some kind of economic activity (start business, renovate house, buy a new car, etc).<p>But it is not guarantee: people may feel too financial vulnerable to take risks with borrowed money. This is where the limits of <i>monetary</i> policy are run it.<p>There are points where the government starts spending on various projects: if a contractor is hired to build a bridge, and it will take &quot;x&quot; years, then all of its employees may feel more confident and do more spending because for the next &quot;x&quot; years they&#x27;re set. Their money then goes into other people&#x27;s pockets, into other people&#x27;s pockets, etc.<p>Public&#x2F;government spending to kickstart demand is what Keynesian economics basically is.')
