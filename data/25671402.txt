Because as much as I hate that Facebook bought them, they&#x27;re part of what I would call &quot;critical social infrastructure.&quot;<p>No such thing as &quot;critical social infrastructure.&quot; Could you live without whatsapp? Yes. Then by definition it is not critical.<p>&gt; Asking to leave WhatsApp is like cancelling your contract with your ISP and going offline just because you don&#x27;t like the company.<p>Not at all. Some areas in the US don&#x27;t have choice of what ISP they can use, but you have many good choices for messaging apps.<p>I am growing tiresome of people complaining (on HN, of all places) about how evil facebook and google are but will not go as far as cancelling facebook or using duckduckgo for search, or protonmail for email.<p>Folks, if you are not happy, you have choices and they are free and very convenient. The services you complain about using for free are not the problem, you&#x27;re just lazy.<p>EDIT - you folks in the replies are basically proving my point. Instead of taking ownership over the freedom of choice that you have, you would rather make excuses to justify lack of initiative. That&#x27;s not a healthy or happy frame of mind to box yourself in, and it gives too much of your emotional influence to the platforms. Like you folks are seriously comparing a messaging app to ISPs and heating in london...really?  Give me a break, snowflake.')
