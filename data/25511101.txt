However, it&#x27;s unlikely that humans will ever overcome their greatest enemy, themselves. Such a utopian fantasy is still hard to take in for most people, while it&#x27;s much easier to imagine things going to shit and degenerating to a cyberpunk dystopia. Humans make the technology and so technology will never be the answer to solving human nature.')
