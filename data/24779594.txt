As white guy, u benefit basically everywhere. Know who doesn&#x27;t?  Women. Know where they have more benefits than in the US?  Almost everywhere. Why should we stay and fight something that us so obviously unbalanced when we can walk away and let it burn behind us?  How is that my responsibility?  Or my wife&#x27;s?  Or my daughter&#x27;s?  We&#x27;ve built a world that&#x27;s so obviously not for them, that thinms they&#x27;re literally thought if as incapable of making decsions for themselves, that have no chance to come out ahead (rare exceptions do not make the rule).  Even worse if you&#x27;re a woman of color. It&#x27;s not &quot;uncomfortable,&quot; as your condescending response claims, it&#x27;s fucking dangerous. That you can&#x27;t see that indicates that your pedestal is too high.<p>Let it fail. After the fires are out and it&#x27;s time to rebuild, I&#x27;ll lend a hand. Until then, good luck. I&#x27;m done with this mess.')
