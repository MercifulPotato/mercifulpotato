When it comes to Cubensis, it&#x27;s commonly found in the places you mention. I think the &quot;myth&quot; you mention, is about Liberty Cap (Psilocybe semilanceata) which you can find basically anywhere in the northern hemisphere, very common all over Europe. While Liberty Caps don&#x27;t directly grow in the dung, they do love cow and sheep pastures and is more commonly found there. If you&#x27;re an adult, never experienced psychedelic drugs before but would like to, and live in Europe, try looking for Liberty Caps in a nearby pasture once temperatures went down to between 0-10 degrees. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find some.')
