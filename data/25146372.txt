Cool. Glad you agree!<p>Nope. Not at all. It isn&#x27;t cheaper to the consumer. You keep on conflating <i>revenue share</i> between who owns the store and the dev, with the amount the customer pays at the checkout.<p>&gt; Cheaper is cheaper. Thats all that I care about. I care about the end result of lower fees.<p>That won&#x27;t be the end result as I have already explained.<p>&gt; It is representative of Apple actions unfairly causing prices to be higher for this specific competitor is being kept out though!<p>No it isn&#x27;t. Prices aren&#x27;t higher. You keep on conflating the price to the end user with the revenue share. They are not the same thing.<p>Even on revenue split everyone except for EPIC (<i>which are buying their way in) are about the same in their respective stores.<p>&gt; All I need is a single example, to show that Apple&#x27;s actions have prevented a lower priced option from competing.<p>You are the not the arbiter of what is a valid example. I&#x27;ve already explained why in a previous comment why one example isn&#x27;t representative of a whole, you chose to ignore it. That is on you and not I.<p>&gt; Nope! Because their actions are illegally anti-competitive, and Apple has significant market power.<p></i>If* it is proven so in court than I may agree with you. IIRC the case is still ongoing. Your opinion isn&#x27;t a fact. Google have significant market power, Steam has it, Microsoft has it (to a lesser extent). You keep on pretending that there is only one phone manufacturer on the market. All of this is nonsense.<p>&gt; Regardless if game devs agreed to the contract, the contract can still be illegally anti-competitive. And the law can be used against Apple on that.<p>We will see if that is the case in court.<p>&gt; And even further more, I still want any and all actions to be taken, through whatever means possible, whether they be through the existing laws&#x2F;court system, or that is through changing the law to retroactively target Apple and its employees, or if it through game devs working together to oppose apple, so as to make the game companies get more of the money, and for Apple to receive less of it, no matter how it happens.<p>You want the market to be legislated because you don&#x27;t like Apple. How foolish.<p>If people argued from the fact that there should be able to sideload applications. Then I maybe inclined to agree with you.<p>I suspect the conversation from here on out will be a waste of time because you keep on selectively ignoring caveats to your arguments.')
