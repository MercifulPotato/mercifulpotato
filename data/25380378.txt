But that&#x27;s a bit off topic.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s crazy seeing good news sources not available to the general public freely.&quot;<p>Why is this crazy? This has been the norm. Want a newspaper? Have to buy one. Radio and TV emerged as a news source and are still &quot;free&quot; today. Quality papers on the internet have typically been paywalled all the time (think Elsevier etc).<p>I don&#x27;t think Facebook is a major news source for everyone. I see local stuff come up often, but it&#x27;s not the stuff that would typically make the papers. I don&#x27;t see very much national stuff come up on Facebook. When it does, it&#x27;s usually low quality,  one sided, stuff that someone is using to support a political opinion.')
