For instance, we could use the AlphaFold-predicted structure to do protein-ligand binding calculations for a bunch of known molecules. If these calculations agree with experimental protein-ligand binding (which they generally do for proteins with known structures), then we can say with high confidence that we&#x27;ve got a good structure.')
