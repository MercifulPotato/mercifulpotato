Item(by='kebman', descendants=None, kids=[25930526], score=None, time=1611765452, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25930130, text='I&#x27;d love some insight in how this industry works. I know there&#x27;s some shops that literally do woodworking and upholstry for that bespoke furniture, but as far as I know, most of it is designed for industry production and mass produced. And indeed, if it&#x27;s one thing IKEA is doing, it&#x27;s exactly design for mass production at scale, but the quality is not super-high, perhaps even intentionally.<p>I think, when it comes down to it, lots of people <i>can afford</i> those $1000—or more—furnitures. When people here in the Nordics are done with their furniture, it&#x27;s often just given away <i>for free</i> on our Craigslist equivalents. And not just the cheap stuff! Often you find really high quality stuff being given away for free. In fact, I found my favourite antique chair in a dumpster! All it needed was a bit of dusting off, and I&#x27;ve had it for over 20 years now. It&#x27;s simply a very sturdy and high quality armchair. And their previous owners opted to throw it away rather than to even list it.<p>Personally I really like to list stuff, though, because it&#x27;s an easy way to get others to do the heavy lifting for you. So probably that explains at least some of it. ;)')
