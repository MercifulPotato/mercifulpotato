You can&#x27;t legally call yourself a software engineer without going through the Engineers Canada accreditation.<p>I had a friend question me for calling myself a software engineer (even though they referred to themselves as one.) I&#x27;ve been programming for 15 years (8 years professionally) by 26 but they were unemployed and not practising after getting their BSc.<p>So in my opinion, there&#x27;s more charlatanism coming out of academia than from honest professionals who have established a career and deep knowledge of their profession. But then again, I&#x27;m not building dams and bridges. So the answer mostly depends on what you&#x27;re doing and how you got there.')
