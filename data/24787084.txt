A4 sheet music is just what I&#x27;m used to. Being able to write extra notation in (finger markings for piano or practice marks) with a pencil is just so easy. Also being able to have two sheets side by side. On an iPad you&#x27;re limited to one. Sure, you could buy two, but then what if your score is 4 pages long? You have to either do split PDFs or swipe multiple times on the other one or something.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m sure an iPad pro might be good size and resolution wise but I couldn&#x27;t justify the cost just for sheet music. Plus the multi page issue.')
