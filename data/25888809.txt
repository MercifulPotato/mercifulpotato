Item(by='rapind', descendants=None, kids=[25888959], score=None, time=1611458379, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25888703, text='&gt; A bad idea, IMO. It&#x27;s still going through the PHP server and all of the routing&#x2F;plugin&#x2F;DB code within WP. Much better to use Varnish (and its ilk) and avoid overloading the PHP service.<p>I&#x27;m not a big WP fan, but this statement is false in most cases. Page caching in WordPress is usually (always?) serving up the pre-rendered HTML direct from disk (or CDN) without hitting PHP. Pagely (the post we&#x27;re discussing) even handle that for you w&#x2F; their own CDN. I would imagine they also support request based caching and purging, warming, etc.<p>Most purely content sites (non-app) can run really well with a very simple TTL based cache (instead of long lived w&#x2F; complex flushing). You can very easily use something like Fastly for cloud based varnish w&#x2F; an appropriate TTL.<p>I also feel the need to point out that gatsby type sites and just pre-rendering &#x2F; caching as well, at least in part (possible using json from a CMS for dynamic data).')
