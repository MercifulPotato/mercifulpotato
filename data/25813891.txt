Item(by='astrostl', descendants=None, kids=[25813991], score=None, time=1610911026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25807399, text='&quot;Weight&quot; is a poor control. BMI is a better one. Going back over the study, it looks like the controls are listed in table 2. 12&#x2F;17 appear to adjust for BMI, with the following note from the authors regarding the resolution: &quot;We were unable to perform a subgroup analysis according to the body-mass index <i>because the mean values were not stated or estimable in the majority of the reports</i>.&quot; (emphasis mine) This certainly doesn&#x27;t throw out the results for me, but I still find myself asking the same question. But moreso the protein vs fat ratio question, as in my reply to the subthread above. With only three macronutrients in play, I can&#x27;t fathom throwing two of them together.')
