We are planning on supporting GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean and Heroku in the future and have users who have actively been requesting support for all of them.<p>Additionally - I think we can build a truly objective cloud console that shouldn&#x27;t be relegated to just public cloud provider services.<p>For example: Why can&#x27;t scale.ai sit alongside ML offerings from AWS and GCP? Why can&#x27;t Cloudflare see S3 egress and have Vantage facilitate an integration? Why can&#x27;t you auto-replicate an environment from Heroku or DigitalOcean to AWS&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;Azure? These are some ideas we have going forward.<p>Currently we have multi-account support for AWS and have been thoughtful with our architecture to quickly add other providers going forward so stay tuned :)')
