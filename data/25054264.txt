It&#x27;s natural selection: the ones that are easier to install&#x2F;use get installed&#x2F;used more often.<p>It&#x27;s to the point where I <i>expect</i> good documentation, and will pretty quickly discard a library if the docs don&#x27;t look robust on first inspection.<p>It&#x27;s sort of bizarre to me that Apple doesn&#x27;t know this, or at least hasn&#x27;t acted on it.')
