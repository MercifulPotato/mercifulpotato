And, even worse - American lives were lost today due to this rhetoric.<p>We can&#x27;t continue acting like this is a matter of hurr durr censorship anymore. It&#x27;s time to move past idealism and into reality: people are in danger. Words have consequences.<p>We saw today what happens when people with immense power spout extremist ideology for years without consequence.<p>Let today&#x27;s action by Twitter be part of the consequence. It&#x27;s not censorship: it&#x27;s consequence. Trump will not be arrested or chased for his rhetoric. He simply won&#x27;t be able to spout it to the masses on a privately owned platform.<p>A life was lost today. There should be some consequence.')
