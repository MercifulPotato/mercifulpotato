Nvidia just bought ARM so that would help them get rid of Intel as a middle man for gaming hardware. MS already has windows running on ARM but that seems to be a budget laptops only kind of thing so far. Also they are shipping AMD on x-box, which is interesting. But you could see Nvidia building an SOC graphics + cpu running windows potentially. Most game engines already  target IOS and Android so there should be no issues porting to ARM on that front either.<p>AMD ought to be paying attention. Risc V could be an alternative at this point if they want to push the market in a different direction. Having to license ARM from Nvidia would not be their dream scenario, I imagine.')
