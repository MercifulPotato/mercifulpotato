One single guy in a super fatalistic scenario is projecting a worst case situation for 2020 of 20% of electricity which it we assume the same distribution as today it would be equivalent to 8% of the world emissions, a 4X growth in 10 years. Even that is not going to happen.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-018-06610-y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-018-06610-y</a><p>&gt; Data centres contribute around 0.3% to overall carbon emissions, whereas the information and communications technology (ICT) ecosystem as a whole — under a sweeping definition that encompasses personal digital devices, mobile-phone networks and televisions — accounts for more than 2% of global emissions. That puts ICT’s carbon footprint on a par with the aviation industry’s emissions from fuel. What could happen in the future is hard to forecast. But one of the most worrying models predicts that electricity use by ICT could exceed 20% of the global total by the time a child born today reaches her teens, with data centres using more than one-third of that (see ‘Energy forecast’)1. If the computationally intensive cryptocurrency Bitcoin continues to grow, a sharp rise in energy demand could come sooner rather than later')
