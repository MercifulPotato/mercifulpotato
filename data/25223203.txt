Converters for languages will appear or already exist.<p>Datetimes is one of the most common data types and yes, everyone ends up &quot;constructing arbitrary types or simply parsing strings and letting users guess how to handle stuff&quot;. Remember .NET&#x27;s handling of datetime? [1]<p>ISO 8601 was published <i>in 1988</i>. You&#x27;d think that protocols designed in the 21st century would at least know about it.
