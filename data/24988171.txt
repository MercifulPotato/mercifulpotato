I&#x27;m a bit curious if any other HN-reader is aware of the private fusion project (aka the SAFIRE project) which is now run by the company Aureon Energy (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aureon.ca&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aureon.ca&#x2F;</a>). I do highly recommend watching the video (also available on the legacy page <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;safireproject.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;safireproject.com&#x2F;</a>) for the video recording of the experiments. It&#x27;s not yet quite mainstream physics but we have to remember that once upon the time the mainstream physics people didn&#x27;t think that heavier-than-air flying machines are possible while nowadays they have wasted countless billions on their fusion experiments and achieved close to nothing.')
