To me, it seems very idiosyncratic and strange. Here&#x27;s some doubts off the top of my head:<p>1. Has the peace in europe been unusually long-lasting?<p>2. Are internal politics actually suspended? Russia, and by extension the USSR, was a traditional player in European conflicts.<p>3. Is there a fundamental difference between the soviet bloc &#x2F; nato &#x27;grand alliances&#x27; and the earlier ones?<p>4. What practical role did the US play in, for instance, German unification? I thought that was basically the German&#x27;s own thing, with nobody else having a relevant opinion.<p>I&#x27;d see the recent cooperation between EU states as a result of the collapse of their empires. No empires means no squabbling over colonial territory, a loss of military power and prestige, and the end of an easy way of translating military power into economic success.<p>Usually, external powers <i>cause</i> instability, much as the US and the USSR did throughout the cold war in the third world.<p>Also, what internal conflict was possible to help the Nazis invade britain? Everywhere else in western europe was already conquered by the time such an invasion was in the works.')
