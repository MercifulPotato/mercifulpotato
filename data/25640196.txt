Item(by='fakedang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609805701, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25639803, text='&gt; With real names, faces are just one google search away for most people (and we could debate further what would it mean if a face wasn&#x27;t found).<p>But it becomes an added hassle for those people, thus making it UX hostile for stalkers. Who is actually going to Google each and every other name on somebody else&#x27;s collaborator list? Some determined stalkers I guess, but they are not going to be deterred anyways.<p>On the point of faces not being found, as a counterexample, some of my former MDs did not put pics in their LinkedIn. Yet people in the industry knew them by name, even if they weren&#x27;t rockstar investors or something. Having heard someone&#x27;s name from other sources such as word of mouth or from newspaper articles is a <i>much</i> better signal than using names to recognize them.')
