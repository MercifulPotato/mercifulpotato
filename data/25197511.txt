Personally I am in a point where idea of owning &quot;smartphone&quot; is actually nonsense.\nConvenience is king but mental clarity is a must for me. From 3 years on I have build a habit to avoid my iPhone and have tracked use cases in which I really need it. There are very small real use cases: 1. Phone call. 2. Messaging . 3 Banking apps. 4. Maps for navigation. My ideal phone is actually only a phone plus internet hot spot. In the future I can see my self using VPN firewall and replacing the list:\n1. Voip 2. Mail. 3. Web browser with e certificate. 4. Separate GPS device.<p>I know that all of this sounds extreme, but the mental benefits are of the chart. I have enormous focus, no &quot;fear of missing out&quot;, no &quot;notification hell&quot;, no &quot;social media&quot; rush. So no jailbreak or any form of functionality will bring me back to this time waisting mental bonanza.<p>If smartphones are the future of mandatory personal identification governments must offer them free of charge. Just saying:)')
