It means you&#x27;ve found a customer. Which is very difficult. Many startups never find even a single customer.<p>Obviously finding your first customers is nothing to brag about if you&#x27;re mowing lawns, because everyone on the planet is aware that anyone with grass in front of their house knows someone occasionally needs to mow it. Same with anyone who has hair on their head.<p>&gt; even $10k a month isn&#x27;t impressive after 24 months<p>&gt; might be better of leetcoding and getting a job at one of the FAANGs<p>I don&#x27;t think the point is to maximize lifetime income. But you&#x27;re absolutely right that if your life goal is to maximize lifetime income, statistically speaking, you shouldn&#x27;t start a startup.')
