Item(by='chopin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606292298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25206915, text='&gt; The philosopher in me doesn&#x27;t mean to be snarky, but what the author concedes here is that APIs actually aren&#x27;t like user interfaces.<p>I&#x27;d say that the &#x27;proper&#x27; API design depends very much on the language you target, at least when you come to details. However there are a few overarching principles of UI design which also hold for API design such as consistency (in my view the most important part of UI design) or discoverability.<p>In my view resorting to documentation is a second line of defense. The first line being able to understand intuitively. This is one reason I prefer libraries over frameworks. The latter almost always require documentation for working with them (you need to implement these 5 interfaces and put them into this factory,...). The former done right are almost always intuitively understandable.')
