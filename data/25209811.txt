Item(by='crazygringo', descendants=None, kids=[25210062, 25210072, 25214430], score=None, time=1606315944, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25198029, text='I&#x27;m curious if there have been any tech advances in tracking valuable objects in like rare books, sketches, paintings, etc. that are currently actually used by institutions or considered a best practice.<p>Whether it&#x27;s RFID chips, Bluetooth tags, security cameras that do &quot;book recognition&quot;, or something else.<p>Heck, even something as simple as a barcode per object, shelf, cart and holding area, and you&#x27;ve got to scan them in and out every time it&#x27;s picked up and put down (tied to your ID), and the whole system beeps with loud errors if it isn&#x27;t scanned in somewhere within 30 seconds of being scanned out.<p>The idea that a multimillion dollar object could be &quot;misplaced&quot; or lost in a large collection feels appropriate to the year 1980, but by 2020 it feels positively anachronistic. (I realize this happened in 2000, so I&#x27;m wondering what prevents it today.)')
