You can have twelve cheap electric motors on the plane instead of one combustion motor. With that comes great maneuverability.<p>The second advantage is that they are fairly quiet.<p>Together, this is great for short &quot;taxi&quot; flights across natural barriers (fjords, mountain ranges), even at night and without need for actual airstrips at either end of the journey.')
