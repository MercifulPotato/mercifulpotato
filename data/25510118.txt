Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25510171], score=None, time=1608665376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25510022, text='&gt; As for the &quot;anti-democratic&quot; American system of government, a cursory reading of the Federalist Papers would demonstrate that the Framers believed that majoritarian democracy was, in fact, tyranny of the majority....Majoritarian rule stinks if you happen to fall into a minority, and that&#x27;s the entire point of having a constitutional republic.<p>Well, it&#x27;s <i>also</i> not the point to entrench minoritarian rule, either.  With the structural advantages granted to less populous states in the Senate and presidential elections plus ruthless gerrymandering of House seats, that&#x27;s entirely possible and arguably <i>worse</i>.  Most <i>actual</i> tyrannies have been of minorities.<p>It&#x27;s also not like the framers had everything figured out.  Their electoral college system went haywire almost immediately, for instance.  If their system becomes so dysfunctional and looses legitimacy in the eyes of the majority (which it may be on track to doing), it won&#x27;t last, to the detriment of us all.  IMHO, that will mean some way of eliminating partisan gerrymandering and and replacing the electoral college with a presidential popular vote (since nearly everyone views the former as a proxy for the latter, anyway).')
