I see far too much right-wing kool-aid being guzzled today, and it seems like about 40% of America would rather die by suicide than live in a world where compromise happens with liberals, and for no good reason except misinformation, disinformation, and subterfuge.<p>So you&#x27;d really rather watch the world burn than accept that Twitter has no obligation to amplify anyone&#x27;s lies?')
