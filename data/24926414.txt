At most, what really sucks is the way some projects are bundled. Unfortunately the way Qt has been packaged in Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu is one of these examples on how not to package software. Qt ships and maintains multiple release versions concurrently, and it&#x27;s a shame that package managers insist on pretending they only need to have one semver major version installed at all times.')
