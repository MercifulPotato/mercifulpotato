But somehow anti-immigrant, and thus anti-agricultural worker sentiment is rife among such people.<p>Many people are still under the illusion that small family farms are the ones that are being supported when they give agricultural subsidies.  But those people are mostly gone.  What are left in their place are huge corporations, and it&#x27;s they who are benefiting most from the status quo.')
