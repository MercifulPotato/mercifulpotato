When you do some research, you will of course discover that they left for the states, already with a Master&#x27;s Degree in their baggage (in probably some industry experience), or studied in the US on next-to-free Norwegian student loans, having endured zero hardships in their comfy middle-class lives over here.<p>And if they screw up, they could always return home.<p>In this day and age, you really don&#x27;t find any native Scandinavians that can just waltz into the US, without having a very good starting point &#x2F; foundation.')
