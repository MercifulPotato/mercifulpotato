The current way, with many researchers being forced to spend more time on grant hunting than researching or teaching, and focus not dictated by scientific needs but by political aims (NASA!), and young researchers being ruthlessly exploited, is unsustainable.<p>Just compare the structures back when science, research and progress were taken seriously to now. It was the US government that gave humanity lasers, Internet, integrated circuits, battery tech, databases (Oracle!), satellite-based data gathering - almost <i>all</i> of what modern life grants us was founded back decades ago by <i>massive</i> government&#x2F;military research programs.<p>Side note: this is also valid for Europe. We have all lost our collective focus to progress and advance to corporate greed and minimalist-government theories, while China has picked up the slack. The 21st century, I fear, will belong to China thanks to the collective actions of the last 30 years.')
