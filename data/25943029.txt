My guess is that some parties within Google et al. keep the permissions really dumbed down &#x2F; broad-brush to maintain a false hope of intelligent user behavior. However, having spent some time with both carriers and mobile device manufacturers, there are also areas of undeclared commercial utility in maintaining control&#x2F;security in the hands of the pre-installed OS (ie. device manufacturer) and not in the hands of the user: DRM, app sales, increased chargeable mobile data use, reduced chance of non-cellular data paths (mesh networking), etc.<p>That said, stock permissions are too broad-brush. Especially networking and filesystem access. This seems to have been recognized in latter editions of Android but not yet carried to its logical conclusion. For example, recognizing that &#x27;writes to &lt;specific range of paths or devices&gt;&#x27; should be an available privilege to grant means we can then use CI&#x2F;CD and profiling in combination with automated testing to substantially reduce the attack surface for any given program on this subsystem by auto-generating rules. This is effectively how many of the kernel security toolkits work in practice, eg. grsecurity&#x2F;apparmor &#x27;learning mode&#x27;, SELinux &#x27;permissive&#x27;. All that is needed is to automate the process. With <i>cgroups</i> now mainstream and multi-subsystem heirarchies of non-traditional control thus applied to a huge percentage of Linux systems, surely the time is ripe for this. It could be a good startup, but because Google holds all the keys there&#x27;s no chance of it gaining general distribution.')
