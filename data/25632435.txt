Most people here don&#x27;t know recent US history anymore ? Just look at what unions did to the people of Detroit ?<p>Sure, on paper it seems like a good idea to fight the rich company to give employees a bigger share of the profit, but do remember: it&#x27;s not the employee that decides how much profit is enough for the company to have. If the investors&#x2F;CEO&#x2F;boss doesn&#x27;t feel the profit is enough, they&#x2F;he&#x2F;she can close the company. Unions always will protect the weaker worker (regardless of the domain) and subtract value form the better workers.<p>If some employees don&#x27;t like what Google is doing, they can protest (as they did). Also they can leave. Twisting the arm of the boss to give you more, when has that worked in the long run ?')
