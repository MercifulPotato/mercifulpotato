That&#x27;s why a cost function is required.<p>&gt; that they&#x27;ve premined, allocated huge chunks of to themselves<p>A huge chunk was not allocated to anyone other than FOSS developers.  Please review the paper [1] for specific allocations.<p>&gt; &quot;airdropped&quot; to a set of developers they collected in 2018.<p>To be clear, this set consists of any developer on github who had 15 or more followers in 2019, the PGP web of trust strong set, and anyone on HN who had a keybase account in their profile.<p>&gt; Why would anybody sign up for this? I genuinely have a hard time understanding why anybody would take this seriously.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is anything to sign up for?  Secondly, you absolutely don&#x27;t need to use the new internet if you don&#x27;t want to - just like nobody forces you to use anything else in this world.  You have a choice.  That said, we&#x27;ll miss you. :(<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a plan to replace the DNS roots with... some company? That just decided they should be the ones to own it?<p>So actually, the DNS root is owned by some company [2] that is under the jurisdiction of California law.  It used to be, and still basically is, owned by the US Department of Commerce.  Internet users are replacing it with a public blockchain owned by the commons.<p>Historically, revolutions happen all the time.  Now it&#x27;s the time for democratization of naming.  Is there any good reason why we shouldn&#x27;t own our own names?  I think that the name might even be more valuable than money.  What is anything without a name?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handshake.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;handshake.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handshake.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;handshake.txt</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icann.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icann.org&#x2F;</a>')
