I know several (they all happen to be women, but I&#x27;m sure many men also like them). It&#x27;s a bit of a tautology - they wouldn&#x27;t be so profitable and dominant if people weren&#x27;t clicking on them, so somebody is doing it, and in massive numbers. They wouldn&#x27;t like going back - my mom is already angry that using my home wifi messes up the ads she gets.<p>Obviously this shouldn&#x27;t be read as an endorsement for FB&#x27;s practices - I think they are as scummy as Apple&#x27;s anti-competitive bullying of iOS developers. It&#x27;s unbelievable that we&#x27;re now openly longing for something that looks a lot like the Windows software market circa 2001: compared to today, it was a paradise of open competition and almost-entire privacy.')
