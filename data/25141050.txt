Consequently, many countries adopted eugenic policies, intended to improve the quality of their populations&#x27; genetic stock. Such programs included both positive measures, such as encouraging individuals deemed particularly &quot;fit&quot; to reproduce, and negative measures, such as marriage prohibitions and forced sterilization of people deemed unfit for reproduction. Those deemed &quot;unfit to reproduce&quot; often included people with mental or physical disabilities, people who scored in the low ranges on different IQ tests, criminals and &quot;deviants&quot;, and members of disfavored minority groups.<p>The key element, here, is that eugenics involves the state controlling the rights of the individual to reproduce in the first place.<p>In this case we&#x27;re dealing with the exact opposite:  providing additional information in support of a person&#x27;s right to make a decision about whether they <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> reproduce.<p>I would make the claim that, given a positive test for a genetic disorder, forcing a person to bring that fetus to term is in fact far closer to the troubling elements of the eugenics movement--a direct intervention by the state in a person&#x27;s reproductive decisions--than the current situation.')
