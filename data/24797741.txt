The parts that do worry me are things where you wouldn&#x27;t expect that to happen. For instance, in this post¹, you will see where many people have interacted with the comments. This is just the &#x2F;r&#x2F;bayarea subreddit so doesn&#x27;t specifically select for &#x27;stupidity&#x27;.<p>Now, set aside the actual proposition and read the comments. Most of them are trivially wrong about:<p>* What a California Ballot Proposition is<p>* What the role of the legislator is wrt ballot props<p>* The text of the proposition<p>Now, this would be a problem if the text was particularly hard, but it really isn&#x27;t. Someone in the comments there pointed out that this was the same as the infamous Prop J and K pair where one raised taxes to provide funding for a thing and the other provided the thing but only if the funding was there. The funding failed, the thing passed. The thing never came to exist. Afterwards, on Reddit, I read commenters describing how they didn&#x27;t know the two things were linked.<p>This is a pretty common pattern on forums like this. Even HN suffers from it where people avoid primary sources only to intentionally play telephone and get bad information which they then convincingly repeat. I&#x27;ve definitely seen folks confidently bullshit something they just learned from another comment instead of reading the primary source. As an amusing coincidence, one of these was about the ridesharing min wage law that Seattle passed. The primary source was very clear, but most comments argued about a thing that wasn&#x27;t a failure mode of the actual law - but was a failure mode of a non-existent law that they had manufactured from thin air.<p>¹ <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;bayarea&#x2F;comments&#x2F;j6c4lv&#x2F;im_a_software_engineer_at_uber_im_voting_against&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;bayarea&#x2F;comments&#x2F;j6c4lv&#x2F;im_a_softwa...</a> it&#x27;s deleted now but the same text as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;06&#x2F;im-a-software-engineer-at-uber-im-voting-against-prop-22&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;06&#x2F;im-a-software-engineer-at-...</a>')
