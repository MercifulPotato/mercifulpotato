The value you get out of it is not wasting everyone&#x27;s time when the salary available isn&#x27;t even close to high enough.  Decide what your minimum compensation requirement is, increase this by some percentage that would make you happy, and give that to recruiters.  You will get far more out of avoiding bullshit than you will potentially leave on the table.<p>Additionally, remember that most independent recruiters work on some form of commission.  It&#x27;s in their best interest to get you more money because then they also get more money.')
