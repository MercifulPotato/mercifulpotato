But I think it&#x27;s good to consider what would happen in other countries should a character like Trump be elected. In Canada, a polarizing character like Trump would be exceedingly unlikely to form a majority government. As a minority government, they would be subject to &quot;no-confidence&quot; votes regularly. When a government passes a budget for example, if the budget does not pass the house, the government automatically crumbles and an election is called. Additionally, as the prime minister is simply the head of the party, his vote carries no more weight than other members, and he can be fired by his own party at any time.<p>A lot of checks and balances are baked into a multi-party system. One inherent advantage is less polarization, as there are more parties to represent the various views of the people. However, there are of course a lot of improvements that could be made to the Canadian governance system (ditching first past the post for example), but I do believe this style of government is more resilient than the US system.<p>At the same time, our government has not, and will likely not, be put to the test by someone like Trump. It is commendable that the US system has withstood what many feared could be the start of the downfall of democracy in the US.')
