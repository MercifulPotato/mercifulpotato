The border on the top of the screen is also wide enough to fit it and in fact the camera inside of the laptop is only marginally smaller than the one in my phone (I&#x27;ve unfortunately had to take both apart enough times that I&#x27;m quite certain of this).<p>It&#x27;s definitely not a physics issue. Just like the painfully slow barely USB 2.0 SD card reader that laptops include, despite costing a couple grand and having a 20Gpbs link literally right next to it, it is a cost issue.')
