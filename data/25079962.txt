They wouldn&#x27;t be particularly human by our standards, but they&#x27;d have the same DNA.<p>But our culture would be gone. All the accumulated knowledge would be wiped out, and it&#x27;s very possible nothing like it would ever return.<p>DNA is fairly robust. Culture, knowledge, and rationality are extremely fragile. We&#x27;re not doing an outstandingly job of preserving them even without a nuclear war, and I can&#x27;t imagine a nuclear war would make the situation any better.')
