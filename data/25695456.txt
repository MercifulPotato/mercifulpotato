(e-mail in profile)  It sounds like literate programming for a shell script to me :)<p>The kernel + shell is the best we have, since there are multiple implementations going back years.  For example FreeBSD and Linux are totally separate projects and codebases, and implement a very very large common subset (POSIX, which has absolutely everything you need for text processing and document authoring).<p>For example, I just tried out NearlyFreeSpeech, a very inexpensive pay-as-you-go hosting  service, and I found it runs FreeBSD.  If I really wanted to make my blog portable and timeless, I would port it to NearlyFreeSpeech, which I estimate would probably be one day of work (really, I only use the Python stdlib, etc.).  But I&#x27;m comfortable enough that Linux is going to survive until in some form or another until  I&#x27;m dead ... or if it doesn&#x27;t, there will be some migration path for the bazillions of other users.<p>The point is multiple implementations: Unix has multiple implementations, CommonMark has multiple implementations, and so does HTML&#x2F;HTTP.  Those things aren&#x27;t going away.<p>The reason that Spolsky&#x27;s blog rotted is because he built it in a custom tool (which he wrote), which was built on VB6,  which was built by a company which changed its strategy ... etc.  The stack was too high, and too proprietary.<p>He switched to WordPress, but I&#x27;d argue that stack is too high too, even though it&#x27;s more open source.<p>So I&#x27;m happy with my solution but sure I would look at different ones.  But my feedback might be that it should be &quot;tested&quot; in the real world.  Just like the HTML+CSS solution is NOT tested because the OP didn&#x27;t actually write many blog posts with this toolchain!')
