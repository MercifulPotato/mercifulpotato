Data capture forms, family and friends schemes, corporate social responsibility stuff etc.<p>The core systems stuff was all Java enterprise inter-operating with off the shelf Oracle and TIBCO stuff. Building those small once off apps into the main infrastructure would have required involving the bigger suppliers who were more expensive and would be stonewalling you with change requests before long.<p>If you weighed the risk and determined that you were happy with these non-revenue path applications being subject to that risk, I think it might be ok.
