Either he can have the 10 cookies right now, or he can pick up his room, and then he has the option of getting 10 cookies from you any time of the day or night during the next month, whenever he wants, no questions asked, no matter how busy daddy is.  Or he can sell the option to any one of his friends or family, to guarantee they get 10 cookies in exchange for those pokemon cards he&#x27;s had his eye on.<p>That&#x27;s an options contract.')
