I haven&#x27;t seen anything controversial in the news.<p>Perhaps not if you read reputable outlets but if you take a look on Facebook, Twitter (including the President’s account) and YouTube you’ll find a frenzy of conspiracy theories about voter fraud. None of it with any real evidence attached, but it’s spreading like wildfire in many social circles.<p>Of course, this statement won’t really do anything.
