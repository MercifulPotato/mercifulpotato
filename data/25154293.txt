Crucially, I need to be able to recognize whether two file descriptors point to the same open `file_struct`. (To be clear, this isn&#x27;t the same as whether they&#x27;re pointing to the same file path. I need to know when the two file descriptors are sharing the same cursor.) There is no way to do this using existing APIs, because there is nothing identifying a `struct file` besides the memory address of the struct. (The &quot;open file IDs&quot; I mention are hashes of the `file_struct` address.)<p>I did spend a lot of time trying to avoid writing a kernel module, and this was the only way I could find to do it :)')
