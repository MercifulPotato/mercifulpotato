Even using plain LaTeX, LyX can be used just for the maths because it is so quick. I can&#x27;t imagine the math for which LyX would be insufficient.<p>It doesn&#x27;t render like tex in the editor, but it is logically correct.<p>LyX has a &quot;tag&quot; for plain tex, which allows you to insert any tex file into your document. That is a practical way of working with TikZ, for example.')
