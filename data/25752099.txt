If terrorists or criminals are talking in large groups, as they did on Parler, they might as well be in plain text. The point is that an average person can get into that conversation (be radicalized) and then become part of that mob. If the CIA&#x2F;FBI&#x2F;NSA can&#x27;t get into those groups then they should be all removed because of gross incompetence and we&#x27;ve been overestimating their influence by several orders of magnitude for the last 50 years. We hear stories about agents infiltrating groups all the time. So what&#x27;s the issue here? That they have to infiltrate and can&#x27;t passively monitor? The only thing this stops is dragnet operations where small group terrorists are plotting together. Which historically we&#x27;ve seen that this isn&#x27;t effective because it&#x27;s just adding more hay to the haystack.<p>I&#x27;d contrast this from a platform like Parler where they actively encouraged extremists to adopt their platform. It is one thing to say &quot;free speech&quot; as a dog whistle and another thing to say &quot;free speech&quot; in the true meaning. Parler sought out extremists from the get go, Signal has been focusing on mass adoption. There&#x27;s a big difference.')
