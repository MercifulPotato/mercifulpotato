Item(by='vkou', descendants=None, kids=[24725240], score=None, time=1602200118, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24722583, text='If all current taxi, and taxi-like services died overnight, the barrier to entry into the industry would be a guy with a high school degree, a cellphone, a driver&#x27;s license, a beat-up Prius, and a yellow paintjob for it.<p>Your cited risk is not realistic.<p>&gt; The obvious part is, you might get used to it, only for it to be dropped.<p>&gt; But also, they may run competitors out of business before dropping it, leaving you without any options.<p>It&#x27;s a <i>taxi</i>. You call a number, or click a button on an app. A car arrives and drives you somewhere. The value delivered by the guy in the beat-up Prius, to me, is the exact same as Waymo. It&#x27;s the most homogenized, commoditized industry in the world. Waymo could corner the entire market, and then go out of business, and the very next day, the streets would be <i>full</i> of independent taxis picking up passengers.')
