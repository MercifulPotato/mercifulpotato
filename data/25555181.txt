Fortunately, I was not hurt at all.<p>I believe yholio&#x27;s statement about &quot;when correctly used&quot; was meant to be &quot;when correctly used by <i>all</i> participants&quot;; i.e., no single participant can guarantee their own, or anyone else&#x27;s, safety, no matter how careful they are.<p>On the other hand, the guarantee is, as yholio notes, of an almost entirely theoretical nature even given universal cooperation:<p>&gt; The safety guarantees work only when humans demonstrate almost super-human regard to the safety of others, are never inattentive, tired, in a hurry or influenced by substances or medical conditions etc.')
