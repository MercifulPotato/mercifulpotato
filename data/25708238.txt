I don&#x27;t want to give them my phone number.<p>Have you guys all seriously gone and signed up for accounts, given these people your phone number, and actually gone looking around?<p>I have family members who use this website.  They&#x27;re not neo nazis who are planning political violence, and I know for a fact that they would be mortified to know of somebody who fit that description in their social group.  They&#x27;re your standard issue Irish Catholics from northern Minnesota who heard that conservatives weren&#x27;t allowed on twitter anymore, so they went and signed up for parler accounts (a petty revolution, but there isn&#x27;t a lot to do in N. Minnesota in January except ice fish and snowmobile).')
