Calculating their assets is. Imagine the following<p>I own a $100M building outright that I rent to tenants (say an office building) - it&#x27;s illiquid with a thin market and I can&#x27;t just move a building. So let&#x27;s say I do this: I enter into a terminally settled, non-transferable, future-callable, sale-leaseback with a partial-repo feature, with an overseas bank. The mechanics are this: I &#x27;sell&#x27; the building to, say, Nomura in Japan. This is the &#x27;sale&#x27;, but I don&#x27;t take any cash. Instead, Nomura agrees to a 999-year lease where I can operate the building and the rent payments are settled via the sale proceeds I never received - this is the terminally settled part. I rent to tenants and keep the net operating profit. &#x27;Future-callable&#x27; means I can undo this in the future; &#x27;repoed&#x27; means that if I need some of the money that Nomura is holding from the proceeds, I can get it back in part.<p>You say, &quot;but the operating lease has value!&quot; - but does it? Its non-transferable, so it has no market value whatsoever, and I can zero the economics of it so it has no model value; you can&#x27;t value that using <i>any</i> generally accepted measure. There are some detailed complicating factors in this example, but they can be sorted out; importantly, transactions like this are fairly common for (completely legal) reasons. The main thing I have done is taken the building out of my calculation of &#x27;wealth&#x27; - I would have owed 6% times $100M, but now I don&#x27;t &#x27;have&#x27; a $100M building to tax - Nomura has the building, and they&#x27;re in Japan. I will owe either income tax or corporation tax, but I would have owed that anyway. Wealth tax zeroed.<p>Now multiply this by literally tens of thousands of millionaires and their respective assets. At some point, the cost of extracting the tax is more than the receipts collected!<p>And this doesn&#x27;t even touch on the fact that there are many asset rich, cash poor people. For instance if you own $25 million in shares in a pre-ipo unicorn, and you&#x27;re making $175k in salary per year, where are you going to cough up the millions annually to afford the tax? These are real problems and it appears that the sole motivation why some want a wealth tax is not because it makes sense by any economic or policy standard, or that it might improve the lot of the man lesser-off, but because they want to make other people poorer. Full stop.<p>And that seems to me to be a morally toxic and ideologically disgusting criteria for developing law.')
