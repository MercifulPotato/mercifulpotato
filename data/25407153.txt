In the context of an interactive shell command I doubt many people care much about posix; indeed I struggle to recall any context in which I ever cared about posix compliance as such. Unless you have an personal or professional interest in fringe operating systems posix compliance is mostly of interest as an imperfect proxy for answering the question will it work on both Linux, macOS&#x2F;iOS (and maybe busybox).<p>Anyway, I suspect the following is POSIX compliant:<p><pre><code>    git status -s | awk &#x27;gsub(&#x2F;^ M &#x2F;,&quot;&quot;)&#x27; | tr \\\\0 \\\\n | ...</code></pre>')
