Robustness in the event of failure is useful with planes and automobiles even though it adds weight and makes them less fuel efficient. Similarly with government policy it might make sense to opt for a less efficient but more resilient or some qualitative attribute like more freedom of choice.  This would be particularly true in a society where a basic income was needed because presumably society would already be extremely efficient at producing goods and services such that the demand for human labor is far smaller than the supply.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m pro basic income or not but I wish more discussion would go into what a healthy set of societal characteristics would look like before discussing how to get there.')
