This is the common framework that justifies reducing the activity of the US State Department, generally relinquishing the status of the USA as world police, and a sort of libertarian view of personal liberties.<p>In that framework, you&#x27;d think the administration would be very against the government monitoring all financial transactions. Trump himself you&#x27;d think would greatly enjoy legally being able to anonymously move any amount of money around. Trump can personally direct FinCEN policy as it&#x27;s part of the executive branch. Yet here we are, the policy is undistinguishable from the Bush or Obama years.<p>There could have been silver linings for personal liberties to this administration if they actually stuck to the principles they claimed.')
