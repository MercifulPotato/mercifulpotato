This is not meant to be a cynical take but just stating financial reality.  The advertisers are the ones paying billions into Google&#x27;s revenue to maintain the expensive data centers and host petabytes of disk space for Youtube videos.  Because money flows from advertisers to Google, the advertisers are the ones that caused Adpocalypse[1].<p>The websurfers querying the search engine are <i>users or consumers</i> and not the paying customers.  Not sure how a users&#x27; union would have much leverage since they <i>don&#x27;t pay</i>.  If they&#x27;re unhappy, they can use another search engine (e.g. Bing) or influence indirectly (e.g. boycott advertisers which causes Adpocalypse.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=youtube+advertisers+adpocalypse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=youtube+advertisers+adpocaly...</a>')
