Of course, as I work with startups and not huge enterprises, I have actual experience only with Postgresq, MySQL and MongoDB, and not Oracle, but that video about anthropomorphisizing Larry Ellison is so funny.<p>However, I started going through CMU intro to databases course (btw, it&#x27;s amazing) and one advanced database feature or optimization after another, I hear &quot;only MSSQL or Oracle do that&quot;. Which strated me thinking: is Oracle really that stupid and backwards? Or is it just folklore?')
