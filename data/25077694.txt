I&#x27;d imagine testing and automated deployments are a bare minimum.  Testing may slow you down, but if most of your work is maintenance, you&#x27;ll see longer term gains.  Automated deployments will prevent any manual errors from occurring and instead of taking hours to deploy, it&#x27;ll take minutes.  Both together will give you some confidence in what you&#x27;re pushing out.<p>Second, I&#x27;d talk with your boss more about &quot;communicating too much&quot;.  Especially if you&#x27;re already having problems, you&#x27;ll want to keep an open line of communication with your boss to let him know where you&#x27;re succeeding and struggling.  I&#x27;d try to figure out what kind of communication they&#x27;re looking for and develop a plan around that.<p>Third, over complicating solutions is a tough problem to overcome, especially alone.  Is your boss technical?  Was he a developer? Who&#x27;s your mentor in all of this?   Can you give an example on how you&#x27;ve over complicated something?  Without knowing anything, I&#x27;d encourage you to spend more time designing and less coding.  Design the solution first and take time to look  for ways to simplify it.<p>Fourth, timeframes are always hard.  I agree with agile and would encourage you to read up on it.  Even splitting a project into milestones could help.')
