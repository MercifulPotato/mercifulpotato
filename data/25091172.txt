While maglevs have been in operation for a long time, I believe this is the one of the few examples of an inductrack.  Iirc The technology hasn&#x27;t really made it out as much because it has only recently come off patent.<p>A key advantage of inductrack is that it requires relatively little energy to achieve it&#x27;s levitation, but the technology is still very new in the engineering sense, so you really wouldn&#x27;t expect it to go fast.  I&#x27;m frankly impressed that they were able to get a decently fast human trial up an running so quickly.')
