But as one of the trainers I’ve worked with told me, first you work on large muscle groups with free weights which has the benefit of exercising small stabilizer muscles as well, but then you if you want to take it further you will need to exercise more specific muscle groups or even individual muscles.<p>Also as others pointed out, this website seems full of exercises that target large muscle groups. I actually struggled to find a more targeted exercise for a couple of specific muscles I am interested in exercising, which isn’t to say the site isn’t useful to me, just that I need to do more research.')
