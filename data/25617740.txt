Most films render at 2k DCI. It&#x27;s not so much that the software and hardware can&#x27;t render higher, it&#x27;s just diminishing gains for the increased  render time.<p>Most 4k films till very recently actually have the digital elements at 2k DCI-ish resolutions and are upscaled. I can&#x27;t speak to wether soul is rendered at 2k or 4k, but it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if it was 2k upscaled.')
