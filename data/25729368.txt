Since my elementary school years some two decades ago, I don&#x27;t think I ever cycled so little in one year as in 2020. Bicycle is my #1 transport but due to forced remote work and generally low level of activity outside home I haven&#x27;t had the need to go much anywhere. (I won&#x27;t even begin with the massively detrimental effects on my fitness level.)<p>That being said, I sincerely hope people who took up cycling during the pandemic will continue to do so 2021+ forward. More cyclists = more planning focus on cycling = better &amp; safer cycling infrastructure.')
