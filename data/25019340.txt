There is no substitute for learning in a properly structured learning environment with good teachers to keep one properly focused.<p><i>&quot;I had the extreme luck of having excellent teachers around me. That helps one from running astray. It helped me all the way to earn a Nobel Prize. But I didn’t have internet.&quot;</i><p>That backs up what I said, good teachers are everything (including being a very rare breed). The fact that he didn&#x27;t have the internet was probably a good thing, as it likely kept him focused. I&#x27;m very glad I didn&#x27;t have the internet in my formative years, I know I would have wasted too much time there on trivial matters.<p>Nevertheless, if one doesn&#x27;t have access to excellent educational resources then this website sounds as if it&#x27;ll be a worthwhile substitute.<p>It&#x27;s a great venture and I wish him well.')
