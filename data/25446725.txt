Item(by='Taek', descendants=None, kids=[25447070], score=None, time=1608144861, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25446251, text='&quot;By design, any changes to update the Bitcoin protocol need to be accepted by the miners with the majority of computing power - a.k.a. a hard fork.&quot;<p>This is incorrect and a common misunderstanding about Bitcoin. Hard forks require users to update, and it doesn&#x27;t matter what the miners do. It also doesn&#x27;t require a majority of users to upgrade, anyone who does upgrade will be on the new network, and anyone who does not upgrade will be on the old network.<p>Bitcoin (and other blockchains) are structured so that miners have as little power as possible. Pretty much the only thing miners can do in practice is choose to censor transactions, and that would be considered an attack. Networks have recourse like bricking all mining hardware, which typically acts as a sufficient deterrent to such attacks. Miners can also double-spend (a form of creative self-censorship), but the same network recourse applies.<p>In practice I don&#x27;t think there are any examples of miners intentionally making a blockchain slower and more expensive. Miners pretty much always fit every possible transaction into every block, and any throughput restrictions are determined at the protocol level by protocol devs, not by miners.')
