Item(by='chuie', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1609613238, title='Career trajectory for technical co-founder?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I started a start-up 5 years ago as a side project during graduate school. I learned a lot from the experience (maybe don&#x27;t do a start-up while in grad school...) but as the company grows it makes sense to bring on people who are better than I am. We are selling a hardware device, instead of continuing to do all the development myself we brought on a EE and a MechE to get the product better faster and I suppose the best case scenario is that we continue to hire specialists, leaving me to wonder...where should I be trying to level up? My role has transitioned into more of an general administrator&#x2F;get-it-done person, but should that be the direction I continue in? Being in grad school the past several years has not exposed me much to career trajectories in tech, and I like having a plan for the future so I can begin chopping wood now.<p>Any advice would be appreciated.')
