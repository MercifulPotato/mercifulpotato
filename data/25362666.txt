Just read history.<p>&gt;  If Bezo&#x27;s was forced to liquidate say 2% of his ownership in Amazon to satisfy his wealth tax<p>Except nothing I explained about Islam&#x27;s Zakat laws force anyone to liquidate in the manner you&#x27;re describing. Note I said cash money. Stocks are not cash money, and hence will not be taxed in the same way I explained. Ownership in companies is subject to things like debt, which will reduce the amount of money paid out.<p>Islam&#x27;s Zakat is different from the wealth tax some leftists are trying to push today as you&#x27;re describing.')
