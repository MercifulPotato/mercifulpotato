Lots of it comes from polish and creating the seamless player experience. It might not be as technically complex as 3D engine, but no AAA developer would care about optimizing the fluid or belt system to behave in a scalable way. It&#x27;s really well thought out.<p>(Also, there is a saying that it takes a genius to do something in a simple way. So even if the resulting code might be simple, arriving to that point can be actually pretty complex endeavor.)')
