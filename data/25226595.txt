Item(by='firloop', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606465822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25219491, text='&gt; We thus had a (very, very low) spending limit for this project. This is the reason for the Slate’s extremely basic webpage – it’s literally just a hardcoded HTML file sitting on AWS. Dirt cheap! (I had lots of folks write in offering their help to create a much fancier webpage. This was very generous, but I could do that too. It’s basic because we couldn’t afford to do something nicer. I’m not kidding when I said our spending limit was low.)<p>This seems like exactly the sort of thing that open source could &quot;disrupt&quot;. Something simple perhaps; a static site builder[0] that takes in candidates and a link to an ActBlue campaign and makes a passible &quot;slate&quot; page. One advantage to having something like this would be something that optimizes for all of the metadata&#x2F;header tags that makes a page very sharable on social media.<p>Admittedly, software is probably not the hard or interesting part of doing this, as the post mentions, it&#x27;s probably just the actual act of promotion. Then again, making &quot;slates&quot; easy to brand, spin up, and promote sounds like a powerful grass-roots tool to me. (If anyone is thinking about doing this, please email me)<p>[0]: I&#x27;m not suggesting some overengineered monstrosity. Hell, the static site builder could be a static HTML file of its own.')
