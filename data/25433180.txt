A certain category of the LGBT community finds it offensive for straight people not to accept performing homosexual&#x2F;transgender sex for themselves.<p>&gt; No. I don&#x27;t think people should be pressured into sex acts.<p>What about masturbation ? Masturbation and orgasm, especially from a woman point of view, used to be seen utterly negatively. Why would YOU judge negatively a woman masturbating &#x2F; being sexually abused and degraded (both psychologically and physicall) if 1) the acts are consensual, and 2) she finds it <i>liberating</i> and utterly pleasurable. It&#x27;s none of your business.')
