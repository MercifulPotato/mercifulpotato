Otherwise it degenerates into a BSD-family license (actually not even that, as you wouldn&#x27;t have to give credit to the original author). GPL requires you to provide the source of binary software you ship to your users by revoking your copyright grant if you do not do that. If you remove the threat of copyright enforcement, then I can ship your GPL library without shipping source.')
