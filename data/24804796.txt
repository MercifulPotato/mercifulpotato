In the absence of the contrived situation, choices will reflect the genetic predispositions of the baby, coupled with what is afforded by the environment.<p>2. If someone acts to create a contrived situation for the baby, then preferences will be systematically biased by that contrivance.<p>Neither of these are surprising statements, although the experiments results confirm (or can be deduced from) #2.<p>The random case doesn’t actually occur outside the laboratory, and if it did, it would be just a special case of #2.<p>So, “who we are is just a product of random choices we made as babies” is not a good interpretation of this result because babies actually don’t make random choices unless you put them in a special laboratory situation.')
