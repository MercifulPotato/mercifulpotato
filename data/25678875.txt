Another thing to consider is the weight of the titanium that encases the RTG just so you don&#x27;t fry the other electronics. Dealing with radiation in space is pretty difficult and radiation shielding in general is still a pretty complex problem. On Earth we pretty much solve it my mass (more mass == more shielding) but we don&#x27;t have the luxury with space applications. There&#x27;s a lot of advanced composites there and layered material. It is a really fascinating subject. There&#x27;s also people trying to harvest some of this energy into usable electricity. I worked on one of these devices (focusing on betavoltaics) and it isn&#x27;t going to power your house, but you can power things like a heartbeat signal for your craft (and of course use it to trickle charge batteries on long missions).')
