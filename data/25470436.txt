Publishers can choose to not support it.<p>Why does the community hate AMP if publishers opt in to it?<p>Also, publishers could easily create fast-loading pages without AMP as well if they just reduce all the bloat -- GDPR popups, banners, flying &quot;subscribe now&quot; popups, third-party ad libraries (use first-party ads for much faster loading times), weird JS scrolling effects, trackers, all that crap. That&#x27;s why pages get slow.<p>HTML alone is fast -- AMP isn&#x27;t necessary for a fast experience.')
