Right now it&#x27;s not easy to get, for example, vulkan or muslc or qt as a bazel package.<p>It&#x27;s also not easy to publish a version of your package (A) that depends on another package (B). This would create a diamond-problem like situation where your package (C) depends on both packages (A-&gt;B, C-&gt;A, C-&gt;B). So, some code needs to resolve these issues and reproducible identify the exact hashs of everything to pull in to make it a not-manual process.<p>Also, something great about the design docs linked in my other post: there&#x27;s a presubmit.yaml standard so, pulling in a library, will include tests that bazel will run for whatever arch you&#x27;re compiling for. For instance, say you pull in sqlite and need to build it for RISC-V. Before you just needed to hope that sqlite worked correctly on your arch, now you&#x27;ll be able to test those situations in CI with RBE runners for all architectures.')
