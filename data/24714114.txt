People who clean toilets, or collect trash, or any of those other unskilled menial jobs that absolutely need doing in society aren&#x27;t &quot;enjoying this jobs every single day&quot;.<p>&gt;&gt; How did accepting that as the norm sneak into our culture?<p>I think you&#x27;ve got that totally back to front. The typical HN reader is _super privileged_ to even be able to think about choosing &quot;a job that I love&quot; over a less fulfilling job. 99% of the humans on the planet are doing whatever job they can just to survive. &quot;A job that you love&quot; has never been &quot;the norm in our culture&quot;. Pretending most people don&#x27;t just &quot;go through life wasting away most of their prime waking hours on a job they don&#x27;t love&quot; is ignoring the lived existence of practically everybody you see each day that&#x27;s not in a FAANG Michelin-starred cafeteria or double-digit equity incentivised at a swing-for-the-fences startup.')
