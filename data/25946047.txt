It is outright market manipulation that they stop people from buying, but not selling. That they stopped individuals like me, who know the risk and can afford the loss, while allowing their hedge fund buddies to buy the dump and cover shorts.<p>As for &quot;this would have happened anyway&quot;, well that doesn&#x27;t sound very free market to <i>force the very thing you claim to be trying to stop</i>. RH says &quot;oh no we don&#x27;t want you to lose money, so we&#x27;re going to cause a crash on the stock. Feel free to sell&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s rotten to the core.')
