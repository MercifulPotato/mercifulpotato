I&#x27;m definitely in the camp of the CRUD developers. I do accept that I don&#x27;t do lower level work (even making plugins&#x2F;affecting how the framework works) in my day to day job.

He states that he himself is more interested in the &#x27;Information System&#x27; parts instead of the &#x27;Computer Science&#x27; part.
