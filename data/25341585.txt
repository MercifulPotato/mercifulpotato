So, even if a cadet gets out of training with good habits&#x2F;attitudes those can change very quickly when they start working with the more experienced officers. I&#x27;m sure it can be done, but it will likely take a zero tolerance level of push-back like has happened with sexual harassment in the corporate world to solve the problem.<p>And I don&#x27;t for a moment consider most police forces to be underfunded. The lions share of most city budgets are the police force, and it goes to buying armored cars and helicopters, and &quot;benchmark city&quot; ratios of police&#x2F;citizens. And where I live the armored car gets used once or twice a decade, and in all cases so far could have probably just called the larger city an hour away and borrowed theirs as was done 15 years ago before the purchase.<p>Some how we survived for a century with far less police, and outside of the crime wave of the 1970&#x2F;80&#x27;s which were likely caused in large part by other things, were generally safer too. That &quot;crime wave&quot; seems like it would have solved itself without the huge ramp up of police funding we now have today, although the tough on crime people like to attribute it to that. A large part goes to fighting the failed drug wars. Which in turn feeds into the massive prison populations we have now, the largest part of which are there for non violent crimes.')
