Fortunately that&#x27;s nothing like what the Schrödinger equation says.<p>The basics of quantum mechanics are:<p>1. Any system can be described in a linear &quot;state space&quot;, whose basis vectors (roughly speaking) are each possible arrangement of the things being described (every thing&#x27;s location).\nHowever, all possible states include (complex) linear combinations of these.  This is usually described as the &quot;wave function&quot;, you can plug in any value for coördinates of all your things and get a number back out.<p>2. States in a closed system evolve according to the (time-dependent) Schrödinger equation, -i h-bar d&#x2F;dt (state) = E(state). This is sometimes phrased as &quot;energy is the generator of time translation&quot; (note that this phrasing holds true in the Hamiltonion formulation of classical mechanics too, but with different, related meanings).  Actually calculating this can be difficult, and you might need to do various tricks such as decomposing in a convenient basis.<p>No all-encompasing energy field binding and penetrating us needed, though the equation is non-local in the sense that it could depend on the entire world.  (In fact, it&#x27;s quasi-local in practice; energy is usually just a function of where things are (local), and how different that coefficient is on infinitesimally adjacent states (i.e. spacial derivatives of the wavefunction).  But this does let changes propagate at any speed, including faster than light.  Basic QM is not Einsteinian relativistic.  It is perfectly Galilean relativistic in a very nice way though.)<p>3.  If you measure a system, you&#x27;re going to get results that are probabilistic with the probabilities proportional to the (absolute value of) the square of this wavefunction.  After that, the state is reset to whay you measured, and evolution will proceed according to 2.')
