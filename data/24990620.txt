Millions of Americans still get their news from cable news and talk radio, where conservative voices have dominated for years. Many pro-Trump Facebook influencers also have sizable presences on Twitter, YouTube and other social networks&#x27;.<p>The NYT were being disingenuous back in August here - Tucker Carlson dominates cable TV pundit viewing figures while CNN, the NYT and the other Democrat supporting media have made a fortune bashing Trump and whipping up fear and hatred over the last four years.<p>In a democracy it is profoundly wrong to imply that your opposition has no right to exist, to question their credibility and to constantly make claims of what they think and believe and then insult them for those ideas.<p>I am a registered Democrat and am appalled by the lack of a DNC political platform beyond &#x27;getting rid of Trump&#x27;.<p>This has become a very toxic, unhealthy situation and the NYT has lost a lot of credibility participating in these behaviors IMO')
