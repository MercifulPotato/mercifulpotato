But of course, once I could see them as they are, I just changed my mind. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had an &quot;agenda&quot;, just biases. Maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s easier for me to change course as needed.<p>While I have no problem admitting that I&#x27;ve been wrong, it&#x27;s still a problem when others of the same beliefs still haven&#x27;t realized it&#x27;s bullshit.
