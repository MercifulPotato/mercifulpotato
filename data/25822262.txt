I meant if time is not fundamental, then there must be a time-free formulation of the laws of physics and also the universe itself must fundamentally work without time. I can somewhat - but certainly not fully - wrap my head around a time-free formulation of physics for specific situations and recovering time from that as an emergent phenomenon. But thinking about the universe as fundamentally time-free just breaks my brain, I can not overcome the thinking that change happens over time while the truth is probably closer to time emerges from change, roughly speaking. I guess because we are so used to reductionism, thinking about things as the sum of their parts and how they work, we or at least I struggle when something is not decomposable. But time seems to fall into this category - if there is a single isolated particle, then there is no time, it only shows up once there is a composite system and relations between its parts can change.')
