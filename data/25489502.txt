I downloaded some footage of satellites flying over the earth from NASA, used FFMPEG to extract each frame of the video, wrote a ruby script which runs over every image in a folder and calls primitive (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fogleman&#x2F;primitive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fogleman&#x2F;primitive</a>) on each image.<p>The final step is to recombine it into a single video, which I haven&#x27;t done yet because I haven&#x27;t yet implemented video playback in the program I&#x27;m writing. In the meantime I&#x27;m just loading each image on the fly and playing it as a sprite animation. This results in low FPS but it gets the gist across.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SBFGqxWYyvI&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SBFGqxWYyvI&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><p>I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;d still look pretty choppy even if it was a 60 FPS video though. I&#x27;m not yet sure how I&#x27;m going to smooth it out. I can share the FFMPEG command I used &#x2F; script I made with you if you want, but I&#x27;d have to find it first (this was maybe a year ago). I&#x27;m sure the script is garbage.<p>I do not believe the go program that I am using is deterministic. You can run the same command on an image twice and it will produce a different result. It might be possible to make it deterministic, but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve wanted so I haven&#x27;t looked into it.')
