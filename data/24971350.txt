Whatever you are doing to serve errors has to be strictly less expensive than serving successes. If your load shedding error path does things like logging synchronously to a file (as you might get from a logging library that synchronizes outputs for warnings and errors, but not information), taking a lock to update a global error counter, or formatting stack traces in exceptions, it&#x27;s possible that load shedding will _cause_ the collapse of your service instead of preventing it.')
