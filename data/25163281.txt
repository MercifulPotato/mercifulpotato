In real life, drives are way more reliable than this specification.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t believe that statement without data backing it up.<p>Disk drives are right at the engineering edge.  There is a reason why consumer class drives have one MTBF and enterprise drives have a better MTBF.  If a disk drive manufacturer could somehow cite a better MTBF, they <i>absolutely</i> would (see the whole GB vs GiB marketing stupidity, for example).')
