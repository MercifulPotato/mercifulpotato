It can be used for local web development, production static-site serving, or as a network file host. By default, go-live serves the directory it is executed in.<p>It&#x27;s inspired by JavaScript&#x27;s famous live-server utility, but way faster and doesn&#x27;t need Node.js installed. Supports Linux, Windows, and Mac, as well as ARM. It&#x27;s also 4MB fully compiled, and can be used on an IoT device.<p>Mac: ```brew tap antsankov&#x2F;go-live &amp;&amp; brew install go-live```\nLinux: ```snap install go-live```<p>Checkout the Github for more info on how to install it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;antsankov&#x2F;go-live#install" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;antsankov&#x2F;go-live#install</a> and interesting use cases.<p>Any feedback is appreciated, since this is the first open-source Unix utility I&#x27;ve worked on! Also need some help on profiling it.')
