It turns out that buying lots of cards and building a massive engine on a whim may not be more efficient than just buying silvers&#x2F;golds&#x2F;provinces all the time. There are lots of subtleties in the timing of purchases, and determining ways to create a slightly more efficient machine than your opponent.<p>IMO it&#x27;s an terrific 1-on-1 game where meaningful strategic and tactical decisions are made, but I find the game a lot more &quot;fun&quot; with three or four players (five players takes way too long)')
