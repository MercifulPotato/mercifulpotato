I attended in the early 90s and back then I was not aware of any philosophy to treat the kids as adults. We did not have an off-campus lunch program; I got detention one time when I got caught sneaking off campus. And there was definitely a vibe of gifted and talented across the board. The labs were not as sophisticated as they are now. My classmates had broad interests and ended up with achievements across many professions. Just within the few folks Iâ€™ve kept track of, there are successes in science and tech but also theater, TV, movies, writing, restaurants, politics, etc.')
