Item(by='boulos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604255210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24959634, text='I’m currently shifting my schedule to work Saturdays and take off Mondays (I don’t have children, and my partner is flexible). Before the pandemic, I tried to block off time for deep work by booking multiple hours on my calendar each day.<p>The shift to Saturday has been mostly great. I get a full day of deep work when nobody else is willing to work (Saturday), and neither Monday nor Friday had meetings I cared much about. Being able to walk around on a Monday is way nicer during the pandemic. Again, I get that others can’t replicate it if they have other commitments — importantly, both partners would need to have this flexibility, and most children’s’ schools probably wouldn’t be up for it :).<p>The main thing as many are highlighting below is about overlap (and predictability for recurring meetings). I mostly work with people in US&#x2F;Pacific, but also US&#x2F;Eastern and somewhat less often Europe (London and Warsaw) and Sydney. So that’s already unschedulable anyway. People have been reasonably receptive to “oh, I see, yes you don’t work that day” though a good chunk ask “Do you really work on Saturday?” (to which I not only really work on Saturday, I probably get the most useful things done on that day).')
