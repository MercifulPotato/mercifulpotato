The retrotink ultimate stopped being made last year, which is very sad.  The community hasn’t picked up the source yet.  It’s a matter of time though.  I’m going with a PI2SCART for video output.  I would use this Raspi 400, but the GPIO location is not well suited for hats.<p>I’m going this route because I also want the flexibility to have a computer on my CRTs.  If you want pure gaming, then look into MiSTer FPGA.')
