RCEs in the wild on Windows make the news. RCEs in the wild for months on end are bad for the entire world.<p>Does no one remember the complete nightmare that was going to a relative&#x27;s house and realizing they hadn&#x27;t updating Windows in 1 year? From bot nets to hidden folders full of pirated files (or worse...), and an overall general expectation that all banking credentials ever entered on that machine are compromised.<p>Yes mandatory reboots are irritating, yes it would be nice if Microsoft hired back the armies of QA people they got rid of years ago so that the updates were more reliable, but those updates serve a real purpose.')
