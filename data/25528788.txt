There&#x27;s nothing exclusive about the Model 3 or the criminally ugly SUV.<p>Now, if you meant to say that the Model S is exclusive, you&#x27;d be right.  Buying one of those puts a person in the exclusive club of people who were too stupid to spend the money on an A8 or a 760 instead.<p>Edit:  An S class would also be a good option.  But Heaven help the person who thinks a Model S is in the same league as any of the other $100k cars.  Its ride quality is trash.  The interior is trash.  I&#x27;ve heard plenty of people get defensive about the Model S, but I&#x27;ve never heard anyone mount a real defense of it.')
