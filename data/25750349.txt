Not cutting off Parler would also be providing material support to terrorists.<p>This Administration publicly announced a policy of maximum prosecution of offenses connected in any way to domestic civil unrest, in general (now, at the top this was obviously, though not on its face, politically targeted at their opponents, but the career prosecutors called on to execute the policy are perhaps less likely to apply it narrowly in that way), and, in specific, both the D.C. AG and the US Attorney for the District of Columbia have separately indicated that they will be actively pursuing all connections out from the attack on the Capitol, including incitement, in the DC AG’s case explictly including that which may have been committed by the sitting President’s inner circle, and, though charges would need to be held until after he leaves office, the President himself.<p>There&#x27;s a reason people are fleeing from any material connection to the terrorists or anyone seen to have a connection who isn&#x27;t themselves actively cutting ties with them.')
