Webpack exists because jQuery and 3 plugins can&#x27;t deliver the same results nowadays.<p>Also, do you want to improve your code with types and linting? Do that without Webpack, it&#x27;s not going to be much more efficient.<p>---<p>In short, Webpack and Babel basically match the Rust compiler in functionality. If you don&#x27;t use them, your web appâ€™s code will be harder to manage, not easier. That&#x27;s all.')
