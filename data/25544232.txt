There is one piece of truth in this article- They started doing better because they finally improved their product after years of cost optimization (read as shitty pizza).  That&#x27;s it.  Better pizza = more sales.  Keeping it around long enough and word gets out that Domino&#x27;s is good again, which means more sales and growth.  The rest of this article is fluff.  The funny thing is that this article is written as if management saved the day by taking &quot;a huge risk.&quot;  Since when is fixing your shitty core product considered a huge risk?  That&#x27;s not a risk, that&#x27;s a prerequisite!<p>Domino&#x27;s aren&#x27;t currently delivering pizzas by drone or self-driving cars at significant scale, certainly not enough to affect their stock price.  They aren&#x27;t putting enough money into drones or self-driving cars to make investors think that they might have some head start- they will get self-driving delivery the same time as every other pizza company, because they will be buying the solution from another company that is selling to everyone.  Domino&#x27;s pizza tracking and online ordering is cool, but nobody orders Domino&#x27;s because of it.  Because regardless of their tech, they are just about on par with most pizza places when it comes to delivery times.<p>Edit: want a &quot;free pro stock tip&quot; from me (&#x2F;s)? Domino&#x27;s is steady&#x2F;level at ~$400 right now, but they were steady&#x2F;level at ~$300 in 2018-2019.  They got a 33% bump in price from the coronavirus.  So 30x of the 90x bump this article brags about has nothing to do with management decisions.  Once the Western world has gotten vaccinated, Domino&#x27;s is not staying at $400.  They may not go all the way back to $300, but they won&#x27;t be keeping every customer once normal life resumes.')
