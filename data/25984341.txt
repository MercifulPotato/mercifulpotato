But there&#x27;s other use-cases here.<p>If you&#x27;ve made a specialized controller that needed something other than generic gamepad support, and a webapp, and you wanted them to talk to each other, your previous option was to lobby browser vendors to add support.  Now you can build that integration yourself.  I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s something to complain about')
