It got him and my mother their current homer, but it sacrificed his physical health and basically any relationship he may have had with his family, because he was either working (usually 12 hour days) or sleeping.<p>I really hope it was worth it for him, because I could never do that to myself. Giving up that much of yourself and your life for people you&#x27;ll never meet and don&#x27;t care a single bit about you seems like something meant for fools.')
