Only paragraph 4 references Waymo.<p>&gt; You talk about OTA updates as if thatâ€™s some huge technological moat?<p>Of course they&#x27;re not a technological moat. These auto makers are hundreds of thousands of employees. They&#x27;re likely an organizational nightmare and stuck to the way things have been done. The fact that they don&#x27;t have over the air updates or have to iterate on an annual cadence is evidence of something deeply flawed in their organizational structure. And I&#x27;m not confident that they can overcome it.')
