They haven&#x27;t had reasonable growth in sometimes decades. They have never even approached 150 million players, never mind on a sustained monthly basis.<p>Man that statement makes me feel old, but Sega is the biggest, their growth happened in the previous century, decades ago.<p>Sega genesis, which I&#x27;m randomly assuming was the best selling product of this group of companies, got to about 30 million players. Nowhere near 700 million revenue. To put it mildly, this was not something they could sustain.<p>So I have little doubt that Roblox is indeed worth more than the sum of these companies. I don&#x27;t like the games either, sort of a second life but for kindergarten, but clearly they are commanding more success in the market than those companies.')
