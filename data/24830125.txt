Silvera is implemented 100% in Python,\nand it was developed with a goal to accelerate the development of microservices. I wanted to make sure that\ninstead of writing of a large amount of boilerplate code to establish the necessary infrastructure, developers\ncan immediately focus on implementing business logic.<p>Also, Silvera allows you to evaluate the architecture of the application. Evaluation is based on following metrics [1]:<p>* Weighted Service Interface Count (WSIC),<p>* Number of Versions per Service (NVS),<p>* Services Interdependence in the System (SIY),<p>* Absolute Importance of the Service (AIS),<p>* Absolute Dependence of the Service (ADS), and<p>* Absolute Criticality of the Service (ACS)<p>Silvera consists of SilveraDSL and compiler. In current vesion, compiler produces Java 1.8 code, but you can also register your own code generator as a plugin.<p>At the moment, I am writing a paper about Silvera and I&#x27;m looking for feedback.
