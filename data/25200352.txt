Then, there are other people who think &#x27;these damn hippies want me to become a vegan and stop using a car, this is obviously not tenable as a way to save the world, let&#x27;s look at carbon sequestration so we can continue living like today&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m not claiming that these are the only two ways people react, but I do believe they are two common ways. I also believe many companies and political parties encourage those two ways of thinking, because they allow them to maintain the current status quo.')
