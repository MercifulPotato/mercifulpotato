It&#x27;s mostly just a series of character assassinations, from Giuliani to the computer repair guy to...the Russians.<p>And that, my friends, is why Facebook and Twitter&#x27;s actions are not okay and why their insultingly duplicitous attempts to justify them aren&#x27;t going to work. The story certainly seems fake and the NY Post is a garbage paper, but that shouldn&#x27;t matter.')
