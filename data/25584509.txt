Lived most my life in Southern California. I&#x27;ve seen rent being both cheaper and more expensive than a mortgage. For a long while, the mortgage was a much better monthly payment; folks without a down payment were locked out of mortgages and stuck paying higher rents.<p>Looking at my flyover state on craigslist + zillow, a random house I picked rents for $1.4k&#x2F;mo and has an estimated mortgage of $1.5&#x2F;mo. Your rent &quot;savings&quot; would be $100&#x2F;mo and ignoring cost of maintenance if you mortgaged.')
