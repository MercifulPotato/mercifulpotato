Most people don&#x27;t understand &quot;repairability&quot; in the context of less complicated systems (their cars, refrigerators, etc.). They can&#x27;t vote for what they don&#x27;t understand.<p>This can be seen in product faults that remain fixed for many years in other consumer products. (see Samsung washing machines, GM ignition systems, etc.) Folks don&#x27;t know how to evaluate design considerations at this level, I think this  supports robust right-to-repair regulation as a counter-veiling force.')
