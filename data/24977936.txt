So you won&#x27;t have any outstanding criminal defence attorneys, which is equivalent to undermining the rights of those of need to defend themselves in criminal cases.<p>If you want to go this way, you have to go for the full-fledged solution: either the defendant choses their attorney (at a capped price) or an attorney shall be selected at random among <i>all</i> attorneys registered with the bar and must take charge of the case, the only exception being if they have a valid conflict of interest in that case.')
