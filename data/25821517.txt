I don&#x27;t think this is what happens usually though. Sadly most cases I see are the same as the angular case in this article.<p>I made an issue suggesting tickets not be marked as stale if they&#x27;ve not had a maintainer comment yet. As you can imagine, the stale bot installed on the repo itself kept trying to close it due to it being &quot;stale&quot;. After several months the irony wore off and I let it get closed.')
