Missing from your summary is:<p>- &quot;The applicant, Violeta-Sibianca Lăcătuş, is a Romanian national who was  born in 1992 and lives in Bistrita-Nasaud (Romania).&quot;<p>- &quot;In 2011 Ms Lăcătuş, who was unable to find work, began asking for charity in Geneva.&quot;<p>Why was somebody who &quot;lives in&quot; Romania begging in Geneva? Would she not have received social benefits in Romania? This looks like a perverse kind of tourism. Refugees and asylum seekers I can understand but Romania isn&#x27;t a warzone or dictatorship, it&#x27;s an EU member state.<p>And I think &quot;decriminalizes begging&quot; is a bit hyperbolic. The court did set some precedent but they were also clear that a critical factor in the ruling was that this woman was in a situation where she genuinely needed to beg in order to survive.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hudoc.echr.coe.int&#x2F;app&#x2F;conversion&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;?library=ECHR&amp;id=003-6910043-9279633&amp;filename=Judgment%20Lacatus%20v.%20Switzerland%20-%20sanction%20imposed%20for%20begging%20on%20the%20public%20highway%20violated%20the%20Convention.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hudoc.echr.coe.int&#x2F;app&#x2F;conversion&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;?library=ECHR&amp;...</a>')
