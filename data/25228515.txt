Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606483653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25228401, text='Yeah, I mean a LOT of people - scientists, software developers, etc - already struggle to do things correctly, let alone in a novel way. There&#x27;s huge value in work that is not groundbreaking.<p>For the sciences for example: Repeat or (re) confirm someone else&#x27;s theories. Repeatability is one of the most important parts of science, and if all the scientists only pushed to do something new, instead of double-checking others&#x27; work, science would become something ego-driven and vague.<p>For software development (my and most people on here&#x27;s jobs), 99% of it is not building something new. Build something good first. Quality standards, testing, accessibility - how much software do you know that actually does that right?<p>I&#x27;ve worked with so many people during my consultancy stint (myself included I guess?) that would always pursue the latest and greatest - they wanted to innovate, they wanted something fresh and new. So rarely did they spend more than two years at any one customer. The worst offenders would swoop into a company, advise technology X, then fly off again without ever having to live with the consequences.<p>And that does not make you a better developer. It scratches your personal itch maybe, but you&#x27;ve caused potentially millions in lost productivity and the inevitable rewrite by more sane developers further down the line.<p>I&#x27;m trying at the moment to do things Right. Build software for the next ten years, instead of the next six months. I&#x27;m struggling a bit because the project is big and I&#x27;m just a solo developer, but I like to think the mindset is right. I mean I&#x27;m not doing anything new, it&#x27;s just a CRUD application in the end, but it&#x27;s important that it&#x27;s done right due to the sheer amount of data (width, not so much amount).')
