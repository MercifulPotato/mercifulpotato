One I use as a large monitor for my desktop. I’m very happy with them. I mostly watch Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime video and have never noticed the ads on the navigation screen (since they are just tv shows).<p>I’m planning to get YouTube premium to remove ads there and vote with my money for an ad-free Internet.<p>I never imagined that they would be spying on the actual video output, but I would consider that not only a major violation of privacy but corporate espionage (because I use it for work).<p>I don’t believe that is the case, but I’ll be researching if that is being done.')
