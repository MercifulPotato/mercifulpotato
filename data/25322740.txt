You don&#x27;t need to know anything about the situation to do that, so why leave the analysis at the minimally-developed step?<p>Analyzing the situation before schools ever used cloud platforms and why these platforms are alluring to begin with should be a big part of this discussion, because you must understand how you got here to ever understand where to go.<p>For example, when I was high school in the early 2000s, the most advanced setup my high school had was for students to use USB sticks or email the teachers assignments, and it sucked for everyone. The teachers each came up with their own effort to track files. And there was a lot of work for teachers, e.g. students forgetting to attach the file. Or, a clever hackerman such as myself, deleting a couple bytes in the file before attaching it to buy myself an extra day.<p>In university, the school used Blackboard which is apparently very expensive and definitely very underwhelming.<p>After those two experiences, I&#x27;m not surprised that Google suite is a true breath of fresh air for schools and students alike. I know nothing about the education system beyond this post, so I would love to hear something more informative about the situation than &quot;capitalism bad&quot;.')
