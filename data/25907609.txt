If anything this will chill future concerns and people will not speak up. It sounds like you donâ€™t want anyone to ever question a vote.<p>For the same reason it&#x27;s (probably) baseless for a coworker of yours to claim you&#x27;ve been embezzling millions from your employer for years.  It&#x27;s basically a false accusation.')
