I agree they don&#x27;t have a perfect monopoly either. There are lots of other options.<p>The reality is, most of their customers aren&#x27;t going anywhere. Consider all the times you use Youtube. Trying to find a music video, watching sports highlights, videos from your favourite creators. Can you switch to DailyMotion for all of that now? Are all of your creators posting their videos on Facebook? Even if they are, are the videos as easy to find and discover as they are on Youtube? For content creators, is there anywhere else they can share and expect to find the same kind of audience? Not really.<p>This is what I&#x27;m talking about when I say monopoly. It&#x27;s true, there&#x27;s other options. A creator can post their videos on Vimeo and host their own website to monetize, just like someone could have taken a horse and buggy instead of the new railroad. No one is <i>forced</i> to go by train, but doing it the old way is inefficient and expensive. n both cases they won&#x27;t get the same bang for their buck.')
