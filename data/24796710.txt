I have personally not been able to get this to work for FaceTime on 10.14 despite best efforts.<p>An interesting thing Sony seems to do here that others haven&#x27;t is that they bypass the PTPCamera agent that normally comes on, presumably to directly drive the camera through their own lower level PTP library Lja_PTP_USB.dylib.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m the author of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ptpwebcam.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ptpwebcam.org</a>, which works much the same for Sony&#x2F;Nikon&#x2F;Canon cameras')
