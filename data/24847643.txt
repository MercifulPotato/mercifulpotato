Let me see if I can parrot that back in a different way.  If one investor &#x27;messes up&#x27; (an inefficiency).  Another one may step in and make it &#x27;closer to efficient&#x27; as there is some value to be made.  That would assume an unlimited number of investors maybe?  inefficiency is therefore removed from the system.  On a static scale which most people forget the market is most certainly not one, it would be in an inefficient state.  But as time iterates on it would tend towards it as inefficient actors remove themselves.')
