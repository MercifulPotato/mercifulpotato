I looked at Fastmail at the time, but there was one showstopper which I forget (and should revisit).  That said, I have found Zoho to be very reliable and reasonably responsive to support issues.  And their pricing is very reasonable, imo.<p>For data, I use Tresorit.  They have a great, if premium priced, alternative to gdrive, onedrive, etc.  In my experience, Tresorit is more reliable in terms of successfully tracking and syncing terabytes of data (and many files).  Plus their encryption story is believable, and storage is their primary job.  They&#x27;re not going to kick a client out without some conversation at least.  I tried Nextcloud, but like OneDrive, it ultimately would develop sync issues with large volume and large numbers of files.<p>I switched to Firefox a couple of years ago and found it mostly better than Chrome, especially regarding the Multi-Account Containers and the Facebook Jail.<p>For chat, I used Wire for a long time until they changed their focus to corporate only and their home to the US.  Now I&#x27;m back on Signal.  It&#x27;s not awesome, but it works fine.')
