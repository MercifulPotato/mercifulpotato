LOL. That and &#x27;cultural marxism&#x27; are just scary&#x2F;meaningful-sounding terms people make up to label and then defame something they don&#x27;t like.<p>They&#x27;re terms that are broad and just accurate enough to describe <i>something</i>, but too vague and imprecise to actually describe <i>anything</i>.<p>Let me help. You dislike academics who study and analyze society and culture to discover it&#x27;s biases, unspoken assumptions, and so on, and you don&#x27;t like that they critique society for the oppressive elements which they believe they&#x27;ve found.<p>I.e. social justice. Critiques of capitalism. Critiques of systemic racism.<p>Criticize something specific so we can talk about it. But, the reason you aren&#x27;t accurate or specific is because if you were, whatever argument you are trying to make would rapidly fall apart.<p>And I&#x27;d love to be proved wrong! Share a specific critique. We can talk about Marxists, neo-Marxists, communists, libertarian anarchism, Progressive Democrats, Social Democrats, The New Left, Poststructuralism, Structuralism, Critical Theory, Postmodernism (though that one&#x27;s a bit vague), Feminism, Intersectionalism, Third-wave Feminism, Liberation Theology (the current Pope has roots in Liberation Theology, which was a point of contention), and so on.<p>Or maybe you don&#x27;t like Democrats? Social Progressives? The entire field of Gender Studies?<p>Pick something you don&#x27;t like and let&#x27;s talk about it.<p>But, I&#x27;d bet your own lack of education (which I don&#x27;t mean as an insult, more so a factual description - I&#x27;m uneducated about, say, genetics) on the things you criticize makes it difficult to do so.<p>And I&#x27;d bet your true dislike is something you&#x27;d be shunned for expressing, which is why you hide behind nonsense-phrases that function as dog whistles.<p>Because we all kinda know what you mean, even though you didn&#x27;t actually say it.')
