It&#x27;s you forcing me to accept your definition of &quot;factual&quot;. That&#x27;s the crux of the question - it&#x27;s no longer my choice, the gatekeeper chooses for me what is &quot;fact&quot; and what is not, and I have no option of applying my own intellect and make my own choice - the choice is made for me, the conclusions are prepared in advance for me and the information is pre-filtered and pre-arranged to push me into accepting whatever vision of the world the gatekeeper privileges. I don&#x27;t have an option to even know there exists something outside of gatekeeper&#x27;s filter, let alone build my own filter according to my own preferences.<p>That&#x27;s why the quotes are there - because it&#x27;s literally what the quotes are for, to emphasize it&#x27;s not my definition and not may decision - it&#x27;s gatekeeper&#x27;s, and I have no control and no input on it. If you think eating up pre-filtered and pre-digested information is &quot;intellectualism&quot;, you definition of it is very different than mine.<p>&gt; you&#x27;re making out that Facebook is benign or not?<p>That&#x27;s what using pre-digested information does for you - you become unable to parse things that aren&#x27;t pre-digested. I will help you to make it clear - Facebook is evil, but the major point is not whether it&#x27;s evil or not, but the role of information gatekeeper that it performs. Applied to a browser platform, this approach is dangerous and unacceptable to anybody who values their own intellect and is not scared of actually using it once in a while instead of outsourcing this function to a gatekeeper body.')
