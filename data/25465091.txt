Twitter and other tech giants now think that their role is to protect the world from information they deem wrong.  As well, prominent people in media and politics are urging them to take on that role more expansively.  Naturally, therefore, they will oppose competitors whose distinguishing feature is to have less or no censorship.<p>The media establishment does not look kindly upon those who seek to deconstruct it.')
