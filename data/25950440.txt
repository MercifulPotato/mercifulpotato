I agree that it seems like every step along the way is there just to add more money (to what they can charge you or, for the insurance, what they can get you to pay instead of them). The long hours on the phone I mentioned are another expression of that (maybe if we keep giving him the runaround, he&#x27;ll just go away). The fact that you&#x27;re dealing with said issues just makes you more likely to give up, and they know that.<p>The next time something like this comes up, if you&#x27;re feeling up to it, try pushing back. If you have the time to throw at it, the worst outcome of trying is usually just staying where you started.<p>At the end of my many hours on multiple phone calls getting everyone to agree to pay for treatment I need... the company in charge of making it called to let me know they&#x27;ve been retasked to making COVID vaccine and won&#x27;t be making the drug I need for at least 3 months.
