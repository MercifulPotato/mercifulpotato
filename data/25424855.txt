More than 1g in one dose, or 3g over a day is extremely inadvisable. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is toxic at a small multiple of the recommended dose; prescription strength acetominophen products add other active ingredients, they don&#x27;t add more acetaminophen; as opposed to ibuprofen where prescription strength is just more ibuprofen. I&#x27;m not a doctor, this isn&#x27;t medical advice, etc.')
