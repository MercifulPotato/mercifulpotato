But racism is what caused that poverty in the first place.<p>I partly agree, but I’d argue that it’s less complicated. I would rephrase thusly: <i>Poverty IS the problem. And historical racism is the cause of a lot of that poverty.</i><p>&gt; even if you removed racism completely, African-Americans would still be stuck with being poor, simply for historical reasons.<p>I agree in principle. The question is how you solve for systemic poverty. I think the first, most obvious step is to enact a very steep inheritance tax. That would be the most effective way to dampen generational capital inequality.<p>The second thing you could do is a generous UBI because that would dramatically benefit the systemically poor. The most effective way to lower income inequality is to raise the floor.')
