The bottleneck on build jobs tends to lie on disk access, specially with projects comprised of a significant number of small files whose build also outputs a bunch of small files.<p>This is one of the reasons behind doing builds on RAM drives.<p>If that&#x27;s the case then these weird speedups might not be due to magic properties on Apple&#x27;s M1 professor but due to the fact that the processor doesn&#x27;t idle as much while waiting for all those reads and writes to finish.<p>If anyone has any data on this, please do share.')
