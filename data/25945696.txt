If you are a slave to OOP, you end up bolting that method to either one or the other object when really it affects both and belongs in a separate place entirely.<p>The other big issue I have with OOP is frequently I don&#x27;t want or care for reference passing, I just want value passing. That is usually the place where I start using objects is when passing references is useful.<p>It&#x27;s particularly useful if you are building a thing which requires multiple steps and you need that state to persist between steps. I&#x27;ve seen it done well with functional programming, but for me it&#x27;s just easier to build something out with an object that holds persistent state.')
