Pandemics are our new normal.  We&#x27;ve been anticipating pandemics for decades, in movies, books, etc, and here they finally are.  They are both predictable and predicted.<p>There&#x27;s a competent, pro way of handling pandemics, and incompetent, amateur way of handling them.<p>The pro way is brief but comprehensive shutdowns + distancing + masks + sanitizing + testing &amp; tracing + travel restrictions.  It only takes 4-8 weeks of that to shut down a pandemic, then everyone can get back to being their normal, self-centered, freedom-loving selves.<p>The amateur way is to scream about it like a child, refuse to take measures to help stop the outbreak, and be so brainwashed that you&#x27;re unable to distinguish a conspiracy for a real emergency.  Which is of course what Trump and half the US has done.<p>Sometimes a pandemic is just a pandemic, not a conspiracy of the global elites.')
