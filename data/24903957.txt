Sharing information among multiple providers is definitely the goal for the past many decades, and there are various approaches to this eg hl7 and ccda, but all are limited by the adoption of standards by existing software. We are just now standardizing on an international standard for labs, procedures, and diagnoses (loinc, snomed, icd 10). But often this is powered by mappings between systems that might lose details. Moving actual medical records and commentary among systems is even more lossy and sometimes hard to detect!')
