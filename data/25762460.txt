Many STEM topics that are of interest to most HNers are probably among the best things you can learn online.<p>I&#x27;m currently a grad student in Communication Sciences and Disorders. My field involves linguistics, speech and voice science, disabilities, and more. My education in online classes is absolutely of a lower quality than it would be in person. I don&#x27;t think that will ever change until humans stop communicating with their mouths, faces, and bodies. Classes whose subject matter necessarily revolves around face-to-face discussion will always be worse online.<p>We need to be very careful on which subjects remain mostly-online, and which subjects we push back into classrooms.<p>Other than that, I have wondered whether &quot;learning pods&quot; will become a powerful tool (rather than a temporary bandaid to the problem). From what I have seen it seems like a promising way to lower the student-instructor ratio and still get some kids spending time face-to-face without traveling to a central location every day.')
