And especially as I got older and interested in computers he started talking about some work stuff sometimes. His first programming language at work was 360 assembler. For the uninitiated&#x2F;too young to remember: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IBM_System&#x2F;360" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IBM_System&#x2F;360</a>. When I started working at the same company for my first job and I had to log into &#x27;the host&#x27; - meaning the IBM mainframe they had (I believe by that time a Z series <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IBM_Z" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IBM_Z</a>) I noticed how the custom login screen for their entire system had actually been written by my dad.<p>So all this just as a little context. But when I was talking about SQL like 15+ years ago he would always tell me that sure that&#x27;s nice and all, but all those joins. They&#x27;re painfully slow. Why would you do that? They had a table that had exactly all the information that they needed to have and they accessed it via a key. Fast and easy. Need a different view of the data? Make a new table that&#x27;s organized the way you need it. Done and fast. Ring a bell? (NoSQL :))<p>I also started playing with Linux and system administration and obviously virtualization (vmware at the time, qemu stuff etc.). So I go talk to my dad about it and how I love the concept and how it does X and Y and Z cool thing. Yeah well, for him that was really old stuff, coz they had that on their mainframe since like forever (now called z&#x2F;VM, then called VM&#x2F;370 - in 1972).<p>We had to learn and use Java at university, which my dad always made fun of. Especially with articles like &quot;The state of Java application middleware&quot; and such that I was looking at. All that new fangled stuff, pah! He had been working with IBM CICS as the middleware for forever. Initial release of CICS July 8 1969, latest release June 12, 2020. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CICS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CICS</a>)<p>I get it. I say the same thing(s) about some of the new fangled stuff I have to work with nowadays. With the kids. Some of it is great. Other things I&#x27;m just asked myself why the wheel had to be re-invented just to come back to square one. Like NoSQL databases that add features you&#x27;d expect from relational databases.')
