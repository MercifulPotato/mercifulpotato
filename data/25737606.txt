Item(by='mywittyname', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610401072, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25736278, text='Probably because most of the pre-orders had enough time to beat the game.<p>The main story lines are not crazy long, maybe 30hrs or so.  The side quests aren&#x27;t nearly the quality of Witcher 3.  Most are just, &quot;run into this building and kill this guy &#x2F; steal data from the terminal, then run out.&quot;  They only serve as something to do while you&#x27;re exploring the city.<p>With no multiplayer or generated content, I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would spend more than 60-80 hours playing the game.  It makes sense that fewer people would be playing it by now.')
