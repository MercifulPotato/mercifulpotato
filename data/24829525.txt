In the &quot;Upcoming Games&quot; section, one of the games is listed at $30 per session, which seemed incredibly steep compared to the other featured games that were all ~$10 per session. I clicked on the expensive game to see why it was so expensive, and it turns out that&#x27;s just the rate for a single person, but it goes down to $10 for sessions with 3 or more people.  This seems like a cool idea, and I wouldn&#x27;t want DMs to miss out on players because they saw a high price on the front page and went with a cheaper option.')
