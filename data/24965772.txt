I make this claim based on:<p>1. The observation that very wealthy people like Bill Gates and Elon Musk saw their net worth increase at a far faster pace earlier in their career.<p>2. Basic complexity theory. Managing less assets is less complex than managing more.<p>3. The range of investments that can absorb one&#x27;s entire capital without market distortions grows as one has less capital to invest. Say one finds a great opportunity in an ice cream stand on a busy corner that costs $50K. If they only have $50K, they can invest the entire amount and get a great return on investment on their entire net worth. If they have $50 million, that ice cream stand could only efficiently utilize 0.1% of their capital. They would need to find 1,000 similar opportunities to match the return on investment they could have obtained if they were able to invest all of their capital into that one opportunity.')
