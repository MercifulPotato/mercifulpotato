Devices got weirder.<p>It used to be that you could check the width and height of the viewport and say something like “320px wide? Must be a touch interface, deploy the big buttons”. Then tablets got big and it was like “1024px? Could be a laptop, but it’s probably an iPad, which has a touch interface, deploy the big buttons”. Then laptops got touch screens, then the Surface Studio came in and was like “HAHAHAHA”.<p>Now the game is “1920x1080? Could be a big tablet with touch, or a 1080p monitor without touch, or a non-maximized window on a Surface Studio with touch, or maybe it’s a monitor without touch hooked up to a laptop with a touchscreen and our window could get moved between them at any time...”<p>Nowadays, there’s no single reliable way to tell if a page is going to have to support touch until it gets a touch event, by which point you’ve already rendered the UI and it’s too late.')
