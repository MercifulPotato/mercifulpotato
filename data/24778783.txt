I&#x27;d close my PayPal accounts in a nanosecond, if there was a viable alternative.<p>It&#x27;s also long been a source of puzzlement to me why the charade that eBay &amp; PayPal are two completely separate companies with nothing to do with each other has not been challenged in court before now.<p>It&#x27;s not that long since eBay actually banned sellers from accepting other online payments systems like Amazon Payments, Google Wallet, etc. on the grounds of &#x27;security&#x27;, whilst at the same time insisting they accept PayPal.')
