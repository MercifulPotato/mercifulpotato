The same is true for all font engines which use in the case of Xft the Xrender extension.<p>I never understood why they didn&#x27;t include proper font rendering and Cairo into the server. This would not only solve a lot of issues like mixed dpi rendering and vastly improve network transparency but would also eradicate duplicate effort and fragmentation in the toolkit space.')
