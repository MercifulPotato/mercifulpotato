Credit hours or the equivalent correlate pretty loosely to difficulty and the time you&#x27;ll need to spend. (And, of course it&#x27;s even truer when you mix in non-engineering classes which aren&#x27;t necessarily easy but were relatively speaking for me for the most part.)<p>&gt;On average, I studied for 40 hours a week and completed a course every 3 days.<p>I will say that when I was in university, there were very few courses I only spent about 24 hours on. In fact, there are probably a fair number of courses which, even had I taken them a couple years earlier, would still have probably taken more time than that to do assignments and brush up for exams.')
