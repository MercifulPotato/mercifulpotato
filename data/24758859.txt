The complaints all have to do with cheap materials, and&#x2F;or shoddy construction if walls aren&#x27;t straight.  But done right with good insulation and quality materials, I would take it over any other type.<p>It&#x27;s nice and easy to modify and repair also.  Unfortunately most of the money people use to buy goes into the price of the land, leaving little extra for a quality build.')
