Item(by='kilburn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606183218, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25193392, text='&gt; I feel like this would be a lot more significant if you could buy the chip on its own.<p>Oh, totally. I&#x27;m not buying into apple (again) anytime soon, so the only bad thing about M1&#x27;s for me is that I just won&#x27;t have them, no matter how good they are.<p>&gt; But that&#x27;s much the same issue where you&#x27;re comparing it to Zen 2 when Zen 3 is expected to be 20% faster at the same power, and close a lot of that gap.<p>I expect next-gen AMD laptop processors to close the gap either in performance or in power consumption, but not both. Also, power consumption of a laptop is very much a whole-package deal, and Apple really shines here.<p>To be clear, I dislike apple for who they are and where are they leading the personal computing industry, so I won&#x27;t buy from them. Nonetheless, I have to acknowledge that they make some damn fine machines.')
