Also, semes like a textbook example of &quot;eminent domain&quot; abuse?<p>We call this &quot;expropriation&quot; in Canada and it is rarely abused like this.<p>Taking peoples property to give it to a private corporation?  I can understand the need to take property for public use (roads, infra) but the US needs to end eminent domain abuse.  If Foxconn needed the property, go to the landowners and buy it, dont go to the gvt and claim &#x27;road widening&#x27; to kick them off.')
