The last FOSS version got forked by Amazon. This is a good thing if you care about software freedom. Sure, under Amazon it may be a &quot;throw over the wall&quot; model but at least there are open opportunities for the source code to be forked again, and in the meantime at least it&#x27;s being maintained under an FOSS license.')
