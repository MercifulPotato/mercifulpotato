I really liked how they introduced only one feature; that was enough to push me to install and get past &quot;I don&#x27;t know vim, why would I like this&quot;.  I can press &#x27;f&#x27; and type letters to follow links.  No vim-ness.  Just a nice feature.  (You can press &quot;?&quot; to see more features.)<p>(I used an XUL-based web browser with Emacs keybindings many years ago and loved it.  But I had to switch to Chrome, and XUL went away, so I kind of gave up.)')
