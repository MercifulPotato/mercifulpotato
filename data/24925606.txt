Item(by='bigiain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603929768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24920828, text='&gt; Per board fee - priced per component including installation<p>&quot;over-priced per component&quot; might be a better description.<p>As someone else mentioned, they charge you $20 for an ESP32 &quot;block&quot;. That&#x27;s a 33% markup on their ESP32 MicroMod board, and about 1000% markup on retail pricing for the ESP32 bare component. It&#x27;s compatible price wise if your spiders nest hairball has a whole ESP32Thing in it, but there&#x27;s almost certainly gonna be doubling up on connectors, pushbuttons, USB ports&#x2F;controllers, voltage regulators, etc - that it&#x27;d be nice if the ALC magic at least kept the component price as low as the least expensive version they&#x27;ll sell you as a module&#x2F;breakout board.')
