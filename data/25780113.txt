Item(by='sodapopcan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610648931, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25777382, text='I&#x27;m familiar with auto-currying from Haskell I&#x27;ve never worked seriously in a language that has it.  But yes, that makes sense!  I never thought about that.<p>I&#x27;m a bit stuck on your Clojure example still, though.  If a language doesn&#x27;t have auto-currying (or even currying at all in Elixir&#x27;s case), why does the argument order matter?  Whether it&#x27;s a List or a Map, what does it matter if it&#x27;s passed first instead of last?')
