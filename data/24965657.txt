I never heard of a big socialists group who do not want egalitarism to be true egalitarism in the end.<p>And to quote Wikipedia about Pol Pot:<p>&quot;Pursuing complete egalitarianism, money was abolished and all citizens were made to wear the same black clothing.&quot;<p>They were socialist who took the egalitarian aspect very literal and radical. EVERYONE should work the fields. ANYONE who opposed this, was a enemy of egalitarian and revolution. With the known outcome.<p>Negating this by declaring them not socialist I call sophism again. But never mind: what about the cultural revolution in china? China had lots of support from western socialists. \nAnd to me it seems the great cultur revolution was just Pol Pot light.<p>Just what happened anywhere, where socialist ideas of egalitarian were implemented by force: those who do not liked to be made equal, usual a lot of people, had to be put in gulags or shot directly.<p>And it was a interesting quote from Marx. I was not aware of his position. &quot;one will be richer than another&quot; But anyway: he does not solve it.<p>Because this is what we have today: people work harder than other people and become richer. And build something up. (not everyone stole or inherited stolen money).\nAnd do not want to give up on it all of a sudden for egalitarian - so they would oppose the socialist revolution - and would end up in a gulag.')
