I never have looked at either protocols, but I remember that in the days when jabber looked like the next thing, it was strongly criticised for being overly complex and in particular using  xml being unsuitable for a chat protocol. So I&#x27;m wondering if something changed and if you can I&#x27;ve examples of what is complex in matrix but easy in XMPP?')
