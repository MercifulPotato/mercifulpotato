A quick search shows dbus has been in freebsd since 2004, before wayland even existed:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;svnweb.freebsd.org&#x2F;ports&#x2F;head&#x2F;devel&#x2F;dbus&#x2F;Makefile?view=log" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;svnweb.freebsd.org&#x2F;ports&#x2F;head&#x2F;devel&#x2F;dbus&#x2F;Makefile?vi...</a><p>The problem with creating additional wayland-only solutions is that they tend to need good, strong implementations in the toolkits first for it to really make sense over a dbus implementation that already exists. (The wayland api is not particularly friendly for application programmers) The person advocating for the protocol is usually the one who has to implement that.')
