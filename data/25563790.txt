I&#x27;ve literally experienced this when I saw how a film photo of one of my friends come out. He isn&#x27;t super dark skinned, but he is dark enough that this particular film tinted him green! You can&#x27;t tell me that was the photographer&#x27;s fault, can you? Was it my friend&#x27;s fault? No, of course not, and I never said anything to the contrary.<p>I also resent your implication that I meant anything other than that. I never claimed it was the fault of black people,  or that there was anything any individual black person could do about it. I think you should check your bias here.')
