Item(by='helen___keller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603205625, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24828800, text='My main concern with the thought of homeschooling &#x2F; unschooling as a future parent: I feel fairly confident that I could get my kids far ahead of the standard school curriculum, with stronger fundamentals. But I think the school system serves more purpose than just education, and I&#x27;m not convinced my home would be a better school for everything else:<p>Making friends, learning multiple perspectives, learning conflict resolution, learning about diversity, making mistakes and dealing with failure, learning to deal with authority[0]. These are all lessons that I personally would attribute to going through a public education.<p>[0] Just to be clear, dealing with authority isn&#x27;t the same as blind respect for authority. While school tries to teach you blind respect for authority, every student builds their own relationship with authority, probably in combination with the values they learn at home.')
