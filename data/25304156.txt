It’s fascinating as a sort of time capsule, and revealing that programming attitudes do still evolve.<p>Of course we know this. We can observe it in the huge uptake of static typing and functional&#x2F;immutable approaches in areas they were uncommon not so long ago. We can see it in the huge rifts over whether&#x2F;how much to use JS on the web or how to build cross platform UI. But it’s interesting to me to look back and see how dramatically some attitudes have changed on topics that seem almost banal now.')
