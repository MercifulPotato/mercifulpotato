Title transfers <i>before</i> payment is due, since transfer of title is a <i>huge</i> consideration for a myriad of other legal issues, like product liability. Usually, title transfers when received by the retailer, but sometimes it transfers when handed off to the shipper. Actual timing depends on the contract between retailer and manufacturer, and there is an entire body of law dedicated solely to this.<p>Returns to manufacturers (for working&#x2F;undamaged goods) are literally beside the point here, since they only happen for products that simply fail to sell through to end customers, even after substantial discounts by the retailer. Generally, outside of book sales, this happens rarely, and when it does happen the manufacturer almost always just provides discounts on other goods. (For books, returning unsold copies to the publisher is SOP, and the publisher usually takes them back and refunds the store because they want the store to purchase future books. Unlike other retail, book sales are heavily hit-driven and transient, so financial considerations differ.)<p>In the case of new products: for small manufacturers without a record, stock is usually provided on consignment with the manufacturer getting paid after units sell; for big&#x2F;established manufacturers, the stock is purchased by the retailer at a substantial discount from wholesale price or for exchange of services such as marketing efforts by the store to move the product.')
