Indeed, splitting things up is a key part of DRY, since one of the takeaways is that the split-off functionality might be useful for other things.<p>For example (provided the language or framework supports this), you could split the styling functionality of a GenericButton off to some separate function (say withStyle) that merges style rules into an element&#x27;s existing style, and thus instead of having to &quot;change once, fix everywhere&quot; you&#x27;d just invoke that function on the ones where you want to override a style.  And indeed, if you&#x27;re using a specific style change frequently, you could split it into its own specific function and reuse it there.<p>And then - here&#x27;s the best part - chances are there are things other than buttons that could use styles, so if you implemented withStyle (and derived functions) right - tada! - it&#x27;s automatically usable with those other things.  Wanna style a paragraph?  Feed it into withStyle.  Wanna style a text input?  Feed it into withStyle.  Wanna style a picture?  Feed it into withStyle.')
