Item(by='jiveturkey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603823649, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24906940, text='&gt; I imposed the largest financial penalty in our companyâ€™s history on the instigator<p>$0 in zero-valued stock options? I guess technically that is likely the truthfully largest penalty ever because it&#x27;s unlikely that they have <i>ever</i> imposed <i>any</i> financial penalty on any employee. Or, they do have a policy of imposing financial penalties on employees ... I don&#x27;t know which is worse.<p>That said, the zero tolerance being advocated here is not helpful. Based on the story alone, it&#x27;s not as if the women involved were directly being harassed&#x2F;assaulted. This is more a case of locker room banter. It&#x27;s actually lucky this happened in the way it did (ie, with evidence) so that it could be nipped in the bud before possibly escalating.<p>OTOH, Verkada could have and should have done much better than what they did. It doesn&#x27;t even amount to a slap on the wrist. Does anyone even believe that the discipline amounted to more than &quot;don&#x27;t get caught next time&quot;? Laughable. An event like this, for a company like, isn&#x27;t simply an internal matter. There are predictable public-facing repercussions. They have a lot more space between &quot;nothing&quot; (their response) and firing.<p>Well, the CEO has essentially no proper experience in real companies; only the ones he founded. But, he seems like a smart guy and should know better than this.')
