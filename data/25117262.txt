However you might also find it interesting what incompletenesses exist in our own mathematical system (ZFC) -- the most well-known example is the Continuum Hypothesis[1]:<p>&gt; There is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers.<p>Or to put it another way, there exists no intermediate type of infinity between countable infinities (the set of integers) and uncountable infinities (the set of real numbers).<p>The CH is independent of ZFC -- both CH and its negation can be included as new axioms to ZFC and both versions are logically consistent if and only if ZFC is -- meaning that being able to prove the CH is an incompleteness in ZFC.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Continuum_hypothesis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Continuum_hypothesis</a>')
