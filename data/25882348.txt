Several years ago I was running a chat-app network&#x27; platform for privacy focused dating allowing communication between,<p>Messenger &lt;-&gt; Telegram &lt;-&gt; Viber &lt;-&gt; LINE<p>First major issue I ran into was that in SE Asian countries many used their children photographs for profile picture in chat apps, which obviously was a no go for dating, so I had to implement Amazon Rekognition to detect age, make those users change their profile picture and their profiles weren&#x27;t displayed until it was changed. At peak it processed 200,000 images&#x2F;month.<p>But Amazon&#x27;s model was biased and resulted in several false positives for darker skin color marking several adults as children; But since false positives were better than false negatives for this case I went on with it. Amazon told me that they are working on fixing their model, not sure whether it has improved.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;tiktok-app-moderators-users-discrimination&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;tiktok-app-moderators-us...</a>')
