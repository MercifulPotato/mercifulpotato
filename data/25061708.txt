The only thing I use that actually uses that speed in practice is my Gaming PC&#x27;s Steam updates, everything else takes a herculean effort.  Speed testing websites are basically reporting their own bandwidth restrictions to me.<p>Even with that bandwidth, torrents struggle to perform at those kinds of speeds, and everything else is pretty much going to max out around 100mbps.<p>I have no idea what I would actually do with 10x more bandwidth.  I could theoretically fill an entire 16TB hard drive with stuff in one day, but there&#x27;s not a compelling need for that, at least not for more than a single day.')
