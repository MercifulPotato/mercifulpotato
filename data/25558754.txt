Cosmopolitan proves that it&#x27;s possible to just fix C instead<p>This doesn&#x27;t sound like a fair comparison. WASM isn&#x27;t just providing portability, it&#x27;s also providing security and runtime safety. Cosmopolitan doesn&#x27;t, it presumably requires you to trust the codebase, and doesn&#x27;t protect you from C&#x27;s undefined behaviour. Of course, WASM also imposes a considerable performance penalty, I presume the Cosmopolitan approach easily outperforms WASM.<p>&gt; This is probably how Java would have been designed, if Intel&#x27;s instruction set hadn&#x27;t been encumbered by patents at the time.<p>To mirror the comment by Someone, I sincerely doubt this. Java bytecode is a very high level stack-based IR, nothing like a CPU ISA. They could easily have made it resemble a CPU ISA if they&#x27;d wanted to. The lesser-known <i>GNU Lightning</i> JIT engine takes this approach, for instance.')
