Then the popular Focus will be shifted away from the problem, and freelancing will remain difficult in California in perpetuity.<p>That would be the worst possible outcome. \nMy understanding is the whole reason for the existence of AB 5 is for ride share and food delivery. \nMight as well repeal AB5 if this proposition passes.<p>If you are a California voter, please vote NO on this nonsensical proposition!<p>for others like me who are outside California<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201019194140&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;California_Proposition_22,_App-Based_Drivers_as_Contractors_and_Labor_Policies_Initiative_%282020%29" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201019194140&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotped...</a><p>&gt; What is Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5)?<p>&gt; AB 5 established a three-factor test to decide a worker&#x27;s status as an independent contractor. The three-factor test requires that (1) the worker is free from the hiring company&#x27;s control and direction in the performance of work; (2) the worker is doing work that is outside the company&#x27;s usual course of business; and (3) the worker is engaged in an established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.<p>&gt; Who is behind the campaigns surrounding Proposition 22?<p>&gt; On August 30, 2019, three companies—DoorDash, Lyft, and Uber—each placed $30 million into campaign accounts to fund a ballot initiative campaign should the legislature pass AB 5 without compromising with the companies. &quot;We remain focused on reaching a deal, and are confident about bringing this issue to the voters if necessary,&quot; said Lyft spokesperson Adrian Durbin.[10][11][12] Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed AB 5 on September 18 without an exemption for app-based drivers and employers. The ballot initiative was filed on October 29, 2019. Brandon Castillo, a spokesperson for the campaign supporting the initiative, stated, &quot;We&#x27;re going to spend what it takes to win. It&#x27;s been widely reported that three of the companies already shifted $90 million, but we&#x27;re still in the early phases. The bottom line is: We&#x27;re committed to passing this.&quot;[13] The companies Instacart (Maplebear, Inc.) and Postmates also joined the campaign.[14]<p>&gt; Through September 23, 2020, Yes on Proposition 22 received $184.3 million, which is the most funds that an initiative campaign has ever received in California (not adjusted for inflation). Uber contributed $50 million, Lyft provided $48 million, DoorDash contrubuted $47 million, InstaCart provided $28 million, and Postmates provided $11 million.<p>&gt; The campaign No on Prop 22 received $10.7 million. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, SEIU-UHW West, Service Employees International Union, United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Local 770, and United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Western States Issues PAC—labor unions or union-affiliated committees—were the top-five donors to No on Prop 22.')
