Manufacturing goods would be the easiest asset any country could produce - trying to own an asset in a foreign nation is an expensive endeavor that requires military might (the middle east probably being the most pertinent example). Trying to collect rents requires the maintenance of an international legal system that will rule fairly. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible, but that manufacturing requires way less overhead to maintain.')
