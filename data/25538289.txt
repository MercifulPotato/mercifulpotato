I think the subtractive &#x2F; additive distinction is kind of leading people off on a tangent away from what the author was trying to say, or at least what I was took from what the author said.<p>Really I think what the author was getting at is there are some things that if you don&#x27;t do them, it&#x27;s easy for someone else to do them. And there are other things that if you don&#x27;t do them, no one else is realistically going to come back and take care of them for you. And the whole &quot;shape&quot; analogy is just pointing out that some shapes are easier to fill around than others.<p>Regarding the whole subtractive vs additive thing, you could build a statue either way. You could carve away at a block of stone, or you could build it up with clay. Both get you a statue at the end. I think some of it just depends on how your mind works.<p>The thing the article talks about is more of a strategic vs procedural type of distinction I think. Part of being more effective is knowing where to put your effort, and it&#x27;s a difficult thing to point out to people that their view of what is productive doesn&#x27;t align with the actual needs of the project.')
