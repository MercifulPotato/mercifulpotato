HTTP was designed with caching in mind, so the idea was that if you GET a page it should more or less not change and you could add headers and stuff to instruct proxy servers about whether to cache or not and for how long. I think you could use HEAD then to check if a page had changed ...<p>Nothing in the HTTP spec has changed about this AFAIK. The internet still behaves this way.<p>&gt; Anyway, you can no longer take this approach because bad people broke the Internet and now you have to have a great honking opaque TLS layer between you and the caching servers so there&#x27;s no way for this optimisation to work any more.<p>You could certainly still do this, you just need to import the proxy&#x27;s CA certificate into your browser. It&#x27;s just not possible to do to others on your network without consent now. (This is a security feature, not a bug.)')
