The churn rate was insane.  Many of the teams I worked on have churned so much not one member is still there I worked with - in a space of 18-24 months (this was pre-COVID).<p>It is also worth noting a 12 month fixed term contract for any new full-time employee is standard.  Due to Dutch employment law, the employer only has to offer a perm contract after a number of years (after the 3rd I think).  This hardly encourages career growth and it if it takes 12 months to be &quot;up to speed&quot; you would have been fired already!<p>At the end of those 12 months they don&#x27;t have to offer you anything more.  Struggling and need extra training? Nope, you&#x27;re gone.  Particular project changing course (new CTO, new management)?  Nope, you&#x27;re gone.\nPay rise?  Lucky for 1% without threatening to leave... but other companies will add 15% for a new contract in a similar role. It&#x27;s a no-brainer.<p>There was no sense of loyalty on either side.<p>The large professional network I made in the city helped enormously and heard about open positions on a weekly basis.<p>Now I am in a new role (outside of the Netherlands) where I genuinely hope I can stay with the company for many years and have a long career with them (with opportunities to progress internally). Their niche is something which I believe in and have a sense of pride about what they do.')
