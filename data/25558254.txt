So I was suggesting there is still plenty of headroom for panel manufacturers to improve their product by integrating micro inverters and inteligence and such. Incidentally I think you technically have Solar edge optimizers, slightly different from micro inverters, hence why you still need an inverter, a blurry distinction admittedly.')
