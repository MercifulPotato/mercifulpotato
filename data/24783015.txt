Identifying where and how you can make a difference better than other people, making that your elevator pitch, and broadcasting that to people who need that difference in their lives.<p>I&#x27;m not impressed by the other comments arguing reaching people in positions of impact is next to impossible, at least in tech. There are two high-schoolers right now in the latest batch of YCombinator who literally cold-called Sam Altman for funding, and got it (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;11&#x2F;2-teens-cold-call-sam-altman-become-youngest-accepted-to-y-combinator.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;11&#x2F;2-t...</a>).<p>This isn&#x27;t even that crazy a way to connect with people. I once knew a recruiter who was fanatically inventive about connecting with people - he once got a cybersecurity consultant who was perfectly happy with his existing job to switch roles by (1) using the Wayback machine to find copies of the engineer&#x27;s (taken-down) personal website, where he had his Foursquare link, (2) using the Foursquare API to figure out he enjoyed playing chess at his local club and would frequent a bar, (3) showing up at said bar, striking up a conversation about chess with him, getting him to talk about his job, casually slipping in that he&#x27;s a recruiter for company X looking for someone exactly like him, and leaving a business card behind.<p>This is not an endorsement of that guy&#x27;s method - just a reminder that there are crazier things in life to do than picking up the phone and trying your luck.')
