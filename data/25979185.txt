It would also make a lot of voters angry because they still pay taxes, but &quot;those bureaucrats in Washington DC exempted themselves from taxes.&quot;  I can see the speeches now.<p>Approximately 50% of American politicians are anti-government as an ideology, and use the argument of &quot;cutting overpaid government salaries&quot; as a plank in their economic policy, so having well-paid gov&#x27;t staff is just &quot;waste&quot; in their minds.<p>As far as teachers go, they are not employed by the federal government.  In most states they are county-level employees and the counties obviously do not have authority to dictate federal income tax levels.')
