Hell, the first PC in our family was bought specifically for this purpose.<p>All this wasn&#x27;t perceived as weird or unusual, because during communism working Saturdays were the norm. The parents of my friends would also be mostly absent, making the most of the rapid economic growth of the 90s. Unemployment was also fairly high, so it&#x27;s not like they had much of a choice in the matter.<p>This environment created a management culture that either doesn&#x27;t feel the need to improve and innovate(because you can always leverage the low cost of employment or put pressure on workers) or doesn&#x27;t even know <i>how</i> to do that, so it experiments a lot - with mixed results.')
