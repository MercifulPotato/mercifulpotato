Used properly, a system like this could be a boon to the forestry industry, invasive species management, and forest fire fighting and prevention, among other things.<p>A friend did his PhD in lidar mapping of trees and forests, with a focus on identifying risk trees.  He primarily focused on roadside trees that were a danger to drivers, but that was in part due to the ease of lidar mapping from a vehicle.  He did trials with drone imaging, but they had to be manually controlled, which made them no better than people.<p>I live near a national park, and they average several lost hikers and roughly one death a year.  The majority of those are due to poor planning and injury (FFS always check in at a ranger station, tell someone your schedule&#x2F;route, and stay on the trial if you are injured!).  A system like this with thermal cameras could find injured people much faster than a search party every could.<p>Half the battle of fighting a forest fire is understanding its location and boundaries, and tracking&#x2F;predicting its movement.  A system like this could be augmented with smoke particulate sensors and thermal cameras.<p>Many ecosystems are being devastated by invasive species.  Wild hogs, anacondas, airborne pests.  Early attempts to track &#x27;murder&#x27; hornets were hampered because the scientists could not follow their transponders effectively.')
