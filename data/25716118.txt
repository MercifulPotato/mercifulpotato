For me reading about this worst market timer was actually quite comforting because it&#x27;s assuming the unrealistic worst-case scenario in terms of timing coupled with level-headed behaviour afterwards.<p>There was also a study done by Vanguard which showed that historically, dollar-cost averaging underperforms lump-sum investments which was just as interesting to me.')
