Item(by='SPBS', descendants=None, kids=[25344006], score=None, time=1607398067, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25340259, text='This website covers every nitty gritty detail of javascript, even DOM specific aspects like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;javascript.info&#x2F;bubbling-and-capturing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;javascript.info&#x2F;bubbling-and-capturing</a> (just look at how well it is written). I would be highly surprised if it did not even mention those javascript basics. A brief look at its table of contents shows that indeed it mentions those, and I am baffled why the other commentor is getting downvoted for calling you out.')
