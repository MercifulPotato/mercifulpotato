Item(by='burntoutfire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611867007, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25945058, text='&gt; Now, it’s not always the case _if_ you can get the tenants to coöperate and pitch in on basic maintenance and keep anti social behavior at bay ala Singapore, but my feeling is we’re not of the same mindset as Singaporeans.<p>I live in Soviet-style housing in Poland. The antisocial behavior of some tenants (it seems that there&#x27;s always at least one) is something you learn to live with. Over the years, you start ignoring the occasional puke in the hallway or automatically put on headphones when someone next to you starts blaring loud music again. All in all, given how much people pay for such flats in Poland, my guess is that it would be totally acceptable for most people to deal with the inconveniences, if the flat was free as a part of the UBI.')
