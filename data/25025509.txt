Researchers showed that 1%ish of keys they found on the internet are bad, not that 1% of traffic is susceptible.<p>From having studied this in a large enterprise setting more recently, there is in fact a really high prevalence of junk keys but much of it is concentrated in self signed certs and other garbage.  Voip devices, printers, and management cards.  Roca, internet of shit etc.  The last big issue that hit the a high proportion of traffic was maybe the debian debacle from 2008.<p>Now, is this better or worse you decide, but it is a different claim.<p>The keys that do the vast bulk of traffic generally come from respectable implementations.')
