Reducing the need for <i>other</i> forms of local government taxation, given that the municipality is well-run and not corrupt.<p>Beneficial side effects are incentivizing power efficiency, since capital-intensive efforts like insulating your house and installing a heat exchanger are only profitable if electricity prices are high.<p>Another dramatically undersold benefit is that Norwegian municipalities are effectively well-paid pumped storage operators when continental European power prices are low or negative, which effectively reduces the effective &quot;synthetic&quot; power bill taxation, while retaining its income to the municipalities.<p>Authorities and publicly owned power companies have really screwed the pooch on explaining these benefits to the public.<p>Given these benefits, retaining ownership of the hydropower companies in the hands of the public is super important. If they&#x27;re sold to private owners, it&#x27;s basically tantamount to allowing private owners to purchase tax collection rights. And honestly, screw that.')
