Why didn&#x27;t they use the same GPIO header as a full-sized Raspberry Pi? That would allow people to reuse some of the same headers. Seems like a missed opportunity there?<p>2. Since it has no WiFi and it costs more, this compares unfavorably with the good old ESP8266 in some important respects. Why would you pick the Pico?<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m being downvoted to hell. I&#x27;m sure that the new Pico will find buyers, in fact, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it sells out based on brand recognition alone. I&#x27;m just trying to ask some legitimate questions as to what this has to offer over the competition in the microcontroller space, which is a crowded market, and how it fits into the existing RPi ecosystem.')
