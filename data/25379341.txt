The experience is stellar. For many years I used outdated sites like cottagesincanada.com or cottagesquebec.com, it was a nightmarish experience of looking for available cottage during the pandemic. I just gave up and used AirBnB. Sure I paid hundreds of dollars in fees and whatnot but it&#x27;s just so much better experience (searching,reviews...). (And yeah, no  hotels for travel so no Expedia in pandemic)')
