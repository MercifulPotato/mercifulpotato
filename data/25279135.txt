I would like to understand more about this, however.<p>I&#x27;ve asked about this but the &quot;stock answer&quot; is always along the lines of &quot;The company owns the equipment, therefore they can do anything they want.&quot;<p>That stock answer leaves out a WHOLE LOT OF DETAIL about exactly what info is collected, how it&#x27;s processed and some guidance about what&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; vs &quot;extraordinary&quot;. Presumably it&#x27;s possible for them to do &quot;a lot&quot;, but no one who really knows is willing to explain this in a way that&#x27;s useful. This would make a very interesting essay or in-depth investigative journalism article, I just don&#x27;t understand why no one has done that, all writing about this just seems to boil down to the very boring &quot;the computer equipment belongs to your employer&quot; analysis.<p>I suspect that the vast majority of organizations do very little with this kind of surveillance power, but then, there&#x27;s no way I can really know because either people stay silent about it or they have no idea.')
