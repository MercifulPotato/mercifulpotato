This is the epitome of an elitist attitude, isn&#x27;t it? Reeks of privilege, honestly, and that&#x27;s not a term I use lightly, considering how abused it is today. You must be <i>so</i> much smarter than all these people, because you agree with the mainstream take on everything. How high status of you! Why, if we had a class system, I&#x27;d have to assume that you view yourself as a Brahmin, and these millions as Untouchables who are not fit to make their own decisions about what information they consume.<p>This is a morally reprehensible attitude. You would turn over people&#x27;s freedom to corporate gatekeepers and pretend that it&#x27;s &quot;for their own good&quot;. Do you understand what it means to be an apparatchik? By saying things like this, you make it clear that this is the role you&#x27;re hoping to take on for yourself under the coming totalitarian liberalist system. Do you also inform on your neighbours?<p>&gt; what’s right is subjective<p>What an easy way to weasel out of moral accountability. OK, if that&#x27;s true, then for me and for millions of other people, &quot;what&#x27;s right&quot; is absolute freedom of speech, extending to online, even when it makes people mad or uncomfortable to have to confront ideas they disagree with.')
