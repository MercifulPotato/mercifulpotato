Telephoto is a specific category of long-focal lenses, where the focal length is longer than the lens itself - that is achieved using a special lens element that isn&#x27;t present in regular long lenses. (as for the &quot;high focal length&quot;, I guess it&#x27;s just a language quirk as it makes perfect sense in my native language)<p>Looking at the math, cropping a picture taken with a 28mm lens to the equivalent of 300mm is a crop factor of 0.093. Using the highest-res camera I&#x27;ve used (a Sony A7R IV) at 61MP, this results in a photo of around 900x600 pixels - not something you&#x27;d ever see published and taking into account the significant amount of noise that is unavoidable at that pixel density, the photo would be utterly unusable even at that resolution.<p>So sure, it&#x27;s a distance effect, but since no sane person would do that kind of crop and if they did, it would be painfully obvious or at least highly suspicious-looking to most people (also keep in mind the DoF!), it&#x27;s pretty safe to conclude that this effect will be significant only with telephoto lenses.')
