The post is long gone, but it was entitled &quot;The Secret to memcached&quot; -- the advice, which is incredibly obvious in retrospect but wasn&#x27;t to me at the time, is to manage cache invalidation by adding a unique ID to the cached asset, and letting the cache fill and expire items on its own. Going into it, I had assumed I should be removing cached items in the code that was utilizing the cache. I was ignorant. I still am, but less so about memcached. Thanks, Tobias!')
