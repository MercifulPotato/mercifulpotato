Computers are _fast_, especially when you use all CPU cores. ES6 is not bad, but Rust is joy to use. Tooling is solid, and doesn&#x27;t need periodical `rm -rf node_modules`. It&#x27;s easier to peel off and debug compile-time abstractions than runtime&#x2F;VM abstractions.<p>However, you mention &quot;politics&quot; and freedom how you program. I don&#x27;t think that has anything to do with whether you write high-level or low-level code. If you work for an organization, you&#x27;ll have to deal with management, whether you write JS widgets or firmware for a microwave. Programmers bikeshed at all levels, if it&#x27;s not whether to use CSS-in-JS, then whether to use spinlocks.<p>The real, technical constraints of bare metal have sparked decades-long microkernel flamewars.')
