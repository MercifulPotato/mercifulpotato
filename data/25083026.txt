Obama might have been ineffective against Russia and China, but Trump has been worse in every possible way. With China, his &quot;hardline&quot; stance is all rhetorical; it hasn&#x27;t hurt China at all, and has hurt America substantially. And with Russia, Trump has been a massive enabler. Not only did his campaign seek out foreign election interference from Russia, but when caught, went through substantial efforts to pin the blame on Ukraine. And he is constantly groveling on behalf of Putin, begging to invite him into the G7, even doing so after knowing that Russia was putting bounties on American soldiers&#x27; heads. And don&#x27;t stop there, Trump is hands down the most corrupt executive officer in the history of the US...dozens of personally appointed staff ended up with criminal convictions, so much that he had to appoint a new Attorney General just to get the convictions to stop.<p>There is no world in which any criticism of Obama, or any other politician, Democrat or Republican, should lead someone to support Trump. I too did not like Obama and refused to vote for him for his second term, but I would vote for a flaming turd in a paper bag on my doorstep over Trump or anyone that supports him.')
