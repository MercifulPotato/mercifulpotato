Item(by='valyala', descendants=None, kids=[25320119], score=None, time=1607182497, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25290171, text='&gt; Does anyone have any quick checklist or metrics to make decisions like this? When does it make sense to evolve from a vanilla RDB to a timeseries one?<p>10 daily metrics for 350 entities result in `10 * 350=3.5K` reading per day. This translates to `3.5K * 365=1.3M` readings per year. Such workload can be easily handled by any DBMS out there. There is no need to search for specialized time series database for this workload.<p>The need in specialized TSDB solutions arises when ingestion rate reaches a million of readings per second and the number of readings stored in the database exceeds hundreds of billions and trillions. Such a workload cannot be handled by general-purpose database, but it is easily handled by specialized databases such as VictoriaMetrics. Fun fact that it easily handles 10 trillions (e.g. 10K billions) of readings in a single-node setup - see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;victoriametrics.github.io&#x2F;CaseStudies.html#wixcom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;victoriametrics.github.io&#x2F;CaseStudies.html#wixcom</a>')
