But perhaps someone with more background can explain to a lay person -- what even is a force?<p>Why does the existence of a transformation that makes movement under a supposed force actually follow a straight line mean it&#x27;s not really a force? For the other forces (e.g. electromagnetism) can we say that there&#x27;s _no way_ to exhibit a transformation that causes charged particles travel on &quot;straight&quot; lines?')
