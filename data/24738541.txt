This does not increase the Chinese government&#x27;s influence; on the contrary, it will require influence to get the recipient countries to pay back at least part of the amount.<p>It would be different if the payments had been conditional on doing whatever the Chinese government wants, but most of the lending up to 2016 was made with little oversight (which is why the sum is so high) and only after several high-profile project failures (e.g. the port of Hambantota, where after a debt-for-equity swap, a Chinese consortium is stuck operating it to try recoup the construction costs), the criteria for issuing new loans were made more strict, similar to those of other institutions like the World Bank.<p>The bitter lesson for the Chinese development finance industry is that &quot;publicly guaranteed debt&quot; is not very guaranteed when a new government comes to power every few years and wants to renegotiate the terms of agreements made with the previous government.')
