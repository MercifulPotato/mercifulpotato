This could be a good proof point for derisking the Toyota case. However, Apple is pretty secretive and they often surprise us. There is a lot of design space deviation possible in a complex product like a car. Until we know what that product delta is, we cant really assess Toyotaâ€™s ability to pivot quickly enough. Apple wouldnt invest if the delta on what they can offer is small. So should be interesting.')
