However, I imagine the SEC requires notice of more than overnight on such action which is probably why they have simply stopped trading those issues.<p>The failure on the brokers then was in not gradually raising the margin requirements the past two weeks when it became obvious that this was a volatility disaster in the making.<p>The failure of the regulators was, if correct, allowing shorts to be &gt; 100% of the float.  They were asleep and should have had a hammer on any dealers who were lending fictious shares.')
