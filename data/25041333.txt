Same as when I review a restaurant, I&#x27;m reviewing the service and food, not just the food. Even now that I&#x27;ve learned there&#x27;s a separate area to review the seller, I can barely be bothered to leave one review, so I&#x27;m likely not going to take the time to leave two. Honestly, they&#x27;re lucky I&#x27;m even leaving one honest review, since I&#x27;m under no obligation to do so. And like others, I&#x27;ve had my critical reviews get deleted, and I&#x27;ve even received emails from Amazon with vague threats about them, so they really don&#x27;t encourage me to care much.')
