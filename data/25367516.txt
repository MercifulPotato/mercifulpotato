All he&#x27;s posted that I can find is a 42min long video I can&#x27;t be bothered watching properly, but skipping through it his methodology seems to rely on surveying people <i>now</i> and comparing to voting records. This - of course - isn&#x27;t &quot;finding potentially illegal votes&quot;.<p>But maybe I missed something. I do think it&#x27;s interesting that his Twitter profile says he&#x27;s releasing &quot;data and reports&quot; a week from Nov 24, and there is nothing.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting how much of his video is about asking for donations......')
