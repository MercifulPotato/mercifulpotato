We know what it’s good for, and we can easily imagine what it could be good for, if only Apple would set it free.<p>Of course there is question... The Ipad was a tremendous success for Apple. In fact, the M1 is possible because tablets in general and phones sell so much compared to normal computers that have made the price of those ARM semiconductors way lower than Intel&#x27;s or AMD.<p>It has not struggled in anything. When I wanted to know if making an Ipad app made sense economically for me I stayed an entire day on a big Apple store and they sold like 50 on a normal day. They sold like 3 or 4 macbooks.<p>It looks geeks believe that companies are out there to satisfy them. But companies are there to sell products to as much people as possible.')
