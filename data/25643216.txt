If I play a grand master (or indeed just any moderately competent player) 10 times, I will lose all 10. But assuming we share who starts, white will win 5 times and black will win 5 times.<p>Further, for some random chess tournament, I&#x27;m guessing the win ratio for black&#x2F;white is close to 50&#x2F;50 (perhaps white is a bit ahead for having first mover advantage - which is stipulated as ignored in the article)<p>It turns out the result of the game has lots to do with the player, and Little to do with the color, which makes the alien first model simple, accurate, and completely wrong.')
