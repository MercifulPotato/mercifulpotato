Its something that has the almost impossible task of working out what the user wanted and not what they asked for.<p>Maybe most of your problems are a single letter mistake or a keyboard slip up but where good spell checkers shine is they know what you want even when you are miles off. I find googles spell checking to be exceptional at understanding the mapping between how a word sounds like and what it actually is even when they share very few letters in common.<p>An easy example of what I mean is if the input is &quot;shivon&quot; and the spell checker is able to correct this to &quot;Siobh√°n&quot; because it knows this is how users try to spell it when they have no idea. A simple algorithm isn&#x27;t able to do this because there are no logical rules of english to follow here, you would likely need a massive amount of user data to train on to solve this test case.')
