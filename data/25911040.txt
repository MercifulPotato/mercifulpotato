The key insight here is that cell reproduction doesn&#x27;t happen out of nothing, it&#x27;s always an existing mechanism working on a new mechanism.<p>The seminal paper of Ken Thompson, &quot;Reflections on Trusting Trust&quot; (1984)[0], demonstrates how you can encode a backdoor in a compiler in such a way that the compiler embeds this backdoor in every program it builds, <i>and</i> embeds the backdoor-embedding machinery in every new compiler binary it builds. You can use it to build a &quot;vanilla&quot; compiler and make it backdoor-embedding, even though the source code doesn&#x27;t have backdoor-embedding instructions in it.<p>I suspect similar things happen in biology - there is computationally relevant information embedded in the runtime state, that&#x27;s not explicitly encoded in the DNA - but it carries on, because every new living cell is built by a previous living cell.<p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~rdriley&#x2F;487&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~rdriley&#x2F;487&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Thompson_1984_Ref...</a>')
