My understanding is that restrictions are pretty minimal apart from strict control of travelers. So either there is basically no community spread or it&#x27;s likely to be rampant - and then the hospitals would be overflowing like they are in the US, which is much much harder to cover up. I don&#x27;t see how we can come to a conclusion other than that they&#x27;ve been quite successful.')
