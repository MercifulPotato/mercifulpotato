For us math majors, who instead of 95 had to take Ma108, it tended to haunt us.<p>For years or even decades afterwards the number 108 would show up. Call a busy tech support line and get put in queue, and you are told &quot;The average wait time right now is 108 minutes&quot;. Check after lunch to see if it is time to go back to work...it&#x27;s 1:08. That number would just show up way more often then it should have.<p>I know one person who fought back. She took the intro to digital electronics class and the intro digital electronics lab class in her senior year, instead of in her freshman year like most people did, which means she took them after 108.<p>For her electronics lab project she built herself a digital alarm clock (the traditional project). But her clock was special. It skipped 1:08, instead holding 1:07 for two minutes than going to 1:09.')
