This is even true if the original thesis of &quot;we can pump this stock to $1000&quot; is true<p>This is what I&#x27;ve been thinking about the whole time. They can definitely pump the stock if they keep HODLing, since sellers effectively set the price when the short positions have to be closed.<p>Someone still has to be the bagholder and end up holding near worthless stock at the end of this though.<p>$GME will come crashing down once the short squeeze is over, and there&#x27;s only going to be a small minority of retail traders who get out at the top.<p>People who have bought in later at hundreds of dollars are likely to lose a lot of money IMO. Possibly to the tune of over half their initial investment.')
