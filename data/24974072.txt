There&#x27;s a large area in between EC2 and racking your own boxes in your own datacenter. You can buy dedicated machines from OVH or similar firms with lead time of a few days, and it&#x27;s a very rare firm that can&#x27;t predict their load a week in advance .. even for a fast growing company.<p>Look at it like this; GitHub mostly ran in their own datacenter using AWS only for spillover capacity.
