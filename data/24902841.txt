Twitter is within its right to do whatever it wants, but I don&#x27;t want it curating my feed anymore than I want my phone to decide who I can and can&#x27;t text message. And while I&#x27;m resigned to the fact that there will be <i>some</i> moderation on Twitter, to remove a longstanding newspaper for publishing a dubious story is an absurd overreach. They can do it, but it&#x27;s a silly, foolish way to run a social network.')
