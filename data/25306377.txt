Most people already have an email solution, so I think you need to make it clear how yours is different and why that might be better for them.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve already got Fastmail&#x27;s standard plan ($5&#x2F;month if purchased on a month-to-month basis). That allows 600 aliases, 8000 receives per day, 8000 sends per day, 30 GB email storage, 10 GB file storage. Your $5&#x2F;month plan has bigger limits for some of those, and smaller limits for some of those, but I&#x27;m not seeing anything that tells me I might find your service useful either in addition to or as a replacement for Fastmail.<p>For email, I think a lot of people are going to lean toward an established provider in the hopes that this increases the chances of them being around long term.')
