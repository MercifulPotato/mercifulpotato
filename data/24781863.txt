A passable job for the minority of students that have developed the academic skills to some amount of critical thinking. Most teenagers cannot do that, because their brains need in the ballpark of 5 more years of maturing. What most students learn out of that kind of education are two things: &quot;I am stupid&quot; and &quot;Academic fraud is Ok, everybody does it&quot;.<p>Classical education recognizes that fact, and instead of trying to push for a level of abstraction that most cannot yet achieve, they train for concrete skills that will be useful now and in the future. It is Ok to plant the seeds of abstraction and critical thinking at a young age, but you should combine it with specific examples of people using those skills. You learn the results of abstraction first, then you get to see how abstraction was applied to get those results. Much later, if you are so inclined, you will be presented with opportunities to do some abstraction of your own.')
