However, it&#x27;s not because of anything Apple&#x27;s done in particular, but because I&#x27;m in the process of fully transitioning my workflow to the cloud, and using a laptop only as a thin client.<p>Of course, there will always be a need for running dev toolchains locally, but I wonder how many other people are like me who would rather use Linux over an internet connection, and really only need a terminal emulator and an IDE.')
