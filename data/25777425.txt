Offering the Program as a Service seems pretty vague. Here&#x27;s the part I don&#x27;t understand.<p>&gt; Making the functionality of the Program or modified version available to third parties as a service includes, without limitation, enabling third parties to interact with the functionality of the Program or modified version remotely through a computer network, offering a service the value of which entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the Program or modified version.<p>Does this include services you don&#x27;t charge for? For example I might offer services for marketing reasons. At what point is the service no longer primarily derived from the Program? For example if I build an application that offers query capabilities but does not expose the Program API, does that count?<p>For contrast GPL V2 worked because it tied virality to linking, which is pretty easy to validate.')
