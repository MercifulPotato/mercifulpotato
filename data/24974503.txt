There are two trains running perpendicularly.  The &quot;mezzanine&quot; is the first floor with the blue line platform.  Yes, additional stairs&#x2F;elevators could help, as well as timing changes.<p>It&#x27;s simply one of the busiest stations due to its location.<p>The huge mezzanine in the other stations such as at Pershing is mostly wasted space however.')
