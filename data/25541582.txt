But this attitude of superiority &amp; certainty, this conviction that these language features are never the right answer?<p>&gt; I’m not motivated by fear, I’m motivated by experience.<p>In my experience, teams &amp; individuals can have a lot of bad sad mad anecdotes they make for themselves. But other people can find &amp; use the same tools &amp; techniques very stably, successfully, &amp; to good effect.<p>I don&#x27;t fully believe you, that you have this experience. That you&#x27;ve earned this ability to trash &amp; insult a rather-wide piece of JavaScript &amp; it&#x27;s use. In a complete &amp; total way, you&#x27;ve said no, that you alone are the only important voice &amp; that you have total knowledge. This isn&#x27;t only harsh... it&#x27;s other unfavorable things too.<p>Meddling with descriptors is absolutely something that can go wrong, and it&#x27;s very hard to know it really for sure is a good case- often you&#x27;d be better without. But there are also many good cases where these techniques &amp; knowledge of them is absolutely divine, enables really nice solutions. If you need to instrument some existing 3rd party objects? Fantastic, absolutely fantastic.')
