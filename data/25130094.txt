I&#x27;m 35<p>The first one, picture perfect. I could feel my body &quot;go to battle&quot; there was this sense of pride and drive. I felt like I was fulfilling a part of my life that was absolutely necessary.<p>The second one, we failed. Pre-mature by 3 weeks. Bacterial meningitis within 4 days of her being home. She&#x27;s here with us now but she suffers from global sensory deficits, CP and retardation. It was the polar opposite of my first experience. Pure torture.<p>The biology of fatherhood is a powerful one, it can give - just as much as it can take. \nFor anyone who&#x27;s a father out there, without a connection to their child, especially a healthy one. You&#x27;re missing out. \nFor any fathers out there who have had to endure failure, you are not alone and those children need love too.')
