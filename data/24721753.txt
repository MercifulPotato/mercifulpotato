So you could get the &quot;typing&quot; indication <i>after you had received the message</i>. It was often out of order, and very confusing.<p>Our message app (Sococo) was rigorous about sending activity messages, from peer to peer. Not periodically; just when typing began or &#x27;timed out&#x27;, or when focus was gained or lost (desktop app). So a minimum of messages got sent, not the barrage of ping-style message the other guys sent.')
