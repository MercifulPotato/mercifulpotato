Sometimes a person goes on TV sloganeering in favor of spousal abuse, inflaming who knows how many actual abusers out there to believe it’s ok &amp; feel emboldened to keep doing it - real material harm. Sometimes that really, really is only bad, and by never retracting or apologizing, that person doesn’t leave reasonable people any choice but to see that this extreme harmful behavior outweighs pretty much everything else.')
