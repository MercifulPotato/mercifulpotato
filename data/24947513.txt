Is it a sales pitch or not? If it is, even when it says it isn&#x27;t, I would start by looking at Arcan&#x27;s bus factor, and what refactoring and architectural changes were necessary along the years.<p>Having no expertise in this field I have no patience for people who write in this style but never got involved in the process. But if they did then I would be more interested in reading why their proposal was better and what can be done <i>now</i> in the living code. Also IIUC protocols are exactly that, places to experiment and learn from mistakes until they get stable and anyone can propose them.<p>There are many developers who could write a good technical solution but it&#x27;s the ones who can deal with the ugly politics that make a real difference. There&#x27;s a phrase about that there but as always if you don&#x27;t send code your opinion won&#x27;t do any good.')
