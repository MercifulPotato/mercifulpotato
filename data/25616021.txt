These numbers are definitely outside of the goals.<p>I appreciate the call out of &quot;page to complete rendering and the progress bar at the top of the screen to disappear&quot; and &quot;until the issue, comment and buttons have all loaded&quot;.  In a dream world of course, everything would load in &lt; 1s (everything drawn, everything interactive), but working our way down to that will take time.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking at each use case to understand the &#x27;(a) paint faster vs (b) interactive faster&#x27; tradeoff and trying to decide which cases the user has a better experience with (a) or (b).  In Confluence this is clearer in some places than in others, but in Jira it&#x27;s less clear I think (I work on Confluence, I probably shouldn&#x27;t speak for Jira specifics).<p>It always comes down to a limitation of resources though, which is why we&#x27;re always hoping to get as specific feedback as possible.')
