Scheme is quite dogmatically a functional programming language, Common Lisp is decidedly a multi-paradigm language.  With that it shouldn&#x27;t surprise that the article&#x27;s author chose to write into a string in an imperative programming style.  I don&#x27;t think it would raise eyebrows in the Common Lisp community.  There&#x27;s more than one way to do it.')
