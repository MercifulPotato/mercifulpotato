In this case, the font’s already quite a wide font, and the further bump definitely makes the letter spacing unnatural and slightly hinders reading. I could tell as soon as I opened the page that extra letter-spacing was used.<p>(I also wouldn’t mind the font size being increased from 15px back to 16px.)')
