Still impressed I have the same phone number from Google for a decade and a half. Been around long enough that I got 100 custom business cards from the Goog when I signed up.<p>I&#x27;d take it just because it meant I never again had to send out a &#x27;New number!&#x27;, but being able to search through every text message ive sent or received since 2007 and download voicemails is just more icing.<p>Totally get people who dont want google to have more of their data, but for those who don&#x27;t mind, Google Voice is seriously one of the most underappreciated services out there.')
