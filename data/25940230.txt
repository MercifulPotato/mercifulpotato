Glad you finally get it.<p>Huh, are you confusing me with someone here? I argued precisely that in this very thread. As someone who grew up knowing people whose relatives were disabled I think of the r-word (and the German equivalent, English is not my first language) as horrible.<p>Most people who use it are ignorant to what it means to people who have to live with it every day. Which means it is even worse if one thinks about it and goes like &quot;yeah I understand why they hate it, but I am still gonna use it&quot;, because then they are not ignorant but malicious.')
