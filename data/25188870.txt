Item(by='zeteo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606151064, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25187669, text='&gt;Imagining yourself in the shoes of an evil person is a fundamental part of fiction.<p>As long as it&#x27;s fiction, and you know they&#x27;re evil. While I&#x27;ve personally greatly enjoyed Panzer General and its sequels, on a moral level the game differs very little from questionable post-war spin and propaganda. There is particularly an entire genre of problematic, self-serving Nazi general memoirs with themes such as:<p>- Minimizing, or even completely ignoring, the Wehrmacht&#x27;s essential contribution to war crimes and the Holocaust: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wehrmacht#Criminal_and_genocidal_organization" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wehrmacht#Criminal_and_genocid...</a><p>- Effectively promoting the myth of the superhuman Aryan soldier defeating vast hordes of subhumans. The original Panzer General takes this to a new extreme by making German units vastly superior throughout the war, down to the point where it&#x27;s practically impossible to win the Battle of Berlin scenario as the Allies.<p>- Generally treating the entire war as an abstract Kriegsspiel that they&#x27;d have won through superior strength of intellect - if it wasn&#x27;t for that bumbling incompetent at the top. PG is an ultimate fantasy in this regard, with Hitler being hardly mentioned and almost inconsequential (spend a little prestige and you&#x27;ll easily get over his &quot;bad&quot; decisions at Kiev and Gibraltar).<p>It is actually possible to do better in a computer game. For instance, I&#x27;ve heard good things about Decisive Campaigns: Barbarossa. Apparently it lets you stand up to Hitler about war crimes at risk of losing essential resources and&#x2F;or being dismissed, or choose to be complicit; and, at the end, runs you through the Nuremberg trials accordingly.')
