The repeal of 230 would essentially cement those centralized sites as the sole platforms however, as Uncle Frank doesn&#x27;t have paid moderation teams or a legal department, and only makes $7.44 ad revenue each month. Frank won&#x27;t be able to afford the legal costs if someone starts spamming it with libelous content and he&#x27;s busy and doesn&#x27;t get around to taking the posts down for a couple days.')
