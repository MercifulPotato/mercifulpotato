Key in this is the insight that what keeps humans engaged most is angry righteousness and tribalism.<p>The difference is that media never had the tools that are now available to track, optimize for engagement, and also amplify that engagement with immediate social sharing.<p>With this toolbox, we&#x27;ve created something that can cause society to destroy itself - the stakes are really that high. It&#x27;s not the intention of the media companies but it is the result.<p>Nothing in this world scares me more than particularly our tools created by first social media companies in their compacity to destroy civilization.')
