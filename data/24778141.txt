Written conservatively using a few bits of FORTRAN 77, but mainly in a FORTRAN 66 style.  The control structures I found in there would make you go crosseyed.  At one point, there was a jump that took you from outside a loop to the middle of the body of the loop.  Today&#x27;s no-longer-all-caps Fortran manages to elude EWD&#x27;s criticism by not being that language any longer.  You have to use a lot of obscure compiler flags even to make the old stuff compile.')
