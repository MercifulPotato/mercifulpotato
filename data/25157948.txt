We often use special metaphors when we mean to describe complexity, and &quot;trivial&quot; would more easily communicate what I meant regardless.<p>This came up recently in my romantic relationship: I used &quot;small&quot; to describe an emotional feeling I was having and it did hurt the feelings of my partner, who is short. They didn&#x27;t like that size was used to describe a negative emotion and I appreciated that they shared that with me and gave me an opportunity to think about a more precise way of communicating my feelings that didn&#x27;t connect a negative connotation to something they identified with.<p>Why is this so hard to understand that I would seek to live this way? I think we should be excited to practice radical compassion with each other.')
