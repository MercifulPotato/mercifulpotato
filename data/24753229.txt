If you are in ecommerce and your not wanting to ship outside your own country then why have images hosted on CDNs?<p>Scripts and CSS are (or should be) small compared to the images.<p>Yet, with the images, you can use mod_pagespeed on the server to replace images with picture source sets, with the server able to detect the bandwidth of the client and their device to serve them highly optimised images. So that means images that look glorious on a 4K screen with a good connection and images that are a bit jaggy for the person on their phone with only 3G.<p>I am sure that CDNs can do this too and that you can get mod pagespeed to work with CDNs but there is so much that can be done on a server without having to sign up for extra services and their overheads.')
