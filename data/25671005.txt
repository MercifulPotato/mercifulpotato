Item(by='Lazare', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610027700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25670847, text='&gt; if with Telegram &quot;the privacy, security, and governance story is not great though&quot;, why would you migrate from WhatsApp to Telegram in first place?<p>A lot of people use WhatsApp for a lot of reasons. If security was foremost on your mind, you&#x27;d probably have <i>already</i> migrated away from it. On the other handd, plenty of people are using WhatsApp right now to talk to their grandmothers, and switching to Telegram is not an obviously bad choice.  :)<p>OP listed some apps like Discord that suggest he&#x27;s <i>not</i> laser focused on privacy and security, and perhaps is mostly just wanting to to steer clear of large corporations in general and Facebook in particular. Telegram checks those boxes.')
