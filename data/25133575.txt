You&#x27;re starting with some of the most intelligent, diligent, bright-eyed young people on the planet and letting them work independently in a field that they presumably have a deep passion for.</i><p>There&#x27;s some truth to this, but the other reality is that academia is a pyramid scheme; the scheme worked from 1945 - 75, when higher ed grew rapidly, and has worked more or less poorly for PhDs ever since: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jakeseliger.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;22&#x2F;what-you-should-know-before-you-start-grad-school-in-english-literature-the-economic-financial-and-opportunity-costs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jakeseliger.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;05&#x2F;22&#x2F;what-you-should-know-befo...</a>.<p>The &quot;deep passion&quot; can also meet academic politics, the need for stable income, the insanity of the peer-reviewed journal system, sadistic or simply indifferent advisors, a lunatic dissertation committee, and so on.<p>There are likely some solutions to some of these problems; the elimination of tenure could be one, or the creation of the &quot;teaching&quot; PhD that consists of four years of coursework with a relatively small amount of research, with the degree awarded based on whatever papers have been written or contributed to, or whatever experiments have been done.')
