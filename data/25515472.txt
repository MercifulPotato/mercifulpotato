Municipal broadband isn&#x27;t that.\nThe NSA operates at a much different scale than a municipal broadband provider, which is small and basically transparent. Local broadband providers have no capability to undermine cryptographic standards, use libraries of 0days to take over your PC, or anything like that. NSA et al aren&#x27;t going to grant them that capability either. I&#x27;d at least like the <i>option</i> of an ISP that is under indirect voter control, to complement the usual 900lb gorillas that line their pockets at everyone&#x27;s expense and are basically unaccountable.')
