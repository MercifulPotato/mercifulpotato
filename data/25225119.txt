The new Air would be almost perfect, except for the OS. And I don’t have the time to tinker with it, or the inclination to fight companies that don’t want to help.&quot;<p>The last sentence is in my opinion a great summary of the current state of Linux on Apple M1 machines. It would probably take months, maybe years before it will be possible for regular user to natively run Linux there. Until then, many enthusiasts would probably spend a lot of time reverse-engineering the hardware, the firmware, etc. while trying to make it work with Linux.<p>I believe that in the end they will succeed. But all the effort which will lead to it can easily be avoided if Apple provides them a tiny bit of assistance.')
