Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24924557], score=None, time=1603912600, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24921998, text='&gt; Thatâ€™s not true.<p>Yes, it is.<p>&gt; A moderation-free platform can still get in trouble for defamation posted on their platform if 230 was removed.<p>Yes, but that doesn&#x27;t contradict anything in GP, which said hosts can move from publisher to distributo liability by not moderating, not that they can avoid liability altogether that way; distributors have notice-based liability, unlike publishers who have publication-based liability, so, absent 230 the situation for defamation on a not-preemprivelt-moderated site would be somewhat similar to what it is for copyright under the DMCA.')
