I was having problems in my Trigonometry class and asked for his help. I was absolutely shocked at how precise his handwriting was when he was writing stuff down and explaining it to me. It looked like he had typed out his notations, it was crazy.<p>He said something similar to you, &quot;I&#x27;m not a doctor writing prescriptions, I need to be precise. If my writing is precise, its easier to read, easier to understand now and later.&quot;')
