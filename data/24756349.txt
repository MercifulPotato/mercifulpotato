Item(by='vikramkr', descendants=None, kids=[24758035], score=None, time=1602521010, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755614, text='Buy a cheaper used minivan<p>The guest bedroom makes for a decent storage space<p>A yard has aesthetic value and you might be living in an area like greater NY metro area where land is worth more than the house built on it, so it&#x27;s going to make financial sense down the line.<p>The perspective of the author doesn&#x27;t seem to come from the same background and experiences as many of the people reading the article, especially since the comparisons of the decisions they made to the &quot;normal&quot; are based on a very strange normal. That&#x27;s fine, but it might be nice to get a sense of where they come from and what type of lifestyle their social group is living. Looks like &quot;modo&quot; is a canadian service - maybe canada is wildly different from the US but at least from my brief visits to metro areas in that country a significant portion of the lifestyle for the people I met in the toronto area seemed to be a lot like your typical american urban&#x2F;suburban lifestyle in the US. I guess I just don&#x27;t recognize the people &quot;paying for the other 95&quot; since I can&#x27;t imagine anyone buying housing in an urban area with condos and public transit and parks that also sees property land area as purely recreational space instead of a financial investment, or people with young children that can&#x27;t afford a 50k car that would think it makes more sense to rent out a minivan everytime they need to take the kids anywhere rather than get a 10 year old odyssey that&#x27;ll keep running for 10 more. And I certainly can&#x27;t imagine anyone that would decide to get a smaller house without a guest bedroom for financial reasons and then be so magnanimous that they&#x27;re willing to pay for their friends hotel&#x27;s when they visit! If they&#x27;re not visiting to hang out with me at my place, why am I paying for their vacation? I wouldn&#x27;t expect them to pay for mine!')
