Item(by='enonevets', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607254808, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25320572, text='As a two phone user for years now, where I actively carry and heavily use both phones (iPhone Max and Pixel XL), my personal opinion is that both have their strengths and their weaknesses.<p>This article is heavily biased towards what the author is use to. I&#x27;ve done enough comparisons with both phones over the years (even as I upgrade iPhones and Pixels) and have repeatedly done them side by side (including how apps are built slightly differently across both phones) to tell that there are strengths and weaknesses on both side. Of course I have my own biases but I also recognize each has their own strength.<p>This article unfortunately leans towards the author&#x27;s prior Android experience and what they are use to and not approaching the iPhone and where it shines.<p>Another way of looking at this... my own opinion is that Mac OS is superior to Windows (having used both OSes). But if you are coming from Windows expecting Mac OS to behave like Windows as your barometer for why Mac OS is great or not, you&#x27;re obviously going to be disappointed. That analogy plays out here.')
