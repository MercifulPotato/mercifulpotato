Their janitors and cooks and maintenance people are already via contractors.  Their lowest paid employees are most likely their admin assistants at $50K a year.<p>So basically this is targeting companies whose CEOs make over $50M a year, which is basically Twitter, Pinterest, Google, Facebook, Uber and a few others that actually have an office in San Francisco.<p>And I&#x27;m sure Google and Facebook et. al will fight them over how much money they &quot;make&quot; in San Francisco.')
