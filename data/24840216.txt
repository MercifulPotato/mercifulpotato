It&#x27;s really Apple&#x27;s choice and interest what it does with the default search, Apple could decide tomorrow to point it to its own search engine and there&#x27;s nothing Google, the DOJ or anyone else can do about it.<p>Not really sure what the DOJ expect Apple or Google to do in this situation, it seems to me that 2 companies entered a mutually benefiting contract. You can&#x27;t argue that Google &quot;colluded&quot; with Apple, there&#x27;s a lot of throwing punches between each other (all the privacy oriented moves Apple is doing are hurting Google&#x27;s business) and again Apple could be making its own search engine anytime they wanted, they already replaced Google Maps with their own thing.')
