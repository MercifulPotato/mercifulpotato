Perhaps they could tell the admin of the system how to reduce the attack surface, detail what services it should not be providing (and why), what services it provides that are worse than the alternative, and how to turn them off or harden them.<p>“An init system should not need many lines of code to function properly.”<p>That’s a ridiculous statement. Lines of code is an absurd measurement to determine the security of anything.')
