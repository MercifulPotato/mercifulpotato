Foreigners are very unlikely to hold enough of the same values as their team as to be qualified to be the manager. The exception here are folks who have already become fully Americanized, in which case there wouldn&#x27;t be the kind of problematic behaviors you described above.<p>It&#x27;s the same reason why new immigrants to a country don&#x27;t go straight into becoming MPs and Presidents, regardless of their backgrounds and qualifications.')
