I think Winnie the Pooh is smarter than Trump and won&#x27;t just throw a tantrum because he didn&#x27;t get his way, but it&#x27;s certainly possible he&#x27;d decide to turn every iPhone in China into a brick rather than accept that we don&#x27;t want to keep telling eavesdroppers which server name you wrote in the URL.<p>The GREASE isn&#x27;t there primarily because of China, as I said they don&#x27;t build crazy fragile technology, they don&#x27;t have anybody to sell this too, the Great Firewall is an in-house project, so it&#x27;s mostly simple and robust. Bad destination IP, connection blocked. Rarely a big problem in a technical sense.<p>GREASE is because of stupid corporate middleboxes. Middleboxes are a technical problem, because even when they have an apparently mundane and legitimate purpose they tend to go about it in stupid over-complicated ways that destroy forward compatibility. All of the weird spelling of TLS 1.3 is because of middleboxes. Why is HelloRetryRequest spelled ServerHello? Because if you don&#x27;t say ServerHello at that point some famous middleboxes explode. Why is TLS 1.3 ClientHello written exactly like a TLS 1.2 ClientHello (including the version number) except with crazy extension values? Because otherwise middleboxes explode. Why is there a bunch of completely random data labelled &quot;Session ID&quot;? Is it a session ID? Nope. If that was missing, you guessed it, middleboxes explode.')
