I took video of a mob of people brutalizing (pushing to the ground, pinning on the ground) a Christian street preacher in broad daylight because they didn&#x27;t like his annoying speech. At night, for days at a time, there were gunshots and people getting shot. If you think it was &quot;quite peaceful&quot; there, then you&#x27;re getting your information from a severely biased source. I lived there and spent more time there than probably any of your sources.')
