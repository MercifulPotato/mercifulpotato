Who is keeping the order of the queue or adding people to it in a way that you know when you&#x27;re supposed to expect to get the vaccine?<p>Is it just up to your personal doctor?  A local hospital?  The county?  Who is keeping the list?<p>Maybe I&#x27;m not a key&#x2F;critical category person so I am not in the target group, but aside from the high level CDC guidance on who should get it, there seems to be a vast chasm of lack of information &#x2F; authority connecting to the individual person to know how to take action to receive the vaccine.<p>But again, maybe I&#x27;m missing something.  It seems like a total chaos fest, muddling &#x2F; random walking our way through the crisis.   I guess the same theme as the entire handling of the situation in the US.  God forbid we have some centralized authoritative list of who is who, and who does what, to know when someone should get the vaccine.<p>But I guess when 0% are vaccinated, <i>anything</i> even half-assed is useful.')
