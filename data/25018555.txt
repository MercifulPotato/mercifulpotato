But if something were used for profit, part of that profit would have to be paid upstream. And that would be profit for that node which, if used the same license, would have 5% of that trickle upstream.<p>This could be an automatic process and handled through an open registry. Anyone could take anything, register, and then pay their &quot;taxes&quot;. If you wanted to donate anything you made, make that an option also.<p>Of course there are an infinite amount of &quot;what if&quot; scenarios, but that&#x27;s the gist of it based on the following philosophy:<p>No one should need permission to copy anything or profit from anything. But they should share their earnings if they &quot;opt in&quot; to capitalism.')
