From a uarch standpoint the RISC vs CISC distinction is moot and from an ISA standpoint the only real quantifiable difference seems to be being a load-store architecture.<p>ISAs without conditional moves tend to have predicated instructions which are functionally the same thing. I&#x27;m not actually aware of any traditionally RISC architectures that have neither conditional moves or predicated instructions. While ARMv7 removed predicated instructions as a general feature ARMv8 gained a few &quot;conditional data processing&quot; instructions (e.g. CSEL is basically cmov), so clearly at least ARM thinks there&#x27;s a benefit even with modern branch predictors.<p>Conditional instructions are really, really handy when you need them. It&#x27;s an escape hatch for when you have an unbiased branch and need to turn control flow into data flow.')
