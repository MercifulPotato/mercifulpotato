For most of them, you don&#x27;t even have any real insights!<p>Why pick on them, for no reason? They didn&#x27;t do anything unethical, and most didn&#x27;t seem to even raise a Series A.<p>You have no clue why they failed; you just speculate... and you don&#x27;t just name the companies, you call out random founders by name. These people put themselves out there and worked hard, and now they&#x27;re going to get a Google Alert saying they&#x27;re in a blog post called &quot;Biggest Y Combinator Failed Startups.&quot;<p>Most YC companies don&#x27;t work out. In my batch (5 years ago), about 80% are out of business now. That&#x27;s okay! That&#x27;s just how it works. I&#x27;m all for talking about failures, but it&#x27;s weird you just pick on a few small random YC startups.')
