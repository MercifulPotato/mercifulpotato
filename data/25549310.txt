Item(by='333c', descendants=None, kids=[25549583], score=None, time=1609050662, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25549289, text='The more victory cards (&quot;green&quot;) you buy, generally the less effective your deck becomes (because most victory cards don&#x27;t do anything other than count for points). This means that buying VPs makes it (generally) harder to buy more VPs. The smaller your deck, the more pronounced this effect.<p>All of this taken together means that you end up having to target some point along the continuum between &quot;get points quickly but fizzle out early&quot; and &quot;long slow burn to getting a lot of points.&quot; If you go for the &quot;quick&quot; strategy but the game doesn&#x27;t end quickly, your opponent can take the extra time to pass you in VP, and vice versa if you choose the &quot;slow&quot; strategy but the game is short. And it&#x27;s not just two options â€” like I said, there&#x27;s a whole spectrum of choice.')
