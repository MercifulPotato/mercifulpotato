Many people live in democracies, and a pretty well trodden path to change in them is:<p>1. popular awareness of an issue,<p>2. pressure put on political bodies to do something,<p>3. legislation or other political action addressing the issue.<p>This is not a clockwork process, and often nothing comes of it, but your idealized state of ignorance would prevent it completely.')
