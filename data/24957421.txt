My team and I envisioned live captions for meetings and delivered in Microsoft Teams worldwide in Dec&#x27;19. We had built it to improve inclusivity because we saw a rise in remote meetings (we couldn&#x27;t have predicted COVID). We are super glad and grateful to hear that live captions have been extremely helpful and useful to you. Thank you for choosing us. Please don&#x27;t hesitate to share any further feedback or comments.\nRegards,\nShalendra')
