That&#x27;s actually another very common fallacy - I defended parent, who wasn&#x27;t criticising Facebook, so I must be pro-facebook and probably agree with everything they do. Just... what!?<p>The point touched was very very narrow: Facebook very likely doesn&#x27;t invest in Oculus for the sake of getting facebook accounts. I&#x27;d probably argue that it&#x27;s not even for the sake of getting more info about the users, though I haven&#x27;t yet. But I definitely didn&#x27;t say anything like &quot;they can kill your hardware device if you give up your account&quot;.<p>I did criticise tribalism, polarisation and automatically assuming that a discussion has exactly two sides.
