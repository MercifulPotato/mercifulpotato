If everybody thinks as I do, maybe there will be problems.  But, judging by my experience with staircases in America (namely them being fairly wide and numerous), I prefer my odds in the staircase.  Even if I only manage to get a few floors down before becoming tangled in other humans, maybe those few floors are enough to put me below the fire, or below the floors now filled with toxic smoke.')
