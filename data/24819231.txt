The cost of something is always proportional to how much the customer(here the German government, read <i>the taxpayer</i>) is willing to spend not how complex the project is. While it might not be more complicated to implement than in Finland, the German government has more money than the Finish government so it was billed(read fleeced) accordingly.<p>It&#x27;s like asking <i>&quot;Are SV engineer really 400x times better coders than Europeans?&quot;</i>. Maybe not, but they can charge 400x more because their market conditions allow them to. Simple.')
