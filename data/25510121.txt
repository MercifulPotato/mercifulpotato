Item(by='lmeyerov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608665395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25507289, text='People are downvoting this, and I&#x27;m guessing because they interpret it as saying it&#x27;s fine that the technical co-founder is being forced down + out like this, or that they don&#x27;t &quot;deserve&quot; their shot at vesting that 40%. Not my intent - it&#x27;s immoral, and probably, illegal. Pulling this 1mo before the cliff is especially evil.<p>The difficulty is the CEO has a lot of flexibility in equivalent legal actions like firing the co-founder, issuing 10X more shares, and diluting the 40% to 4%. Even if the technical co-founder does successfully walk away with 40% today and things go well, investors in funding rounds years from now will still pressure them to do so (&quot;why is 40% of the company shares dead weight? That should go to new employees!&quot;). The situation stinks, as does the negotiation position.')
