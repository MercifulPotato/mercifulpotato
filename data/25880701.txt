This can fail in umpteen different ways, as car manufacturers differ on how they implement CCS (Dunno how, but it happens).<p>Then you&#x27;ve got the software in the charging point, which needs to be customised for the brand you&#x27;re selling under (another moving part).<p>And lastly, you have the back end system for the brand, which handles authentication, authorization (RFID or App) and billing - this is the bit that ultimately gives the charger the go-ahead to start feeding power to the connected car.<p>Any of these fails, no electricity for you.<p>For 22kW &quot;slow&quot; chargers this is a bit simpler as the actual charger is a lot less complex, it doesn&#x27;t need to negotiate, it just needs to switch one relay.<p>Tesla is like Apple in this case, they take care of the whole stack. So as long as the charger has power, it&#x27;ll work. Authentication and authorization are done by having the car negotiate with the charger directly via the charging cable, no dongles or apps needed.')
