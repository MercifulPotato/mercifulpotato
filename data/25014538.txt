What we call copyright is a deeply flawed legal framework that helps to entrench rent-seeking and anti-competitive behaviour, but there&#x27;s another side of the coin: the intent of the law is genuinely to guarantee access to the fruits of one&#x27;s intellectual labour.<p>Of course, copyleft licenses such as the GPL _can_ be used to protect the authors&#x27; rights to compensation for commercial use of their work - but the framing matters. I think that&#x27;s the fundamental reason open source licenses such as BSD and MIT have caught on - they centre on the need of the developer to get productive work done, not on the far more abstract principle of the home PC user being able to recompile their own software stack from source.')
