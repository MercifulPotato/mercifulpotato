Social activists can certainly be politicians, such as Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders etc. But many are not. Obama is not a social activist. He&#x27;s an effective politician, one who has certainly brought about change. But he&#x27;s not a social activist.<p>Many social activists were famously unpopular. Martin Luther King died with a 66% disapproval rating^[1]. Susan B. Anthony was ridiculed and accused of trying to destroy the institution of marriage (sound familiar?).<p>Of course some activists veer too far. Jane Fonda is an example. I don&#x27;t fault her opposition to the Vietnam War, but her infamous photo practically advocated for violence against American troops.<p>In a sense the aim of social activists is to be ahead of their time. MLK was reviled in his time and practically infallible today. We need both politicians and activists for progress. Politicians push forward the policy, but the activists push forward the politicians. Without activists, politicians can end up in holding patterns, afraid to lose popularity. Without politicians, activists are just screaming into a void.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;martin-luther-king-jr-was-not-always-popular-back-day-780387" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;martin-luther-king-jr-was-not-alway...</a>')
