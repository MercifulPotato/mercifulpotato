Fractional scaling will _never_ look good. Even Apple, who controls their entire stack, doesn&#x27;t like fractional scaling and exclusively makes monitors and displays that support 2X scaling. Everyone looking for good fractional scaling support is going to be looking for a very long time, no matter what compositor they use.')
