Let&#x27;s also throw in that they have a monopoly over paper production and publishing. Now, do you think your argument that &quot;this private entity can do whatever it wants&quot; is problematic? I should hope so.<p>I&#x27;m not making the case that it&#x27;s black&#x2F;white and that this situation with Big Tech is equivalent to MEGA INC. But, it&#x27;s not that our free speech rights are binary. My point is simply that we&#x27;re somewhere along the spectrum spanning &quot;private home&quot; &lt;-&gt; &quot;MEGA INC&quot;, and at this point rights are actually being diminished because of the oligopolistic nature of a significant corner where discourse happens.<p>So, unfortunately, I think it&#x27;s a nuanced situation that&#x27;s not easily reduced to a simplistic principle such as what you&#x27;ve stated. We have clear principles to reason about the extremes, but it&#x27;s hard to make an argument in the hairy middle because both can be made to apply.')
