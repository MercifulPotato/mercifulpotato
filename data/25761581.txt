This is complexity that you as a dev have to deal with in some way.<p>Svelte and React makes different tradeoffs in how they expect developers to deal with this.<p>Personally I think maybe Svelte makes a better tradeoff. I&#x27;ve seen so many people make variables instead of using useState, etcâ€¦ because that&#x27;s the kind of thinking they&#x27;re used to.<p>In Svelte that would simply work for the simple cases, but you&#x27;d have to use $: someVar for the more complex cases. I think requiring having to deal with that complexity only when you need it is a more reasonable way to do it compared to React.')
