No entanglement, no dead and live cats etc.\nElectron orbit is modeled as an infinitessemally thin fluid shell with charge elements spinning around the nucleus along all great circle orbits. However, while spinning, the orbital does not change - it&#x27;s like a standing wave, and thus it does not radiate.')
