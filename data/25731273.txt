I don&#x27;t know of a single person that has been called a Terrorist for anything other than calling for violence against others.  Why self-proclaimed &quot;peaceful&quot; conservatives continue to lump themselves in with white-supremacists and domestic terrorists is beyond me.<p>You can pretend that people are being persecuted for being a Republican but 30 seconds of fact checking will disprove that.  In fact the only ones calling for violence against Republicans are those very same white supremacists and domestic terrorists because it seems that anyone that doesn&#x27;t align with Donald Trump is somehow not a conservative.  Mike Pence isn&#x27;t a Republican?  Really? I can&#x27;t think of a politician much further right, and somehow he&#x27;s no longer acceptable.<p>If your political belief system is &quot;whatever Trump thinks this week&quot; then maybe it&#x27;s time to re-evaluate what you really stand for.')
