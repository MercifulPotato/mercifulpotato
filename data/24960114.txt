The comment I responded to is overtly and unequivocally expressing arrogant repression (“no politics” and “no religion” discussed at work because “most people” can’t rationally talk about it).<p>If you think <i>my</i> comment is a personal attack, that’s wildly unreasonable. The parent comment is the one behaving that way and it is absolutely fair and uncontroversial to point out <i>their own words</i> demonstrating thuggish repression.<p>In fact, <i>not</i> challenging their comment on these reprehensible points would be the far worse action.')
