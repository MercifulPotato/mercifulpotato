Item(by='phizy', descendants=None, kids=[24945226], score=None, time=1604080442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944530, text='There&#x27;s always been people who believe in nonsense. Most people, throughout most of history have. The meaning of &quot;post-truth&quot; today is that people in power are no longer being asked to justify what they do on the basis of fact. (It doesn&#x27;t mean that facts don&#x27;t exist or that they don&#x27;t matter, I just found it off-putting that you&#x27;d try to suggest that.)<p>Allow me to paraphrase a concept from Tolkien: evil doesn&#x27;t win because it&#x27;s a superior force, it wins because it convinces you that it&#x27;s already won. &quot;Look over there, evil wins. Look here, evil already won. Evil always wins, that&#x27;s the way it has always been. You can&#x27;t fight it so give up.&quot;<p>You can&#x27;t win by spreading evil&#x27;s messages, even sarcastically. You win by being a superior force and never giving up. People&#x27;s credibility should actually suffer when they do or say things that are incredible, and people who appeal to us with facts and compassion should be rewarded.')
