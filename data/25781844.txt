Sufficed to say, the &#x27;insurrection&#x27; on capital hill was of another league altogether what with the legitimacy of the Office of the President being maligned to support the interdiction of the transfer of power. That&#x27;s a &#x27;really big deal&#x27;. In 200 years we will remember COVID and Trump for dubious reasons, while the BLM protests and FB&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Twitter wars won&#x27;t like make the history lesson.')
