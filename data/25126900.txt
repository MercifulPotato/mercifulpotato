I suspect for most modern developers, short, frequent compiling is a more common use-case than 10m+ builds. For video editors and other pros, it&#x27;s different, but since Apple&#x27;s CPU offloads a lot of the video &amp; audio processing to secondary processors, I don&#x27;t think that will be an issue either.')
