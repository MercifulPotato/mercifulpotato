Item(by='seotut2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609955636, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25656835, text='I think that you will find that the very concept of &quot;meaning of life&quot; is meaningless. There is no concrete, real-world thing that it refers to. However, some people do attain a certain bodily and mental state where they feel they are missing something, they feel like life is incomplete. This sometimes manifests itself as a nihilistic worldview (among other effects). It is also almost always accompanied by a feeling of disconnection from others, from society.<p>Now, for someone who is not in this particular bodily (and mental) state, life itself is a joy. The concept of meaning of life doesn&#x27;t even come into question, because if you love waking up in the morning, love the work you&#x27;re doing, the people you interact with and society and the world itself, you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re lacking anything. There is no need for further meaning.<p>Also, this state, like all other bodily functions, is not a discrete, binary switch, but a continuous biological mechanism that takes a spectrum of values. It can be measured by simple tools such as the activation of the vagus nerve, brain activation pattern revealed on an EEG and so forth.<p>As for how to change this bodily function, unfortunately that is still a bit of a mystery. Some find that seeing a therapist helps, changing of your personal circumstances often helps as well. There are other promising mechanisms such as neurofeedback, but none of them have a perfect track record.')
