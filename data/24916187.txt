The interesting thing about that talk is that he advocates using a functional style in ruby and quietly suggests that in the end the coder should &#x27;probably use erlang&#x27;.  It turned out that jose valim was working on elixir at that time, which basically became exactly what gary was asking for (a rubyish erlang).  It&#x27;s a shame that gary doesn&#x27;t use elixir.')
