By changing jobs, I get a lot more experience in a lot of different things. I&#x27;ve worked in five different markets:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tech-culture-shock-from-america-to-the-south-pacific-and-seattle-to-chicago&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tech-culture-shock-from-ameri...</a><p>I know people who&#x27;ve been at the same job for 6~7 years and they are totally getting paid way under market. A company might give you a 2~3% cost of living increase, or a $5k promotion every few years, but switching jobs let&#x27;s you ask for $10k or more.<p>On the downside, I would NOT recommend anyone else change jobs almost yearly like I did. My job loyalty is shit and it&#x27;s hard for me to take on other jobs when people are concerned I could just leave.<p>That being said, the good jobs with good pipeline engineering, tests and CI&#x2F;CD flows allow people to flow in and out; quickly pick up things and move with fast&#x2F;good deploys. Those shops are the best, but they are rare. They tend to not care as much weird resumes because they want to hire people who are innovative.')
