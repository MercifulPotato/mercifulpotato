The idea being that defining it as inherently supernatural is impossible and simply a linguistic reshuffling, when it&#x27;s really more like &quot;you&#x27;ve simply started calling your belief system something else, but it&#x27;s actually still just Christian.&quot; Keep in mind here that Christianity, like all religions, is a really big tent.<p>Put in other terms, the Western world in 2020 likes to act as if it reinvented itself afresh in the 1700-1800-1900s, but in reality, everything about &quot;secular&quot; knowledge has been formed in thousands of years of Christian culture. For example, the idea of universal human worth, human rights, and subsequently democracy (in the sense of every human being, not the Ancient Greek kind), is absolutely rooted in a Christian context. Had a different society had the industrial revolution first, things might be very different.<p>Or to ask a different question: if your values and actions indicate you as a group of X, but you vehemently deny (only with words) being a member of X, what does that mean? Is expressed spoken belief the final decider? Or does action factor in too?<p>This is a really long-winded way of saying that what &quot;religion&quot; is defined as is constantly changing. The book I recommended explains it much better than I can.')
