It&#x27;s a fragmented market, different electricity providers (this matters, some chargers really want you to be a customer of a specific electricity provider, some just offer different prices depending on this), different charging networks, different plugs, different apps and payment methods, different behavior even if you&#x27;re seemingly in the same network, wildly different prices, etc.<p>Every app shows different chargers and different status on whether they&#x27;re occupied or not. Most are broken anyway. Some are on hotel or supermarket grounds so they&#x27;re accessible only to some people, and even in the same network might have a different price because the owner of the land asks for a cut (yes, that&#x27;s a thing). Some are inside a parking lot so you pay the parking on top of the charging. Some are on a free parking spot for EVs so someone will park there all day. Some charge per KWh, per minute, or a combination, plus maybe another one time fee.<p>Chargers need to be as ubiquitous as gas stations, and provide an experience that&#x27;s just as frictionless. Drive in, pick a plug and start fast charging, get a maximum allotted time to charge, then pay like you&#x27;d do in any store, or better yet have the car talk to the charger and handle this for you (ISO 15118) and be on your way. Alternatively, to take advantage of how different electricity is from gas and maybe also use those cars as electricity storage, governments could invest to put charging points on every street parking, in every streetlight, etc.')
