We didn&#x27;t originally set out to write a new license, but when we did, we put real time and thought into it. It&#x27;s nice to see that appreciated.<p>We&#x27;ve shied away from declaring one &quot;right&quot; way to use the license, because norms, conventions, and expectations vary so much across development communities. What&#x27;s right and normal for, say, Maven artifacts would seem a bit strange in, say, an npm package or a C library.')
