They can already do this anyway in retros or all-hands meetings, signing on to open letters to the executive team, etc.<p>Not saying that the organizers here have malicious intentions, but if you did have malicious intentions then something like this could actually be a pretty good scam... Re-purposing the word &quot;union&quot; for something that is not really serving that role, and collecting money from people who will ideologically sign onto it without thinking because they automatically think &quot;unions == good&quot;. Basically making money off of the current shift to the left in US politics.')
