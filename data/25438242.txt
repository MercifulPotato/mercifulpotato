There is a world of difference between being alone and feeling alone. You can feel alone without being alone, for example. I am wrapping up my fifth military deployment and as such have spent a considerable amount of time actually alone compared to other adults. From numerous points of observation some adults are more capable of performing, and even possibly appreciating, time apart from other adults more than others. Some people simply cannot handle it and literally go crazy.<p>If the study does not account for such a foundational distinction I can’t, in good faith, consider the results valid. This distinction is hard to appreciate until you have been alone for an extended period and observed differences of performance relative to other people.')
