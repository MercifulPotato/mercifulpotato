I <i>thought</i> you were trying to say that many things that people depend on in Haskell are <i>merely</i> the result of a PhD thesis, i.e. perhaps a messy body of work designed by an inexperienced person.  On the contrary, language extensions are well designed and thoroughly thought through.<p>On the other hand, sometimes people get the idea that Haskell can encode <i>everything</i> in types.  It can&#x27;t. They get stuck and get into messes.  Nonetheless the ability to encode <i>some</i> things into types makes Haskell by far the most practical language I&#x27;ve used.')
