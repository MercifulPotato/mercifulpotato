The reason I ditched Dropbox was because of the bloated Mac client. Maestral looks like it might bring back the 2010-esque Dropbox client feeling (fast and efficient).<p>I mentioned above that I switched away; iCloud Drive is pretty mediocre since syncing sometimes doesn’t happen instantly and there’s no way to force-sync. I’ll probably move my Mac synced preferences back to Dropbox if this works well. Though I’m also worried about them deprecating their APIs since that seems to be a popular move these days.')
