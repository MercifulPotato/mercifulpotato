Yet most people stay in Congress.<p>A large part of the cause is single-issue voters, especially abortion and gun control. <i>Many</i> people vote R simply because they are so hellbent on turning back abortion rights or keeping the right to buy guns in supermarkets and vice versa. And the parties <i>know</i> and exploit that - Bush, Obama and Trump had times with supermajorities in which they could have ended the respective issues permanently, but they didn&#x27;t.<p>The result is a dysfunctional Congress whose members are not held accountable by their voters no matter what they do, and a subsequently disappointed public.<p>And the same mechanic also applies to the Presidency elections. A lot of people only voted Biden because they wanted to get rid of Trump, and one might say that many people voted Trump in &#x27;16 to prevent Clinton who&#x27;s as Establishment as it can be.')
