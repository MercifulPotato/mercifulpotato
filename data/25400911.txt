I&#x27;ve done this in python for automating entries into another database (no API) and it was really simple, just used a headless web driver, mySQL, and an ugly tkinter interface so the workers could use it.(I&#x27;m a pretty mediocre CS student not a professional but found it very easy and flexible).<p>Coincidentally there is another post on the front page talking about you should &quot;buy not build.&quot; Bit of a misleading site name.<p>Side note: are there any places on the web where people just post and comment on personal engineering and CS projects they&#x27;re working on and not necessarily trying to sell?
