Item(by='toyg', descendants=None, kids=[24728838], score=None, time=1602233483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24727748, text='This is just an annoying result of OSS projects squatting on FOSS, re-muddling the waters about what &quot;Free&quot; was supposed to mean (free as in freedom&#x2F;&quot;libre&quot;). The original dichotomy was just OSS &#x2F; FOSS. I guess the resulting division is precise (opensource you pay for &#x2F; opensource and gratis &#x2F; opensource and free as in freedom), I just find &quot;floss&quot; somewhat gross and just say Free Software.')
