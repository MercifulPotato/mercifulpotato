Nobody expects property damage to be a vehicle for police reform -- it&#x27;s an argument for more police presence, if anything. In the case of the capitol riots, not only are the crimes worse (storming the capitol &gt;&gt; property damage), but the criminal acts absolutely do reflect on the movement&#x27;s agenda. Intimidating congress is a plausible vehicle for obtaining the votes they needed that day to overturn the election. Trump&#x27;s pre-riot speech emphasized that this was the goal. These factors increase the culpability of platforms and leadership in the capitol riots as compared to BLM.')
