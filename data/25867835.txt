It was intended to look like a natural death, without raising suspicions.  To do this, they snuck into his hotel room, injected him with a muscle relaxant, then suffocated him. It took local authorities ten days to realize it was actually a murder.  They did eventually figure it out, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hard to imagine intelligence agencies have done similar things before and gotten away with it.  In the case of Litvinenko, authorities were pretty sure he&#x27;d been poisoned from the onset.  The poisoning drew a whole lot of attention that Russia probably could have avoided if they intended to be subtle.')
