Item(by='snvzz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606605965, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25241282, text='&gt;CP210x is OK too:<p>While it is, it doesn&#x27;t do SPI&#x2F;I2C&#x2F;GPIO&#x2F;JTAG&#x2F;etc like the FT232H does.<p>Some CH340 variants have some extra functionality, but the CP210x are pretty bare.<p>Somehow, because of how cheap the breakout boards are these days (in aliexpress, at least), I ended up with one or more of each of the popular chips.')
