For one, Highway 89 and 88 (Monitor Pass and Carson Pass) south of Lake Tahoe, which are both part of the annual Death Ride which I&#x27;ve done a few times. I suppose if I was coming from 50 I&#x27;d do 89 (Monitor) and then take 4 (Ebbetts Pass&#x2F;Pacific Grade) into the Angels Camp area, which is a much nicer ride than 88.')
