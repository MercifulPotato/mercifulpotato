Eye protection might provide additional benefits. Globally collaborative and well conducted studies, including randomised trials, of different personal protective strategies are needed regardless of the challenges, but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence could be considered to inform interim guidance.<p>This para says we don&#x27;t have enough evidence, and what we have isn&#x27;t particularly good, and we need more evidence, but in the mean time the bits and bobs we have could guide us.<p>This is why I say &quot;people should wear masks, masks may help, but we need better evidence&quot;.<p>All the way through your article there are people saying that the science is not clear.<p>&gt; But for the variety of masks in use by the public, the data are messy, disparate and often hastily assembled.<p>[...]<p>&gt; So, scientists have relied on observational and laboratory studies. There is also indirect evidence from other infectious diseases. “If you look at any one paper — it’s not a slam dunk. But, taken all together, I’m convinced that they are working,” says Grabowski.<p>&gt; But such studies do rely on assumptions that mask mandates are being enforced and that people are wearing them correctly. Furthermore, mask use often coincides with other changes, such as limits on gatherings. As restrictions lift, further observational studies might begin to separate the impact of masks from those of other interventions, suggests Grabowski. “It will become easier to see what is doing what,” she says.')
