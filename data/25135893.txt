[...] alternatives exist.<p>Sure, if you want your business to go bankrupt.<p>Itch?  I love the place but good luck supporting your business with the number of sales you’ll make if you’re only available there.  Epic?  GoG?  Humble?  Those are curated stores;  you have to be invited in; you can’t just choose to sell there.  And even if you could, they still don’t have anything even remotely remotely remotely like the number of shoppers on Steam.<p>As a practical matter, today, Steam is the only realistic option for mainstream non-hobbyist digital PC game publishing.  You can do other stores plus Steam, but Steam has to be in the mix if you’re hoping to support yourself by your sales.  (and yes, you can point to a small handful of digital games which were highly financially successful without primarily selling through Steam, but those are the hyper-viral one-in-a-million exceptions, not representative business cases that you should be betting your business on replicating)<p>(Exception:  if one of the other stores is going to pay you to be exclusive to their store (preferably only for a certain duration so that you can get onto Steam right after that period), then that can absolutely make up for losing out on the early Steam sales.  But again, that sort of deal isn’t available to everybody)')
