Then after a while a guy in a car shows up, you pay him (usually in cash, some accept meal tickets) and you get your food. And the service is not limited to the town but also the villages around it. Some restaurants have their own cars, some cooperate with taxi companies.<p>A fairly new addition to this are what I would say are &quot;food aggragator services&quot;, like: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.damejidlo.cz&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.damejidlo.cz&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a><p>The provide a common interface for restaurants that cooperate with them in a given area, so you just search the street or location you are in and it will show you the restaurants that provide deliveries in that area &amp; their menus. The main added value is in this case convenience - you can just click what you want and have ti delivered without calling someone. They also have their own cars so they can offer deliveries from restaurants that otherwise don&#x27;t offer deliveries. Also they make it possible to pay for most deliveries by card.<p>The downside is of course that not every restaurant that does deliveries is in their system &amp; substantial cut they are taking from the money that goes to the restaurant to cover their services. Which most likely explains why there are restaurants missing in their list.')
