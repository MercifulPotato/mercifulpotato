That&#x27;s bullshit.<p>Why would that be horsehockey? Why would you expect people in different countries and cultures to be equally intelligent or hard-working? <i>That</i> would be surprising! So clearly there will be difference of some kind, and it might be small on the average, or it might not be. I&#x27;ll follow the data where it leads.<p>I don&#x27;t accept that the topic is forbidden from rational investigation and discussion. Or that everyone is somehow magically equal and life is fair - that&#x27;s the real bullshit.')
