I have a kinda newfound respect for them and their engineering culture of long-term support.”<p>MS seems very willing to support things for a long time. On the one hand that’s a good thing but it doesn’t stop them from constantly cranking out new things and putting them on maintenance quickly. I would much prefer if they stuck to less things and developed and improved them over a long time. Especially in the desktop development area I simply can’t see a coherent strategy. Over the last decade we had WinRT, Winforms, UWP, Silverlight, WPF developed in addition to Win32. I like desktop development but I can’t recommend with a good conscience committing a long term project (in a lot of companies in house software gets used over decades) to one of the MS frameworks because there is a good chance it will soon be obsolete. It doesn’t really help when people say “but it’s maintained” if your chosen framework doesn’t get any new features and there is no upgrade path to the latest framework.')
