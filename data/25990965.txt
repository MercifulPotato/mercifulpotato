We&#x27;re reaching a point where the implementation of a language is mostly a solved problem (throw it on top of some JIT for a bigger language) and the only meaningful innovation is in the semantics and syntax of a language for expressing intent and providing soundness.<p>If we&#x27;re skating to where the puck is going here, I wouldn&#x27;t say it makes sense to ignore native compilation for functional languages because that&#x27;s a well served niche, but because AOT compilation <i>itself</i> is becoming niche.')
