I had so much fun I ended up spending about as much on lenses and film&#x2F;film development than I would have if I had bought an entry-level DSLR.<p>Iâ€™ve since bought an entry-level DSLR but the AE-1 keeps drawing me back. There is something really neat about the whole process and anticipation of seeing the developed film. Not to mention the old cameras just look and feel cool and the photos have a vintage-like texture that is really unique.')
