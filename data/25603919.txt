So for example, you could open any KDE media player, paste in an audiocd:&#x2F;&#x2F; URI, and it&#x27;ll play the specified track from your CD.<p>And it also meant that any application could open remote files without having to manually download them first. Like, if I wanted to open some random file off the web in a text editor, I can just go into Kate, hit Ctrl-O, and paste its URL into the dialog box, and it&#x27;ll fetch it into a temp folder and open it without me having to first download it manually. This was especially useful for PDFs, because Okular is generally way better than any browser&#x27;s PDF reader (and I was doing this before most browsers came with PDF readers).')
