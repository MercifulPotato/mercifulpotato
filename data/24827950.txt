I am a heavy sleeper and have a hard time waking up sometimes even if I get the right amount of sleep. I have been using this now for over five months and it&#x27;s brought great stability to my sleep. I workout in the morning and now I can consistently wake up.<p>A set amount of time before the alarm is to go off, the alarm simulates a sunrise and can play FM radio, a repeating sound (ocean waves, Nepal bells, etc.) and at the alarm time can do your typical loud alarm. I have this set for 20 minutes before I wake up to start the sunrise. By the time I am ready to wake up, its full brightness and I am ready to get up.<p>There is also a sunset feature for going to bed.<p>I also never thought that having an alarm being controlled by my smartphone would be such a great convenience feature but with this type of device it&#x27;s a perfect match. I don&#x27;t know how someone could use this device to it&#x27;s full potential without the app.<p>This model is the most expensive but I have seen baser models with the core features. I do see a model now at Costco. I would recommend trying it out if you&#x27;re struggling with bringing consistency to your sleep.<p>I used to feel these types of devices were a gimmick but for me it&#x27;s been worthwhile.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.philips.ca&#x2F;c-p&#x2F;HF3670_60&#x2F;smartsleep-connected-sleep-and-wake-up-light" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.philips.ca&#x2F;c-p&#x2F;HF3670_60&#x2F;smartsleep-connected-sl...</a>')
