Item(by='Jochim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607015025, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25290715, text='&gt; What tactics are ok for a company to use to combat unions if it doesn&#x27;t want them?<p>In the US they could improve working conditions to the point that employees are happy with the status quo. Unionisation efforts are typically driven by employees who are stressed by unhealthy&#x2F;unsafe working environments, employee mistreatment, or poor pay. We see the opposite of this in the tech sector, where decent pay, safe environments and plenty of benefits leads to a rather union hostile attitude.<p>&gt; Or should companies just accept and work with any union that forms?<p>If we accept that unions act to address the power imbalance between employees and employers and unionisation is mainly driven by employers exploiting that power imbalance then I think it&#x27;s both good for society and in line with the spirit of the laws that exist in many places that make various forms of union busting illegal.')
