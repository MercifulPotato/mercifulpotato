The device is 3D printed with just a few dollars of materials, and slips on to its user’s hand like a glove. Through tiny mechanical links, the device translates hand movements to an attached small silicone hand and provides realistic haptic feedback. A wire between the glove and the user’s waist adds to the experience by restricting reach to the range of a small child.')
