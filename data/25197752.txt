It&#x27;s a piece of hardware designed to run a specific vendor-sanctioned class of video games and in some cases provide limited media playback capabilities.<p>It uses specially designed hardware for that purpose, which is different in many ways from general computer hardware (specialised SoCs, proprietary storage solutions, etc.).<p>Sure, it&#x27;s perfectly possible to use a passenger jet as a demolition device for multi-storey buildings, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re in same device class as demolition equipment. The type of a device derives from its <i>intended</i> use, not <i>potential</i> uses. That&#x27;s why a nail gun isn&#x27;t sold as a hunting weapon even though it ticks almost every box of being a firearm.')
