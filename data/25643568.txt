A gain function is extremely difficult to get right. It is more likely that zoonotic transfer occurred. Either within a wet market or people operating in that industry or a lab worker accidentally exposing him&#x2F;herself.<p>Sequence analysis show a unique mutation that increased receptor binding affinity that was not predicted by previous models.
