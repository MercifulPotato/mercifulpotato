People say &quot;make your own website&quot;, but that becomes a race to the bottom when we start politicizing server hosts and ISPs.  When you completely shut people up, that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re gone, and now you don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re thinking.  Meanwhile you&#x27;re actually tyrannical because a monopoly on information makes the mass 80% believe that everyone thinks like the MSM, which isn&#x27;t true, then everyone is surprised when it turns out there&#x27;s lots of people who don&#x27;t support the establishment.')
