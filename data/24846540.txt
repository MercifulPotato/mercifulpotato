Those are technical details. SQL should just be pulling, saving and querying from the store without much maniplation. Not changing the data.<p>It&#x27;s the rules that a business stakeholder might be interested in creating.<p>When you start putting the tax calculation rules into the stored proc, thats where the problems begin.<p>If you create a CTE to pull the information required to perform the calulation then return that info without doing the calculation thats fine.')
