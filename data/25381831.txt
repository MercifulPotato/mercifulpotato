Email is very flexible, lots of services directly integrate with email and for all the other stuff there is zappier. Some examples<p>* mailing something to todo@mydomain will put it in my todo list (i.e automatically forward actionable emails, jira tickets etc)<p>* mailing a link to videodl@mydomain will run youtube-dl on the link and then upload the video to onedrive. I also have a companion apple shortcut that does this from the share sheet without even opening the mail client.<p>* sending a pdf to pdf@mydomain will send it to my ereader<p>* article@mydomain will parse the link, remove ads and reply with the html contents of the article<p>For the backend i run an instance of n8n.io which can listen for emails via imap and run custom scripts based on the email address')
