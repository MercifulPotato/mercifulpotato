The term has been on the rise since September 2008 [0] and I&#x27;ve seen it routinely used and abused. Who can refute empathy or a lack thereof? I recently took a corporate training about personalities.

Make better teams through understanding; nothing new. One measurement went from what&#x27;s basically Extremely Empathetic =&gt; Data Driven (neither being bad, explicitly stated.) Routinely people that I worked with recategorized people in &quot;data driven&quot; to &quot;non-empathetic&quot; in casual conversation.
