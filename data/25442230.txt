All the &quot;vouchers&quot; that multiply your points are applied automatically through the app, rather than having to goof around with scanning barcodes as in the Tesco app.<p>I haven&#x27;t worked out my exact spend at Sainsbury&#x27;s this year, but it was probably less than £1000. From that I had enough nectar points to buy £100 worth of wines in a recent promotion, and I still have plenty left over... (points, that is. Most of the wine is gone, haha)')
