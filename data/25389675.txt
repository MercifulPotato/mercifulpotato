That&#x27;s why I think only an USB debugger cable could help in this case.<p>And to be fair, I&#x27;m just guessing the modules weren&#x27;t loading, after they got compiled in, everything worked like a charm. Didn&#x27;t debug it further, as this happened in the beginning of the pandemic and finding an USB cable not shipping from China, with reasonable costs, was impossible.')
