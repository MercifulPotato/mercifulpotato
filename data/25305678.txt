There are clear downsides (described in this thread) to all the possible options, and even the option of letting people choose between bad options doesn&#x27;t actually make people&#x27;s lives better at the end of the day.<p>Keep in mind that Chrome basically pioneered the concept of doing OS-level sandboxing between websites. We can complain all we want about how Google should give people the option to choose whether they want hard site isolation or not, but if it weren&#x27;t for Google&#x27;s investment in Chrome, we wouldn&#x27;t even think of the option. Would it be better to live in a world where hard problems don&#x27;t get possible solutions at all, where no one feels like they have choices taken away from them because the choices were never given them in the first place?<p>(I do firmly agree that the very existence of Google is anti-democratic, though... but I get there via an entirely different argument. I&#x27;m glad to see more people concluding this, nonetheless.)')
