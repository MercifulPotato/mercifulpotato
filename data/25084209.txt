Which implies if they can raise their revenue by ~7.78% while keeping costs steady, they can break even. Given their rate of revenue&#x2F;cost increases (in the same timeframe as above compared to the 9 months ended 2019-09-30, revenue grew 326% while costs grew 192%), they could very plausibly do so within the next year.')
