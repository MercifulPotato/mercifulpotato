We should assume either there is not much more to find, or even if there is a lot more there isn&#x27;t a way to make new technology leverage it.<p>We don&#x27;t make this assumption because it is true. I honestly don&#x27;t think it is true but we should make this assumption because we must ignore the attractive hazard of seeing simply waiting for new physics and new technology to be the solution to our problems.')
