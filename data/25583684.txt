BASIC was pushed on to the home micro scene by Microsoft. This held us back.<p>BASIC was invented at Dartmouth in the 1960s[1] as a simplified programming language for beginners, and was well-suited to microcomputers because of its interactive user friendliness and minimal resource requirements. Microsoft deserves credit for fitting a usable computer language into a few kilobytes (!) of memory.<p>Alternatives such as Forth or assembly language were not as beginner friendly, and languages like Pascal or C had higher RAM and storage requirements and were not interactive like BASIC.<p>BBC BASIC was a powerful and friendly environment that was neither written by nor &quot;pushed&quot; by Microsoft. Rather, it was pushed by the BBC, resulting in a generation of computer enthusiasts and professionals.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;69316&#x2F;basic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;69316&#x2F;basic&#x2F;</a>')
