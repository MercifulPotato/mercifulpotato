I&#x27;ve never understood this fascination of Brits, often those themselves who do not play tennis, to bash Tim Henman (and also curiously enough Andy Murray pre-Wimbledon win). Henman won 11 ATP titles, reached 6 grand slam semi-finals, ended 5 years in the top 10, and is an Olympic finalist. He&#x27;s also a pretty nice guy who continues to promote grassroots tennis in Britain.<p>Yet the only conceivable reason to the author that people might be enthusiastic about Tim Henman is <i>nationalism</i>? And to leave such a baseless claim without comment like it should just be accepted? Honestly I expect better from the LRB.')
