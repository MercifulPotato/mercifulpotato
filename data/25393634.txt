Should the telephone company be able to listen in and censor those as it wishes?<p>The parallel is phone companies in the past did listen in to peopleâ€™s conversation, but this was recognised as an abuse of a monopoly power. Regulations were introduced to stop this sort of activity.<p>What we should be discussing is how to regulate natural monopolies like YouTube, not if they should be able to just do whatever they like.
