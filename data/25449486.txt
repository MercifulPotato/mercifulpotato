Income tax for the median person can remain low while you kill tax incentives for high earners. There&#x27;s only so much &quot;consumer spending&quot; the top bracket will do in practice and very little of it will affect local economy. (I remember reading about this but can&#x27;t find it now, I&#x27;d love to cite it)<p>Then we need to account for how much the cost even matters to a given bracket. I&#x27;m nowhere near the top and when I buy an appliance, I wouldn&#x27;t care if it was 20% more expensive. Meanwhile I know people in more common jobs who would need to save another month for that difference. So yeah, tax me more and I&#x27;ll have a little bit less savings, but my spending will be barely affected.')
