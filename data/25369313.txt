When you take a drug and induce a huge spike of activity, the brain&#x27;s negative feedback loops are put into overdrive in an attempt to steer things back to normal. When the drug leaves your system, it takes some time for these feedback loops to move back toward a more normal state. It&#x27;s basically &quot;paying back&quot; the highs with some rebound lows.<p>It&#x27;s possible that taking 5-HTP in the days after the drug could maybe counteract some of the lows, but it&#x27;s not a magic bullet.')
