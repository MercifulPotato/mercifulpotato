Item(by='gnicholas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605651235, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25130182, text='Safari is migrating to a new system of extensions that will make it much easier to port from Chrome. However, I understand it still requires Xcode (which non-Mac folks can&#x27;t run) and a developer license (which not everyone wants to pay for). I hope to bring my Chrome extension to Safari, but honestly it&#x27;s not a priority because most people who install extensions are not running Safari (when you consider that most people are not on Mac, and a large chunk of folks on desktop Safari are there because it&#x27;s the default â€” and therefore would not likely install extensions).')
