Probably using only solid state components, having it completely self-contained, and having all the components built for longevity may be close to but not quite impossible. But it would be entirely unpractical for anything beyond the proof of concept, certainly not as a mass market device. The &quot;longevity&quot; part of every component likely sacrifices speed, power, and performance in exchange for reliability. Imagine things like much larger features in silicon, duplicated or triplicated (or more?) components and units, use of more non-integrated components, the system as a whole would incorporate far more redundancies that take space and possibly power just for the eventuality they need to take over, etc.<p>Not to mention that testing and continuous development are challenging to say the least given the timeframe. By the time you discover your design has flaws you start over with a vastly different 100 year computer.<p>So from all practical perspectives I can&#x27;t see a 100 year old computer being built with today&#x27;s tech unless we mean stuff running in hypervisors and emulators that are constantly maintained and developed over that century.')
