The way iCloud on an iPhone works, users have no chance to encrypt data before uploading it. Most people are only tangentially aware of what data is siphoned automatically by the service.<p>It would be the responsibility of the iCloud service to encrypt data (if Apple had chosen to do so, and a user opts in). Simply choosing not to delete encrypted blobs is not the same thing. The salient point is that Apple was _going_ to offer encryption as a part of the iCloud service, but dropped the feature at the FBI&#x27;s request.')
