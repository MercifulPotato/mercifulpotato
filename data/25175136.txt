I wasn&#x27;t aware of them and they look really good to get up to speed. I messed around with SwiftUI a while back but I haven&#x27;t for the past year, so those should help me get back into it.<p>The game looks very impressive for being new to iOS. If you haven&#x27;t looked into it yet, I recommend learning SpriteKit as well. Its animation system (SKAction) is pretty nice. I actually ended up basically re-implementing it in C# for another game I was working on, since it wasn&#x27;t terribly hard to do (got the subset of actions I needed working in a couple of hours), and you can be very expressive with it, once you grok groups and sequences.')
