I get the sense FB ads are really only good for things a consumer might impulse buy (e.g. clothing, games, small gifts, etc.) but anything where the user is probably going to do some more in-depth thinking about the purchase, they&#x27;re beyond useless. Which pretty much makes sense - even if you&#x27;ve drilled down your targeting well for business decision makers who may sign up for Ozonetel, it&#x27;s highly unlikely that decision maker is going to really want to know more about Ozonetel while they&#x27;re looking at cat vids and fighting with crazy uncles about politics.')
