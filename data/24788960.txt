In a meeting, people naturally listen to the best programmer, deal maker, explainer, or whatever else people do that is the currency of the realm. Think of a musician who has a diminutive personality, until they have an instrument in their hands and suddenly they&#x27;re a huge presence. It&#x27;s the effect of their physical performance and skill, which is something you can&#x27;t fake, that is the effect of competence in a domain. Charisma isn&#x27;t domination either, as domination is crude and simple, whereas having charisma means you&#x27;re the person people <i>want</i> to listen to, not the one they just can&#x27;t talk over.<p>In that sense, great actors are usually good enough at something else that they can summon the confidence from that into a role.')
