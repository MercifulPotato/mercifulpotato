It cannot disappear or be hidden in the machine in secret compartments because the paper is in the mechanical side of things, not software. Such hidden compartments will not fall invisible to officials on the ground. It&#x27;s not a black box machine in that sense,  officials run basic physical and mechanical tests on it before voting happens. The machine is dumb and tiny.<p>I still understand your point about &quot;anything can be hacked&quot;, but at this point, to hide something in physical sight needs on the ground support (which can happen regardless of machines), or needs discrete parts like a shredder which will make it mechanically huge and does not go unnoticed by such a large chain of command.')
