So, they found ways to employ people with short term contracts. That works better if you can contract out to other countries where labor is cheaper.<p>As someone who started out the career as one of those contractors, I can say that it is definitely not &quot;slavery&quot;. I voluntarily worked in such jobs because it paid far more than anything else that did in the local economy, even if I found a job there, that is.')
