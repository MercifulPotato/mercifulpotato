I admit I&#x27;m still convinced it&#x27;s <i>probably</i> the card (I have an earlier revision in a ThinkPad that works fine), but now I&#x27;m not so sure!<p>Curious: Are you talking about that &quot;little&quot; issue where the i915 module was randomly causing a panic? I ran into someone who had some really perplexing issues that a kernel update later resolved, and their dmesg was strongly hinting (to me) that it was linked to the i915 drivers. That, and a bug report I managed to dig up.<p>And I also agree. I&#x27;m looking at a Ryzen build, too. I have a couple of Intel NICs in my file server though and they&#x27;re better quality IMO than the Realtek cards.')
