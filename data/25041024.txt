They&#x27;re not really much good at anything else but having that massive tax dodge advantage takes the whole industry on a competitive spree toward the gutter.<p>Remember when it became well known what a terrible employer amazon are? So they paid staff to fake twitter post positive things about working at amazon? The only thing that will improve amazon&#x27;s behavior is if they percieive a threat of losing their tax dodges due to political unpopularity.<p>See now all this looks a lot more to me like vested interest socialism and cronyism than anything resembling capitalism but I&#x27;m sure my socialist friends will view it as the opposite. Everyone is holding their nose at the sheer stench of it.<p>Whatever your cause without cleaning up the endemic, pervasive corruption leading to massive regulatory capture, that cause is lost.')
