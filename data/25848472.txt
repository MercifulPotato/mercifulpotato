The whole point of the M1 experience is that out of the box, it&#x27;s fast, silent and runs for days. Yes, Linux will run, as it would run on any ARM processor, but it will be slow, hot and run the battery down in a couple of hours.<p>It will take years for the open-source community to reverse-engineer the ISA and write kernel code that optimally utilizes it. There&#x27;s no shortcut here. Until then, it&#x27;s not worth buying a Mac just to run Linux on it.')
