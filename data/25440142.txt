A very tiny bit. And your inability to empathise with these people is telling.<p>&gt; The UK has not &#x27;severed all ties&#x27; ... but, are you truly asking how it&#x27;s possible for a sovereign nation to function without the EU?<p>By spending decades building relationships with other countries.<p>The EU is UK&#x27;s largest trading partner. It is a huge common market with no borders, barriers, or tariffs. The EU has trade agreements with over a hundred countries that all members benefit from. Including, yes, Australia and Japan.<p>By severing ties the UK establishes a barrier between itself and EU common market, it exits all trade agreements between EU and other countries, and so on and so forth. It will be decades before the UK re-establishes similar deals.<p>&gt; EU citizens are denied the right to vet, or vote for the leaders and their platforms<p>Just a few years ago I voted in EU parliamentary elections.
