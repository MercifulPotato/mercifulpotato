They lead from behind the desk and the grad students and postdocs are the ones running the experiments and data analysis. The PIs just react to the data presented and offer guidance.<p>It&#x27;s a weird system, before they became professors they were running experiments in a lab and were able to get good results to get published and become a professor, clearly there&#x27;s a skill set there. But the minute they get professor job we take these people out of the lab and put them behind a desk. It&#x27;s kind of like yanking LeBron James off the court during his prime and making him coach.')
