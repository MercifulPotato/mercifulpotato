The first one is if it&#x27;s being familiar to what you&#x27;re used to and the second one how long it takes to learn if you&#x27;re not familiar with it.<p>Now I learned C-like language before I learned Lisp-like languages, so that might be the reason I felt I understood Lisp way faster than I felt I understand C-like languages. There is simply less to learn about the language and more to learn about conventions, while C-like languages always have bunch of extra syntax you have to learn, otherwise the compiler cries.<p>&gt; Other disadvantages include lack of typing &amp; poor tooling support<p>Not sure these are inherent to Lisps. There are plenty of typed lisps, and even the ones that don&#x27;t have types, can have types added to them after the fact, just because they are Lisps.<p>Regarding tooling, I&#x27;d say that the entire C-like ecosystem is far behind any Lisp language regarding tooling. I mainly see people using &quot;println&quot;&#x27;s for debugging, and sometimes using a &quot;line debugger&quot;, while Lisp developers modify their code at runtime and have a far more advanced debugger, something C-like languages will probably never do as well as Lisp-like languages does it, again because of s-expressions and the code they make you write.')
