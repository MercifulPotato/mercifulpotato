All these calls to order tech giants to promote specific views (even though I tend to agree with most) are extremely dangerous. I don&#x27;t remember who was pointing that this all basically forced Google to have a &quot;state department&quot; and a foreign policy. Same with Facebook.<p>Personally I am of the radical opinion that the source of all this evil is advertisement. I&#x27;d simply forbid it. Advertisement is the reason why social media try to increase engagement. It uses advanced manipulation techniques and recent psychological research.<p>The net would cost people 2 more dollars per month but would be a much saner place without advertisement.')
