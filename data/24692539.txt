There are different variants of it, in my VW Touran it works like this: When the car is in ACC&#x2F;lane assist mode (similar to Autopilot), it will detect when there is no steering wheel input for a while. First it beeps, then it will brake a few times to &quot;wake you up&quot;. Still no input? Then it will brake to a complete stop and turn on the warning lights. In more recent incarnations the car will park at the side of the road.<p>It is great for medical emergencies (stroke&#x2F;seizure) but of course you should not rely on it and drive without paying attention to the road.')
