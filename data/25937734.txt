The GFC was an anomaly - and banks got bailed out for taking on risks that they shouldn&#x27;t have been (and only some - lehmens got owned and they didn&#x27;t get bailed out). The bailouts were more about stablizing rather than saving the gov&#x27;t buddies, despite what the conspiracy narrative likes to make (of course, it _did_ save the banks, so believe what you will).')
