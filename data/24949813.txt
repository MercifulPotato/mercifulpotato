These floodlights will be used to illuminate the darkest parts of the moon, enabling the VIPER lunar probe to find water in places that are difficult to see. NASA demonstrated one of the floodlight prototypes before the mission.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ycnews.com&#x2F;guatemala-pacaya-volcano-erupts-and-parks-are-difficult-to-open-due-to-pandemic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ycnews.com&#x2F;guatemala-pacaya-volcano-erupts-and-parks...</a><p>NASA explained that the VIPER team has been testing various LED-based lighting systems designed to be used in the coldest and darkest places on the moon, which will be necessary for lunar rover navigation to find water in other basically invisible places.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ycnews.com&#x2F;united-states-launched-a-minuteman-3-intercontinental-missile-which-has-conducted-4-tests-launch-this-year&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ycnews.com&#x2F;united-states-launched-a-minuteman-3-inte...</a><p>As part of this work, we are exploring different wavelengths, including the bright blue floodlights shown in test images recently shared by NASA. These lights need to provide the best working condition for VIPER&#x27;s optical system, including various cameras installed on the detector. Among other things, these cameras will help it navigate around the boulders and avoid falling into deep craters on the moon.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ycnews.com&#x2F;china-relay-satellite-operation-and-control-system-completes-multi-target-space-based-measurement-and-control-mission-for-the-first-time&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ycnews.com&#x2F;china-relay-satellite-operation-and-contr...</a>')
