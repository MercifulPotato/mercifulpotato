That was when Apple decided to sever ties with Samsung and stopped designing cores for them and Samsung had to go back to stock ARM designs with the Exynos 5000. That was why the 5000 series sucked so badly - Samsung lost access to those Apple&#x2F;Intrinsity juiced cores. Itâ€™s also what prompted Samsung to open SARC in Austin.')
