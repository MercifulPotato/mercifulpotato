The enclosure is really great, well designed and easy to use. For the heatsink, I actually bent some of the pipes and used the lh6 kit to use two sides of the enclosure for heat dissipation instead of one side only.<p>The thunderbolt port on that mother board works great. I have an egpu that I&#x27;m sharing between my laptop and this computer and it works perfectly on windows. I haven&#x27;t managed yet to configure VFIO so that it works well on a windows VM in linux though.')
