Do we sleep on our right side to cover the right ear for less disturbed sleep? Or rather on the left, to not cover the right ear if we feel the environment is not safe?<p>Is the preference for the right ear maybe related to the preference for right-handedness in humans? Lying on the left side would leave both the right (&#x27;more vigilant&#x27;) ear and the stronger arm and hand unconstrained, the latter maybe needed for sudden defense?<p>Just a few thoughts, pick them apart.')
