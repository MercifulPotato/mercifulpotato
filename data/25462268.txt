Implement ray tracing and rasterization. Understand the math; I&#x27;ll come up quite often.\nLearn how the GPU works. Learn a graphics API, like OpenGL.<p>For the level you see in Cyberpunk, you need to learn modern, physically-based techniques. This requires a bit more math, though nothing you wouldn&#x27;t see in a CS degree. My favorite reference on PBR techniques is the PBR book, which is free online. Applying some of these techniques in a real-time setting is of course another challenge.<p>However, all this probably takes a ton of time and math and low-level programming knowledge for a newcomer.')
