Item(by='murgindrag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608815121, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25524888, text='Candidate thinks they&#x27;re worth $250k. Employer pay bracket is $200k. Options:<p>1. Bend policy at hiring. $250k. $250k. $250k. $250k. $250k. $250k (no raises)<p>2. Follow salary brackets. $200k. $210k. $220k. $230k. $240k. $250k (low initial salary, catch up over time)<p>Having been on both sides, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to make the case for bending policy further at annual reviews. Over time, employees converge to pay brackets. If you were hired with a on-off exception, you&#x27;re getting no raises for a long time.<p>No raises feels shitty to a lot of people. It also brings risks.<p>True story: I was hired by a not-for-profit doing good work. Pay was maybe 1&#x2F;3 of Google, and I&#x27;d be the top tech person at the org (not by ladder, but by skills). Pay was about 85% of what I needed to cover cost-of-living. They stretched brackets to get up to covering my cost-of-living exactly, so I was almost 20% over the upper cap of my pay bracket. Come next re-org, what do you know, they re-jiggle salary brackets standardize things, and my salary comes down 20%.<p>Fortunately, in the meantime, my cost of living had come down, so it worked out okay. I&#x27;m doing important, fulfilling work, and it&#x27;s fun. So long as I&#x27;m doing that and making ends meet, I&#x27;m not tempted to jump ship to FAANG.<p>And no, my employer wasn&#x27;t simply f-ing me; I understand the organizational structure, psychology, and dynamics well enough to understand what happened, how, and why. These were dynamics well above anything my boss, their boss, or their boss has any influence over, and I&#x27;d rather spend the social capital of going to their boss on something more important (e.g. making sure everything I do is open source).<p>A common career mistake people make is to assign intentions to places where the other side has no control. If you&#x27;re worth $350k on the free market, and you receive a $180k offer, odds are the other side isn&#x27;t low-balling you or doing anything mean or improper. They&#x27;re operating from their constraints. You&#x27;re operating from yours.<p>If you need $350k, and they can spend up to $500k, you&#x27;ll be hired, and how well each side negotiates sets at where you&#x27;ll get paid. If you need $350k and they can spend up to $200k, you&#x27;re not getting hired, period. It&#x27;s good to discover that earlier rather than later, but in practice, that usually comes up after the interview. In the no-hire $200k&#x2F;$350k case, although you might not get a job now, things might change in five or ten years, and it&#x27;s good to leave without bad feelings, and I&#x27;m not just talking about expressing bad feelings, but about what you&#x27;re actually feeling. If you come out thinking &quot;low-ball exploitative !@#$%,&quot; that&#x27;s not very healthy; if you come out feeling &quot;good people; no fit; difference in expectations; maybe next time,&quot; that is healthy.')
