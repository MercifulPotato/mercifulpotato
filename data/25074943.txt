IANAL.<p>Epic is trying to bring the product to the customers that want it, and if the App Store and iOS hadn&#x27;t existed but everything else was mostly the same, then those iOS users would simply be using Android or another similar product.<p>Apple&#x27;s investment in the platform benefited many (including Google and Android) but in this case Apple doesn&#x27;t bring anything to Fortnite that other platforms don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s just the users Epic is after.')
