Item(by='chucknthem', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607157268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25312848, text='&gt; I&#x27;d always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place â€” that it would basically be Cambridge with good weather. But when I finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not to be. The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better. Life in Berkeley is very civilized. It&#x27;s probably the place in America where someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home. But it&#x27;s not humming with ambition.<p>With VCs and touting a move to Miami, Austin &amp; other cities as tech spreads out, I wonder what message those cities are sending to attract ambitious people.<p>Or have we sufficiently gotten past the point of tech being in a physical location vs being on zoom, slack &amp; twitter.')
