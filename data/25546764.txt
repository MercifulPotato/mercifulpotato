I currently maintain about 30 Linodes and I have been doing so for the past 2 years.<p>Some things I noticed:<p>* The internal network is not private. But people don&#x27;t realise it. You share a &#x2F;16 with other Linodes. So many open databases, file shares and other services in there.<p>* Block storage performance is really poor, around 100 iops. Same as a SATA disk from 10 years ago.<p>* No proper snapshot &#x2F; image functionality.<p>* Linode Kubeternetes Engine was based on Debian Oldstable when it launched.<p>* Excessive CPU steal, even on dedicated cores. 25% CPU steal is considered normal. Over 50% happens a lot.<p>* Problems with their hosts. I can only guess what the reason is but 4 to 8 hours of unannounced downtime of a VM happend to me 6 times in the past 2 years.<p>Yes, support is friendly.
