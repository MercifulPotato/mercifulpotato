As a non-native speaker, i used to be able to mostly understand british english, and can easily understand the accents from e.g. the Thatcher-era UK parliament. Nowadays in british media i often hear accents that range from heavy (but still intelligible) to very highly &#x27;oxford&#x27; or posh to the point where they are annoying. I think it didn&#x27;t use to be like that, but i might be wrong.')
