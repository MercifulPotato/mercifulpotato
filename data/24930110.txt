It&#x27;s not linked, and I wasn&#x27;t able to find an article online, but the claim is credited to &quot;Christoph Trautvetter of Netzwerk Steuergerechtigkeit&quot;<p>Aside from that concrete claim, they offer a plausible explanation for why something that may make up a small proportion of sales could cause an outsized increase in prices. And they do draw comparisons to known cases in stock markets. So I think it&#x27;s still an interesting article.')
