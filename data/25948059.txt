Actually, designing file formats and network protocols is one of the few areas in software engineering where you do really need future-proof design and extreme extensibility, because once you release the thing, these are set in stone. Yet not many people seem to realize this. They instead &quot;future-proof&quot; their code with useless abstraction layers.<p>Anyway. Versioning helps you avoid ugly workarounds if you need to extend your format in the future in ways that its current version doesn&#x27;t allow. You then keep the code for older versions as a backwards-compatibility-only kind of deal and move on to the new one.')
