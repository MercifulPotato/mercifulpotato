I have been binge watching all the <i>overlanders</i> or <i>asphalt nomads</i> on Youtube that have converted buses, box trucks, step vans and other things into really nice, well insulated, energy friendly mobile homes.  Apparently all you need is a legal domicile, a place that you legally register as your home state.  If anyone could make an amazing energy friendly bus conversion, it would be Elon.  He could travel anywhere and call it home.  He could park on any of his business properties.  Have Tesla made a bus or mobile home yet?')
