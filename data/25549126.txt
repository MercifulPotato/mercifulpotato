It looks like many people are commenting about alternative realities and that exploring them is a fool&#x27;s game (BTW. I concur with that).<p>The thing which bothers me is upbeat comments about living here and now and planting the seeds for future changes. It feels like current problems (and desire to wish them away via woulda&#x2F;counda&#x2F;shoulda) didn&#x27;t happen entirely randomly. These problems are a result of systematic behavior&#x2F;decision making.<p>As an example, it&#x27;s too easy to say to yourself, &quot;I will start doing sport tomorrow&quot;. However, you wake up tomorrow and notice that your day is so busy that you don&#x27;t have time to do sport until 9pm and by that time you are exhausted and can&#x27;t do sport. And you repeat the cycle saying, &quot;maybe tomorrow&quot;. You start teasing your day apart and find that to squeeze in sport won&#x27;t require you just to add it, but also to kick something out. And that all the things you have the energy for in the day, you implicitly regarded as more important than sport. And as a result, you are stuck in the loop wishing to do something better but being limited by your other priorities.<p>And frankly, this bothers me way more. The immutability of the past is normal. Being so set in your ways that you can&#x27;t change the future - this is what scares the shit out of me.')
