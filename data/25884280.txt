And then I say, &quot;hello, how are you?&quot;<p>...because our first priority as humans is to care about each other.  If you are having a mental health breakdown, living in fear or heartache, if your basic, fundamental human needs aren&#x27;t met, then I want to know that first.  It doesn&#x27;t matter who you are or why I&#x27;m in a position to be a support channel for you, my first priority is to hear from you if you need help.  Fuck man, that&#x27;s what support is.  If you are only willing to support a product and not a person, you aren&#x27;t ready for a support role.<p>99.9% of the time, people get straight to the point.  But in the 1&#x2F;1000 time that somebody says, &quot;actually, I&#x27;m struggling a bit; my Mom got detained by ICE this morning&quot; it is <i>everyone&#x27;s</i> job to support that need first.  Merging the PR can wait a few minutes so that this person can be safely heard.  And that&#x27;s what &#x27;hello&#x27; and &#x27;hello, how are you?&#x27; establish.')
