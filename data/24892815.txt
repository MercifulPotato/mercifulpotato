Item(by='MaulingMonkey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603686322, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24892704, text='For me the biggest issue is that CI is often siloed to hell and back.<p>Even when most of the rest of the engineering environment is fine, the build scripts and configuration often aren&#x27;t under version control themselves, or are manually deployed - meaning any changes require access to carefully guarded server credentials.  This may even be by design as a &quot;security measure&quot; - as if I didn&#x27;t already have the ability to run arbitrary code on the build servers in question through unit tests etc.  The gatekeepers in question are often an underfunded IT department that has too much on their plate already, and are underwhelmed by the idea of reviewing a bunch of changes to &quot;legacy&quot; code that they&#x27;ve somehow convinced themselves they&#x27;ll rewrite &quot;soon&quot; that they don&#x27;t directly benefit from anyways.<p>And I find I can rarely run the scripts locally.  They&#x27;re also often hideously locked in to a specific CI solution that I can&#x27;t locally install without a <i>ton</i> of work on my part to figure out the mess of undocumented dependencies, and rife with edge cases that I can&#x27;t easily imitate on my dev machines.<p>My preferred CI setups involve a single configuration file, checked into the same repository it&#x27;s configuring CI for, that simply forwards to a low-dependencies script that works on dev machines.  Getting there from an existing CI setup, however, can be quite the challenge.')
