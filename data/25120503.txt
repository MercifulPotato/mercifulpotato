The measures taken included canceling any elective <i>and</i> non-life-threatening surgeries, <i>drafting</i> medical school students, many foreign doctors that came to help and moving covid patients in critical state from overloaded hospitals hospitals.<p>We even built two full field hospitals which we will thankfully not need as it looks like.
