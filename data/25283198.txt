That&#x27;s the million dollar question. Here&#x27;s CDC data that says 94% of Covid-19 deaths involved one or more comorbid conditions... i.e. these are not healthy people struck down in their prime... <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid_weekly&#x2F;index.htm#Comorbidities" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid_weekly&#x2F;index.htm#Co...</a><p>Point is, just a raw number doesn&#x27;t actually make a great argument.<p>Even worse, it&#x27;s a number without context. The most recent annual death stat I could find was for 2017 which saw about 54,750,000 deaths. So &#x27;1.5m dying from covid&#x27; is less than 3% of this year&#x27;s deaths.<p>In my opinion, and the opinion of many others, those numbers seem a fair argument for the &quot;overblown&quot; POV.')
