It&#x27;s an anti-mainstream censorship if anything.<p>Left-wing, (not neo-liberal mind you), outlets are getting censored too, just ask The Grayzozone, Jacobin etc.<p>As for your average Twitter consensus, if you say i.e. Biden, even Sanders is a radical socialist then you&#x27;re going to get laughed at, because it&#x27;s far from true.<p>But as far as the reach of conservatives, #ProudBoys is trending on Twitter right now and am getting conservative YouTube recommendations about the &#x27;culture war&#x27; on a regular basis, that&#x27;s despite me not being logged in, not watching conservative channels and having history&#x2F;personal recommendations etc. turned off. It just seems to be popular content right now.')
