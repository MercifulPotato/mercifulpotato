Up until that point I had only used Linux as a live CD on my dad&#x27;s computer, so when I saw the rigs people were showing off my jaw dropped. They&#x27;d ditched the beige and black I was used to for silver, blue, purple etc. with lights glowing inside case windows.<p>The one that left the biggest impression on me had backlit tubes on either side of the case front with bubbles flowing up, and the owner was demonstrating the Compiz cube and wobbly windows. I was smitten!<p>Incidentally, I also got my first experience with Linux elitism when somebody asked me what my favorite editor was and I told him Abiword. He told me &quot;Real men use emacs.&quot; Still a little embarrassed about that, but as a middle school kid I didn&#x27;t have much need to know the difference between a word processor and an editor. In hindsight I&#x27;m sure they thought it was pretty cute&#x2F;funny for a kid to visit a college event.')
