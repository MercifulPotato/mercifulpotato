The language server&#x2F;debug adapter protocols make it possible to develop a rich backend for your language of choice and a thin client to integrate into many editors, rather than extending a single editor&#x2F;IDE platform. You don&#x27;t really need to build an entire IDE to create a rich IDE experience, or tie that experience to a particular platform.<p>I&#x27;d also add that you can get really far without linters&#x2F;static analysis tools. A DSL doesn&#x27;t necessarily need them to be useful. That said, there are language agnostic linters you can use to add support for your own language.<p>I will say though that there needs to be richer&#x2F;better language agnostic tools. There are a few for linting, debugging, static analysis, etc, but there&#x27;s a need for things like auto formatting, CI&#x2F;CD&#x2F;general automation, build systems, and package managers. There are a many but it&#x27;s tough to know which horse to pick.')
