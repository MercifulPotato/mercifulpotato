Same as with Netflix. Google could argue the same for non pay-walled youtube content but that would be very difficult to legally pull off I expect - they would essentially be effectively changing the licensing conditions of all that content. If they can&#x27;t (easily) or won&#x27;t (for PR reasons if nothing else) enforce it legally, then there is little point trying to enforce it technically.')
