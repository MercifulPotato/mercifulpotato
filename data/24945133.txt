These protobufs automatically generate all client and server code and give us out-of-the-box backward and forward compatibility, increased performance due to binary format over the wire and more..<p>Our Architect which put together most of this infrastructure has written an entire series of blog posts about how we use gRPC in practice, detailing our decisions and tooling:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackpulse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tech-blog&#x2F;grpc-in-practice-introduction&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackpulse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tech-blog&#x2F;grpc-in-practice-intro...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackpulse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tech-blog&#x2F;grpc-in-practice-directory-structure-linting-and-more&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackpulse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tech-blog&#x2F;grpc-in-practice-direc...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackpulse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tech-blog&#x2F;grpc-web-using-grpc-in-your-front-end-application&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackpulse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tech-blog&#x2F;grpc-web-using-grpc-in...</a>')
