Modules are defined in the source code the same way as any named &quot;item&quot; in the language, like structs and functions.<p>The only difference is that content of `{}` following the definition of a module can be read from another file.<p>You can have a module without a file:<p><pre><code>    mod foo {\n       fn function_in_foo() {}\n       mod bar {\n          &#x2F;&#x2F; this is crate::foo::bar module!\n       }\n    }\n\n</code></pre>\nbut if you omit {}:<p><pre><code>    mod foo;\n\n</code></pre>\nRust will look for `foo.rs` to drop its content where the {} should have been. But namespacing is governed by `mod` declarations alone, not files.')
