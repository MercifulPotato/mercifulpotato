Haven&#x27;t read something so opinionated but clear and well argued about programming in a while. His summary rules at the bottom are great:<p>To sum up:<p>If a function is only called from a single place, consider inlining it.<p>If a function is called from multiple places, see if it is possible to arrange for the work to be done in a single place, perhaps with flags, and inline that.<p>If there are multiple versions of a function, consider making a single function with more, possibly defaulted, parameters.<p>If the work is close to purely functional, with few references to global state, try to make it completely functional.<p>Try to use const on both parameters and functions when the function really must be used in multiple places.<p>Minimize control flow complexity and &quot;area under ifs&quot;, favoring consistent execution paths and times over &quot;optimally&quot; avoiding unnecessary work.')
