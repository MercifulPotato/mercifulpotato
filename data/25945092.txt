However, current approaches typically use learning algorithms that cannot be reconciled with the intrinsic non-idealities of resistive memory, particularly cycle-to-cycle variability. Here, we report a machine learning scheme that exploits memristor variability to implement Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling in a fabricated array of 16,384 devices configured as a Bayesian machine learning model. We apply the approach experimentally to carry out malignant tissue recognition and heart arrhythmia detection tasks, and, using a calibrated simulator, address the cartpole reinforcement learning task. Our approach demonstrates robustness to device degradation at ten million endurance cycles, and, based on circuit and system-level simulations, the total energy required to train the models is estimated to be on the order of microjoules, which is notably lower than in complementary metal– oxide–semiconductor (CMOS)-based approaches.')
