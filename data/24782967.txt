I watched a bunch of BLM protestors tear apart my downtown while local politicians held back the police because they were scared of looking racist. I want federal power expanded until I live in a country that doesn&#x27;t tolerate arson and murder again. People had their chance to show the merits of an unmonitored society, I got a neighborhood full of businesses with boarded up windows because of it.')
