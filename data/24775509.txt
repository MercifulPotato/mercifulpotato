They aren&#x27;t. We have a history, a present. History (germany knows this more than most) is that a surveillance-centric law enforcement is the basis for a repressive regime. The stasi wasn&#x27;t a coincidence. The present shows us that state surveillance is on the rise. Again germany makes a fine example. Already repressive regimes (like Belarus, currently) give us an easier to grok understanding of the mechanics.<p>It&#x27;s easy for us to agree that it&#x27;s bad to supply these to bad regimes. If Lukashenko uses german software operated by german mercenaries (I believe this is a precise definition of the term) to find and arrest his dissenters, germans will feel that this company is bad. That&#x27;s easy. But, that company can migrate and I doubt export bans would have denied Luka much or changed the game meaningfully in Belarus. It&#x27;s effectively symbolic.<p>What is more important is for germans to ban their own governments from doing this, or at least strictly restrict it to counter-terrorism. If any police department can hire mercenaries to &quot;do cyber-policing,&quot; we get to stasi situations quickly.<p>Unlimited power is a bad thing, a dangerous thing.')
