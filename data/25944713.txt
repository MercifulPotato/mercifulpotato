They pulled off a miracle and succeeded in spite of all that and now legacy companies that did nothing want to legislate their own mistake away? Fuck that.<p>If legacy car companies want to use the network tesla built they can pay them for the privilege.<p>The irony is I think tesla <i>did</i> offer them access under better terms and they refused (either out of spite or stupidity, I’m not sure).<p>There’s no way we would have the EV transition we have now  (this early) without Tesla. I think there’s no way a government standard would have worked for building this up (one did exist, and I’d argue it didn’t work).')
