You act as though Apple is suffering. It&#x27;s pretty ridiculous.<p>This isn&#x27;t a draconian government takeover. It&#x27;s to prevent a company, of all things, becoming more powerful than many governments in the world. Companies have no allegiance to the people and must be checked.<p>&gt; Support free products with your wallet instead<p>That&#x27;s not how society works. Humans can be abused and manipulated and deceived. I have seen scenarios in which Apple was a <i>customer</i> of another company. Apple was incredibly abusive in many ways, and this was toward a billion dollar plus company. How do you think Apple treats or cares about others, including its own customers?')
