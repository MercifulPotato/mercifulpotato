I don&#x27;t understand that logic.  They get extra visibility + traffic clicks from Google but also want to be paid for it?!?<p>If after a Apple WWDC event, the front page of HN is filled with url links to Apple press releases and announcements, it doesn&#x27;t mean HN should <i>pay</i> money to Apple Inc to send eyeballs to &quot;apple.com&quot;.  Linking to other urls (for free) is how the web works.<p>IMO, removing the embedded snippets should have been enough.')
