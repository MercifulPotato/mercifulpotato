I don&#x27;t like the service, don&#x27;t like the polices, don&#x27;t like its nearly unusable glitchy interface,  I don&#x27;t like what it seems to do to people that I know and (sometimes formerly) respect(ed).  I think the &quot;twit&quot; in the name is pretty descriptive on many levels.  But that&#x27;s fine, not everyone has to like everything.<p>Unfortunately not using it doesn&#x27;t prevent people from trying to impersonate me there, cursing people out under my name, posting scams etc.  On the dozenth or so times I reported one of these imposters to twitter they asked me to make an account to report via their web interface.  As requested, I made a throwaway account.  About an hour after the account was created I received a notice that my account was suspended for violating their rules.  I&#x27;ve literally never used it, no one at my home was using twitter (or in trouble with it).<p>They&#x27;re just pathetically broken from top to bottom.  Broken service, broken culture, broken process.<p>If you get something out of it, good for you.  But I remain mystified why anyone finds it to be of value.')
