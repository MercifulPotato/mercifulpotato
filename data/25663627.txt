Even while playing Go, a human neural system spends a big part of its energy doing <i>mundane</i> stuff like moving your hand, standing up, deciphering the inputs coming from the eyes and every other sensitive body parts and subconsciously processing it (my back hurts I need to change posture, my opponent smells well, the light in the room is too bright, etc.). Interestingly enough, doing most of these things is also a big challenge for IA today.')
