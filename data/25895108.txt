We rip around 20kw a day on a AVG house in Aust. My folks shred through 30kw an that&#x27;s just 2 people.<p>Given power used to be about $3k a quarter or $12k a year for them...it&#x27;s only 3 years of bills to cover a 15yr battery. They already got 8kw of solar for 13k too. Not bad at all really, $45k for battery an solar, pays for itself in 4 years if your use is high enough. 11 years of savings before you replace the system.(aus dollars)')
