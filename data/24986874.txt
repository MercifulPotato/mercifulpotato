They are constantly scanning any avenues to pursue their aims and are willing to totally alter their careers and lifestyle to fake their way into a position of authority around children. Just a warning to those out their who would think &quot;he just like kids, I can trust this &lt;teacher, priest, etc.&gt;&quot; don&#x27;t, you still must supervise and listen to your child. I and other bus passengers warned our parents that this man was acting suspiciously and we were ignored.')
