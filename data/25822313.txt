Item(by='all2', descendants=None, kids=[25822527], score=None, time=1610981572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25821718, text='A = { 1, 2, ... , k, ..., n-1, n}, for 1&lt;=k&lt;=n, and we&#x27;re given integer n.<p>sum({1..n}) = n(n-1) &#x2F; 2<p>sum(A) = n(n-1) &#x2F; 2 - k<p>k = n(n-1) &#x2F; 2 - sum(A)<p>Is the interview question looking for a &quot;clever&quot; solution? I&#x27;m confused as to why someone would ask this question in an interview? It seems like the more challenging question would be &quot;Find a method of summing a range 1..n in less than O(n) time&#x2F;space complexity.&quot; [edit] I have a dumb. This calculation can happen in O(1). Because of n(n-1)&#x2F;2, we know the sum of the range, no need to examine each value in the range. [&#x2F;edit]<p>Or, even more fun, limit the functions&#x2F;instructions the interviewee can use (ex, some 4 or 5 instructions of x86&#x2F;WASM&#x2F;etc. machine instructions, max 1 or 2 registers, etc.) to complete the task.')
