(it&#x27;s someone else because we don&#x27;t actually create the entangled particles, we just &quot;get&quot; them)<p>The marbles being red and blue (or both red or both blue, depending on what you&#x27;re measuring) from the beginning would be a LOCAL hidden variable. It&#x27;s local because it&#x27;s been predetermined at the moment of creation and the marbles carry the property on themselves and it&#x27;s hidden because you don&#x27;t know how&#x2F;why the person putting the marbles in those envelopes decided those colors and you can&#x27;t see them until you open the envelope (measure the particle).<p>This way if you don&#x27;t open your envelope, your friend&#x27;s envelope contains a marble that&#x27;s 50&#x2F;50 red or blue and the color will be the predetermined one no matter what you do with your marble at home. So whatever decides the marble&#x27;s color has nothing to do with your marble, it&#x27;s local to the friend&#x27;s one.<p>The actual measurements work differently. It&#x27;s been experimentally proven many times that at the moment you look at your marble, the other marble&#x27;s 50&#x2F;50 probability of being red and blue shifts substantially to, for example 75&#x2F;25. And that&#x27;s without it having any way of knowing that you&#x27;ve seen your marble.\nSo there are hidden variables that we don&#x27;t understand, but they&#x27;re not local. They somehow affect both marbles.<p>In real life there aren&#x27;t only two colors and the probabilities aren&#x27;t those nice numbers, but you get the principle.')
