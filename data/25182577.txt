It won’t. But it will get you into a very good school. University of Washington is a great school. It’s average SAT score is just 1340. 75th percentile is 1460.<p>1500 is literally top 2% of score distribution. For most circumstances that should get most people into a top 5% school. (Top 5%, not Top 5).')
