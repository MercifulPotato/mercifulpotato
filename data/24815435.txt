There’s increased demand to have arbitrary query access over the raw data. The most impactful technology changes have been about pushing the access layer (queries, stream &amp; batch processing, dashboards, BI tools, etc) down as close to the raw data as possible and making that performant. What’s fallen out of that are better MPP OLAP databases (snowflake), new columnar formats (parquet), SQL as the transform layer (dbt).')
