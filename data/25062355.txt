The audio comping is nice. What I&#x27;d like to do is being able to run live as a VST inside Cubase, like FLstudio for instance. Cubase handles most of what I need for production and does it way better than Live, Live is more a creative tool than anything else, especially when it comes to complex studio setups with multiple monitoring, it is where Live completely fails.')
