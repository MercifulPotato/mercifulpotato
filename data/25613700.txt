Trying to shove Google Analytics down my throat, no contact information, no privacy page. Probably illegal under GDPR.<p>&gt; so I&#x27;ve sometimes wondered if a cheap form of &quot;sanitizing&quot; PDFs would be to simply force their PDF&#x2F;A flags on.<p>That&#x27;s not really how PDF-standards work. You&#x27;ll have to &quot;rewrite&quot; the problematic parts, the standards are just for checking against the pre-defined ruleset.<p>In professional media production we do this &quot;rewrite&quot; all the time (PDF&#x2F;X-standard). Though sometimes PDF files are just so &quot;broken&quot; that it&#x27;s impossible to fix them.')
