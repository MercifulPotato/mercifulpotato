Linux has an unstable&#x2F;ever changing internal API and Nvidia need to update their out of tree driver for the new release, and probably every release.<p>Nvidia is trying to put the blame on Linux, but Intel and AMD don&#x27;t have these issues because they open sourced and upstreamed their drivers (for AMD they mostly did), which is the way to work with open source.<p>Linux has always been fighting an uphill battle, but as it becomes more and more relevant it is becoming increasingly difficult to fight against it. Intel understands this, and AMD understands this.<p>The wording by Nvidia is telling for how they view Linux I think. In fairness it&#x27;s probably very costly for them to go open source (one time cost at least).')
