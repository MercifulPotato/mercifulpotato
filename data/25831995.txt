I&#x27;d prefer to have a free choice in what to do with my time than to restrict it heavily with a child.<p>I know what my parents sacrificed having me and my siblings. The world today is not build for nuclear families and the world before was nothing close to nuclear families. My parents had to relocate and had no support. They really cared about us and had no life outside of their children. I couldn&#x27;t do that.<p>There is a significant loss of freedom and time when one has children today.<p>Yes, I know that a significant number of parents are horrible people or have children in horrible conditions but I do not think that should require me to have children.')
