A couple of years ago the company I work for got boight by an Italian company. When we finally migrated the Windows users over to the corporate Office installs a bunch of people found that Excel wouldn&#x27;t work for them. Things like sum(A1:A20) were syntax errors.<p>After a bunch of digging i worked out that the localisation from corporate meant they suddenly had Italian function names not English. Very confusing.<p>Excel is a program that is both incredible and terrifying to me. There are ways of building spreadsheets that are reliable and auditable. Then there&#x27;s how 95% of people do it.<p>You can start out really quickly and make great progress. But it tends to grow and metastasize before you know it.')
