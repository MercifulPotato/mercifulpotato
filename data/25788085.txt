The current generation of GPU have over 10k single-thread cores...<p>The number of threads in a GPU cannot be compared to the number of CPU threads or CPUs, especially in 3D rendering. CPU threads are vastly more independent and powerful than those on a GPU. GPU thread divergence places significant burden and limitations on the design of GPU kernels. Memory bandwidth is very costly as well. This is a very active and open research area for 3D rendering, and this Disney scene is designed to test those limitations (among other things). There is a reason why most of the 3D animated movies you see were rendered on CPUs.')
