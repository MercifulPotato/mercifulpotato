Google makes the platforms apps run on (Android, ChromeOS, Chrome [web + electron], Stadia).  Google makes the services used to monetize apps (AdSense).  Google makes the services used to distribute apps (Google Play Store, Stadia).  Google makes the services used to find apps and services (Google Search, Google Maps, Google Play Store).  And that&#x27;s not to mention the deployment platforms, communication platforms, payment platforms, analytics platforms, development tools, content hosting services, etc.<p>They have so much control that you can&#x27;t hope to compete with any of their established apps or services - no matter how much better your own product might be.  All you can to is try to make something new and get big enough that Google can&#x27;t take you on directly.')
