What I&#x27;ve written is mainly cited by big sources (and I have included the sources in the article!), but people rather prefer to point the finger if they do not agree with you.<p>I believe the article title is a bit &quot;imposing&quot; on the reader, but so do are all the other &quot;click-baity&quot; titles we see everywhere, and in this case I am able to prove my point of view, being it through an explanation or a PoC that I do provide as well. But people are mean :)')
