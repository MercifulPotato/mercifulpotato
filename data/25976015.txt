Ultimately it turns into a churn of frustration, defensiveness, and offense.<p>But even if you manage to get a response to agree on what, &quot;right,&quot; means, the depth of their example is likely shallow. (e.g. &quot;Such and such had only 12 infections because they such and such.&quot;)<p>This, too, is problematic, because it presupposes a ton of equivalent variables between the two countries. Population demographics, geographic structure, legal structure, culture, economic stratification, etc.<p>Conflation between a, &quot;did it right,&quot; and a, &quot;did it wrong,&quot; country is practically impossible, at least in the context of pandemic response.
