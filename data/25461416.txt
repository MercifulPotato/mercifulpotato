So for example, rotating an upper arm bone causes the forearm bone to rotate with it.<p>How do you reconcile noise in motion capture data to bone transformations? For example, isn&#x27;t it possible that the motion capture data slightly elongates or shortens the forearm in a way that makes it impossible to maintain the relationship with the upper arm bone?<p>In my head, it feels like you would have to pick the closest point on the sphere that&#x27;s created if you rotate the forearm all around the elbow joint, but that seems expensive to do everywhere all the time.')
