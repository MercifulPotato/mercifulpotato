It looks conceptually similar to vice grips, and squeezing the handles together produces the gripping force. Is that correct?<p>I am a little more familiar with pipe wrenches, though, and even though it isn&#x27;t obvious from looking at the tool, it does grip harder the harder you pull on the handle. If you&#x27;ve never used one, I think it is worth the price of the wrench just to experience how it works.')
