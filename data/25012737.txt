The best instance from my experience as both is &quot;leading by example.&quot; Even as a tech lead and a manager, I went oncall, I fought fires, and I was just not efficient at delegating.<p>I later realized my juniors took this message in a different way. I wasn&#x27;t &quot;leading by example&quot;, I wasn&#x27;t empowering them to take on what they perceived to be &quot;my work&quot; and drive organizational change in a way I couldn&#x27;t.')
