I got it on a whim because someone here on HN was offering theirs for sale at a discount.<p>I wish I had more time to play it!  I&#x27;ll put it on and start playing, and two hours later I&#x27;m still going, I&#x27;m exhausted from the workout, and I don&#x27;t want to stop.<p>And my six year old loves it too!  She loves to draw in 3D.  She loves the YouTube VR roller coasters, especially because she isn&#x27;t big enough for the biggest coasters just yet.<p>And every other person whose tried it loves it too (sadly with lockdowns I don&#x27;t get a chance to share very often because I don&#x27;t see a lot of people and have to quarantine the unit for two days every time I loan it out).<p>My sister in law is an artist so I dropped her into the 3D paint program.  In 10 minutes she had made a beautiful 3D sculpture from nothing. My brother refused to give it up for days because he couldn&#x27;t stop playing.<p>And I just got a second unit from Amazon to participate in a virtual world experience for re:invent, and it was the most awesome way to have a remote meeting!  The sound is directional, so you have an idea of who is talking, and the avatars have hands, so you can see people&#x27;s hand movements as well as their head and body movements.  It adds so much to the conversation to see body language.<p>Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m a bigger fan than I thought I&#x27;d ever be.  Especially since the last time I tried it it got really motion sick, but that was years ago.  The tech has come a long way.')
