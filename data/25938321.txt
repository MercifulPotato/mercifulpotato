What the nature of that value is should be in the answer. And the answer will invariably touch upon a lot more than job satisfaction, so you don&#x27;t have to ask so many questions if your time is limited. Doesn&#x27;t always work on the phone (I find people are often guarded and overcompensating), but in person this question can be disarming and quite revelatory.')
