Whatever the motivations of this system are I see multiple benefits:<p>- candidates themselves have to show policy acumen and cannot rely on party policy<p>- Each candidate&#x27;s personal opinion is therefore more likely to be relayed to the public<p>- less political conformism as large parties cannot dominate<p>- Voters are forced to review policies every election rather than simply voting for the same party&#x2F;party candidates')
