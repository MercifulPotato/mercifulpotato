Even airlines with no MAX aircraft of their own could operate your flight with a MAX if they use code share or wet lease.<p>So while you can make your risk small, you can never be sure, without accepting that you may need to turn back at the gate. But on the other hand I assume you&#x27;ll be OK with flying it once it has flown for a number of million miles in a few years from now. After all, the airlines that operate non-MAX 737&#x27;s for the equivalent flights will be flying older and older craft.')
