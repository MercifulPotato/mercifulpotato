Tesla has like 20,000 SuperChargers. If I&#x27;m driving on a road trip, I need to stop at a SuperCharger and there&#x27;s let&#x27;s say a dozen spots. In some locations those spots are full, others might be half empty and so forth. How will NIO supply the hardware to do these battery swaps? Will there be a dozen battery swap stations spread out similar to the SuperCharger network? Who will deliver the batteries? How many do you need? What happens if you show up and NIO ran out of batteries to swap? Will this actually be cheaper than the SuperCharger network for me?<p>I think it makes more sense to swap the batteries out from a manufacturing standpoint, but much less so for road trips. You can see NIO already shifting away from this with increased range.<p>If you could just swap out the batteries why even bother working on range (NIO touting 600km+ cars IIRC)? I guess that could further limit how many swap stations you need (they could be more spread out), but the problem is you end up spreading them just a long main routes. I need a SuperCharger&#x2F;battery swap location in places like Marquette, Michigan or Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.<p>And as a Tesla owner and road trip driver... I really don&#x27;t mind waiting like 20 minutes for the battery to charge. It encourages me to take breaks I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have taken which are probably more healthy. Destination charging or a SuperCharger within a 20 minute drive of my destination are more of concerns for me now that I own an EV, but it just means the trip has to be planned out a little more.<p>I like NIO&#x27;s ambitions and like the battery as a service prospect, but much more for hey I want to swap out my old battery for a new one to extend the life of my car.')
