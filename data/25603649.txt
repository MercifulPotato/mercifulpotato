It&#x27;s how the money is spent.<p>Thank you. I clearly didn&#x27;t know enough about the problem space.<p>For others like me:<p>&gt; MAY 11, 2020 â€”The amount spent per pupil for public elementary and secondary education (pre-K through 12th grade) for all 50 states and the District of Columbia increased by 3.4% to $12,612 per pupil during the 2018 fiscal year, compared to $12,201 per pupil in 2017, according to new tables released today by the U.S. Census Bureau.<p>&gt; The increase in spending was due in part to an overall increase in revenue. In 2018, public elementary and secondary schools received $720.9 billion from all revenue sources, up 3.8% from $694.3 billion in 2017.<p>&gt; New York ($24,040), the District of Columbia ($22,759), Connecticut ($20,635), New Jersey ($20,021) and Vermont ($19,340) spent the most per pupil in FY 2018.<p>&gt; Public school systems in Alaska (15.8%), Mississippi (13.8%), South Dakota (13.6%), New Mexico (13.4%) and Arizona (13.2%) received the highest percentage of their revenue from the federal government while public school systems in Massachusetts (3.9%), New Jersey (4.0%), Connecticut (4.2%), New York (4.3%) and Minnesota (5.1%) received the lowest.<p>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2020&#x2F;school-system-finances.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2020&#x2F;school-s...</a><p>I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of New York (City?) policy requiring advanced degrees and certification for public school teachers as well as how involved New York Police Department is with the whole business.<p>How much of the USD 24,040 figure of New York goes to New York Police Department?<p>and then there are the football stadiums: how is this legal?<p>&gt; Eagle Stadium is a football stadium in Allen, Texas. It is owned and operated by the Allen Independent School District and is home of the Allen High School Eagles.<p>&gt; Construction cost $ 60 million<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eagle_Stadium_(Allen,_Texas)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eagle_Stadium_(Allen,_Texas)</a><p>How does this money break down? Would it be better to have a permanent school from home instead? I know I for one would not miss middle school. But yeah, the goal has to be clear: what do we want to achieve? If it is simply a place to park children, we can do that for a lot cheaper. If we actually want to educate, we need to spend better.')
