Item(by='rvense', descendants=None, kids=[25149176, 25148581], score=None, time=1605783778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25147406, text='I no longer think of myself as a &quot;document writer&quot;, and there honestly would not be room in my team for someone who only wanted to touch the HTML and not the CSS or vice versa.<p>I was there for the Zen Garden, and it was great at the time and in its context (Flash and image maps!), but now I&#x27;m using the web stack for a 3D editing application, and my last job was complex GUI for managing large number of IoT devices. The idea of separating &quot;the content&quot; from &quot;the presentation&quot; does not apply anymore. It&#x27;s just not a thing. Good software engineering is super important, more-so than ever I&#x27;d say, but keeping some parts of the UI in the .css files and some of it in the .ts files does not equal adequate &quot;separation of concerns&quot; in my context. It&#x27;s just not that simple anymore, and in fact in the previous job it was an impediment, since UI refactors became much harder because of the state of the .css files. In my new project, which was moved over from Bootstrap shortly after I started, Tailwind has made sure that many of the old problems just don&#x27;t arise anymore.')
