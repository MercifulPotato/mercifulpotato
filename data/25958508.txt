But that is nothing new.  Hedge funds die every day ... on paper.  But which brokerage houses are going under?  Other hedge funds are doing fine, likely profiting on this.  The fact that a few are held out as victims sounds, to me, like the other funds just stoking the panic.  I don&#x27;t see any non-paper houses closing over this.  This is Gamestop, not the mortgage crisis.')
