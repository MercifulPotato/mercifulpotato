Consumers are demanding more, companies are promising more, developers are worked to the bone and everyone still ends up unhappy.</i><p>The dynamic is the same in films, where all of the studio&#x27;s profits come from a few blockbusters (sometimes called &#x27;tentpoles&#x27;), and in publishing, where all of the profits come from relatively few bestsellers, and got that matter in venture capital, where all of the returns come from a few unicorns.<p>BTW, you might be interested to note that in film at least, the &quot;work to the bone&quot; component is largely missing (not that film crews don&#x27;t work hard, they do), and that the film industry is unionized to the hilt (Screen Writers Guild, Screen Actors&#x27; Guild, Directors&#x27; Guild of America, International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, etc. etc.), nor is pervasive unionization any sort of barrier to incorporating equity compensation (often in the form of residuals) for key talent.')
