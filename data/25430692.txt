The massive demand is artificially produced because of the logic of our economy. People don&#x27;t need a whole new wardrobe and new smartphone each year but there are few long-lasting options on the market. People shouldn&#x27;t have to own two cars per household so everyone can get to school and work on time but cities are designed to encourage the sale of cars. This is the underlying problem. We could make the world a lot less wasteful and easily support all the human life in a sustainable way. It just requires a drastic political and cultural shift. But we are told that humans in their nature are going to be this way -- even though there is plenty of evidence to the contrary -- so that you never demand that things change. So please stop reinforcing this idea.')
