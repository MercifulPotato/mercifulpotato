Why would a Jabra representative lie to me and say that it only supports 2 active connections instead of lying to me to say that it supports as many as I want? It&#x27;s far more likely that they were telling me the truth about their product and that you&#x27;re misrepresenting your experience than it is that they were lying to make their product seem worse while you&#x27;re telling the truth.')
