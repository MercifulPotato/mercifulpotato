Item(by='newbie789', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607202364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25312681, text='There&#x27;s a series of comic books called Action Philosophers that I very much enjoyed. Each issue is about a different philosopher (Spinoza, Plato, Aristotle, Kant etc.) and for light reading it&#x27;s really nice for getting a baseline introduction to different ideas.<p>Note that it is in no way comprehensive. I majored in philosophy in college and had already read the primary texts for all of the philosophers featured in the comics before I discovered this series. That being said, I found the interpretations to be reasonably faithful and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve recommended the series to friends that are curious and want to browse without tackling large, dense tomes.')
