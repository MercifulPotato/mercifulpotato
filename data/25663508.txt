Item(by='tylerhou', descendants=None, kids=[25663985], score=None, time=1609972042, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25663295, text='Your post shows how much disinformation has propagated.<p>&gt; We don&#x27;t identify voters and we removed chain of custody on ballots.<p>Source? Voters are identified by signature (and in some places voter ID). Re: chain of custody, as far as I&#x27;m aware, states generally require representatives from both major parties (plus independents) to be present when ballots are moved or opened. Since states generally have the power to conduct their elections as they deem appropriate, finding a national source is impossible, but I invite you to find me an example where such a chain of custody was violated.<p>Mail-in-ballots do not subvert this chain of custody [1].<p>&gt; Instead we put unsecured boxes on street corners to collect ballots and put them in the mail.<p>Drop boxes are locked with keys and are monitored with video surveillance. Sometimes, people set fire to ballot boxes, but when this happens security is tightened [2] [3]. In any case, the small number of ballots damaged by arson would not change the outcome of an election.<p>&gt; We eliminated signature validation.<p>This is not true. Give us a source. The closest thing to &quot;eliminating signature validation&quot; is giving voters the chance to fix signatures [4]. &quot;Eliminating signature validation&quot; is a false claim that Trump has spread [5].<p>&gt; I have no idea who got the most legitimate votes, but neither does anyone else.<p>The fact is Biden got the most legitimate votes. End of story. Any other claim is refusing to accept the overwhelming evidence that there was no significant fraud. That&#x27;s not to say that the vote count is accurate, but all evidence shows that any inaccuracies would not have changed the outcome of the election.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;fact-checking-mail-in-voting.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;fact-checking-mail-in-voting...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;26&#x2F;us&#x2F;elections&#x2F;in-boston-someone-set-fire-to-a-ballot-drop-box-officials-called-it-a-disgrace-to-democracy.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;26&#x2F;us&#x2F;elections&#x2F;in-boston-so...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;live&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;us&#x2F;trump-biden-election#ballot-box-fire-california" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;live&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;us&#x2F;trump-biden-elect...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;pennsylvania-election-2020-pittsburgh-elections-presidential-elections-fc464c287c18823ff57fedc13facf7e5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;pennsylvania-election-2020-pittsb...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;11&#x2F;trumps-latest-falsehood-democrats-are-trying-end-signature-verification-ballots&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;11&#x2F;trumps-la...</a>')
