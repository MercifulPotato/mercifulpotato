You can see that market is moving towards non repairable single use devices or that they can be only repaired at a extortionate price by authorised repair shops. \nIf there is no regulation, all companies will be moving into that direction chasing that extra profit and consumer will not be able to vote with their wallet if everyone does it.\nYour example is comparing apples to oranges. I am not saying that regulation should influence product design, but rather the producers should give access to spare parts and schematics.\nI agree that regulation like for A&#x2F;C example isn&#x27;t great.')
