If someone is working on a side project then they are entitled to conduct that however they see fit. However, there should be zero expectations that this output can then magically translate into business value simply because it was undertaken.<p>Most software that is written is regrettably garbage in terms that business owners actually care about. If you want to do something hard &amp; correct (aka valuable), that almost always means rigorous engineering&#x2F;planning to make sure everything lines up.<p>We wouldn&#x27;t expect a structural engineer to be able to employ one of their hobby designs for actual use, nor would we ever want to entertain that idea. I feel similar thoughts should apply to software engineering, which in some cases is also life safety critical.')
