The time I&#x27;ve spent working on software is only a proxy for the things I really care about.<p>- Sometimes I need to pay rent, and will work for projects that are a net positive when compared to the status quo.<p>- The rest of the time I&#x27;ll volunteer my software engineering skills on projects that are closest to my ideals.
