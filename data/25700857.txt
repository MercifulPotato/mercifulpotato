Clojure actively positions itself as a language great for data transformations, as does the community, where Haskell doesn’t particularly tailor towards this. In fact this is the first time I ever heard someone say that Haskell is a great choice for that.<p>I hear many more Haskellers argue it’s a great language for writing parsers, and with that I very much agree.')
