They would basically be the guys that would do the dirty work of killing people that there is no reason to kill legally (i.e. enemies that the army should fight). These paramilitary groups have been hired (or created) by corrupt politicians and big companies to seize lands rich in gold or oil from their rightful owners. These groups would also end up being part of the trafficking networks.<p>The current president has been demonstrated to have relationship with these paramilitary trafficking groups. That is why the president isn&#x27;t pushing any effort that would affect the way the cartels work. Congress is pushing in this direction, but the government party is still majority in the congress, so it has been a challenge.<p>A government entity that manages Cocaine networks would be a big opportunity for growing businesses, as it happens with some of the liquor brewers in the country. But that is directly against the interests of the current president. We all hope to change this in the next elections, as the current cartels are so powerful that they buy out, blackmail  and kill almost any judge, senator, entity or individual that tries to fight back.')
