Never a good sign.<p>In my experience, I have never met anyone who denies there is a pandemic of sorts.  Nor have I read anyone denying the existence of a pandemic, once the WHO made that call.   And I read lotsa stuff from all corners of our fair Internet.<p>Which makes the argument that [there is “pandemic denial” to be addressed] itself a sort of straw man argument.  You can forgive me not climbing down the ladder of this article when it is, to use the argot of today’s youth, “turtles all the way down”.')
