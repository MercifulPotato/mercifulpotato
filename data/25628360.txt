For example: if Twitter&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Youtube shows you content from users you follow in chronological order they would be exempt from responsibility. But, if they recommend you content based on some more advanced algorithm then they would have an &quot;editorial&quot; responsibility for the content of that content.<p>So if youtube recommends some insane conspiracy videos denouncing HRC as a lizard person, then they would be open to a libel lawsuit. But if they just hosted it and only showed it to subscribers or on search the platform would not be liable.<p>I guess &quot;search&quot; could be considered a recommendation algorithm but that could be carved out. And I don&#x27;t think that search is really driving the social pollution of these large online platforms.<p>Seems like a fair compromise to me since it wouldn&#x27;t affect fundamentally what could be posted online, but only affect how the platforms are processing those posts.')
