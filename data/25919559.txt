Item(by='glazyrin', descendants=None, kids=[25919919, 25919731], score=None, time=1611686457, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25916187, text='I think this is a truism which doesn&#x27;t always apply.<p>Suppose that there are 1,000 basement-dwelling redditors (okay, it&#x27;s a caricature). Each has their basic needs taken care of, but not much money, and not much scope to improve their lot in life. What little money they have doesn&#x27;t get invested, but spent frivolously.<p>Suppose 1,000 such people could all put in $500 and give it to a randomly selected one of them. That person wins a life-changing amount of money. They suddenly have their prospects upgraded - they can travel, buy a house, live in some comfort, pursue a dream career. Couldn&#x27;t it arguably be rational for all 1,000 to participate in that game? Doesn&#x27;t it make sense that the utility curve is convex, not concave - that $500,000 is more than 1,000 times better than $500, when compared to $0?<p>After all, suppose that $500 was a year&#x27;s spare income. Even saving for most of a lifetime would only yield $20-30,000, nothing like enough for many of the opportunities that half a million would make possible. And a lump sum at age 65 could be much less useful than one at age 25. Losing the $500 might barely make a difference to one&#x27;s quality of life.<p>Now suppose that to participate in this lottery, they have to pay 10% of the money to Wall Street, or high frequency market makers, or whoever. Couldn&#x27;t it still be a rational choice for each of the 1,000 to participate?')
