I remain skeptical that loans are what drove prices up. Declining public funding has also played a role. Sending money directly to public colleges rather than sending that money through a twisted loan system makes more sense to me. And the state &#x2F; regional colleges are cheaper to operate.<p>I&#x27;m paying tuition to two of those schools right now for my kids -- a state &quot;flagship&quot; university, and a regional campus of the state university system.<p>There are certainly tiers of private colleges, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to mess with religious schools. I&#x27;m mainly thinking of letting maybe the top 20 private colleges in the country become the destination for the top 20000 kids based on whatever criteria they want. But don&#x27;t let that system continue to distort educational policy and funding for the rest of us.')
