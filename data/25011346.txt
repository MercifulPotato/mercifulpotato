There is no other way, because if code concepts don&#x27;t reflect the problem space, development will slow down, become cumbersome.<p>But what I see and what a friend of mine observed:<p>- Most technical debt is just bad code\n- Most technical debt is just mistakes\n- Most technical debt is just a lack of basic mainteance.<p>Why call that technical debt?
