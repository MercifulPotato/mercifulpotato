This is why the iPhone ecosystem is able to run so much more snappier than the Android ecosystem.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t see how that translates to lower memory usage than x86 programs. I think the supporting quotes he used for that point are completely orthogonal. I don&#x27;t have an M1 mac, but I believe the same program running on both machines should use the same amount of memory.')
