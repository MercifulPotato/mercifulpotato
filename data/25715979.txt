I understand them, I&#x27;ve followed along on both sides of this and nobody is talking to anyone, the left is calling people racist for even questioning them and cancelling leftist media on the regular for being &quot;alt right&quot; whatever the hell that means.<p>I&#x27;m just not surprised this is the outcome. What else can you expect?<p>It&#x27;s not whataboutism, I&#x27;m not using my example to say they have the right to do what they did, what I&#x27;m pointing out is that you can&#x27;t have sustained &gt;100 day riots in portland with the government not being allowed to intervene and expect anything fucking less than an amplified repeat.')
