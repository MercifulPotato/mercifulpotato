Inviting people is two clicks and a paste. Joining a server (once you have an account) is two clicks.<p>This is kind of missing an elephant in the room.<p>Because even creating an account on discord after clicking a &quot;join server&quot; link only requires you to put in an username. No pointless e-mail requirement, not even a password, no nothing. Put in an username and you&#x27;re good to go.<p>This might look particularly weird to some of the HN community who are fond of optimizing the conversion rate of their pointless landing page -&gt; sign up flow and like to subscribe people to mailing lists that 97% of their users will find fucking annoying.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing a similar thing to discord on a site I run where users don&#x27;t even have to choose a name. They get a randomly assigned name which they can change later if they want. A new user needs to perform 0 clicks to begin using the product.<p>This was especially helpful in the beginning, because the first few people who stumbled upon the site immediately became users and started interacting with each other. By adding stupid landing pages, sign up flows, analytics (which then requires me to get permission from my users), and whatnot the site probably wouldn&#x27;t have gotten off the ground half as fast.')
