Combined with the fact that the battery on it was already shoddy and only degraded significantly with time, I legitimately would have to keep my charger always on me, or I might get stuck with a dead phone.<p>2 of my friends who bought Nexus 6P around the same time also had issues, with one hitting the infamous bootloop issue, and another one experiencing battery issues and automatic shutdown similar to mine.')
