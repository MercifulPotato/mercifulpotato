Item(by='ColinWright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602414203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24744814, text='Educational examples are rarely &quot;real world&quot;, and anything &quot;real world&quot; is usually too complex to make the underlying principles clear.  In quicksort, for example, any genuine example code has to deal with the partitioning code, and then the recursion aspect is swamped with the details of getting the partitioning right.  Trying to avoid that by simply describing the algorithm is generally unsatisfying.<p>I&#x27;m going to write a follow-up post to this with a genuine real-world (well, pure maths calculation) example ... perhaps you will find that more satisfying.')
