The trick is in figuring out if any particular advertising campaign generated more profit than it cost to run.<p>Also, there&#x27;s one alternative that&#x27;s often forgotten in these discussions: Perhaps game theory is at play. It may be, for example, that, across entire industries, advertising costs more money than it&#x27;s worth. But that everyone has to do it anyway, because anyone who chooses not to will start losing ground to everyone else. IOW, just like in the standard prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, choosing to act is less about increasing your potential gains than it is about limiting your potential losses.<p>There is an interesting long-running natural experiment in the pharmaceutical industry that suggests, albeit inconclusively, that this is the case.')
