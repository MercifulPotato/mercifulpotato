I&#x27;d hazard a guess that at least some &quot;ultra-processed&quot; ingredients don&#x27;t have any effect on you at all. Some might even be positive.<p>People take medication for health conditions after all, and they help them live longer, higher quality lives. What could be more ultra-processed than that?<p>Scientists and engineers don&#x27;t generally tolerate painting with such a broad brush, and it&#x27;s at least obvious to me that there are several confounding variables here other than  the artificial ingredients themselves (super high calorie density, for example).')
