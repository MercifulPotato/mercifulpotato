I&#x27;ve used basically the same technique you describe. I&#x27;ve tracked every calorie and learned how to prepare mostly plant-based (raw, whole food) meals. However, I exercised more than you describe. I like to walk so I&#x27;ve been walking 25-40 miles&#x2F;week. When I walk I can eat more and stay within my calorie deficit goal It became a virtuous motivational feedback loop for me. The other benefit of the exercise is that I haven&#x27;t seen any indication of muscle or strength loss while losing the fat.')
