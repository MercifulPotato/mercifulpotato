I never had an issues with the compilation speed of F#.<p>&gt; why use F# when you can use OCaml?<p>Even though both of them are in the same family they could not be further away from each other. OCaml has many standard libraries more you can read here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discuss.ocaml.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;what-is-the-preferable-solution-for-the-role-of-standard-library&#x2F;1092" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discuss.ocaml.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;what-is-the-preferable-solution-...</a><p>F# has (almost) everything that is available in the CLR, which means tons of high quality libraries, ready to be used in production.<p>Another advantage is AWS support. Since C# is a tier one language in the cloud F# is also a tier one language. I am not sure where OCaml falls into in this space.<p>Other than these I am not sure why, but these are pretty big ones for us. I love OCaml and trying to use it whenever I can, which is not that much unfortunately.')
