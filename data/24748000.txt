Item(by='tadfisher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602441702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24747701, text='I live in Portland. I march and exercise my Constitutionally-guaranteed right to peaceably assemble. On many occasions, Federal agents and police have preemptively declared peaceful gatherings &quot;riots&quot; and deployed riot-control agents and less-than-lethal munitions unprovoked. In others, they have not waited to declare such or order the crowd to disperse, and deployed tear gas and shot into the crowd anyway. Contrary to what Fox News is telling you, rioting is far from regular and I have yet to witness actual law-breaking beyond resisting arrest or disobeying law enforcement. The DA is dropping 70% of protest-related arrests because they don&#x27;t involve violence or property damage.<p>So I hope you can understand how little trust I hold in the police to make sure the suspect they caught on camera actually committed a crime. Consider a gray space in the middle where the system of policing we have needs reform before we can trust police with tools that make them more effective at acting against the communities they serve. Police should have been protecting protestors and their rights, but they have been antagonistic and violent from the start.')
