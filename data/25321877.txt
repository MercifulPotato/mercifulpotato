CSS is a big offender. CSS doesn&#x27;t specify the colorspace of colors, so typically browsers will just send whatever is in there directly to the display.<p>CSS defines that all hex and rgb() colors are always in the sRGB colorspace. There is also support for other colorspaces, such as P3 and Adobe RGB. [1]<p>The Safari web browser does color management for wide gamut displays correctly, so #ff0000 looks correct and not too vibrant. The biggest offenders are Chrome and Firefox, because they are not color managed. Those web browsers (and Windows) give you the wrong colors.<p>&gt; There are also plenty of images out there that don&#x27;t include color space tags, so it&#x27;s undefined as to what colors they&#x27;re actually trying to display. Some software assumes sRGB.<p>Images without colorspace tags have been defined to be sRGB images by the web specs [1] and all web browsers should already do that. Other software may do something else, as you said. I hope all software will copy how web does it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;css-color-4&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;css-color-4&#x2F;</a>')
