The timelines of their cases aren’t that different and Holmes’s case is both clear-cut and amazingly complex. Aaron was arrested in Jan 2011 and died Jan 2013 before his trial started and after being offered a plea deal of 6 month in low security. His trial never started and I can’t find if it was ever scheduled when I do a google search.  Holmes was arrested in June 2018 and her trial was originally scheduled for March 2021 but delayed until July. Her pre-trial hearings start in two weeks.')
