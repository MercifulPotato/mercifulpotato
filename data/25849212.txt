He&#x27;s saying he wants to move to another country to keep more of his money. If you can pay 10% for the same services (or the level of services that you want) in one country, but it would cost your 45% in your current country, then why not switch? There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that. You&#x27;re still paying your share under the social contract.')
