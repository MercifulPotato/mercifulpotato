In fact, I know it: I work for an investment bank and we&#x27;re moving vast majority of our UK-managed assets to EU. Roles are moving slower than expected, but with the assets being managed in EU, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before the UK roles become redundant if employees refuse to move.<p>Almost all my team&#x27;s work during last 24 months was related to Brexit and the change of legal entity. It&#x27;s major. Very major.')
