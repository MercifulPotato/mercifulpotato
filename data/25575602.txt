The issue is that on the revenue side thereâ€™s a big fat zero and I&#x27;m kinda lost to where to go from here. I&#x27;d love to keep the project going, but it obviously needs a new perspective and some novel ideas.<p>If anyone from the community has any recommendations as to where to look for a better direction for the project, I would to love chat. I&#x27;m almost at a position to sell the domain and shut the whole project down, but something inside of me fights against this idea.')
