More like a family club. (This is starting to change though)<p>When everybody is just like you, it leads to high trust, no us vs them mentality. Same is true in eg. South Korea and Japan.<p>Contrast this with their \nsimilarily northern neighbour Russia, which is basically the America of eastern europe. A nation resulting from a melting pot \nof ethnicitiess, languages, cultures (most current Russians are really assimilated from smaller native cultures, their great grandparents didn&#x27;t identify as Russian). And the end result? Corruption. Everybody just tries to milk public funds as much as they can, and so forth.')
