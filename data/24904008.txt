Then in 1999 came to the US (Los Angeles), and start seeing the difference. But my first boss, who introduced me well to the society told me it wasn&#x27;t so. He was growing up in the Valley (San Fernando) and going biking to school every day for miles. Also if you check the 80s movies - E.T., Goonies, and even now Stranger Things showing how it used to be - kids really used to roam the streets with bikes (same was in Bulgaria too - most of our kids movies were about parents going to the beach in the Summer, and kids in groups strolling around). Or my favourite kids&#x27; show - Verano Azul (spanish, and very popular in Bulgaria back in the days) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Verano_azul" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Verano_azul</a> - same thing - something changed much much later...')
