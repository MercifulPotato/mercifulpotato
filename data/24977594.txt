Unfortunately the same leverage principle applies. Which is why it&#x27;s almost impossible to get real justice - including tax justice - in a plutocracy. The scales are tilted too heavily in the opposite direction.<p>The answer is to balance plutocracy with effective political organisation, but that&#x27;s an incredibly hard problem to solve at all, never mind peacefully.')
