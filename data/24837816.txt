When I read <i>Fatal Risk</i> (about AIG&#x27;s financial division from 1980&#x27;s to the financial crisis in which it collapsed), there was if I remember correctly Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general for New York, with a bunch of cases on which he built a career and a ton of political support that subsequently failed in the courtroom. The result was a complete waste of money and resources on shoddy cases, some people got fired in disgrace and some people got popular. (In Google&#x27;s case it would be like the CEOs resigning while admitting no wrongdoing and the case itself languishing in court before being settled with no positive outcome for the society.) Let&#x27;s hope the Google case is not going to turn out that way.')
