Keyboard is just too shallow and key travel is just too short. It is improved over the butterfly but it still isn&#x27;t as good as the 2012.<p>The machine you mention is my work machine, but it has been docked and I haven&#x27;t really broken in the keyboard.<p>The previous work machine which I typed in probably 20k words a day was a butterfly keyboard mac.
