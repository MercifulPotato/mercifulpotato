I invite you to enlighten me.<p>Let’s say we use the governments force to close business down, in order to hinder the virus from spreading there.<p>When the government later stops applying this force and business can reopen with persecution, will the virus not just continue from where it left off?<p>In March they said “flatten the curve to not temporarily overload hospitals”, which I get, but the reasoning for keeping the forced lockdown only seems logical if you never reopen.<p>For this reason I’m glad my country is one of very few that never locked down. More have died here than in the neighbour countries, but I fail to see why they won’t catch up when they reopen.')
