I was playing the original Theme Hospital (1997) just yesterday on Windows 10 with no issues[1].<p>[1] Okay a couple of issues. It needs compatibility mode for the colours to look right. But that option is built into Windows so I don&#x27;t really consider that a failure of compatibility. And the installer is 16-bit and won&#x27;t run on 64-bit windows. But some years ago I made a copy of it after install and the actual installed game is 32-bit and runs fine.')
