They are using oil income to grow in LNG, renewables and other energy related business.<p>Exxon just doubled down on oil. Exxon is perfect example of people drinking their own cool-aid. They are just humans.  Cynically spreading big-oil propaganda without believing it is not easy.<p>---<p>I think best Exxon could do is to start selling parts of itself. China, some other Asian investors and Gulf countries would be willing to pay good money if they package it properly.')
