I would&#x27;ve liked to have built Emacs 24.4 from source, because that is the version against which my Emacs Lisp code is tested, but I gave up. (I&#x27;m using Emacs 26 instead and spending time adapting my Lisp code -- something I probably never would&#x27;ve needed to do if I could&#x27;ve built 24.4 because I am moving off of Emacs.)<p>If you&#x27;re using x86_64, there are tens of thousands of packages with pre-built binary packages, so it might be you never have to build something from source to get the desktop environment you want.')
