The way things are going nowadays though, it&#x27;s more likely fossil fuels will simply stop being mainstream; for ALL parties involved, it&#x27;s the more economic option.<p>I mean granted, there&#x27;s pretty big profit margins on fuel, but with electric they can get rid of the underground tanks, the trucks, the safety checks, the fire hazard, etc.<p>So whereas the oil producing countries have invested their incredible amounts of oil money into real estate, companies like Shell are investing in charging points. Because they&#x27;re good, long-term investments, they don&#x27;t need much attention, they can be placed anywhere, and every charge session is a bit of profit for whoever owns them.<p>I mean I&#x27;m confident Tesla&#x27;s long-term strategy isn&#x27;t so much producing cars - since the established car companies are going to overtake them in that regard, if they haven&#x27;t already - but infrastructure, supplies, IP and raw materials (charging stations, batteries, technology and lithium &#x2F; cobalt &#x2F; intermediate goods, and big projects for power companies like grid-level batteries).')
