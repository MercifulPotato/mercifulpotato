Item(by='usr1106', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607709541, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25388184, text='&gt; Sleep and hibernate have nothing to do with drivers.<p>That sounds like a brave statement to me.<p>Without knowing many details I believe that drivers can block the system from hibernating when they don&#x27;t cooperate correctly.<p>I am absolutely sure during wakeup the driver needs to cooperate correctly. There are numerous cases that some device does no longer work correctly after wakeup. I doubt that ACPI alone can be blamed for all of the issues, even if I don&#x27;t like the close source nature of ACPI.<p>Is there any open source approach to ACPI? Not that I&#x27;d expect to work better right away. But you know whom to blame. In the worst case yourself for not starting to fix it.')
