Immature people and people preoccupied with their own emotional issues should be signaled by the community at large that, maybe, they should first take care of themselves before they try to change&#x2F;influence the community.<p>I&#x27;m not saying censure them or &quot;deplatform&quot; them. Just that they should not be encouraged&#x2F;coddled&#x2F;enabled. We got here because the position on people saying stupid stuff about politics in public was met with &quot;just leave him&#x2F;her be, everyone is entitled to their opinion&quot;. Yes, they are, but if those opinions are stupid and spoken in public they should be laughed at so that everyone is clear that sharing stupid opinions leads to loss of social standing.')
