On the demand side, commonly referred to as a load, the main factors are economic activity, weather, and general efficiency of consumption. On the supply side, commonly referred to as generation, fuel prices and availability, construction costs and the fixed costs are the main drivers of the price of energy. There&#x27;s a number of physical factors between supply and demand that affect the actual clearing price of electricity. Most of these factors are related to the transmission grid, the network of high voltage power lines and substations that ensure the safe and reliable transport of electricity from its generation to its consumption.</i><p>Which customers (e.g. data centers, mining firms) would take advantage of <i>retail</i> intraday rates?<p>How does cost and availability of storage affect the equilibrium price of electricity?')
