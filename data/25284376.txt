Even in middle-class and upper middle-class jobs there&#x27;s a prevalent fear of having to be seen in the office at all cost to avoid being fired.<p>What you are suggesting is the exact opposite of this, with the addition of being extra cruel against people who are not privileged enough to have a cushy job that allows them to work from home.')
