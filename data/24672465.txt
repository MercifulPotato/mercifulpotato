Just big pressurised tanks?  Also be interesting to see how they refuel the train, because I imagine that small hydrogen molecules are difficult to confine, while the gas is so diffuse that it must take ages.<p>Edit: I found a better link which has more technical details:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.railway-technology.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;hydroflex-hydrogen-train&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.railway-technology.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;hydroflex-hydrog...</a><p><i>A total of 20kg of hydrogen is stored in four high-pressure hydrogen fuel tanks whose pressure is regulated and maintained at 8.5 bar by the pressure drop regulator.</i><p><i>The fuel cell unit is powered by hydrogen from the tanks, while oxygen is sourced from ambient air. The fuel cell converts the mixture and generates pure water and electricity up to 100kW. Electricity generated by the fuel cell will be sent to the lithium-ion battery pack.</i>')
