After reading multiple online articles(from the UK) about the digital divide(mostly related to education) that has surfaced during the lockdown I decided to start this sub-reddit. Imagine if a developed country like the UK is facing this problem, then what will be the situation of developing and under-developed countries. The bubbling-up of the digital divide issue during the lockdown period is not just related to the UK. It is worst in many other countries. This sub-reddit is to help bridge the digital divide.<p>Due to the lockdown schools have started teaching kids remotely. But many students do not have the means for remote education(even in developed countries). Even dedicated teachers are struggling with remote teaching.<p>To help kids and their teachers, please donate computers or your services to help kids with remote learning. Form your local groups&#x2F;communities using this sub-reddit.<p>I hope this sub-reddit will help bridge the gap between the students who can and cannot afford computers and or internet for remote learning.<p>Thank you.')
