I would not dare to suggest there are easy answers here. My initial reaction was to attempt to argue that we are not, in fact a democracy, completely derailing the conversation in an attempt simply to &#x27;win&#x27; an argument. I am oddly surprised with myself over this. There is no ego here. Nothing to prove. And yet, the need to be right on the internet prevails. This agrees with your note that humans are not rational.<p>I definitely agree that lying is effective. I agree that outrage machine is getting really annoying, but I also found a way to deal with it in an imperfect way. Stop consuming this information and, eventually, stop internalizing this overwhelming pile of crap that is shoved into our minds 24&#x2F;7.<p>There is a reason we are a republic. There is a reason we protect ( or at least give lip service to protecting ) minority voices. And that&#x27;s usually, because popular opinions don&#x27;t need defenders. And I want those voices protected even if they are unpopular, ill-informed, dishonest, or even just lying.<p>The alternative is that we ban lying. Period. No cute ads that dance on the edge of misrepresentation. No white lies. You had a shitty day. Say so. No lie of omission. Your company uses child labor, disclose it in 10-k ( oi, all material facts should be available for investors ). No politician talk. We usher a new world where dictionary police is king and every single one of us has to weigh each word carefully..<p>I feel I should apologize. This post may be now coming across as snarky. I think that fact that I don&#x27;t really have a good answer makes me frustrated.<p>edit: added don&#x27;t in last sentence.')
