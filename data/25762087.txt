I have two adult friends that were home schooled and both resent their parents for it. One was home schooled because their devoutly religious parents didn’t want them socializing with non-religious students. The other because their parents didn’t believe the available school could serve their needs related to autism.<p>Both vocally believe they were significantly stunted academically, socially, and professionally.<p>Anecdotes are anecdotes, but it’s always nice to hear the other side.')
