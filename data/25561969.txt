This is making school life for kids punishingly competitive. It&#x27;s a-few-winners-take-all, with most of the winners already pre-determined by being born rich. Every middle class parent is taking extreme steps to get their kid a chance of being one of those winners.<p>When I was a kid, there was college+professional job out there for the A and B students, and there were jobs at the factory or mill out there waiting for the C and D students. Now, it&#x27;s success for the A++ students with the &quot;right&quot; extra-curriculars (and for the too-rich-to-fail kids), and unemployment&#x2F;meth&#x2F;prison for the remaining A, B, C, and D students.')
