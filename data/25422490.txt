Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607976279, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25418663, text='&gt; Yes he didn&#x27;t wear masks as press conferences because they entire administration was lax about mask usage. And then for you to argue and only mention the press conferences is extremely disingenuous.<p>You&#x27;re missing my point. They would follow him around with a camera and any time they could show him without a mask there would be another story, regardless of the facts or the context. They would write the same story <i>whether or not</i> he was doing anything wrong in that instance.<p>That&#x27;s a recipe for creating partisan conflict. They write the story when he&#x27;s not doing anything wrong and then people correctly defend him. The existence of true instances are not a defense to reporting false ones. Because this is basic psychology; once people start defending something they keep doing it. So they <i>created</i> a large population of people willing to defend not wearing a mask. It was totally irresponsible.<p>It&#x27;s the old saw about how the best way to discredit an idea is to defend it loudly with transparently erroneous arguments. That&#x27;s what CNN were doing throughout.<p>&gt; And that&#x27;s separate from the Mexico argument. To me, it&#x27;s incredible how little responsibility certain groups of people take for their own actions.<p>Please pay attention to context.<p>The argument I&#x27;m making is that the severe lockdowns as used in Australia could not have been as effective here because they only work if you can close your borders in practice, which Australia can do and the US can&#x27;t. We&#x27;re not even talking about &quot;low effort, low cost&quot; methods -- the argument is that higher cost efforts, of the sort that could actually get the number of cases to zero, couldn&#x27;t have worked here. Even if the US put everyone in solitary confinement for a month, attempting to reopen the day after that would have still seen dozens of new cases.<p>That is a different argument to the one that more severe extended lockdowns would have saved lives. Which might very well be true (though against some grisly trade offs), but it&#x27;s no support for claiming that it would have been better for US manufacturing in 2020, which is ridiculous.')
