New Jersey - 183\n2. New York - 172\n3. Massachusetts - 142\n4. Connecticut - 128\n5. Louisiana - 124<p>These states have had some of the harshest restrictions. They&#x27;ve gotten worse results than the mixed approach for the rest of the country.<p>Good case in point: Michigan vs Florida. Both have about the same deaths per million at 74 and 75 respectively. Yet Florida is fully open with no restrictions. And Michigan had some of the harshest lockdowns and restrictions.<p>Density may have been some kind of argument early on, but we are 9 or 10 months into this.
