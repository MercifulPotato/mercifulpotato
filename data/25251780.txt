It’s not because they’re producing less valuable code, the company sells the product for the same price to anyone anywhere.<p>But the Turkish engineer is basically told by the company that because she’s stuck there and she can’t move elsewhere, then it’s normal to get paid a tenth of her SV colleague.<p>How is that fair?')
