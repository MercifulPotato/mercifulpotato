It&#x27;s happened before - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tB8D2QZ9lA4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tB8D2QZ9lA4</a><p>It&#x27;s unlikely to be an electric vehicle if it&#x27;s carrying a full-sized human.  You just need so much weight in batteries &amp; swept area for props for more than a couple minutes of flight that it&#x27;s difficult to pack it into a form factor anything like the size &amp; shape of a human.<p>Given the location and the current state of the technology, though, a liquid fueled jetpack is perfectly possible.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be very efficient if the flight is only a few minutes long.  A typical helicopter may achieve 5 hours in the air without any lift to glide ratio.  Jets are less efficient, but still efficient enough for short flights.<p>You may infer a TWR limitation of jet aircraft.  It&#x27;s real, but it&#x27;s not driven by technical limitations of the jet propulsion technology, but rather by maximizing the range using optimal amounts of lift &amp; fuel for a fixed mass of engine.  It doesn&#x27;t make much sense to use engines so powerful &amp; heavy as a fraction of aircraft mass that they can hover straight up to cruising altitude; If you had engines that powerful, you would be hanging a bigger fuel tank on the vehicle and launch it conventionally.  VTOL at high subsonic or faster is an exceedingly range-limited means of flight.')
