I remember setedit and rhide about twenty years ago.</i><p>Yeah. SET published their port on GitHub a few months ago:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;set-soft&#x2F;tvision" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;set-soft&#x2F;tvision</a><p>One of the motivations to undertake this project was when I realized SET&#x27;s Turbo Vision didn&#x27;t support UTF-8 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;windoze&#x2F;tvision&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;windoze&#x2F;tvision&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5</a>).<p>&gt; <i>However, 16 colors?</i><p>This is not a design choice of mine. It&#x27;s what the original Turbo Vision supported and I still haven&#x27;t gotten around to extend it.<p>&gt; <i>Also, windows console is in maintenance only these days. Everyone is moving to Windows terminal and for good reason.</i><p>Using the Win32 Console API doesn&#x27;t imply that applications will only work in the legacy Windows console. Windows Terminal supports this, as well as any terminal taking advantage of the Windows Pseudo Console (ConPTY) API (i.e. Git Bash).<p>From a programmer&#x27;s perspective, using ANSI escape sequences to display text is fairly simple (and is what Turbo Vision does). But processing input is a pain in the ass, as it requires a complex VT sequence parser. So I stuck with the Console API for input. Anyway, there would be no problem in replacing the current console I&#x2F;O strategy with something entirely different or even having many of them and picking one at runtime.<p>&gt; <i>Unlikely anyone is using DOS any longer, maybe freedos but still.</i><p>That&#x27;s what I thought, until someone opened an issue and explained they were building for DOS...

So DOS support is staying for now.')
