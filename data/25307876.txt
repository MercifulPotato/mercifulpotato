I agree, but it sounds like the conversation went like this:<p><i>employee: I&#x27;m not happy about x, y and z. If you don&#x27;t do those, I&#x27;m going to quit.<p>manager: well we are not going to do those, so thank you for your time. We accept your resignation and would like it to start immediately (i.e. you&#x27;re fired).\n</i><p>If you are gonna tell your manager that you plan to resign if a condition isn&#x27;t met, then what do you expect them to say if they don&#x27;t plan to fulfill that condition? It sounds like she was expecting them to say <i>&quot;Hey, well we don&#x27;t want to meet your demands, but sure, we&#x27;re happy to have a disgruntled employee around here, so feel free to stick around, or you could just quit on your own timeline, no sweat&quot;.</i><p>I suspect that <i>many</i> people would be fired on the spot for threatening to resign, so don&#x27;t threaten it if you aren&#x27;t okay with that consequence.')
