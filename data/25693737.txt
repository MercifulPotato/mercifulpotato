Their 7nm node is significantly behind schedule. Their only solution in the near-term is to keep increasing the TDP of their chips, which won&#x27;t work for long.<p>This might be their only good option. Sure outsourcing manufacturing is a risk, but it&#x27;s probably one they need to take. They will catch back up if they can get their 7nm node back on track, which isn&#x27;t a given.')
