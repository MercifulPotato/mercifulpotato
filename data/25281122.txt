So for a marginal cost of, let’s say, $2m for a reflown booster, there are still able to charge $50m+.<p>But since their customers are seeing prices of $50m, space is still expensive... nothing much has changed.<p>(I’ve simplified this by omitting the fact that the upper stage is not reusable)<p>A lot of BFR development is being done in the open in Boca Chica, and you can follow along because it’s being live-streamed almost 24&#x2F;7. BFR has had small incremental hops recently and will try for a 15km flight this week. We’ll see what happens.')
