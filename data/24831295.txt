A key part of the puzzle is probably that it takes significant skill and knowledge to forage off the land, while farming takes considerably less skill and more grunt labor. Humans shifted from a small population of hunter-gathers to a large population of taxable and conscriptable farmers-from-birth that forced nomads out into marginal lands where farmers couldn&#x27;t survive. It seems that the internet is going through a similar dynamic. Highly skilled tech wizards that can roll their own equipment will continue to exist at the fringes, but the mass of less skilled and centrally manipulated users will dictate the momentum of the internet going forwards, much like how highly populated agricultural states became the dominant historical force based on their sheer mass and numbers.')
