Apart from 1 or 2 moments (spider bot is cool,hotel theft job alright.)<p>It&#x27;s just very run and gun. And uniteresting. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m in the minority, but I&#x27;d love it to be a mix of syndicate (if you know that game), Detroit, and something like a point and click game. Something with a ton of interaction and only a bit of fighting.')
