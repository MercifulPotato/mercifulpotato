I&#x27;ve seen the case where for example User A is leaving Company Z and the developers have, for some reason, rigged it so removing A&#x27;s access to all documents in the world has to happen in one giant cross-shard transaction, because it&#x27;s <i>consistent</i> which means it&#x27;s <i>correct</i>. But ... that&#x27;s crazy. There&#x27;s a hundred equally-correct ways to do it with tombstones and ordering and without cross-shard or even cross-row transactions. If you give a developer something that looks like BigTable they&#x27;ll learn to deal with ordering, instead of using atomicity as a crutch.')
