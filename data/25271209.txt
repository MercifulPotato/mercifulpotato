May I suggest the following: &quot;Legal justice occurs when all individual persons are treated equally and fairly under the law, and when no person is allowed to wrongfully take advantage of another.&quot;<p>As others have mentioned, I think this philosophy&#x27;s weakness is that it leads to the very opposite of legal justice. There ought to be an <i>objective</i> legal standard that doesn&#x27;t change based on who appears on the docket, the judge&#x27;s unconscious bias&#x2F;prejudice, how the judge is feeling about the case, his&#x2F;her sense of how society is faring, or what he&#x2F;she had for lunch. That&#x27;s why legislators write law and judges interpret law, and why &quot;legislating from the bench&quot; is an aspersion and not something to which good judges aspire.<p>Legal subjectivism is just a big invitation to injustice -- which indeed can and does happen when the judge and legislator are the same person. (Hopefully he&#x2F;she is not also the executioner.)')
