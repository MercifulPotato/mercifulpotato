It is best to have them fully separated so they can&#x27;t communicate. They should communicate exclusively via the user.<p>Which gets targeted more and why, the user or the password manager?<p>If you are suggesting that we should be manually entering passwords into sites as copied&#x2F;observed from our password managers, that removes the anti-phishing benefits of password managers altogether by giving primary control back to the human.  If I never type a password again, those hackers sending fake login page links &quot;from my boss&quot; will never gain me.  Not so with no direct connection between my password manager and my browser.')
