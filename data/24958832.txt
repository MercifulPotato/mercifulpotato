If the volume is FileVault-encrypted, it can get quite “greedy” about holding onto deleted files.<p>Even though it is supposed to let go of the space upon demand, it is my experience that it does not.<p>When a big update came out (don’t remember exactly which one, but it was a couple or so months ago), my disk space was down to about 13GB free, even though I had deleted over 150GB of files. The update refused to run, citing lack of space.<p>I had to wipe the disk, and use Migration Assistant to restore the disk.<p>That was the <i>second</i> time this has happened.<p>I think that this particular aspect of APFS still needs a lot of work.')
