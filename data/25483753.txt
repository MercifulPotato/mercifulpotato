Item(by='nmfisher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608436828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480257, text='The problem is we actually conflate two related, but not identical, concepts when we talk about &quot;bias&quot;.<p>The first is statistical bias - feeding algorithms training data that is somehow unrepresentative of the &quot;real world&quot; (or more specifically, the actual class of data for the intended use case). As an example, applying facial recognition to Caucasian faces when the model was solely trained on Chinese faces, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time. The problem was that your data was &quot;biased&quot;, because you actually wanted a model that recognizes &quot;human faces&quot;, but you trained on the biased subset of &quot;Chinese faces&quot;.<p>The second is the ethical&#x2F;political notion of &quot;bias&quot; against individuals; more concretely, the idea that a society is &quot;just&quot; when people are judged as individuals, and not prejudiced by their gender&#x2F;skin colour&#x2F;etc. In this respect, when we say &quot;we should not be biased against men&quot;, we really mean that &quot;an individual man should not be treated any differently from a woman, even though men are overwhelmingly perpetrators (and victims) homicide&quot;.<p>The complication is that <i>reality is inherently imbalanced&#x2F;biased</i>. Society can be chopped up into a lot of sub-views that skew towards particular demographics. Some are relatively harmless. &quot;OnlyFans content creators&quot; aren&#x27;t 50-50 men-women, and men aren&#x27;t charging the same as women either. Some are not - &quot;murderers&quot; are mostly men, black men are overrepresented in the &quot;criminal&quot; group, and so on.<p>This raises some obvious questions:<p>1) Why is this the case? Is this the result of systemic discrimination? Historical oppression? Innate preference? Cultural pressure to conform?<p>2) If you can answer (1), how does that influence your view of what a &quot;just&quot; society is? For example, do you consider it to be &quot;unjust&quot; to be wary of men (and men only) to protect yourself from random physical violence when you&#x27;re out and about?<p>3) Does everyone share your view on what a &quot;just&quot; society is?<p>4) How do these answers dictate what you should &quot;do&quot; about it? As a voter? As an ML practitioner? As a CEO?<p>I&#x27;m not going to delve further into these questions, because they cause a lot of contention and deserve more time&#x2F;consideration than I can justify right now in a HN post.<p>The main reason I decided to comment is that I&#x27;ve seen too much debate that tries to steamroll people into accepting conclusions without considering or answering these questions. Even worse, some people are actively trying to silence others who simply want to discuss these questions, rather than swallowing their conclusions uncritically.<p>(This is not levelled at you, by the way, your comment just presented an opportunity to lay out my thoughts.)<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone can meaningfully discuss the (ethical) concept of &quot;bias&quot; without first laying out a very comprehensive perspective of &quot;society&quot; that touches on all of these points.<p>There was a joint paper from Google, Facebook (and possibly others) about 2 years ago that I thought handled this exceptionally well. The authors addressed many of these questions honestly and objectively, and most importantly, <i>acknowledged the potential for disagreement</i>.')
