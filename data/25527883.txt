A lot of languages and frameworks promise to make programming fun, Elm is the only one that&#x27;s held up for more than a few weeks. Months later I&#x27;m still doing substantial side projects in it and get a rush just from opening up a new .elm file and starting a new set of types and pure functions.<p>Funny you should mention type classes-- that&#x27;s one of the biggest things that Elm, the little brother to Haskell in many ways, doesn&#x27;t support (and doesn&#x27;t intend to, for reasons of limiting the footguns available to devs and also keeping to the high standard it sets for itself for error messages IIRC...)')
