When heavy the maximum altitude for a normal passenger plane can be several thousand feet below it&#x27;s certified maximum service ceiling.<p>What helps is that due to procedures nobody flies manually at such altitudes. So it&#x27;s up to the autopilot to maintain a specific airspeed.<p>A similar effect exists at very heavy weight on takeoff, the gap between the stall speed and the maximum speed for the flaps can be as little as 20kt in a fully loaded 777. That requires good concentration and constant monitoring in the climb to not get a stall warning or a flap overspeed. This part is often flown manually.')
