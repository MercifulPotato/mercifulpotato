This is the same company that, in 2016, let Russian accounts pay for campaign ads in the US in rubles, according to Congressional testimony.<p>Facebook said they&#x27;d prevent such errors in the future by creating an election oversight board. Despite the fact that they had four years to prepare, their oversight board took their first case... on December 1st, 2020, conveniently after the presidential election was over--and hundreds of millions of ad dollars were spent.<p>I&#x27;m sure that Facebook has teams working on privacy and good governance. This is basically a public relations spend for them. Their business model is collecting as much data on people as they possibly can and then selling ads based on that data. The idea that &quot;overall the intention and effort is there&quot; seems laughable at best.<p>But, as someone who seems to be an insider, do you have any information you could share that contradicts that narrative?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;technology&#x2F;358102-franken-blasts-facebook-for-accepting-rubles-for-us-election-ads" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;technology&#x2F;358102-franken-blasts-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.yahoo.com&#x2F;facebooks-oversight-board-announces-1st-152115513.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.yahoo.com&#x2F;facebooks-oversight-board-announces-1...</a>')
