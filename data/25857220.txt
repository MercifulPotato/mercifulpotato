If the clinics self-regulate, don&#x27;t artificially inflate the number of procedures needed and ostracize clinics who do, then everyone wins in the long run. The alternative is, everyone attempts to maximize gain and the government has to eventually step in with more draconian regulations that hurt everyone. Rational, local altruism can be a path to global self-interest.')
