You should still be processing and managing data with sql or python version controlled on git. What Retool does is commoditizing front end for building internal enterprise tools and letting you spend the resources and time on the data. The real value add of internal tools is data, UIs can change but the data doesn&#x27;t. Unfortunately many digital IT projects put high focus on the frontend and they go badly because too little effort is put on the data, I think Retool solves that giving a standard cheap way of building decent looking frontends.')
