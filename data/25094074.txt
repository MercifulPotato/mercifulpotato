No native modules, no custom operators, no lenses (would they really ban them?), etc.<p>That second one even comes back to bite the code here, because compared to e.g. Haskell lenses, the Elm lens code is ugly and verbose. Having to manually write lenses instead of being able to auto-generate them with macros is yet another Elm failing, though to be fair, I don&#x27;t know that macros are opposed by the committee.')
