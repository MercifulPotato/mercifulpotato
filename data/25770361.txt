In case anyone else reads this comment chain, here are a few points to keep in mind.<p>&gt;Bitcoin isn&#x27;t legal tender and never will be. The primary reason is that the govt (and its in our best interests) needs to able to execute fiscal and monetary policy. No one wants uncontrollable inflation or deflation -- there&#x27;s a reason why we use a fiat based money system today.<p>Outside of speculation, many use Bitcoin to escape the effects of fiscal and monetary policy that they don&#x27;t agree with (e.g. 35% of all dollars that have ever existed, were printed this year).<p>&gt;The IRS has classified BitCoin as a commodity. That means whenever you transact in bitcoin (if you do it legally) you have to record the fair market value of the coin in USD so you can report and pay capital gains or losses. It&#x27;s not practical to use it as a currency for legal transactions.<p>The law is always slow to catch up with innovation. It&#x27;s a commidity for now, which makes using it more burdensome than it needs to be, but this can change overnight if it was given the status of a currency.<p>&gt;Businesses have no interest in a money system that are anonymous because they have to deal with potential audits from the IRS.<p>Bitcoin is the opposite of anonymous. I&#x27;m not sure why people still get this wrong after seeing Bitcoin in use for 11 years. It is a well tracked public ledger of value. Companies can more easily open their books to audits, and the IRS can also verify these books using publicly obtainable information.<p>&gt;BitCoin similar to gold, except for the fact that gold has intrinsic value as a material input to manufacturing and it has to be acquired at market price.<p>Bitcoin is digital gold. Its intrinsic value stems from many aspects (in no particular order):<p>* ease of value transfer<p>* time of settlement (settlement between banks will take up to 90days)<p>* divisibility (a dollar only has two decimal points, while Bitcoin has 12 for now, but no real limit otherwise)<p>* a zero-trust consensus system<p>* and quite a few other properties. These are all intrinsic to Bitcoin. To claim that it has no value flies in the face of its pratical application for the last 11 years.<p>&gt;Bitcoin is a system that requires current holders to encourage new people to come in and purchase Bitcoin because that&#x27;s their only viable exit strategy.<p>Not sure why you feel this is true. Bitcoin would continue fine as-is with the current participants and activity. Perhaps the speculators would leave the system, but this is true of pretty much any speculative market activity and not the primary purpose of such a financial tool.')
