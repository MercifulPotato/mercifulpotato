I find Go code somewhat easy to write, just just give up on trying to be concise or elegant, but not at all easy to read. The excessive boilerplate just makes me feel like my brain does not have the working memory to piece it all together.<p>The constructs are simple, true, but if you are trying to write anything non-trivial, then simple syntax will not make your <i>problem</i> simpler. It is just expressed in tens of times more lines than in Elixir, Haskell or even PHP. This takes a toll on the reader.<p>As an example - you can accomplish interesting projects with Lego. And it is easy to get going for sure. But at some point, when you are trying to do something non-trivial, it becomes a hindrance, despite it&#x27;s simplicity. Hence &quot;I built a life-size XYZ in Lego&quot; becomes impressive in it&#x27;s own right.<p>Oh, and Go modules is a story of a train wreck.')
