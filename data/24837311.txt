For example, cross compilation becomes more of a thing. It is easy to accidentally break the type system.<p>Why? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a concrete example of why this isn&#x27;t simple (but I&#x27;m not really a compiler person, so there might be!). I can imagine plenty of ways of doing Bad Things, like adding compiler flags based on what day it is, but I can&#x27;t immediately see why this would _break_ anything. What do you mean by breaking the type system? Accidentally getting non-typechecked code in the compiler, or running into problems with the compiler thinking two equal types are distinct?<p>&gt; There&#x27;s just not a lot to say. The exact details are being worked on. This takes time.<p>I understand and appreciate this! Maybe I should&#x27;ve phrased myself better: I don&#x27;t understand how people are using `unsafe` today successfully when something as fundamental to the Rust language model such as aliasing isn&#x27;t really defined properly yet. It sound like people writing books without the rules on verb conjugation being really set. It sounds to me like plenty of the unsafe code out there might end up breaking at some point, and that, by extension, all other safe code out there is basically built on extremely shaky grounds.<p>I might be overreacting here though, since I don&#x27;t write a whole lot of Rust anymore and am pretty distanced from the community. Considering their track record, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll turn out just fine.<p>---<p>&gt; (By the way, Hacker News doesn&#x27;t support markdown;<p>Ah! It&#x27;s always tricky to remember which places support what syntax with these things. Thanks!')
