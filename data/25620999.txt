Even if we get regular 3-pin 13amp sockets installed everywhere instead of the proper type-2 connectors, you can&#x27;t just leave domestic sockets outside and unprotected, because in case of any damage or injury you&#x27;d be liable. At the minimum you need some circuit that can detect faults and report to HQ that it needs repairs. Then are you going to provide electricity for free? Because if not you need metering and billing infrastructure for all of these, and that absolutely does require maintenance. Even proper &quot;hardened&quot; type 2 chargers go out of order all the time and have to be maintained. 3-pin sockets everywhere are not the solution.<p>Tldr: a street with 40 sockets on it will require constant maintenance, and if the idea is to have every single Street everywhere wired with sockets, then this becomes a stupidly expensive endeavour.')
