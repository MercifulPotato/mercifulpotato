There have been so many in the news the past few years I think.<p>This story has me wondering, how many people (that are supposedly from group X or Y) need to do something repulsive to get a whole group deplatformed from &#x27;place A&#x27; - &#x27;place b&#x27; - etc.<p>Not judging this particular story - as it could come out (or not come out, but be known internally) that there is more details Amazon has, that has made it seem more important to do this for one reason or another - I also don&#x27;t know all the details from the associated event I assume this is in relation to.<p>I am finding it interesting though that it seems easy to cancel a group, and I&#x27;m not sure how many members of said group need to be cast in a bad light before bringing the ban hammer down on them.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s not just a number, but a percentage of members? A group of 100 could have 1 member do something and get cancelled, a group of 10,000 could have a dozen people doing terrible things but it&#x27;s not?<p>I&#x27;d like to see a chart logging these things and some stats come together. Seems to be there is going to be many more cancelled in the future, people should be prepared for the wrath brought unto them from their associates (real, virtual, perceived, everything it seems).')
