Blame it on all the layers of abstraction and general lack of caring in applications instead.<p>It&#x27;s true that there are cases where the Linux scheduler gets in the way of a good desktop experience, but desktop latency is too high even when the scheduler isn&#x27;t a bottleneck. And if anything, good scheduling gets harder in a microkernel, not easier, because you have less insight into what is going on at a system level. (Ultimately, the distinction simply shouldn&#x27;t matter though -- not for desktop experiences, that is.)')
