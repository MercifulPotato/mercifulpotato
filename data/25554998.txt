Nu-reddit wants to be an instagram style mobile first feed app and you can only see one submission at a time.  Clicking on the comments is maddening because it doesn&#x27;t even show all the comments before ending and suggesting other posts from the subreddit. If I wanted to see them then I would click on the subreddit hyperlink. Additionally it only shows the first node of depth for each op content so I can&#x27;t follow the conversation without clicking again.')
