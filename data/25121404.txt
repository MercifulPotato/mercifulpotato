You&#x27;ll turn a blind eye to the desperate delivery drivers, to the stress of the restaurant owner as he struggles to make payroll (it&#x27;s a hard enough business already) as the delivery company pushes him to lower prices with the threat of being dropped. Then you&#x27;ll notice that the quality of the food starts to drop, or one day that restaurant falls off the app, huh, you&#x27;ll think, wonder what happened to them, never mind. And the deliveries will start to take a bit longer and make more mistakes as the company squeezes the drivers harder and harder...<p>Try paying a fair price for fair value and taking pleasure in seeing businesses owned by your neighbours thrive. It really is a better way to live than spending your time on earth with your face buried in an app exploiting the poorest.')
