Not to mention a data leak due to a vulnerability in any part of their stack.<p>The company has shown complrte disregard for security multiple times in the past and I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised if they had major security holes. And since they already lied about E2EE, it would be entirely safe to assume they would not have disclosed a breach either.')
