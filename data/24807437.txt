Being skillful at detaching from your own emotional response would seem to me to be a useful skill for such an occupation. Empathy might help one to recognize or predict behaviors, but it could also hinder them, and in any event I would think a sufficiently intelligent and experienced psychologist could more than compensate for that particular deficit.<p>The book &quot;The Sociopath Next Door&quot;, written by a clinical psychologist, describes a real-life story of a [presumed] sociopath who fraudulently worked as a clinical psychologist. Unfortunately, their habits tended to the more malevolent end of the spectrum and they supposedly delighted in manipulating their patients. The story begins at page 77 of the Kindle Edition.')
