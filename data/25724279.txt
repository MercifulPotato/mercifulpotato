Having run the college gambit before getting an associates degree in business, I learned what was important and what wasn&#x27;t in college. I knew an internship was practically vital if not required. So like another class I put in a lot of time to apply to as many positions as I could. Many students I&#x27;d talk to would always seem frustrated the moment I or someone else would bring up an internship and that was because they were more worried about working at their current job and graduating debt free. I at least had the foresight to know that the experience in this field was worth more any amount of interest I&#x27;d have to pay simply because you&#x27;re income potential far outweighs the maybe few thousands in interest you would&#x27;ve saved working full-time.')
