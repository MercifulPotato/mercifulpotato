I&#x27;ve seen the same thing on other platforms. If you are ordering for pickup, it&#x27;s usually a <i>lot</i> cheaper to order by phone or through the restaurant&#x27;s website (if you can).<p>A sushi order I made last week would have been $77 (delivered) on Postmates. I ordered the same items from the restaurant directly and picked it up myself for $36. The restaurant is a 10-minute walk away.<p>This makes me skeptical of the business model. Those margins will absolutely get whittled down over time and these companies are already unprofitable.')
