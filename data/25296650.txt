Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25297592], score=None, time=1607036831, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25295634, text='&gt; “Dual intent” is the “administrative fiat” I was talking about.<p>Except that while the term &quot;dual intent&quot; is a term of art which doesn&#x27;t appear in the statute, the exception from the rule requiring no immigration intent for non-immigrant visas for visas in the H-1 category (from which exception the H-1B1 is now also excepted, putting it back into the no-immigration-intent category) was  <i>also</i> part of the 1990 INA that created the H-1B. While there are categories where you might argue dual intent exists by administrative fiat rather than statute (IIRC, that&#x27;s the practice with P nonimmigrant visas), its absolutely not the case with V, H-1 (except H-1B1), and L visas, which are explicitly statutorily excluded from the no-immigration-intent rule.<p>&gt; Since the 1952 Act, the INS adopted a fiction of dual intent to turn the H-1 visa into a de-facto immigration visa.<p>Possibly true between 1952 and 1990, but since 1990 the H-1 has been a visa which <i>explicitly</i>, <i>under statute law</i> allows for immigration intent. To the extent that there was an administrative usurpation involved, it hasn&#x27;t been an issue since the middle of the George H. W. Bush Administration, and, moreover, its never been an issue for the H-1B, which was created at the same time as the explicit statutory dual intent rule.')
