Pretty fascinating stuff how you can identify strategic pulsars with desired frequencies and at positions where you can detect certain ranges of gravitational waves (typically super massive blackhole mergers).<p>Prior to LIGO&#x27;s detections, they were hoping to be the first to detect and confirm the existence of gravitational waves but LIGO beat them to the punch. They were already concerned about defunding of efforts in radio astronomy and fighting to keep some of this hardware operational. These Arecibo hits are probably not a great addition.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pulsar_timing_array" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pulsar_timing_array</a>')
