Nobody is going to use Perl 6. There are a million other languages out there these days. What does your language do that is in any way special or unique? Nothing.<p>Needless to say, the name Perl has little cachet or relevance today, thus explaining the name change. Lipstick on a pig.<p>At this point, if a supposed &#x27;alternative&#x27; can&#x27;t replace the C language, I want nothing to do with it. We need to get back to the hardware. No, Go doesn&#x27;t cut it, and (<i>laugh track deafening</i>) I&#x27;m not interested in Rust, either.<p>I think the very idea of a VM language, while a cool and fun toy back in the early 2000s, is losing its relevance, at least for the moment. Source code portability is much better than binary portability.')
