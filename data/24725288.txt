I got the impression that in the USA people tend to be in denial and often see suicide in the circle of friends and family as stigma (I guess, very orthodox Christians see it even as sin).  Often I find the cause of death reported only as the technical detail, e.g. fatal gun-shot wound leaving out that the victim pointed his&#x2F;her own gun at herself with no one else involved.<p>Without this denial, there might be better statistics which could lead to better policy.  I fully expect the lock-down and economic crisis in the USA to have caused a spike in suicides here too, but it&#x27;s difficult to get hard numbers.')
