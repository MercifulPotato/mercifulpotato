If we put Iran on the blacklist, does it mean a social extension can&#x27;t be sold to an Iranian company even if most the user are in Iran? And also how bad is bad? Is it bad if they sell my data to Google or is it only bad if they sell my data to $NotGoogle?<p>Do you trust Google to not weaponize that power for a (anti-)competitive advantage? &quot;We see you want to sell your extension, the only company on the whitelist now is... let me see... oh us. We can offer you the competitive rate of 5 candy bars, you won&#x27;t get a better offer. We. Guarantee. It.&quot;<p>Plus the PR backlash of Google allowing a sale and having it go south fast is not a good look. Google basically tacitly endorsed a rogue agent.<p>Finally from a personal level, who the heck is Google or anyone else mustering the nerve to tell me I can&#x27;t sell my BS first-world-problem-fixing extension to the shadiest truckers on the planet. I made it, you benefit from it, most likely for free and I can&#x27;t make a profit off my work by getting market value for it? Worse stil the gatekeeper of that is some near trillion dollar company trying to track everything I do? What, like what?<p>I&#x27;m not Facebook or Twitter, this a Chrome extension and you&#x27;re proposing stricter _privately run_ regulations on that then the large corporations eating your every move like it is lunch?<p>For the record, I have never written a chrome extension, and have no real skin this game. But right now, thank $deity for Firefox.')
