For example the following.<p>&gt; CPU usage (from &#x2F;proc&#x2F;stat) averaged over 90%<p>Leaves me wondering exactly <i>which</i> metric from &#x2F;proc&#x2F;stat they are refering to. I mean it&#x27;s presumably its user time, but I just dislike attempts to distill systems performance into a few graph comparisons. In reality the realized performance of a system is often better described given a narrative describing what bottlenecks the system.')
