This helped enormously in a DIY design I kludged together in Thailand (where box fans are NOT available, so I had to get something to work with regular round desk fans, which everyone already has):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slice-of-thai.com&#x2F;air&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slice-of-thai.com&#x2F;air&#x2F;</a><p>&quot;cannon&quot; design (ugly but effective): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slice-of-thai.com&#x2F;air&#x2F;#p3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slice-of-thai.com&#x2F;air&#x2F;#p3</a><p>This may also explain why the OP heard that the tape &quot;helps&quot; but was surprised when it didn&#x27;t.
