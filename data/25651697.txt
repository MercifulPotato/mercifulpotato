Item(by='neilparikh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609883782, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650287, text='&gt; do good directly, with your own mind and hands, not indirectly.<p>How? I live in North America. The people need the most help in the world don&#x27;t live in North America. How do I help them directly &quot;with my own mind and hands&quot;?<p>I could help those in my city&#x2F;state&#x2F;country, which isn&#x27;t unreasonable by any means, and definitely commendable. But this will leave the global poor in just as bad as state as they are right now. Who will do good directly for them?<p>As a side note, maybe this is an issue of framing. We&#x27;ve been calling EA charity, but another way to view it is wealth distribution from rich countries to poor countries. I think from that lens, it becomes obvious (to me) that this is not only good, but necessary, because I don&#x27;t think the current global inequality in wealth is fair at all. Telling people to stop donating to EA charities is effectively telling them to keep the wealth in rich countries, rather than having it flow to poor countries (who really need it).')
