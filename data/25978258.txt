You can&#x27;t provide anonymity you can only provide protocols that endeavour to remove context. Attacks on anonymity system always come down to injecting or deriving context.<p>&gt; In an adversarial environment (just so we are all on the same page, life is an adversarial environment), there are few limitations on the kinds of context attackers are allowed to inject or derive context from.<p>&gt; No anonymity system is absolute because there is always context. The majority of my research in this space centers around the context that people add on top of robust protocols that ultimately undermine them.  I&#x27;m interested in practical failures, not theoretical restrictions.<p>&gt; Privacy will always been an active choice, not a passive tool. That doesn&#x27;t make it impossible or out of reach or &quot;dead&quot;, it makes it a fight worth fighting.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SarahJamieLewis&#x2F;status&#x2F;1273743630801371137" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SarahJamieLewis&#x2F;status&#x2F;12737436308013711...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SarahJamieLewis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SarahJamieLewis</a> Sarah Jamie Lewis @SarahJamieLewis Executive Director @OpenPriv<p>Anonymity hasn&#x27;t the same requirements as secrecy does.')
