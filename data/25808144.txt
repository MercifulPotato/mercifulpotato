As long as sharing political memes of your party to the community continues, many people are outright pushing away anyone in the middle.<p>Bear in mind, many people&#x27;s politics and values have become very aligned: If you don&#x27;t support someone&#x27;s views on identity issues, for instance, they may not feel they can be friends with you anymore. If you consider abortion to be <i>literal murder</i>, the color it places on someone who supports or has had an abortion, may make friendship similarly challenging.')
