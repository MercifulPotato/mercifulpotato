Do they pull the dog along their own preferred route, staring at a their phone, getting annoyed when the dog stops to sniff? Do they yank  on the leash? Or do they patiently allow their dog to take in the smells of the neighborhood and leave their own messages in return, let the dog change direction in response to a smell or sound? Do they allow their dog to meet other dogs, with the other owner&#x27;s permission? (As my wife says &quot;this isn&#x27;t your walk, this is the dog&#x27;s walk&quot;)<p>Is this a responsible owner? How does their dog behaved around other dogs? If the dog misbehaves, how does the owner respond? Do they pick up after their dog?<p>Bottom line: a dog is an excellent asshole-o-meter.')
