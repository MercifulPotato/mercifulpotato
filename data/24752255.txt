Having been doomscrolling Solomon&#x27;s fortune cookie file after the privacy thread yesterday, not only did I find the dude was pro-privacy, I also serendipitously ran across his 28:8, echoed later by Kohelet 2:26, an early commentary on sharing bits vs. hoarding atoms?<p>&gt; &quot;He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God.&quot; )<p><i>Da bosmang da bik, demang im du kapawu unte setashang fo inyalowda, im gonya gif imalowda fo demang im xalte ere kori beltalowda!</i> (SIGINT excerpt from a meeting of a skinny so-called Revolutionary Expropriation Committee.
