Do you imagine them as actual human beings with their own thoughts, aspirations, preferences, goals?  What does such a person have to gain (emotionally &#x2F; socially) by choosing YOU in particular for a partner?<p>In all relationships, romantic or not, personality is everything.  Do you try to be a positive person, or do you complain every time something doesn&#x27;t go your way?  An attractive personality and some self-confidence can go a long way in making you attractive to others, even if you haven&#x27;t been particularly advantaged by your genes.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about the dynamics around bars, hookups, and dating apps, you know that&#x27;s not the only way to meet people, right?  I think some of the strongest relationships come out of shared interest in a hobby &#x2F; skill &#x2F; career.  Join hobby groups etc (not with the intention of finding a partner -- that will be weird and creepy -- but remain open to the idea that you might bump into someone along the way that really aligns with you)')
