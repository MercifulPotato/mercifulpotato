I&#x27;d be willing to bet AWS has spent at least as many person-hours developing their service as has been put into ES itself.<p>I don&#x27;t really know where I fall on this subject.  Companies need a route to monetize when developing open source products.  It feels like AWS has been closing many ways to do that.  Short term it might feel good for us end users, but long term it&#x27;s probably bad for the ecosystem.')
