Item(by='IkmoIkmo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610157472, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25694779, text='No, now you&#x27;re mischaracterising me. All this while I&#x27;ve spoken about implementation, I&#x27;ve never claimed that the public should not have access to representatives. I&#x27;ve claimed that it must be implemented according to the conditions necessary to ensure it is orderly and secure.<p>Indeed, access is the default. And in a village with a handful of visits and no armed psychopats plotting to kill your local representative, that default is all you need and may proceed as such.<p>But as you&#x27;ll agree, the chief public representative (the president) lives in a different reality. Public unfettered access is a threat to his life. And while the public should have a form of access regardless, practically a 300 million to 1 communication relationship doesn&#x27;t work, so you must implement it accordingly, differently. That&#x27;s why most presidents had a habit of spending an hour a day reading letters from citizens, hosting debates, participating in public forums, holding press conferences, inviting people to the white house to discuss, speaking to various organisations representing people&#x27;s causes etc. But walking into his office at 4PM to speak to the president? That&#x27;s a joke. I&#x27;m fully aware that in a democracy a public servant works for the public, no need to discuss the ideal. I&#x27;m discussing the practical implementation, which is why I started with the village vs capitol example, which sees different outcomes on the basis of the same principles, which is exactly because the ideals are the same but the implementation cannot be. Similarly, you would organize access to certain parts of the capitol in a secure manner, e.g. those parts of the capitol holding a laptop of the speaker of the house.<p>In a post 9&#x2F;11 world you cannot just say the capitol belongs to the people and access should be free (again, obviously talking about practice, not ideals, here), without concluding in the same breath that it should be freely accessible to any terrorist as well. And it&#x27;s just an example. This week it were people thinking they were sent by Q or incited by Trump to de-facto participate in a coup (i.e. storming the capitol to prevent an elected official from being confirmed, while spreading propagandistic lies that the election was stolen, a direct attack on the democracy if you ask me). Next week it might be a psychopath thinking he is doing god&#x27;s work. And yes, times have changed, if you&#x27;re also interested in discussing how airport security used to be different back in the day, be my guest, I don&#x27;t see the point.<p>Plenty of countries have well-functioning (and by many subjective and objective measures, better functioning) democracies, with high-level access to public representatives, while taking proper security and practicality measures.<p>&gt; It’s so foundational that it’s also quite literally built into the building as there are galleries for public viewing of Senate and House proceedings.<p>You say some of these things as if access to public viewing of proceedings isn&#x27;t the norm in countless democracies worldwide. But if I go to a viewing, I go through this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25690107" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25690107</a><p>Not because I don&#x27;t have access, but <i>precisely</i> because I do, as does everyone else, and that creates risks, which can be mitigated without reducing access. A basic measure which would&#x27;ve prevented the debacle at the Capitol altogether.')
