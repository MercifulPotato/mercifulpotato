Nevertheless I agree that naming is a creative aspect of API design. It&#x27;s not a creative aspect of API code though! There it is just an affordance.<p>The names that we given our APIs are inherent to their behavior and not necessarily the code. Some languages, such as Swift, even mangle API names when they are used so that their names are non-sensical without de-mangling. So why is the name important? It&#x27;s important for us to understand what the system is doing, but not to the function of the system itself. This might not seem important for us when doing our work, but in the case of copyrightability it&#x27;s an important fact based on precedent law.')
