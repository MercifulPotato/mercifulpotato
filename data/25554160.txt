Maybe to many.  I like to rotate hobbies to keep things interesting.  My hobbies usually interest and complement each other in various ways.<p>- Film photography.  Photography is probably the first hobby I picked up.  I have a variety of older film cameras in 35mm and medium format.  Planning to convert an extra room in my basement into a darkroom in the near future.<p>- Blogging.  I have been running my blog for a few years now.  Most of my post are long form on technical subjects that interest me.  I don&#x27;t post often though.  Maybe once a month or less.<p>- Game dev.  I picked up Godot about two years ago.  I&#x27;ve been working on and off on a simulated life game since October.  I spent this week redoing the UI and adding more features to the game.<p>- Arduino.  I tinker with Arduino dev boards.  Lately I picked up Forth and have been teaching myself how to program the ATMega328 with FlashForth.<p>- Weightlifting.  I suppose you could call this a hobby too.  Working from home has allowed me to replace my commute time with lifting and I&#x27;m very thankful for it.<p>- Mushroom identification.  For anyone interested I recommend the books &quot;All that the Rain Brings and More&quot; as well as &quot;Mushrooms Demystified&quot; by David Arora.<p>- Journaling.  I like to organize my thoughts in a notebook on a regular basis.  This hobby is probably the genesis of my other hobbies as I usually develop what I want to do with pen and paper first.')
