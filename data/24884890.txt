It is legal to file DMCA for anything. As it stands, the hosting providers don&#x27;t even verify the validity, or the good-faith requirement, because they don&#x27;t want to get in a fight that could cost them the safe harbor protection. So even invalid DMCA requests usually mean the content will be blocked for a couple of days and the accused party will have to lawyer up to put together a counter-claim.')
