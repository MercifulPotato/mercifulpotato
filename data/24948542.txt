Agile is a practice and it&#x27;ll take some to get up to speed. One path I took was taking jobs in tech support, answering phones calls, and finding opportunities to engage with the product teams. You can start by giving feedback on the top issues you&#x27;re seeing and breaking down ways the product can improve to reduce related support calls. And Boom, you are now apart of the Agile process, providing a feedback loop that helps development teams incrementally improve the product. You also help reduce support cost; don&#x27;t worry, if you automate yourself out of a job, there will be a better one waiting for you.<p>That&#x27;s how you open doors for yourself. Many great Q&#x2F;A and operations engineers started in tech support where they honed their troubleshooting skills.<p>2) Yes, I use to get those questions. My answer was, &quot;I&#x27;m starting a family, and I&#x27;m looking for something a bit more stable, and bigger challenges than the ones I was getting on my own&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s all about being able to demonstrate your skills. Some times it&#x27;s whiteboard coding exercises or logging into a live system and &quot;making it work&quot;. My IT certifications helped me earlier in my career and now things like GitHub and blog posts are a great way to showcase your skills.<p>3) Remember, you can always tailor your resume for the job you want. If you want to avoid looking over qualified, then re-frame your experience to align with the job requirements. Instead of &quot;I ran a business doing X,Y,Z&quot;, you can re-frame it, &quot;As a _ I did X,Y,Z&quot;.<p>During the interview you can show off your full skill set by giving deep answers demonstrating your understanding of the big picture and how to make a business impact.<p>If you ever want to discus this stuff further, shoot me a DM on Twitter, I&#x27;ve been where you are, and I know what&#x27;s possible.')
