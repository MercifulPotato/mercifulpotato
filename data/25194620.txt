Item(by='TMWNN', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606184871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25194222, text='&gt;Compare wealth and life expectancy of any ethnicity living in USA with the population living in their previous habitat, and the US population comes out on top.<p>&gt;Japanese Americans for example have higher life expectancy than Japanese in Japan, and I expect the same would be true for Ethiopians.<p>Similarly, Americans do well on PISA compared to their ethnic relatives.

Both white and Asian Americans score higher than Canada (and white+Asian is essentially Canada&#x27;s racial makeup), and higher than New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Norway, and the UK; Estonia is below US Asians but above white Americans. Norway is by far the wealthiest Nordic state but its average is only two points higher than the US national average, despite not having a demographic that is 13% of the population and scores 85 points below the white American average.')
