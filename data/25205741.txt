It&#x27;s a virtual machine, and if you use it, you&#x27;re running Windows in a virtual machine too.<p>So if you want a Linux VM: great news. They literally demoed a linux VM during the Arm Mac introduction back at WWDC. They provide the basics of a Hypervisor at the OS level, and Parallels at least, already has a working user land VM tool that can make use of said Hypervisor. They&#x27;ve also confirmed they&#x27;re working on a new version of their app to run on Arm Macs.<p>I get not wanting Homebrew - I refuse to install it, and will always find another alternative. I&#x27;m told macports is a better approach to the same basic idea (a 3rd party package manager for Mac utilities) but more often than not if I need something I just end up downloading a tar, and do the regular configure&#x2F;make&#x2F;make install.')
