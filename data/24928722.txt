How would you test a feature flag e.g. Halloween discount. As this probably involves both front-end and back-end code. The only way I can think off how this can be tested is by making a special new user with this feature flag.<p>But do you now need to test all possible permutations of the flags combinations? If so, how to determine these permutations? Can imagine you test all possibilities every time??')
