It is well designed, well documented and comprehensive. I like the power of slots and signals.<p>My experience developing Qt applications for ~20 years (mostly for Windows and Mac) is that it is very well supported on Windows, but less well supported on Mac. I really wish they would concentrate a bit more on making it look more native and be less buggy on the lastest version of macOS, rather than adding new features.<p>I list a few current issues with Qt 5.15 on macOS 11.0 here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;successfulsoftware.net&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;issues-with-qt-applications-on-macos-11-0-big-sur&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;successfulsoftware.net&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;issues-with-qt-app...</a><p>And dialog widget layouts never look quite right on macOS.<p>I am not aware that Qt 6 fixes any of these issues. I hope they get fixed soon.')
