Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603461885, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24866068, text='&gt; Watching this fight I wonder &quot;Who is in charge of governing California?&quot; is it the Legislature&#x2F;Governor or is it special interests who can spend enough to put bespoke laws into effect and make bespoke changes to the state constitution?<p>Neither.<p>It&#x27;s the people, who, after all the spending <i>choose</i> both the legislature and the governor, and choose the results ofinitiatives and referenda, and who have, on making all those choices, time and again defied the balance of spending.<p>&gt; California didn&#x27;t help itself when it implemented term limits which had the unpleasant side effect of never having any legislators with enough experience in the job to know how to really get things done, and so the &quot;work&quot; of writing laws has also fallen to special interests.<p>Special interests have proposed and drafted laws and offered them up to the legislature since long before term limits, legislators (both before and after term limits) do draft their own a decide which, wherever they originate, to support, either as written or with amendments. And while term limits as implemented in CA do overall moderately weaken the elected legislators compared to unelected interests (professional staff as well as lobbying groups), it&#x27;s a fairly modest effect; the median legislator is probably about as strong as before, but no one builds up the kind of institutional power that someone like Willie Brown had.<p>&gt;  This has never been more clear than the last 4 years where California has had a single party in both houses, and a Governor and still cannot legislate anything that special interests oppose.<p>This is obviously untrue in the literal sense, as most legislation has special interests both supporting and opposing and plenty has passed in the last four years.<p>If you mean it in some non-literal sense, then I can&#x27;t fathom exactly what that might be.')
