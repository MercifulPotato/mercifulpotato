Try to imagine how you would feel if it crashed 50%. If devastated is your answer, why not scale back a bit? If you scaled back and Bitcoin came to rule the financial world you would still be in a very good position.<p>I know a friend who got so excited and put a large, large amount in BTC. Bought quite a few. It crashed and he sold. Probably at the bottom — didn’t ask. Later when it rebounded and he bought 1 BTC. He could have saved a lot of money if he just bought 1 from the start.
