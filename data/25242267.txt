I couldn&#x27;t see but that didn&#x27;t disturb me for some reason. I felt that I was lying down but had no idea why. I tried to sit up but couldn&#x27;t. Whenever I tried something, some unknown force would push me down again. I tried over and over but couldn&#x27;t do it. At some point I gave up.<p>A bit later I was able to open my eyes and my mum told me the nurses had been in panic because I was still hooked up to all the machines and the IV and they were afraid I&#x27;d pull it all out and&#x2F;or hurt myself. They were the ones pushing me down when I tried to sit up.<p>I think I was like 10 or 12.')
