In a broader context this is makes me wonder whether the development in-group nomenclature (slang) developed for similar reasons, to defend against collisions in terminology with others where misunderstandings could lead to disagreements and fights. You can still speak the same language, but if someone overhears you (tries to interpret what you type into a url bar) they don&#x27;t understand unless you have intentionally specified the mapping to the global nomenclature. Of course this would require that browsers stop trying to redirect you to who knows where when you type in a single word in the url bar so that not typing in the local name would lead to a failure.')
