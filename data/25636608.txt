Founded in 2014, raised $170M.  Our drones are flown at scale in complex, unknown environments every day to capture incredible video, automate dangerous inspections, and save lives.<p>The autonomy team is ~20 people who drive the state-of-the-art in computer vision, motion planning, 3D reconstruction, and high-performance systems infrastructure to make our robots intelligent. We combine a creative research environment with real production hardware, to enable our engineers to iterate at incredible speeds.<p>For example, we were the first to demonstrate a deep-learning based visual obstacle avoidance system and shipped it on the Skydio 2, where it remains the industry best. We are now revolutionizing 3D capture to be able to autonomously map anything and make 3D models in incredible detail.<p>Weâ€™re looking for engineers and researchers with strong SW development skills combined with strong mathematical thinking, and a drive to work on robotic systems. We are open to an experience range from new grads to world-class technical leaders.<p>Visual walkthrough of our team: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;skydio-autonomy" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;skydio-autonomy</a><p>2020 customer highlights reel: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;4rdrtEU-9Bw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;4rdrtEU-9Bw</a>')
