Item(by='srinathkrishna', descendants=None, kids=[24945571, 24945577, 24945410, 24945206], score=None, time=1604080768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944574, text='#+begin_rant<p>I&#x27;ve been very very skeptical about Roam - I appreciate the sentiment behind it and the fact that it&#x27;s making more people aware of networked thought but the marketing around it has been insane. Especially investor Twitter is raving about it for many weeks now about how the tool is a savior. It&#x27;s almost as if they&#x27;re doing it to increase user count to Roam to justify their investment, which is likely.<p>It often misses the point here - the idea of networked thought and note-taking is the key here. If you have the time and means to do it, you can always do so using something as simple as text files too.<p>Something that&#x27;s as critical as a note-taking tool, the first rule of thumb should be - don&#x27;t lose data! Agreed, it was the readwise integration that messed things up here but the snapshotted database approach has its own perils in the long run too. For the most part, one does not need constant sync-ups. And Roam doesn&#x27;t even have a mobile app today - which means that most likely folks are just using their laptops to add notes.<p>If you&#x27;re just starting out, I&#x27;d recommend using [Obsidian][<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md</a>] or if you have a little bit more time, explore the world of emacs via [org-mode][<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orgmode.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orgmode.org</a>].<p>Roam might be a success or might not be :shrug:. Use something that works for you and your workflow. Don&#x27;t engage in productivity porn and lose many hours.<p>#+end_rant')
