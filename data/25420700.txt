For instance if you think about optimistic mutations - where when you post on FB, it instantly reacts and moves on, the tradeoff is speed for a potentially more confusing user flow in the future (oh whoops our backend was down, and that post you made 5 minutes ago, yeah that&#x27;s not around anymore).<p>Blanket philosophies like 10,000 hours or 100 millisecond, boil all of the nuance out of these tradeoffs.
