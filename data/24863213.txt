Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[24863647], score=None, time=1603400191, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24862986, text='&gt; Land doesn&#x27;t depreciate, only structures and improvements to the land.<p>The structures are generally the majority of the value of the property.<p>&gt; Mortgage interest is not included in the basis of real property or in depreciation. It&#x27;s just another deductible expense.<p>Nonetheless it&#x27;s a major expense and fully deductible. They also get to deduct property maintenance etc.<p>&gt; Most real estate companies are partnerships or REITs due to special tax provisions. But most of their investors are corporate entities.<p>A group of ten individuals who get together to buy an apartment complex are not a corporation. Moreover, if the investors are a corporation, it&#x27;s still one less layer of indirection -- for a corporate investor, if the real estate holding company were an S Corp you would be paying corporate income tax <i>twice</i>.<p>&gt; Real estate is a cash flow game: real properties are purchased through commercial mortgages, and rental income services the debt.<p>This is true until the debt is paid, but then isn&#x27;t that the point? They get to deduct the interest and depreciation and maintenance, and wipe out their rental income.<p>&gt; Because of this, real estate investment flourishes in <i>low</i> tax years: as a result of depreciation, the cost basis of the real property has been reduced, so the taxable income from the sale has increased.<p>That would result in real estate <i>sales</i> in low tax years, i.e. willingness to divest rather than willingness to invest. During the high tax years people would want to buy&#x2F;hold and continue speculating to continue to defer paying the high taxes on the appreciation.')
