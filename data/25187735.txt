For example, assaulting a police officer in the performance of their duties might be aggravated assault, but a normal person would just be assault. The act itself is a crime, the victims both had harm done, but the grading is different.<p>What this law says is that these protected people have a right to privacy, but the general population does not. This is not right, and I believe this is an equal protection violation.')
