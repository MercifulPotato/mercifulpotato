Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611550511, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25897053, text='&gt; like saying any rent is not rent once any other rent opportunity exists<p>Good point, thanks!<p>FWIW, I did try selling free software, though under the MIT license. My income was a fraction of the hourly wage were I do do in-house development that was never released at all. Enough to live on, but not normal software developer wages.<p>So I find it hard to call that &quot;rent&quot;.<p>Speaking of economic rent, &quot;Frappe has the huge advantage of being the home to most of the contributors and maintainers of ERPNext&quot; makes it sound rather close to the economic rent attributed to labor unions (&quot;higher pay for some workers, where collective action creates a scarcity of such workers, as opposed to an ideal condition where labor competes with other factors of production on price alone&quot; - from WP&#x27;s &quot;Economic rent&quot;).<p>That&#x27;s pattern matching on my side, since I don&#x27;t have handle on what &#x27;rent&#x27; is supposed to mean here.<p>Speaking of distractions, the analogy &quot;FOSS is like the highway system&quot; suggests the government should be funding FOSS, and&#x2F;or that tolls are entirely reasonable. ;)')
