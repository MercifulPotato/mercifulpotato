A better phrasing of the sentence would be &quot;If there is a falsifiable idea that so far has not been falsified, it may be considered established scientific fact.&quot;  Scientific progress occurs not just by discovering new tenets, but by disproving incorrect ones, and nobody&#x27;s come up with an objective test for the presence or absence of the Divine.<p>Emotions flare because faith is a deeply personal issue, but from a lab protocol standpoint it&#x27;s not a testable hypothesis, and thus not really worth arguing about.')
