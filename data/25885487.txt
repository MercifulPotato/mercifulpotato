You’ve always had this ability by using P&#x2F;Invokes, but it’s never been easy. It requires a lot of domain knowledge (or copy-pasta that may cause other problems) to actually get it to work. It’s also very easy to get wrong and cause big memory leaks in the unmanaged heap.<p>Over the years I’ve managed to get pretty good at P&#x2F;Invokes to the point where I don’t bat an eye when I need to do some interop with native code. That doesn’t mean I don’t sometimes run into a particularly finicky API that requires digging deep into stuff like GC pinning, structure packing, fixed pointers, or other challenges that will grind things to a halt while I debug what’s happening. At least I’ve come to the point where I can look at unexpected API behavior and have a good intuition for what I need to do.<p>It sucks, a lot.<p>I’m really glad that there’s finally an official and reusable abstraction to make this simpler in the future.')
