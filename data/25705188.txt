Stalin&#x27;s USSR survived major natural disasters and wars, expanded its territory and the leader died in office. Multiple democracies in contemporary Europe were destroyed from the same influences. Only UK, Sweden and Switzerland could be said to be at least as stable as Stalinist USSR.<p>I despise and hate Stalin, but his regime was fairly stable compared to contemporaries.')
