Lets take a simple case I know of personally -- a family with children.<p>A remote graduate program with evening classes works for a lot of people. A program where you need to commute into the city, commute back late at night after group meetings, or change cities all-together is just not practical for all but the wealthiest individuals (those who can afford 18hr nannies).<p>Those who aren&#x27;t wealthy enough to do that aren&#x27;t stupid or lazy, they are just lacking wealth.<p>Consider also that hundreds of millions of people live within un-commuteable distance to a university.
