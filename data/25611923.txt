Some are conservative collections of proven software, others are bleeding edge, etc.<p>IMHO, someone should start to collect papers, which are worth reading, and <i>keep this collection up to date</i>, with fixes to papers (AKA as patches in software), with one paper per topic, with ready to use math models and simulations, with in software tests for models, etc.')
