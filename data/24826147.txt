Yes, Atlassian supports SSO, but it requires Atlassian Access which costs $3&#x2F;user&#x2F;month.  Further SSO with Access requires user management to be done within Access which is not the source of truth for this company as that privilege belongs to AD.  Users are assigned to groups in AD, and group membership determines the access to Confluence sites, etc.  Unless the cloud offering can provide similar functionality the server licence will die here, and be replaced by a product that can deliver these features.')
