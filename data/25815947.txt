For less popular packages, yes it can happen, because maintainers are almost completely volunteers. Some years ago I created a port, then at some point stopped being able to find the time to maintain it. Eventually someone offered to take over, and I happily obliged.<p>The ports Makefile framework is incredibly sophisticated, so one can find lots of examples and be quickly able create and test ports very easily, especially for packages written in C, C++, Go, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, etc. Poudriere, which is the definitive bulk package builder used by FreeBSD pkg itself, is especially useful here. Ports that a have a billion vendored libraries are a pain. Ports are not allowed to download from the internet at build time, so all the vendor dependencies need to be known beforehand and be marshaled to download at the &quot;fetch&quot; phase accordingly. But eventually it all boils down to a very terse and declarative Makefile. What used to be a bigger pain, was the way to update ports in the ports tree, which used to require someone with access to the ports tree taking your new port and updating it. But recent news indicate that FreeBSD is moving to git and towards a model where port owners can each update their own directly, which will be huge. My personal opinion is that this will lower the ports maintenance bar significantly.<p>Also, for administrators, switching &#x2F;etc&#x2F;pkg&#x2F;FreeBSD.conf from  &quot;quarterly&quot; to &quot;latest&quot; pkg train of your version number (e.g. FreeBSD 12.x) will get you the latest versions of binary packages, as soon as their respective port is released into the ports tree. Quarterly is also pretty good, but you get only security updates and package versions tend to stay stable and change every quarter. I&#x27;ve administered systems switched to &quot;latest&quot; and seldom had any serious problems.')
