Almost all major content-hosting companies are headquartered in the USA and thus bound to the DMCA: Facebook&#x2F;Twitter (social networks), Google&#x2F;Amazon&#x2F;Microsoft (clouds), Github&#x2F;Gitlab&#x2F;Sourceforge (code repositories), StackOverflow, Automattic (Wordpress), Akamai&#x2F;Cloudflare&#x2F;Fastly (CDNs), Wikimedia&#x2F;Fandom (wiki hosting). The only major exception is Atlassian who are headquartered in Australia.<p>No matter if your content may be legal under e.g. European law (e.g. right to repair, right to interoperability, right to reverse engineer), you are going to have a hard time hosting it. And even if you get it hosted at an European provider (remember, we don&#x27;t have anything that competes with any of the three US cloud giants in terms of functionality!), you will have issues with accepting donations easily - Paypal, Stripe and <i>all</i> credit cards are under US regulation.<p>And it&#x27;s not just theoretical, just look at what happened to Kim Dotcom&#x2F;Megaupload (or, tangentially related, Julian Assange). If the US deems you a danger to their business interests, you are going to get hunted down, no matter where in the world you are and if what you are doing is legal under the jurisdiction of that country.')
