Do other people think your cooking is good? Do other people think your cooking is worth coming back for in a week, a month, or a year? You can try and do trendy things in food but these trends come and go quickly.<p>3. Rent and capital costs. It is expensive to fit a space for a kitchen, so you probably took a loan for that. Landlords are trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of you. There may be cheaper options than a leased space like a food truck or a sidewalk stand, but if they&#x27;re even legal where you are the permits aren&#x27;t cheap and there&#x27;s usually a long waitlist. And better locations with more foot traffic cost more money.<p>4. Labor &amp; management. Most people do not have experience running a restaurant&#x27;s operations, which have to be tightly managed to both keep expenses down and keep service at decent levels. Bad service will turn customers away for good and bad word of mouth can snowball.<p>5. Margin. The tendency for new restauranteurs is that they underestimate their expenses and how much margin they need to be making.
