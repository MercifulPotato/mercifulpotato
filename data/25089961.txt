I hate it when when I&#x27;m accidentally logged out by feathering the &#x27;lock&#x27; icon.<p>I&#x27;m aware I could move it - but ideally where are times that I&#x27;d <i>want</i> to use the feature as intended.<p>The lack of haptic feedback for the Touch Bar is a bizarre and unusual oversight for a company usually so detail-obsessed as Apple. We are not allowed to install anything but specifically approved software, so any third-party solutions are a no-go here. It should be built-in, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.<p>I&#x27;ve personally taken to using a bluetooth Apple keyboard half the time with my work laptop just to avoid the Touch Bar as it honestly feels infinitely more comfortable for coding to not have it there.')
