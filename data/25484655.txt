Item(by='magicalhippo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608450273, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25481368, text='&gt; there might be more punk bands then ever before but if they all sound the same, who cares?<p>&gt; Maybe bands needs to go underground for a bit for a new sound to emerge.<p>I think this is what I&#x27;m trying to get at. The advent of affordable recording sessions and affordable world-wide distribution and marketing (internet) means the underground has become less underground.<p>Before acts would rise from the underground to the radio with a fresh new sound, but I&#x27;m pretty sure if you put them in the scene they came from you&#x27;d say &quot;they all sound the same&quot; as well.<p>They all sound the same today because the radio filter has been removed, and you can experience all of it in a way you couldn&#x27;t before. So the gradual changes and differences don&#x27;t get a chance to build up to a radical difference before people hear it.<p>IMHO this is great, as for me it means I can find a lot more music that I enjoy.<p>But it would seem it has made it more difficult for you to find the next stand-out thing to enjoy.')
