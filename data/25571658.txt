My daughter started drawing on paper but quickly moved a tablet. What she can do is faster and more precise than a) what she can do on paper, and b) what modern desktop drawing software can do. I think she&#x27;d call her style cartoonish for sure, so maybe drawing something other than interesting characters doing weird things is beyond touch screens, but the ability to generate, combine, and manipulate elements in a drawing app on a tablet blows anything else I&#x27;ve seen out of the water in terms of the quality of the end result and the speed at which she can achieve it. And yeah I&#x27;m probably a little biased.')
