I eventually crammed for about 2 weeks to get my high school diploma at my mother&#x27;s request, then I moved to Sweden for a while (on my own, as a teenager).<p>My school experience was <i>abysmal</i> and doing things my own way allowed me to actually learn stuff that would end up being useful. I&#x27;d not have made it half as far if I had gone the traditional route.<p>Currently 28 and satisfied with how things have played out so far.')
