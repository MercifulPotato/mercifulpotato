Item(by='jimmygrapes', descendants=None, kids=[25219904], score=None, time=1606374945, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25217255, text='In order to provide examples of &quot;race-baiting propaganda&quot; as I called it, we would have to first agree on what constitutes race-baiting and propaganda. I assume we can agree that propaganda is material designed to sway an opinion, yet labels itself implicitly or explicitly as something other than &quot;opinion&quot;.<p>As for race-baiting, my definition is anything that brings race into the conversation when it is materially irrelevant, or when it is introduced solely as a means of depicting one race (or a representative member thereof) in a positive or negative fashion, to the exclusion of further context, nuance, or counter samples.<p>The 1619 Project itself is a prime example.<p>I am on mobile and have difficulty linking, but you can search on NYT&#x27;s website for the word &quot;racist&quot;, filtering out anything other than world&#x2F;U.S. news, within the last month, and you will see a bevy of articles written to highlight how &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; somebody is for even <i>hinting</i> at race being a factor in something (such as a descriptor) - not going to go into the hypocrisy there, but it&#x27;s hard to miss if you apply the same standards NYT uses to depict someone as &quot;racist&quot; to their own staff.<p>A simple recent example, for the person in a cousin comment asking me to expound, is in the recent news article about Honestie Hodges, a young girl whose handcuffing by police caused &quot;outrage&quot; according to NYT, and who recently died apparently of COVID-19 related causes. In that article you can read through and see several points where race was introduced, not as a relevant point, but as a way to introduce further division between two races in an article where those facts are immaterial.<p>It is through their omissions and irrelevant insertions, through their implications and labels, that NYT is race-baiting; the propaganda part comes from using the reach of the organization to spread such content as pure unbiased fact, when in truth it is manipulative.')
