Item(by='Jugurtha', descendants=None, kids=[25187543], score=None, time=1606141482, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25185619, text='We built custom machine learning products for large enterprise for the last several years...So, communicating to people across with different skillsets and degrees and <i>types</i> of &quot;technicality&quot; was required to make things work.<p>I&#x27;ve written several replies here that address many things I consider important that might be useful to you[0][1][2]. These tackle communication, making sure people have access to information, tying business objectives to your activities and speaking a language that fits your audience (developers on the team, people on your team who may not be technical, people who are technical but may not be machine learning experts, CEO, advisors, investors, clients, domain experts at the client company, etc.)<p>These are all your &quot;customers&quot; to your communication product. You&#x27;ll notice I went on and on about sharing meeting notes, or dispatching information to people so the message penetrates several levels and people know what they&#x2F;you&#x27;re doing and why.<p>&gt;<i>I am now transitioning to freelancing.</i><p>You might find a thread I tweeted[3] about this useful, too. It advises you about the benefits of dealing with enterprise as a company to make it worth your while, lawyers, building product[4], abstracting that product to expand and sell more. There&#x27;s a lot of trial in there. The context is products for enterprise in the mid six figures that a couple of people could pull off by making sure they get the communication part with the client right, and other things.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25025253" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25025253</a><p>- [1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25160534" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25160534</a><p>- [2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25176818" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25176818</a><p>- [3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jugurthahadjar&#x2F;status&#x2F;1310668293305499653" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jugurthahadjar&#x2F;status&#x2F;131066829330549965...</a><p>- [4]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25176818" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25176818</a>')
