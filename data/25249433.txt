And I woke up feeling fresh as a cucumber, as they say.<p>I don&#x27;t really take sleeping that seriously in general, but I used to get sick pretty frequently (sick enough to not work, a couple times a year). Nowadays I have a routine, and it&#x27;s not so different: if I feel a tiny bit sick, I go home, lie in bed, and order semi-healthy Mediterranean food (I have specific cravings when I get sick -- is this common?). I stay that way until I can&#x27;t stand being in bed any more. I also avoid any source of stress.<p>The number of days per year when I&#x27;m sick has probably gone down by a factor of 4: I get properly sick half as often, and when I am sick, I get better much faster. Almost as importantly, getting sick is no longer &quot;miserable&quot; in the same way. It seems a substantial part of the misery of being sick (with something mild, like a cold or, at my age, flu) just comes from trying to do things you shouldn&#x27;t try to do. Lying in bed and executing a nap&#x2F;snack&#x2F;pee&#x2F;read loop... that&#x27;s not so bad.<p>(As others in this thread love to point out, this doesn&#x27;t work for people with bad sick leave, or stressful jobs, or single parents, and so on and so forth. That&#x27;s a strong case for sick leave etc., as far as I see.)')
