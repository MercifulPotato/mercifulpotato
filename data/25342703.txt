In fact that is how they obtained the search warrant for the screaming woman&#x27;s residence, by showing evidence to a judge.<p>&gt; But even if they just had them out, that&#x27;s improper police work.<p>What are your qualifications for criticizing warrant service procedure?<p>&gt; You gun should only be drawn if the intent is to kill someone.<p>Thats wrong in multiple ways, you don&#x27;t seem to have the relevant background knowledge and experience to discuss this issue.<p>Ask yourself how upset you would be with a police officer&#x27;s use of deadly force if you learned that he had <i>intended to kill</i> the person he shot, rather than intending to save someone&#x27;s life?<p>&gt; They went in there with the intent of terrorising their victim.<p>You don&#x27;t know that. You could just as easily believe that the woman refused to open the door for 20 minutes in order to antagonize law officers in the performance of their official duties. This is why we want people to support their statements with evidence instead of pretending to read minds.<p>&gt; At no point did anyone demonstrate any threat to the officers, and so at no point should they have had their guns out.<p>Perhaps that would have been the case if they had responded to the officers in a timely manner. After a 20 minute wait, its possible that the individuals in the house have set up to attack the police when they enter.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s basic gun safety 101.<p>Hard to take lectures on gun safety from someone who hasn&#x27;t demonstrated the relevant qualifications.')
