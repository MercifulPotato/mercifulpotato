I know they are playing the long game, but you&#x27;re grossly underestimating how big the market for cheap stuff is. Even if it&#x27;s subsidized by spyware.<p>I doubt Apple wants to be in that market, it&#x27;s a gross market (low margins, tons of support costs, etc.).<p>Just to give you an example, French PC site, laptop section for €400 to €600 (they also have 10 or so under €400):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fnac.com&#x2F;PC-de-400-a-600-Euro&#x2F;Par-prix&#x2F;nsh93675&#x2F;w-4#bl=ACPar-prixARBO" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fnac.com&#x2F;PC-de-400-a-600-Euro&#x2F;Par-prix&#x2F;nsh93675&#x2F;...</a><p>So about 230 (!) products in total, for a single site. In poorer countries, you can find even cheaper laptops.<p>Similar thing for phones, a $400 phone is not cheap. A $100-150 phone is cheap, like the Huaweis, Honors, Xiaomis, Oppos, Vivos, etc of the world (you don&#x27;t even get those in the States).')
