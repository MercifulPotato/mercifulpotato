I, myself, found it somewhat entertaining to read as a kid.<p>Rather, my question is more in reference to what seem to be incongruous facts: the article points out that the comic was not written with the intention to be funny, so then what explains its popularity as a comic strip?<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that there are some (many!) who thought it funny. What I&#x27;m trying to understand is the discrepancy between its immense fame AND its apparent lack of humorous intention.<p>It&#x27;d be a little bit like if there was a famous band that was incredibly popular, yet in multiple interviews they reveal that they don&#x27;t put a great deal of effort behind making appealing music. As such, I would be curious to understand what instead may be the other driving sources of their appeal (ex. good looks, marketing etc.).<p>For example, here are some other possible candidate reasons the Garfield comics may have been popular. I don&#x27;t know if any of these are true, rather I would consider them hypotheses that I would be curious to hear others confirm&#x2F;debunk:<p>* it was marketed very well and gave people the perception that it was _supposed_ to be funny, and if you didn&#x27;t find it funny that was perhaps a result of _you_ not getting something.\n* there was a more limited selection of sources of comic strips, so the standards for what passed as an entertaining comic strip were lower than in our Internet age.\n* most people knew it wasn&#x27;t funny, nor that it was meant to be funny. Rather they read it because it was the cultural meme of the day to do so.')
