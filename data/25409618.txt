Doing so is non-trivial, though.<p>There&#x27;s a real risk of falling into a &#x27;half-ass two things&#x27; pattern. It&#x27;s difficult to do exactly one day a week on some project, then cleanly drop it until the following week. Context loss is a real problem. This year, I find myself looking out for &#x27;low stress&#x27; times during my day job to do some deeper dive on bioacoustics and create a bunch of new stuff in a kind of sprint, rather than consistently setting aside 8 hours a week. It&#x27;s hard to do a research &#x27;sprint&#x27; in two areas simultaneously; it&#x27;s better to let a research question take over my brain for a while.<p>(I also find that my personal limit for meaningfully tracking experiment outcomes is two model architectures. I tried three at some point this year and it was kind of a disaster.)<p>It&#x27;s tough to motivate myself to do important-but-boring things like write unit tests in 20% time, which (combined with the context shifting problem) has often lead to pain down the line.<p>All told, it&#x27;s a hard road, but very rewarding, IMO.')
