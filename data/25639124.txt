Frankly, we don&#x27;t have solid data, so it&#x27;s hard to say.<p>The US has, best case, massive testing shortfalls and untested cases, periodic government attempts to downplay the issue, and chaotic spikes and overwhelmed systems. It is almost certainly still better in all of these areas than those countries listed above. We can&#x27;t do anything about that though.<p>It&#x27;s fog of war. But you&#x27;re probably getting downvoted because the tone of your message seems to be one of &#x27;pfft the US isn&#x27;t that bad&#x27; - which by most metrics we seem to have, isn&#x27;t the case, at least in high profile areas like Southern California. Keeping it from not being overly bad, near as we can tell, also requires taking serious and often painful approaches to the problem to mitigate it, which doesn&#x27;t happen if it isn&#x27;t taken seriously. Not taking those measure seems to make the problem even worse - in the sense of concrete, real people being dead that otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be.<p>To more directly answer your question - in total number of REPORTED new cases and deaths, US is solidly number 1. As a percent of population, the only sizable country with more cases than the US right now is the Czech Republic - which is serious, but isn&#x27;t going to get headline news like the US will.  By tests per capita, the US is doing reasonably well - the only largish country doing better so far is the UK. However, considering the scope of it&#x27;s spread in the US, that is probably misleading. Most countries haven&#x27;t NEEDED to test so much.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;</a><p>Feel free to click on the various sorting widgets to see it from different views.')
