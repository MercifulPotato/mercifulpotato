We performed fire mitigation and forest thinning so that if a fire happened near a structure then the fire fighters might actually have a chance to save it. If no fire mitigation was performed then they would definitely not even try.<p>He told me that by not letting burning take its course, the forest floor accumulates a massive amount of fuel and then when it does burn, it burns much hotter than it normally would and effectively sanitizes the forest floor and regrowth takes years instead of weeks&#x2F;months because it got too hot and killed everything.<p>As mentioned in the article, we civilized humans really should be letting things burn, at a lower temperature and more frequently and avoid the fuel build up that scorches our land for years on end. This is the way forward.')
