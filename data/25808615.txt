Former Biodynamic farmer (horticulture) and did a stint at the MDRS, I was asked by the director to come back as an Executive Officer under her for another mission with more focus on the Green Hab.<p>If you can find that PP and repost I&#x27;d definitely check it out.<p>Are you working on anything right now in robotics with automating Ag? One of the things that I think we&#x27;ve seen during COVID is the mass acceleration of automated processes in many fields, but I haven&#x27;t seen as many in Ag then prior to this--mainly in harvesting, weeding but as you know maintenance, pest control and irrigation play a much bigger part in day to day operations and was wondering what has been done in that regard.<p>I wonder if there is anything for those of us with backgrounds in Ag and tech to do something at places like Biosphere 2 or at the Eden Project.<p>I&#x27;ve had to go back to Supply Chain since COVID derailed my plans to go to SpaceX and then hopefully come back and work at a more mature Squared Roots if it had a focus on Mars food production, but I definitely like to see something like that happen and maybe even get involved if I&#x27;m still useful.')
