The bigger the software (i.e. GNOME, KDE) the harder it fails. And often in unexpected and unpredictable ways, too.<p>The kind of people who use GNOME or Ubuntu or whatever the &#x27;windows competitor&#x27; is always seem to be having problems, but are also the kind of people who see needing to use a terminal as a problem in itself.<p>I&#x27;ve never ever had a problem with i3, emacs, firefox, and simple &lt;20 line configs. Terminal is fine, it&#x27;s what most GNU tools are built around in the first place. It&#x27;s apt that people who really love Linux and appreciate what it does out of the box, and who don&#x27;t feel the need to turn it into Windows or MacOS, also seem to have the least issues with it.')
