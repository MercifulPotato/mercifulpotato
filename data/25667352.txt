An example is his recent defense of long lines and dismissal of the insane &quot;80 characters per line&quot; peeps.<p>What I mean specifically by &quot;uncontrolled lunatic&quot; is that he often ignores convention and current opinion and does and says things that get him into trouble. He also has a temper that he often is bad at controlling. I myself have this issue, and I don&#x27;t see how one could say he does not have issues in this regard.<p>While it requires some amount of perpendicular thinking to be a master of software, having such an attitude and working with other people in that way will cause too much conflict that is unnecessary.<p>I think what you are missing in my statement is that I consider calling someone an &quot;uncontrolled lunatic&quot; as a sort of compliment.<p>I agree also that he is less of a technical person and more of a manager. His skills lie in herding.<p>On the other hand; Git is a flaming piece of garbage and he is directly responsible for its popularity... so... He did though reasonably tell people he didn&#x27;t intend for anyone outside of kernel developers to use it. I just wish he corrected its deficiencies. Maybe someday he can apply his &quot;arbitrary character restrictions are silly&quot; logic to Git comments and become less contradictory.')
