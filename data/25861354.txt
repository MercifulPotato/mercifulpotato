Having seen family members&#x2F;friends die of cancer, I don&#x27;t find the additional and potentially unnecessary discomfort of screenings to be too much of a cost.<p>At the same time, I&#x27;d never judge someone for feeling the opposite, particularly in cases like prostate cancer, wherein most people die &quot;with it, not of it&quot; as they say.')
