But their win is inflated by Intel completely imploding. Until next year they&#x27;re merely iterating on 2015 technology - their Skylake architecture - on the desktop and in servers at least. This is not to say that Intel&#x27;s 2021 chips will be competitive with this (they won&#x27;t be) but if Intel with better management would have been at this point in, say, 2018 instead of 2021 this would have played out very differently.')
