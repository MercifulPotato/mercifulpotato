I would really appreciate to see more accurate lists or, better yet, more diverse lists.<p>However, I have to point out the irony here. Every time someone complains about the lack of western representation they just pretend there isn&#x27;t a southern hemisphere in the planet. The East is not composed of only Europe, Canada, and the United States.<p>That&#x27;s to say, fight for overall diversity, not for western vs. eastern representation because that&#x27;s a false dichotomy.')
