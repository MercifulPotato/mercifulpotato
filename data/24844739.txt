Had the headline, and the first part of the article been written carefully, a reader could have been allowed to stop at a point of knowing that the experiment took place, but not yet knowing its outcome.<p>I don&#x27;t have a solid understanding of quantum anything, but I feel like this &quot;no objective reality&quot; statement is misleading of these results. IIUC, two parties cannot get conflicting measurements of the same value (Alice thinks the photon is vertically polarized and Bob thinks it is horizontally polarized), but they can disagree about whether a superposition exists or has collapsed. That seems less crazy.')
