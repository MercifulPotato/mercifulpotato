I&#x27;m wondering if there are nonprofits or other groups that could use PM help to actually do something beneficial for the country? Anything helping with journalism&#x2F;inequality&#x2F;feeding people&#x2F;etc. would be interesting. More than happy to take a meaningful pay cut if the jobs are out there.')
