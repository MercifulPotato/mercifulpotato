Item(by='8fingerlouie', descendants=None, kids=[25185265], score=None, time=1606125849, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25185061, text='&gt; Three years later and you&#x27;re soldering ESP8266s<p>I&#x27;ve just shut down my environmental monitoring solution. I had 7 of those things reporting temperature and humidity (along with various other readings if needed) over Mosquitto MQTT.<p>I put my initial solution together in 2013, and i shut everything down this year. Turns out i rarely looked at the data i collected, and never used historical data, so a regular digital thermometer with a LCD display is more than enough for me :)<p>By the time of shutting down, the thing had grown to include push notifications of temperature extremes for select sensors, as well as presence detection along with humidity alerts for getting people to open windows every now and then, and another notification if the temperature dropped fast (2-3C or more over 20 mins)(so they close the windows again)<p>These days i just open windows every day, and as for the temperature, if it&#x27;s too hot&#x2F;cold i adjust the thermostat. The one remaining issue is the temperature in my dog kennel, which was the original reason for implementing it, but as it has never been a problem in the 7 years it was running, i figure i won&#x27;t be a problem ever.')
