But Twitter can&#x27;t really censor anything, only their platform (same with Facebook). Content they block can be accessed through other means. Net neutrality, however, applies to the operators who can (effectively) bar access short of finding a separate provider.<p>Examples of things net neutrality would bar would be slowing&#x2F;blocking Bittorrent connections (traffic shaping), slowing competitors (Netflix), etc. And those things have happened and likely will continue to happen without net neutrality legislation.')
