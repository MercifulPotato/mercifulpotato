Nothing new about it at all. EA and Bethesda have gotten away with way worse. If you don&#x27;t believe me go find a big publisher game that got a ZERO rating like games did back in the day if it didn&#x27;t run&#x2F;crashed at launch for example. Today the same game will be served on a specially made PC setup by the publishers tech-team before you entered the room and you test the game in their paid suite while eating free snacks. Then it gets a 7. Not because of the crashes but because the snacks were old or you didn&#x27;t win in the random number generator lottery and got mad.')
