Item(by='flagrant', descendants=None, kids=[25638899], score=None, time=1609796950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25638496, text='&gt; Is the part we are disagreeing about what “not _yet_ showing any change” means?<p>No, it&#x27;s the meaning of the entire statement. Your translation means &quot;coronavirus did not result in an increase in deaths in 2020&quot;, whereas my translation means &quot;the spread of coronavirus may be wider than the number of excess deaths in 2020 indicates&quot;. The meaning is wholly different, it is saying something orthogonal to the point you want to make. It says nothing about whether the number of excess deaths is higher or lower than usual, just that you cannot take the number of excess deaths and determine the spread of coronavirus from it.<p>&gt; Please keep in mind though that the claim you’re responding to was that 2020 the year didn’t see a significant increase in deaths - it was a very average year to die as a Swede.<p>I am keeping this in mind because I&#x27;m trying to point out to you that you have no data for excess deaths in 2020 so you cannot make this claim.')
