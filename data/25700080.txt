You&#x27;d have to run content-scripts from some browser extension that polyfills the APIs you want to get rid of. But disabling XHR&#x2F;fetch&#x2F;others won&#x27;t stop your browser from being able to make requests. CSS can make requests (like when you provide custom font paths, or images), HTML can also make requests (&lt;img&gt; and &lt;iframe&gt; elements comes to mind). Without those, we don&#x27;t have a web anymore, we have a document storage without links to other resources.<p>CSS cannot be used as an external API as much as HTML cannot be used as an API. The trick the author is talking about under &quot;CSS as an API&quot; assumes that JS is activated, otherwise you can&#x27;t really do anything dynamic with the data. And if you&#x27;re not doing something dynamic (like you wanna display some text in :content under a :before element), you can just set it in the HTML response instead of in the CSS response.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that disabling JS by default is bad (I do so myself, enabling it only for trusted sites). I&#x27;m just pointing out that disabling CSS is not gonna give you any additional benefits. As long as you&#x27;re in the browser, a HTML page can make requests for you, even if you have CSS disabled.')
