The demographic changes in the US guarantee that outcome under all scenarios, short of the Republican party rapidly becoming a split Hispanic party. It&#x27;s the only sustainable path forward for that party, so we&#x27;ll see if they adjust accordingly or increasingly weaken. The future of the US is Hispanic &#x2F; Latin American, so either the Republicans will adapt or they&#x27;ll lose the popular vote by ever greater margins.')
