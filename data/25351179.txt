If they were useless, you&#x27;d see a lot more psychopaths around. It sounds like you&#x27;re thinking of morality in religious terms, as some sort of negative worldly thing that we ought to do despite of consequences. In reality moral decision making is a sort of game that produces rules which are mutually beneficial and create long term stable social relationships.<p>&gt;After all, having greater optionality in your actions is likely to lead to a more optimal path towards your goal.<p>No, not in the long term. Absence of moral values is as risky as a society without a rule of law. &#x27;Greater optionality&#x27; just leads to maladjustment which over time fires back both on society, and then on the individual in question, which is why people with dark personality traits are much more at risk to not hold a job, be drug dependent, in damaging relationships, or engage in crime.')
