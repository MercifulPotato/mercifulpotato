But for the sake of this discussion, we can assume that the endurance of sapience is desirable to me.<p>Happy to conclude the &#x27;understanding&#x27; discussion by replacement with &#x27;understanding of fundamentals and nth-order consequences for n &gt; 3&#x27; if that will do the trick. As for the rest, you&#x27;re going to have to stop butchering my sentences.<p>&gt; <i>Quite clearly there was a question mark at the end it to indicate my implied doubt.</i><p>Indeed there was, but I was able to (like you did) chop off the comment and create a &#x27;quotation&#x27; that had you take the opposite position. Normally, that would be disingenuous but I did it solely to show you what you were doing.')
