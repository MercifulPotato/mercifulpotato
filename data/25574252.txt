The inaccurate method those cheap bathroom scales use would probably be good enough to detect trends but if we&#x27;re just going to detect trends: why not stick with BMI that&#x27;s accurate enough for that purpose and way cheaper&#x2F;easier to use?  There aren&#x27;t that many people with overweight BMIs that aren&#x27;t overweight.  Maybe it could be slightly better to change methods, but it&#x27;s not like it would be orders of magnitude better.<p>-Someone with a BMI of 28 (smack in the middle of overweight) and a 6pack')
