He was not interested in what they wanted him to learn and had &quot;attitude&quot;. He went off doing what he wanted which led to poor college results. He had trouble to find academic job after for precisely that reason. He was perceived to be lazy. Later, he had good ideas, partly thanks to his extra studies (while at patent office where he was supposed to be doing something else by employer, it was boring job).<p>It is preposterous to claim that the way these tests went is not an instance of sexism. His college teachers did not seen prodigy in him at all.<p>&gt; (Note: it is of course possible that sexism was the cause, but it can&#x27;t be inferred from the information given. BBC sure wants to suggest it, though)<p>It absolutely can be inferred. Moreover, it can be safely guessed that if she was rebelling the way he did, she would get even less of benefit of doubt.<p>Einstein had good ideas later and success. But at the college, most of his peers had better results then him.')
