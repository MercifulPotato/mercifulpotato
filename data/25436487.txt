Item(by='Manfredo_1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608073053, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434952, text='&gt; I think this comment is dangerous as it legitimises the (clearly documented) widespread arrests of openly marked journalists behaving entirely non aggressively, almost surely because they were pointing cameras at police officers behaving violently.<p>I have yet to see an instance of journalists being arrested for filming.<p>What I have seen are crowds of people refusing to abide by curfews or dispersal orders and getting arrested - journalists are sometimes among them. Each time I see a video of a journalist supposedly being arrested for filming, I also see a bunch of people in the background who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> filming <i>also</i> being arrested.<p>Anyone can don a jersey that says &quot;press, or a lanyard claiming to be a journalist. The more widespread the notion that these things somehow exempt people from curfews and orders to disperse, the less surprised I am that so many journalists (most of them independent) are getting arrested.')
