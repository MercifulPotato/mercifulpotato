You also had too much breathing time at work. Maybe you should stop breathing when outside of work. You read things on that screen so I guess you &quot;got enough reading at work&quot;. If your allowed headphones at work and listen to music while working then I bet you &quot;got enough music at work&quot; and don&#x27;t listen to music outside of work.<p>I&#x27;m totally for your right to do whatever you want outside of work. Me, I continue to use &quot;the screen&quot; because I like gaming, I like movies, I like channels on youtube, I like video chat with friends and family.<p>The computer it just a tool. The fact that I happen to use one at work is no different than I might use books, a chair, a table, and other tools at work. That doesn&#x27;t give me some ridiculous notion that I got too much book time, chair time, table time, pen time, etc...')
