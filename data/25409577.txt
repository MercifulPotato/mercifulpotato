There are a certain number of developers who will muck around and waste their 20% time and there are certain (terrible) team leads and PMs who discourage the use of the time because they&#x27;re anxious about their own projects.<p>But for the most part it contributed massively to the happiness of the developers. And the outcomes, in my opinion, were invaluable. It&#x27;s not always visible from the outside, but Atlassian now has swathes of valuable internal tooling, built with love by developers who were invested in solving their own productivity problems.<p>The quintessential &quot;20% project&quot; is GMail but I think that misses the incrementalism that 20% projects really provide. Developers will absolutely take advantage of the time to improve their personal ergonomics, and everyone around them benefits from that.<p>But this is obviously very difficult to measure.')
