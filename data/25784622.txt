No local modifications? No violation of terms. End of line.<p>While that&#x27;s a <i>slight</i> risk of having more burden than <i>not</i> having to provide that source code, it&#x27;s not like it contains anything proprietary, because you probably aren&#x27;t modifying it anyways — and once you divulge that source, it&#x27;s proof that you not only did not violate terms, but could even request legal fees.<p>So whether or not this search usage would qualify, which can only be definitively decided in a court of law, your actual risk of harm and exposure is none whatsoever — unless you have proprietary patches to ElasticSearch and you aren&#x27;t already sharing them openly in a GitHub fork. (I&#x27;m not your lawyer, etc.)')
