We simply do not trust your cloud.<p>We also have a higher compliance requirement, since we can have potential snippets of production data. Our Jira&#x2F;Confluence systems are highly isolated inside a high compliance solution. We can verify and prove that these machines do not leak.<p>The Atlassian cloud is completely unacceptable in every way possible. And going from $1200ish year to $20000 per year with data center is laughably horrendous - for the same exact features.<p>Unless Atlassian changes its direction, your software is that of the walking dead. We have a absolute hard timelimit of 2024, but in reality, 2022. We&#x27;d like to still use it and pay you appropriately, but we&#x27;re not about to compromise our data security handling procedures so you can funnel more people into a cloud service... And judging by the comments here, is pretty damn terrible.')
