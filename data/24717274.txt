I wanted to get a sense for its &#x27;potential&#x27; during dark post 9&#x2F;11 days of terrorist threats and such, adding another mental concern - &quot;What if someone dribbled some down the side of a plane&#x27;s window?&quot;. After playing with it a bit, i figured it&#x27;d be pretty hard to cause harm (you need to scratch the oxide layer for the gallium to affect ally).<p>Worry gone, it&#x27;s made for an interesting toy since :)')
