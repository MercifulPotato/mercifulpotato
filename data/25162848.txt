A lot of rural areas are still stuck with dial-up and low-bandwidth cellular data at best, so every kilobyte matters.  This also applies even in places with abundant cellular coverage; congestion can and often does cause issues with thousands or millions of people trying to get info or reach out to emergency contacts all at once.<p>Min&#x27;s rationale further brings to mind things like disseminating info on hospitals, shelters, etc. in war zones, often to people who at most have an ancient (by first-world standards) phone with expensive and slow network connectivity.')
