Item(by='1vuio0pswjnm7', descendants=None, kids=[24913014, 24913253], score=None, time=1603838696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24910678, text='IME, most YouTube videos do not use any technological measure to prevent using <i>any</i> TCP client, not simply Google&#x27;s Javascript player compbined with a web browser, to download the video.  Moreover I have observed that for most YT videos Google&#x27;s player uses &quot;progressive download&quot;, i.e., a number of successive HTTP requests with incremented Range headers, not &quot;streaming&quot;.<p>Thus, for most videos, there is no need to circumvent any technological measure, e.g., a so-called &quot;rolling cipher&quot; for the video signature.  Section 1201, specifically referenced in RIAA&#x27;s letter, requires that the circumvention software be &quot;primarily&quot; designed for circumvention.  It&#x27;s arguable youtube-dl is not primarily designed for downloading the minority of YT videos that use the rolling cipher, or whatever &quot;protection&quot; Google may choose to offer the minority of YT accounts that want to use YT as a distribution channel for commercial content, e.g., VEVO.<p>With the rolling cipher, Google tries to ensure all HTTP requests sent by the user are made via its own Javascript player.  However this still does not stop anyone using a popular browser with Developer Tools or the equivalent (such as Microsoft&#x27;s own Edge browser) from obtaining the download URL and using any TCP client the user chooses to perform the download.  Nor does it stop any user from observing the download URL via other means, e.g., users observing the TCP traffic entering their personal networks.<p>Through the use of the rolling cipher, YT does not restrict access to the the download URL.  It simply changes the URL periodically.  The rolling cipher is thus not an effective access control.   For example, when Google promises YT account holders Google can prevent users in a certain geographic region from accessing a video, does Google use a rolling cipher in the Javascript player as the access control.')
