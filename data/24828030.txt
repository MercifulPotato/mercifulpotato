I have some basic theoretical Haskell knowledge, but not much practical experience. However I do have some significant Nix experience.<p>Ended up not even going through the beginner tutorial, as the installer&#x2F;scaffold process required me to do things that I didn&#x27;t like:<p>- forced scaffolding of projects with some quite blackboxy generated shell scripts inside<p>- use of nix, yet requiring me to install &#x27;make&#x27; and &#x27;direnv&#x27; system-wide (why? just let me use a shell.nix)<p>- required me to use cachix.org as a system-wide nix substituter, which I don&#x27;t want to do for security reasons (just allow me to build everything myself)<p>All in all this looked promising, but ended up being too magical for my taste. I&#x27;d like to be able to start using IHP &#x27;from scratch&#x27; instead - with my own Cabal&#x2F;Nix&#x2F;Bazel build machinery. This is a critical requirement for libraries&#x2F;frameworks that I use.<p>Your mileage may vary though - if you&#x27;re okay with RoR-like scaffolding and blackboxness, then you might feel at home here, and at least you get a nicely typed language in return.')
