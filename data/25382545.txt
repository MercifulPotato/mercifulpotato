A valid and well supported opinion.<p>However what I refer to is that you question how a piece like this article can go ahead and not point out the immortality of their ways. And I really think that from their business-centered, libertarian point of view, there just isn&#x27;t any immortality here. In <i>their</i> opinion, they did things right. Therefore they could not point it out.')
