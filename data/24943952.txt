We can argue where exactly the line should be, but most people should agree that pedestrian&#x27;s shouldn&#x27;t be able to just suddenly jump out in front of a fast-moving stream of heavy traffic and expect everyone to stop across all lanes for them.<p>As a society we have agreed that the laws in most places are &quot;Pedestrians should cross the road at these designated spots, where they have right of way, sometimes only when given a specific signal&quot;. Sure, in some places it&#x27;s become acceptable to cross the road outside of these &quot;allowed&quot; circumstances if you feel like there&#x27;s no risk, but at that point you should also assume all liability.<p>FWIW I am for the pedestrianization of city centers and adding protected bike lanes everywhere possible, but I do think when there <i>is</i> a road, we all have to follow the agreed upon rules.')
