It&#x27;s outrageous. I&#x27;m buying Ankers and &quot;good&quot; brands too. My car has ubsc to usbc and android auto and it used to be a pain (usba to usbc slowed it down) so I&#x27;m diligent about fast&#x2F;good cables.<p>I have no working usbc-usbc cables right now. It&#x27;s wild how quickly mine go bad and most of the time they&#x27;re just plugged into a phone once a day (driving), if that.<p>I just have a drawer full of dead cables with some sort of usbc end..')
