If that is something you&#x27;d be \ninterested in, please let me know.<p>Sounds like they are planning on having the community take over responsibility for XQuartz. Nonetheless it’s great that they put in the work of bringing native Apple Silicon support and making a build system for it that others can use.<p>Anyways I personally much more rarely need XQuartz now than before, but it’s good to have it be available still if and when you need it.')
