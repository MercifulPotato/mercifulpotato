When I act as a client and looking to buy me some software the first things I am looking for:<p><pre><code>  1) Does it have perpetual license for at least the version I am about to buy.\n\n  2) Can it work offline?\n</code></pre>\nAnswer either of 2 no and I am not buying it. Well this of course excludes things like Netflix. The product I make offers either either perpetual license or subscriptions so the customer gets to choose. So far perpetual license revenue exceeds that of subscriptions.')
