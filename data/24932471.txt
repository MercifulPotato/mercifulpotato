(Important because Youtube, Vimeo, etc changes constantly and breaks old youtube-dl versions.)<p>We have 2 main areas to implement:<p>1) the <i>code artifacts</i>:  a source code repo (and binary releases for download) ; for Linux kernel, I think this is &quot;www.kernel.org&quot;[1]<p>2) the <i>workflow</i>:  the issues &#x2F; bug reports &#x2F; pull requests ; for Linux kernel collaboration, a popular mailing list is &quot;majordomo@vger.kernel.org&quot;[2]<p>If youtube-dl switches from github to mailing lists, how would the &quot;-U&quot; command work?  Would somebody need to setup a SMTP server (or at minimum, a SMTP email account) dedicated to youtube-dl?  Would youtube-dl then use SMTP protocol to scan the mailing list for which server has the latest code artifacts?<p>Does making youtube-dl act as a pseudo email-client make it RIAA proof?  Are SMTP servers beyond the legal reach of RIAA?<p>EDIT to reply: <i>This article is about the developer workflow, not about what the end-user software should do.</i><p>I understand that but I think it&#x27;s productive to <i>go beyond that</i> and think out loud what a realistic implementation could be to help end users.  Besides, many end users are <i>also the code contributors</i>.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vger.kernel.org&#x2F;vger-lists.html#linux-kernel" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vger.kernel.org&#x2F;vger-lists.html#linux-kernel</a>')
