Thrust implies acceleration, not just velocity.<p>Suppose you&#x27;re just inside the event horizon, from the perspective of an external observer. You&#x27;re traveling outward at a velocity of .95c. That&#x27;s lower than the escape velocity (which is &gt; c), so you&#x27;re going to fall back in before you actually get to the external observer. But if you were close to the event horizon you might cross back over it before you fall back in, right? At which point the external observer could see you again.<p>And once you&#x27;re outside the event horizon, e.g. to the place where escape velocity is .9c, you might by then have slowed to .8c, but if you still have the capacity to accelerate back above .9c again, you could still get out, couldn&#x27;t you?')
