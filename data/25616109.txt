Back in 2017 I was driving in Mexico using maps.me in offline mode (saving on ex-orbitant data roaming fees). At one point, the highway did a wide turn, and some village was tucked away in this turn.<p>Maps.me decided it would be a good idea to cut through the village as its main street connected two points on the bending highway like a chord. Yes, in terms of distance it was shorter, if you do not account for the allowed speed limit and conditions. I spent 10 minutes slowly crawling through the village trying not to kill any chickens. I was also low on gas and had barely enough to get to the next gas station, so I was not amused.<p>Since then I always triple-check maps.me routes, looking at the whole route and checking it against google maps if I have a chance.<p>To be fair, it has probably more to do with maps.me routing algorithm than OSM data, but it is hard to know.')
