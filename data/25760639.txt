Item(by='cheph', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610536431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760511, text='Well twitter banned him, among other reasons, because his tweet “To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.” &quot;may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a “safe” target, as he will not be attending.&quot; [1]<p>Which seems to be somewhat scraping the bottom of the barrel of credibility, as is some of the other reasoning. Some other gems:<p>- &quot;The use of the words “American Patriots” to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol.&quot;<p>- &quot;The mention of his supporters having a “GIANT VOICE long into the future” and that “They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an “orderly transition” and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election.&quot;<p>I think they kinda fucked up letting him back on in the first place and are now left nit picking two mostly benign tweets because they don&#x27;t know what else to do. The most egregious tweets were not the two they cite.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.twitter.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;topics&#x2F;company&#x2F;2020&#x2F;suspension.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.twitter.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;topics&#x2F;company&#x2F;2020&#x2F;suspensio...</a>')
