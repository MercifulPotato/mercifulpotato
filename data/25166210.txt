The workaround was that he charged a flat hourly rate, not a per-service fee. He specialized in knee surgery and also worked at a local hospital, so you could either wait 3 to 6 months for him to fix your knee at the hospital, or you could book him sooner at his private practice. That sounded like a win-win to me.')
