At least just perror() and abort(), so the user has a chance at finding the problem. Similarly, using mmaped files without handling errors is user hostile since it just crashes the app and SIGBUS gives absolutely no clue to the user what happened. As said, my point is to use mmap when it really makes sense and is worth the hassle, not just because it seems cool and makes the code look a little simpler, exactly because you omit error handling. Especially if you don&#x27;t know how people will use your software. As you said, mmap on nfs is bad, so you&#x27;d basically have to forbid users from using your software with network shares.')
