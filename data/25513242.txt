A couple cities attract so many bright talented hopeful young &amp; other seekers, &amp; the rest of the country, well, it keeps ossifying, having these remainer cultures.<p>I&#x27;m visiting the parents now &amp; I think about how it used to be a competition to see who had left the least, who had ever gone the least distance from home. proud proud foolishness, this desire to experience little, a certitude that yours was the right &amp; only way, utter closedness. repulsive vile &amp; toxic behaviors, from people either concerned &amp; blustering or deliberately ignorant, infatuated with their local world alone. everyone socially goading each other into fanaticism.<p>talking with the people of my contemproary urban world, there&#x27;s a recognition that our values, our beliefs, carry no weight in this twisted electoral system, set up centuries ago. we have to become a democracy again, have to have some way to affect the governance of our nation, which we do not have, thanks to these electoral systems that favor the un-urban so heavily, that give them such voices. we think &amp; muse about the travelling bands, the tribes of the willing hopeful better-making positive techies &amp; others, that we can find ways to bring the connections we value in to a polticially active force, to try to deliberately rebalance, but it&#x27;s so far off, so hard to actually imagine it happening. we need more suggestion, more dreamers, more material talking about, laying out this path. we hope. we are so tired of america being under the seat of these tribalistic demagogues, radicalized under some false spectre of socialism &amp; general FUD, &amp; we want some damned ability to progress this stuck nation. if we must spread out to spread our dreams, perhaps that is what we must do.')
