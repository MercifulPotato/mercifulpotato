They were in places like forums and forums were often around topics. I belonged to many forums on topics and the general conversation was around those (with some water cooler).<p>This is worthy of protecting. Just this week I ended up in a forum on a topic because I was trying to figure out how to repair something and there was discussion around people on it. Very valuable.<p>&gt; Today people looks at Twitter&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;YouTube&#x2F;Reddit, see mismanaged cesspools and declare that we need centralized speech control.<p>These are general conversation channels with the exception of Reddit. They are also paired with targeted ads. They tend to be short form. In a forum I see all the things and navigate it. In Twitter&#x2F;FB&#x2F;etc I see what they put in front of me. They control the flow of information.<p>The platforms the conversations are happening on are shaping the conversations themselves. This cannot be discounted.')
