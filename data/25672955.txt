What we don&#x27;t know is who or what was responsible. In the sense that JetBrains is in the supply chain and that supply chain was ultimately compromised, the threat is absolutely credible.<p>Other credible threats include every human who touched or has the ability to touch the configuration of their Team City pipelines.<p>However, the Times journalists should get some facts straight before flinging libel around. There are millions of JetBrains users for a wide variety of products. They&#x27;re implicating all these products, and that doesn&#x27;t seem to be appropriate. Breaking a text editor or IDE to introduce this class of attack seems unlikely, and much more prone to discovery.<p>Personally, everything about this smells like an inside job (or gross incompetence).')
