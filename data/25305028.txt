You have every right to say &quot;this is mine and does not concern you&quot;.<p>Establish limits and set boundaries, if you have to.  If that means a locked room, desk, trunk, or other means, then do that.  Often the best way to establish boundaries is to assert them.<p>You situation sounds intrinsically toxic.  I understand you&#x27;re married with family --- if that&#x27;s where the privacy issues are (rather than at work), you might want to consider family counseling.  A lack of basic trust or respect is a bad sign.<p>Meantime, digital encrypted systems may be more appropriate, though personal notations and code can help with paper --- you&#x27;re not the first person to have nosy neighbours.')
