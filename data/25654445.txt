I went whole hog and got the $65 edition.<p>Took so long to make it that by the time I finally got it, no one ever wanted to play it. Most of my friends end up playing totally different party games when we get together.<p>I also looked back a bunch of things I bookmarked to see what did and didn&#x27;t get made - about 75% of the KSes I was interested in never got to funding status, or got funded, but eventually failed.')
