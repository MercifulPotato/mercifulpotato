Item(by='Balgair', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606538974, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25232991, text='Hear Hear!<p>He was a two fisted drunken chain smoker, for sure.<p>But what rare good ideas he had were worth it all.<p>I&#x27;ll cheer again his <i>Letters to Young Contrarian</i> as terrible sauced drivel.<p>But damned if I ever wrote more in the margins of that thin little tome arguing against his bastard ideas. To be clear, I disagree with nearly everything Hitch said. But his poppycock made me think deeper than any second-rate Augustine. To have <i>everyone</i> hate you is a rare thing. To have that for decades is unique.<p>If he ever wrote only that one pamphlet, he&#x27;d be forgotten. But that he wrote so much more <i>and</i> that cigarette of a book, well, makes the matchbox so much more reprehensible. It wasn&#x27;t satire, rather, a hose of drool.<p>But it is truly <i>honest</i>.<p>Again, read it, argue with him, treasure it, and pass it along.<p>I can&#x27;t recommend anything better on how to live that kind of life.')
