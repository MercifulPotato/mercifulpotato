The fact that is was liberally licensed made me less afraid of vendor lock-in.<p>In my opinion it seems like Elastic wants ElasticSearch to still be <i>perceived</i> as the fully open source project (with all of its good connotations) it once was.<p>&gt; AWS is the fly in the ointment there, and I don&#x27;t see how blaming Elastic for not giving us stuff for free any more is anything other than entitled. We should be grateful that ES is OSS at all, and we should want an environment where companies that produce OSS can thrive, instead of blaming them for wanting to get paid for the work that they release freely into the world.<p>It&#x27;s okay to release things as non-OSS. It&#x27;s also okay to release something as OSS first, and then regret later. But it&#x27;s super weird that they&#x27;re painting this picture of AWS being a big evil company when they&#x27;re just doing exactly what is expected. Can&#x27;t they just say &quot;we&#x27;re not able to build a company around the liberal license&quot; instead of this &quot;we&#x27;re such an open company and we love open source and AWS is ruining everything&quot; talk?')
