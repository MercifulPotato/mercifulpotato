Why would you expect anything else? And if anyone complains about it, the complaints will get scrubbed off the internet. And if you go to private messengers to complain, your session keys will get escrowed because &quot;terrorism&quot; or &quot;misinformation&quot; or something and you&#x27;ll be banned. Keep in mind that the WallStreetBets Discord server was banned for &quot;hate speech&quot; right in the middle of all the recent drama. Does anyone actually believe that was the real reason?<p>It&#x27;s because of shenanigans like this that I&#x27;m categorically against any sort of control whatsoever over flows of information.')
