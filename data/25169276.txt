It&#x27;s equipped with proper desks, monitors, chair and so on. You can go there if you need a few hours, or days, of dedicated time. If you&#x27;re working on a specific project, we&#x27;ll often move the team working on that project to a dedicate office. For your daily job, you just just stay at your normal desk in a semi-open office space, with plenty of meeting room and smaller rooms for calls or online meetings.')
