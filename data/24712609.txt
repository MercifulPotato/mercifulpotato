I&#x27;ve been pushing for more language safety for what, decades, and it&#x27;s good to see Stanford teaching it. It&#x27;s important that students understand ownership concepts, because they exist in C, but the language doesn&#x27;t give you any help in dealing with ownership. For years, I&#x27;ve been saying about C that the big questions are &quot;how big is it?&quot;, &quot;who deletes it?&quot;, and &quot;who locks it?&quot;. Rust addresses all of those. So teaching Rust is useful to get students thinking in the right direction.  Even if they get stuck maintaining old C code.<p>Looking ahead, new students are going to have to deal in future with huge numbers of CPU cores. So they need to deal with large numbers of threads. That&#x27;s very hard to do well. This class addresses not just safety, but performance. That&#x27;s good.<p>This is so far ahead of what I got from Stanford in 1985.<p>(I have some arguments with the Rust people, mostly around over-use of &quot;unsafe&quot; and too much language churn, but they&#x27;re doing great work.)')
