I have been of the opinion for a decade that most apps and even static sites are way more JavaScript-heavy than they need to be and that we depend far too much on frameworks, so much so that even very good developers don’t know much actual HTML and CSS. Yeah I know it’s the old “too much abstraction” argument, but I strongly believe it. It’s a breath of fresh air when people write articles like this because it brings us down to earth. Now, I’m not saying going JS-free is appropriate for all cases or even most cases. Sometimes the customer has complex requirements or the project you’re brought in on uses JS at its core (Rails, React, Angular, any of the SPA frameworks). Heck, I’ve even written my own SPA framework because reasons. Point is, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the “old fashioned” static page apps in many cases - using forms, letting the back-end handle business logic, not having to worry about routing, etc.')
