I know there are countries in Europe&#x2F;Asia that are much harder than the US to get into.<p>IMHO the US is more about making money than it is about where you come from or your ethnicity or your nationality.  We just want to get paid.  I know in the news you see a lot of parts of the US that makes it seem like they do not want immigrants, but I think the truth is that the US welcomes immigrants more than other countries.')
