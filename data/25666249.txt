When you take away the ability of people to participate in peaceful political discourse, you push them towards violence.  Half of the American electorate currently feels profoundly unheard.  They&#x27;ve lost their public voice and their ability to vouch for themselves, which has enabled mass media to flood every publication channel with parodies of them.  The longer this continues, the greater the risk of violence will become.  You can&#x27;t make people&#x27;s beliefs go away by silencing them.')
