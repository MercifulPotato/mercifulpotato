My bad.<p>&gt;that was a person walking into a parked car (it&#x27;s funny that they could measure the walking speed of the person at 2.7mph).<p>And heh. I can&#x27;t say the car&#x27;s likely at fault in that case although it may still have behaved in a way the pedestrian didn&#x27;t expect.  And as someone else noted, some of the language I was quoting was from The Verge. The actual report is much more just the facts.<p>To your broader point, a human driver could probably obey every traffic law and get into tons of at least minor accidents that would be technically the other driver&#x27;s fault.')
