Servers are way too useful. The git model seems like a nice compromise. And by git model, I mean an opensource distributed protocol that anyone can run coupled with some big centralised services run by big tech - so you don’t have to. This has all the benefits of a centralised system with the all important off ramp.<p>Email more or less works the same way now. A few years ago I moved from Gmail to fastmail and haven’t looked back. That said, I really wish more of GitHub’s features made their way back to git. Issues should be stored somewhere in the git repository - so they can be viewed offline and so competing services like gitlab can be compatible.')
