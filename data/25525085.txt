(Well, maybe.  I suspect that at least to some degree, she already had her position, and derived her axioms from there, then argued for her position from her axioms.)  So I attack her position by saying that in her third axiom, she mis-defines consciousness, and the rest of her errors follow from her flawed starting position.  That&#x27;s rational.  &quot;It leaves me cold&quot; is not a rational response.  (It may be an indication that you feel there&#x27;s something wrong with the position, even if you can&#x27;t define it or prove it, and that&#x27;s fine.  But it&#x27;s not a rational response.)')
