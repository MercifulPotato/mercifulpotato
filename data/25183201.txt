It&#x27;s a safe bet that uniqueness will become ever more disproportionately rewarded in the near-future.<p>This can mean developing a unique perspective or using your existing, unique experiences to do something no one else can. The trouble of course is that as general advice, it&#x27;s all hand-wavy and each individuals specific situation has its own context and limitations. Everyone is forced to figure it out without the benefit of direct examples, by definition.<p>I think the single best &quot;starter advice&quot; for someone interested in taking this direction is to train your mind to be habitually observant. Meditation is one way but other good techniques exist as well. Coming up with something unique almost always involves figuring out how a &quot;weird&quot; piece of external reality fits.')
