Most of what you are annoyed with though is like being annoyed at C for the same reasons: Make is a programming language with a built-in dependency mechanism, and as such you can use it to build whatever you want... now, does it already come with whatever you want? No. I can appreciate wanting something which does. But such systems usually then give you what they want. I don&#x27;t want my programming language to solve half of these things you want, and yet somehow I have built things on top of Make that solve even the problem of building for arbitrary embedded cross compile targets. (And hell: of cross compile toolchains is what you care most about, the king of that space is autotools, which not only correctly supports compiling to everything always every time out of the box, but somehow manages to make it possible with nothing more than you passing some toolchain configuration as command line arguments to the generated configure script... and one might note that it generates Make, though without taking much advantage of what makes Make great.)')
