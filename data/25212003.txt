I have a fairly different political worldview than Greenwald but he is totally unique in his principles and consistency in speaking truth to power. For like a decade he has refused to call himself a liberal or leftist, letting his actions (like profiling AOC before really any other outlet noticed her) speak for themselves.<p>Greenwald has been carefully explaining what is wrong with Silicon Valley censorship for years[1][2]. Hopefully Snowden will convince some people.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ggreenwald&#x2F;status&#x2F;918451881940344833" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ggreenwald&#x2F;status&#x2F;918451881940344833</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ggreenwald&#x2F;status&#x2F;1077912022187163648" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ggreenwald&#x2F;status&#x2F;1077912022187163648</a>')
