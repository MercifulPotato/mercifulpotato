I’m also channeling Wolfram here, but I’m not sure if he ever expressed it exactly this way. But the thing I’m imagining would be: set up some (preferably discrete) dynamical system, and then another different kind of system that you fit variationally to the first. The claim would be that the mutual information between state variables of the second and the first will always gradually decrease — unless they are the exactly the same family, in which case the fit rediscovers the exact dynamics and the two systems are identical. So intuitively, the second law would correspond to the claim that different families of programs cannot accurately simulate each other for very long. In the special case of a coarse graining, this should give you the more familiar story about entropy and the ‘gap’ between macrostates and microstates, but the real story is a more general one than that and is an empirical fact about the “computational universe”, with physics a special case.')
