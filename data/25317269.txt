I&#x27;ve definitely seen jailbreaks of embedded devices that start off by MITMing DNS to proxy all traffic. DoH is changing that, and I can see how that&#x27;s annoying.<p>&gt; <i>hit Samsung.com if there’s an update you need</i><p>Why would you need an update? Updates are mainly necessary for security, which you don&#x27;t need if the device isn&#x27;t on the Internet. If the device doesn&#x27;t have all the features you expect out of the box, return it within the return period. There&#x27;s a small corner case where an update could carry significantly increased functionality, but it seems easier to ad-hoc address that down the line rather than plan for it. Carelessly doing updates is a good way to <i>break</i> your device.<p>&gt; <i>Unfortunately that’s going to be a losing game for many devices</i><p>I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s a losing game if you play it correctly. Fine grained policing of types of traffic is a losing game, but wholesale denying transit isn&#x27;t. There is little difference between my network of tp-link bulbs and a local modbus network.')
