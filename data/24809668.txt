I admit Rust needs to sort some kinks out still but it builds up on the experience of C++ and I believe it&#x27;s already heading in a very productive direction. I love what they&#x27;re doing with their async stack, being just one example.<p>I can&#x27;t deny compiler and linker speed in general are better in C++ land but Rust is gradually catching up (too slow for my taste still but sigh). That&#x27;s a very strong point against Rust to this day.<p>You might be right that compromises for running in embedded environments might load Rust with the same ugly historical baggage as C++. That&#x27;s very possible and I can only hope it won&#x27;t happen, but you do still have an excellent point about the genesis of these problems.<p>D and Nim I admittedly didn&#x27;t evaluate very fairly -- gave them half an afternoon each. They were quite nice in fact, but I found the small ecosystem off-putting, especially in a situation when I want to play with an idea that might require libraries for 5+ well-established technologies. So yeah, I wasn&#x27;t very fair to them but didn&#x27;t want to dedicate much time for prototyping ideas regardless.')
