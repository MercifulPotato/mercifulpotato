The largest part is about how social constructs, ideals, workflows, and so forth fit.

It is not just about translating the app in Dutch and French; the way people interact, do business, communicate; the problems people have, the problems they dont have, and so forth are very different.<p>This is a pet-peeve of mine: we are all pushed in an American Template due to the prevalence of Silicon Valley &quot;dictated&quot; norms. When I was young, nudity on television in my country was normal. A local movie would have to have at least two naked tits.
