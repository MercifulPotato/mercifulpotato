Spent two summers finishing it up real nice and then woosh! No insurance, I guess we lost about 20-40k of materials and tools that were there. The most painful part of fixing it was getting all the building permits sorted out.<p>Oh well,  the Buddha teaches us that all things are temporary.  I did enjoy the weekends hammering away with friends and family.<p>I am looking into shipping container construction now.  Cabin 2.0 will solve all the design flaws we inherited from Cabin 1.0,  and no doubt introduce new and exciting flaws!')
