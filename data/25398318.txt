They assign incoming speech sounds to categories based on the cues that are used in their first language rather than the second language, so they actually perceive the sounds in a different way from native speakers. This is a concept known as categorical perception. For example, Japanese learners of English tend to perceive English &#x2F;l&#x2F; and &#x2F;r&#x2F; as the same sound and cannot discriminate them reliably in perception experiments. Therefore, we can speculate that they have trouble producing the sounds differentially because they don&#x27;t actually hear a difference between them.<p>So, the first step in overcoming pronunciation issues is not necessarily to teach tongue positions, but to train perception.')
