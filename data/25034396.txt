We&#x27;re having exponential growth in the amount of COVID19 (with a slow exponent, with social distancing, but exponential none-the-less). That we&#x27;ve seen mutations back when there was a tiny fraction of the cases we have today is a very bad sign.<p>If it jumps species, as we saw with mink, we may have a reservoir in nature with no control. It will mutate and periodically jump back to humans.')
