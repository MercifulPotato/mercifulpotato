Apart from Samsung, the largest phone manufacturers are all Chinese, and currently under sanction by the US government, with more soon on the way. Out of the Chinese bunch, the majority are Huawei. Huawei has been forced to move into a non-Playstore Android OS.<p>I use a burner Huawei for non-essential Android stuff. Every time I click the &quot;Rate App&quot; button on apps, it redirects me to Huawei store instead of Play Store. Every time I click the &quot;Download&quot; or &quot;Install&quot; button on the browser, it sends me to Huawei store. I think we can expect to see more changes in the coming two years as Android keeps updating. Huawei phones up until 2018 are allowed to use the Google SDKs but none are allowed from 2019.<p>The only one left behind is Samsung, which has the wherewithal to create its own (Apple clone) app store. If they go ahead with that, Google Play will be a fucking joke at that point.')
