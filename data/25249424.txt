Shine the critical light of examination on this &quot;belief&quot; that the most reliable way to expose bad ideas is to expose them.<p>Have you seen this tested? Have you evidence that this works?<p>Crucially, does this work at internet scale or in social medai-esque content environments?<p>-----<p>I can say that we know for a fact, that exposing conspiracy theories by letting people broadcast them independently is a sure shot way of having them infect more people.<p>We&#x27;ve seen this evidenced all over web forums, and social media. Bad ideas get amplified. Worse, the more complex the logical counter argument, the far better the bad idea will fare.<p>Here are what we know, for certainty:<p>1) People DO NOT want to spend cognitive power.<p>1.1) Content that forces cognitive expenditure will gain fewer views and therefore be harder to go viral.<p>2) Emotion driven processing is cheaper.<p>2.1) Therefore emotion engaging content will proliferate<p>3) this is worsened over general demographics<p>3.1) Proofs or logical arguments that require more than common knowledge will need novel approaches to propagate.<p>Our human web of knowledge is a growth medium that suits conspiracy theories, self referential beliefs, and superstition.<p>Reason is the interloper here.')
