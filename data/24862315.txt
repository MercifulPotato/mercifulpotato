It&#x27;s total dominion of the human spirit through terror, where traditional &#x27;isms are just nationally focused. When you break people with the randomness of the terror, they will oppress themselves.<p>In this model, North Korea is still just a national tyranny, and even China&#x27;s CCP is a national police state with colonial aspirations, but it hasn&#x27;t metastasized into a transnational movement. Hitlerism and Stalinism were the result of movements that created totalitarian empires. Arendt&#x27;s view was it was a new form of government that was an artifact of the 20th century.')
