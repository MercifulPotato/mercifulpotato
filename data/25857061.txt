You have repeatedly confused the meaning of open and closed. &quot;Closed&quot; means <i>including</i> the end element given in the range, and &quot;open&quot; means <i>excluding</i> it.<p>It may make more sense to think of intervals in the real numbers. &quot;[1,2)&quot; doesn&#x27;t have a maximum to the right - it has 1.9999....... but not 2. Thus it&#x27;s &quot;open&quot; to the right. Whereas &quot;[1,2]&quot; includes its maximum (2), so its sealed.<p>The terms open and closed apply to any set of numbers (not just intervals), where &quot;closed&quot; means that the set includes the limit of any series of numbers in the set, and open means &quot;not closed&quot;.')
