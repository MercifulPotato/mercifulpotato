Their machines are still far more expensive than Windows</i><p>It was never about being cheaper or the best bang for the buck.<p>Mac was always playing at the expensive end of the market, for people who want&#x2F;appreciate (most of) what they get (macOS, the hardware&#x2F;software integration, the ecosystem,  the design choices, the better components at various levels - screen, trackpad, the sturdy unibody construction, the sound, the battery life, etc), including some compromises (e.g. lighter and more battery over more powerful graphics cards, simplified product line vs endless configurations and decision fatigue, etc), plus the ability to run commercial apps like FCPX, Adobe Suite, MS Office, and (for those few that care) a UNIX underneath.<p>Now the Mac has all that, plus a very fact CPU, it can customize for the OS even further, build extra coprocessors and SOC goodies, have crazy battery life at great performance, and even lower cost or higher margins.')
