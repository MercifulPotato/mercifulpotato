In the UK for example, we&#x27;ve started doing citizenship checks for anyone who looks remotely like a foreigner, which to my mind is perverse and unnecessary, and part of a governmental preoccupation with trying to become as racist as possible via the back-door. (essentially, if we can blame the foreigners, we can absolve the government)<p>However, I think we can still say &quot;America&#x27;s system is totally screwy&quot; and also say &quot;and btw, as a warning, X country seems to be heading down that route too&quot; - I don&#x27;t think, phrased the way ant6n&#x27;s post was, it takes away from criticism of America.<p>Essentially, in a perfect world, nobody would be made bankrupt because they got ill, and it seems right that governments should do everything they can to prevent that. If there is a class of people who get forced into that position because of something they cannot change, then that system is broken - whether or not that broken system adversely affects you personally. For example, the American system is not broken for rich people, and especially those in perfect health. For those people, it works just right.<p>And even if you are the only person in a country that is given the choice between feeding their family or investigating an abnormal lump, it doesn&#x27;t matter how many people benefit from the upsides of that system, it doesn&#x27;t matter if all your neighbours can visit their GP for a weekly checkup without penalty - without a doubt that system is broken and unjust and needs fixing.<p>But yes, I think most developed-country-based non-Americans would rate America&#x27;s system as somewhere between &quot;more broken than mine&quot; and &quot;perverse and cruel&quot;. The fact that we all use America&#x27;s system as the yardstick for what a bad system looks like says it all.')
