To me, a Conspiracy Theory is an unconfirmed Conspiracy that lacks a preponderance of evidence. I&#x27;d rather see some sort of weighted approach that factors for new evidence as it comes in, if it comes in at all. Even in a broad Conspiracy Theory, there may be parts of it that are true and parts of it that are untrue, it isn&#x27;t a binary thing.')
