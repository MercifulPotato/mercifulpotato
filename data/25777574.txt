It&#x27;s very much like Slack&#x2F;Discord channels. Users are able to essentially create topic rooms within a show.<p>Think of each TV show as it&#x27;s own Discord server and within the show are user-generated topic rooms.<p>My hope is that users basically self-silo into topic rooms that interest them in regards to whatever show their watching.<p>For example: the Yankees are playing the Marlins. Users can create a #yankees room, a #marlins room, a #umpire room, etc to create chat rooms around a given topic in regards to whatever they&#x27;re watching. In each room, a user has the ability to block, filter words, etc...so they can tailor their chat experience in whatever way they want while watching any given show.')
