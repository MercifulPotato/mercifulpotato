Thanks for the comments, and thank you for using Retool!<p>We have a product in beta that (I think) does what you&#x27;re looking for: the Query Library (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.retool.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;query-library" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.retool.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;query-library</a>). This lets you run queries, save them, and share them across your company. LMK if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for?<p>(In the future, we will be adding more permissions, etc. to it. We are actively developing this right now and would love to get some feedback from you on it if you&#x27;d be open to it? I will have our engineer email you!)')
