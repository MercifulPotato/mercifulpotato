Now perhaps the minutiae isn&#x27;t quite as important - but what better way to learn the chronology than knowing the dates? It&#x27;s fundamental to it.<p>&gt; to see that most people can’t do it because it’s taught and tested poorly.<p>Or they just don&#x27;t want to learn it. Some people don&#x27;t like math. Or maybe people are lazy - they like it but can&#x27;t overcome procrastination to really learn it. Or they are more focused on something else, like I was as an adolescent (computers.) There are certainly people who got sick, or went on vacation during that week of school, etc.<p>My point is, we always like to blame things that aren&#x27;t actionable, i.e. &quot;the system.&quot; It was just &quot;taught poorly.&quot; There are certainly cases of that being the truth, but if you look at the time constraints and all other details, it&#x27;s hard to just blame the system. How do you actually fix the system?')
