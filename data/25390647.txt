Many claimed Russian interference, many claimed that James Comey put his thumb on the scale, many claimed that the media provided Trump with a great deal of free media and that the mainstream media were easily whipped up with anti-Clinton stories, many claimed that the sitting administration erred in not publicizing known associations between high-level Trump campaign operatives and Russian agents.<p>NO ONE claimed that the vote was illegitimate.  NO ONE claimed that the ballot boxes had been stuffed.  The 2016 vote was much closer than 2020 and still the party that lost accepted the result and even if they mumbled about &#x27;not my President&#x27; there was no one claiming that the election was stolen.<p>Please stop with the bullshit both-sides claims, it is pathetic.')
