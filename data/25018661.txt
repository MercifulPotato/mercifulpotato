The House made their case and the Senate disagreed. The same thing happens in real court (prosecution makes a case and jury disagrees). It absolutely should not be so easy that the house alone can remove the president with a simple majority.<p>&gt; Things like showing tax returns should be formalized.<p>Why? Anything really insidious isn’t going to be on a return anyway. And if it’s required for the President, why not literally every other government position?')
