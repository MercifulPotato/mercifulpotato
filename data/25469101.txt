This technique is applicable for so, so many applications - even when it doesn&#x27;t appear obvious at first.<p>Factoring out complex control system logic into these (and related) formalisms dramatically enhances testability, substantially reduces code volume, and eliminates huge swaths of possible defects (not to mention seriously enhances formal verification and model checking). The &quot;code&quot; part for applications should basically be for data plumbing, and all decision-making and control logic should be factored into these.<p>Thanks for posting this!!')
