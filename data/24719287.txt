Imagine a company like Apple being vulnerable to this extent. That&#x27;s why when people bring up a new privacy safe&#x2F;better UX alternative for a sensitive data service I am very skeptical to try them out. Like for email, fastmail or protonmail or Hey.<p>Data security is hard, I would rather trust someone who has shown good capability there, invests a lot in that and has more to lose. That&#x27;s why for the foreseeable future, I would rather use Gmail, Google Drive over their alternatives. Also, why I prefer to use Amazon instead of individual storefronts which ask for contact and payment details.')
