Lots of time in the woods. Built it up myself.<p>I&#x27;m super excited for electric off road vehicles, but when you&#x27;re way out there you really still need a gasoline engine. It&#x27;s just too convenient to store 100+ miles of fuel in ~60lbs strapped to the back of your truck, your friends truck, and every other person&#x27;s truck who you meet on the trail. On a longer trip it&#x27;s easy to be a day or more from fuel (because the roads are bad, and average speed is very low)<p>Torque from 0 and independent control of each motor is going to be a game changer. Add in new suspension possibilities when you don&#x27;t have differentials and axles (hub motors?) and next-gen trucks could be extremely capable. If we can figure out the range&#x2F;refueling problem (...and I don&#x27;t think we can for 10+ more years for this use-case)<p>I think folks are getting confused about &#x27;off road&#x27; in the comments here. Image search &#x27;4x4 rock climbing&#x27; - that&#x27;s the stuff many trails have short (or long) sections of. Add in the isolation, constant use of aircon or heat (or both), high power demands to go very short distances, and electric just won&#x27;t do it right now. We need better batteries or some way of producing electricity from liquid fuels.')
