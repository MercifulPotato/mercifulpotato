I would absolutely choose a pharmacy over another as a result of them having something to help through that process, especially when I have a headache.<p>You&#x27;re making a similar mistake to OP. You&#x27;re considering the end user, the pharmacy, but are now ignoring manufacturers, suppliers and wholesalers. Why would a major supplier provide their goods to a pharmacy who ranks them last in their kiosks? Why wouldn&#x27;t they give preferential pricing to pharmacists that give better rankings?<p>Perhaps large chain pharmacists have buying power here, but they don&#x27;t need help attracting customers. Perhaps small pharmacists could benefit from this system to attract customers, but if the system ranks Pfizer products last they wont be in business for long.<p>Point is, perhaps you want it, and perhaps you think pharmacists should want it for you, but the entire supply chain does not want it.')
