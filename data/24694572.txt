How can you do any kind of change control (unless you treat <i>every</i> edit to the sheet as a change)? Excel does some things well but for anything that needs to work robustly as part of a process (as opposed to one-time exploratory data analysis) it lacks things that were basic in 1996. It&#x27;s an &quot;unsafe at any speed&quot; situation: it may work as long as you do everything right, but it&#x27;s missing basic safeguards as soon as you make a single mistake; I&#x27;d put it in the same category as using a memory-unsafe language.')
