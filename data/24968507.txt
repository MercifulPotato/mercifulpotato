The fact that deepfakes will exist will erode confidence in even those things that are true. At the same time it will add additional fake situations to the conversation.<p>Worst part is that eventually even the AI-powered counter measures are going to fail eventually. The moment a computer knows what gives away a hint that it is a deepfakes and not real, a computer can solve to not present that give away. The “good guys” and “bad guys” will iterate with each other until it is perfected.')
