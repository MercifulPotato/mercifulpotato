One team decided that they wanted to use chalice and build custom bash scripts to deploy parts of the system out. (chalice would perform the deployment of apigateway, and get the required IAM policies built out. For all other resources they would use terraform, but they broke it down on a per-resource bases, rather than accepting changes to all the infra in 1 go, there would be a script that runs each resource type independently; buckets, tables, service-accounts, elasticsearch....<p>The current team does their deployments in 2 stages, first the use chalice to generate the correct terraform files for the 2 lambda&#x27;s that are deployed one the indexer, the other the service api, then the generate all the other terraform json files using python. After this is complete the infra is deployed in 1 step.<p>The second team has way less errors on deployment, and managing the infra is way easier, esp if you need to nuke it all and rebuild an environment.<p>I would break out the terraform backend on a per-environment basis rather than clumping them into folder&#x2F;bucket, that can be dangerous if the bucket gets emptied.')
