Item(by='eagsalazar2', descendants=None, kids=[24859113, 24859162, 24859108, 24859079], score=None, time=1603380359, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24858829, text='I agree with everything you&#x27;ve said but it makes me wonder, who is buying these things?  I remember seeing an H2 (in 2005 or so) with a custom license plate that proudly read &quot;5mpg&quot; which sums up the ethos IMO and still angers me to this day. I think a lot of people, like me, feel like the Hummer brand is poisonously associated with many things we don&#x27;t believe in to the point where I would never consider buying one.<p>On the other hand, I can&#x27;t imagine their prev base of the flamboyantly anti-liberal is going to be excited about an EV either.  So are all their new buyers those sheepish in-the-middle people who don&#x27;t care that much about the gross brand and always wanted to buy a Hummer themselves but were too embarrassed??  Seems like an odd niche to focus on.<p>Anyway I&#x27;m confused about the marketability of this product unless they openly disavow and almost apologize for their previously brazen&#x2F;gas guzzling&#x2F;tree-hating positioning.  That they&#x27;ve sold out the first year means nothing without knowing the volumes involved.  My gut tells me this isn&#x27;t actually going to be a big seller and unlike you I don&#x27;t imagine their intentions are laudable.  More likely this is a callous and misguided resurrection of a dead and vile brand and they aren&#x27;t even thinking about that history and their culpability in perpetuating the associated culture.')
