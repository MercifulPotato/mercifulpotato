Not everyone has pride in their work, in their person, or in their actions.<p>I once worked with one of these &quot;good enough&quot; people.  He bought his wife the cheapest things because they were &quot;good enough.&quot;  All he was focused on was the ticket price.  Not the quality.  Not the workmanship.  Not going with a good company instead of a bad company.<p>It&#x27;s become more common these days in everything from consumer goods to personal behavior.  There was an article in the newspaper yesterday saying that sales of Folger&#x27;s Crystals is up 14%.  It&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot; coffee.  There&#x27;s a congressman up for re-election right now who admits to having an affair with an intern.  His campaign doesn&#x27;t hide this fact that would have made him un-electable ten years ago.  His behavior is &quot;good enough.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s like all the Facebook and Google employees who are working on things that make the world a worse place.  They&#x27;re making money, so that&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot; for them.  Someone else can be moral.')
