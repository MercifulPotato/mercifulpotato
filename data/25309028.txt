Item(by='samizdis', descendants=None, kids=[25309092], score=None, time=1607120469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25307167, text='This topic, over the past couple of days, seems to me to have become fraught, polarised and argued to distraction and faction.<p>It&#x27;s not a stretch to say that the world has a problem with discrimination, or that big personalities can rock the boat when they go against the grain. Or that corporates have interests to defend.<p>I&#x27;d like in this case, though - not to say that all the other factors aren&#x27;t worthy of examination as subjects in their own right - to see this paper. The authors&#x2F;collaborators are leaders in the field. There are legitimate concerns about AI&#x2F;ML; the validity&#x2F;reliability of data from which, nowadays, consequential outcomes are derived.<p>Please, let&#x27;s ignore - at least for now - the corporate politics, the heat of the race&#x2F;gender politics, the PR machines weighing in (look at all the news outlets grabbing this atm), and take a look at what the paper says. The right people (those in the field and qualified&#x2F;able to do so) should be listened to.<p>As for the politics of this, and the posturing and politicising and agenda-building on all sides: that doesn&#x27;t help.<p>AI and ML affect us all now. This is a trend. Let&#x27;s at least expose the findings of acknowledged leaders in the field - let&#x27;s see this study - before we descend into the sideshows of politics and factionalism. Please.<p>Edit to clarify: tl;dr - I&#x27;ve not seen&#x2F;read this contested paper. Whatever its contents, I want to see them, and imo that is more important than the current controversy blizzard etc.')
