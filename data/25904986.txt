Sugar tastes &quot;good&quot; to everyone for fairly well established biological reasons, but when someone has been educated on the identification of finer tastes and to enjoy them-  they will reject sugary food for something more nuanced and varied.

Wine pricing, particularly among the highly competitive world of home retail wine selections (how much will someone part with for a &quot;nice bottle of evening wine&quot;) where most sell at say, $10 but the best price to performance is around the $22 mark. With particularly nuanced and hard to produce wine tastes ganering the high costs. Not literal comparative &quot;good taste&quot;')
