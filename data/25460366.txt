The idea seems to be to throw off EM at a sufficiently high frequency that you get around Planck&#x27;s constant and none of the local matter is allowed to &quot;relax&quot; and interact.<p>Which sounds great in theory but then you realize that your local matter might be things like electrons and thus currents which are what you need to throw off that EM.<p>So while in theory it might work if you could find things that can move faster than they&#x27;re allowed to, we don&#x27;t really know how to do that just yet.  Or so it seems to me.')
