This is where Linux really outshines Windows. I can configure a Linux installer with all my favorite software integrated, user accounts, configurations, etcâ€”but with Windows I essentially have to install Windows, install my apps (leaving tons of randomly scattered files and registry entries all over the system), and then sysprep the WIM.<p>The unattended setup on Windows is very confusing, there are like 3 different ways and 6 steps to configure, and the tools are mostly designed with GUI in mind. Could you imagine being able to configure, install drivers and apps using a single YAML file for Windows?')
