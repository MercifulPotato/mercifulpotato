There&#x27;s three things that are usually suggested which might help you, that you&#x27;ve touched upon.<p>First, you should have a dedicated work space. A room is preferable, but you can make do by erecting sight barriers to your desk for example. The main idea is to make it easy to leave your work &#x27;at work&#x27; and not be reminded of it in your free time.<p>Second, clothing. If you feel your day lacks structure make sure you&#x27;re not lounging about in a tracksuit all day. Put on clothes you would wear to the office before work, and take them off at the end of your day. Wear shoes.<p>Third, take a walk before starting work and afterwards. A 20 minute walk will allow you to plan the day ahead and get in work mode, and will let you unpack the day and unwind after work. Ignore the rain.<p>So basically, make going to work a ritual (as foolish or unlikely to work as it may sound). You should also minimise distractions and control impulses to do non-work related things while &#x27;at work&#x27;. If you can, consider getting out of the house for lunch or eat at your desk and not at the dinner table. Lastly, take part or try to instigate remote water cooler chats with colleagues to keep sane.')
