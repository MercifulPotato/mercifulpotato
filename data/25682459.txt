It was back in 2013 when they were new. Everyone was going &quot;whoa, your encryption is weird&quot; and they were defending themselves by saying &quot;we have 6 world champion programmers&quot;.<p>Anyways, something like 6 months after launch a Russian guy found that they were seeding their secret chat keys with entropy from the server, meaning the server could trivially MITM any secret chat. Pretty embarrassing.<p>Iirc it got quite little publicity since most of the discussion was in Russian, and the disclosure was in a forum post in an obscure forum.')
