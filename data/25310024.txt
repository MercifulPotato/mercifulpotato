This ETF covers some of Plug Power, Meridian Energy, Emphase Energy, and other companies that produce energy from renewable sources.<p>One thing I like about it is that it is a basket of products - 100 shares of ICLN is spread across the industry.  100 shares of Tesla stock would cost about $60,000 and all be in one company.<p>I am not looking for fantastic returns, I just have money sitting in the bank and figure I could have it sitting in stocks, bonds or whatnot from companies connected with renewable energy.  If I keep up with inflation I will be happy, if I make more than that, it is gravy (I just bought ICLN - it went up 98% in the past six months, but if it keeps pace with inflation over the next few years that is fine by me).')
