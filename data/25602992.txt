There is a truth they must tell, legally and also the stuff that gets clicks and views is true for it&#x27;s audience in a salient way.<p>Authority has the power to control, it&#x27;s part of the job description and politics resolves the truth of that domain.<p>Why do you want something &#x27;more powerful&#x27; than truth? You just excised yourself from philosophy, religion, god, law, ect in dismissing truth.<p>We all want &#x27;true&#x27; love anyway so the distinction is poor.')
