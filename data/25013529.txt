The market eventually rejected even the soft-lockin of nonstandard memory cards (think of the 12 slots nobody ever uses that come with every SD&#x2F;CompactFlash reader)<p>I&#x27;m not even sure it was the first wave of digital cameras that did them in-- people bought boatloads of digital Kodaks in the 2000s.  I recall they were very big on dock ecosystems-- drop the camera on a base to charge it, and I think they had some printer docks.  That should have helped to differentiate them from cheap Olympus&#x2F;Nikon&#x2F;Canon&#x2F;etc. point-and-shoot cameras.<p>Yeah, there wasn&#x27;t the residual income but there was a fair bit of an upgrade cycle for a few years to make up for it, which could have bought them time to find a solid place in the market.<p>I think the problem was the second wave: the point-and-shoot consumer camera disappeared (outside of novelties like Instax).  After 2015 or so, you&#x27;re either looking at interchangeable lens systems or other prosumer&#x2F;pro-level kit, or you&#x27;re using a phone.  Kodak never made much of an inroad in the pro-level digital market, and I&#x27;m not sure they had a business adaptable to cameraphone sales-- I don&#x27;t think they made their own sensors or optics, so a licensing or subcontracting business would have nothing to offer.')
