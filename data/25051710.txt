But I just don&#x27;t feel like the internet is exciting and interesting anymore. Maybe it&#x27;s social media as a whole that bores me, but even blogs and websites seem full of useless information to me now, and playing games or watching silly videos just doesn&#x27;t excite me anymore.<p>I ask this question here on HN, but I suspect that people who are bored with the internet may not be on the internet to share their opinion anyway. That said, HN community has been very diverse, and maybe you are in my stage where you&#x27;re bored with the internet, yet you lurk on HN still, in which case, I&#x27;d appreciate your 2 cents on the causes of this.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m also a bit worried that this might indicate an unknown depression. I&#x27;m 28 and shouldn&#x27;t feel like this now.')
