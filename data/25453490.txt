If you analyse the structure of the site (link below), ~800KB of the 4.4MB uncompressed homepage is images. 1.3MB is JavaScript, another 1.2MB is HTML (how is that even possible?)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gtmetrix.com&#x2F;reports&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;xSnIUn3X&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gtmetrix.com&#x2F;reports&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;xSnIUn3X&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; And why is 512KB acceptable but 4MB a problem?<p>Um, because it&#x27;s an 8th of the size and there are still many people in the world that don&#x27;t have fast internet access.<p>&gt; A few bytes of bad JavaScript can mess up your site&#x27;s performance, while several well-optimized MBs can make it accessible and useful.<p>Agree with the JS, but not the images. Well omptimised imaged should hit multiple megabytes unless its some kind of gallery with many images. Using srcset to load resized images is a much better way of doing this.')
