Item(by='sails', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602159232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707407, text='Late to this but I&#x27;ve owned 2 Leatherman Waves and will continue to own them as long as they are produced. \nI&#x27;ve lost one, and the second purchase included having the tool replaced for free after 5 years when I&#x27;d ruined most of the features due to hard use. This was a mix of &#x27;professional&#x27; and hobby use.<p>This brings to mind some considerations for you:<p>1. Professional tier tools are often much hardier than consumer, and often a pro tool would last a lifetime for a consumer user, but only a few cycles professionally<p>2. Warranty and replacement is very important here. Example is Osprey who _had_ an incredible no questions replacement, but they&#x27;ve changed it while keeping the &quot;all-mighty-guarantee&quot; name.<p>Elements to consider. I&#x27;ll try add a Leatherman review.')
