They can count the ballots internally, but such numbers are segregated from the official count and get added later (if at all).<p>I can say that <i>Republican observers and lawyers</i> on the ground in PA confirm that the official numbers do not include segregated numbers. If they did, Biden&#x27;s lead wouldn&#x27;t even be close. They would have called PA for Biden on Wednesday.<p>If you choose not to believe the GOP&#x27;s own observers and lawyers, that&#x27;s your choice, but I&#x27;m not going to indulge in your conspiracy fantasies.')
