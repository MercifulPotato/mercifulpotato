What they owe you aren&#x27;t the banknotes, but instead the money.<p>Also note when you deposit money into a bank, it&#x27;s not treated the same way as if you put banknotes in a safe deposit box. The way you made your argument on stock brokers is as if it is, and fundamentally misrepresents this relationship. They don&#x27;t owe you &#x27;your&#x27; shares, they owe you a number of shares. Your shares become their asset, in exchange for their liability to you. You don&#x27;t get to control what they do with their assets.<p>That&#x27;s also the reason you don&#x27;t get to control what the bank does with &#x27;your&#x27; money you hold with them, because legally, it&#x27;s their money with an obligation to pay you when requested. Hence the central bank steps in to regulate and guarantee fractional reserve banking in order to prevent bank runs.')
