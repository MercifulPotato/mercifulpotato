If I use a custom kernel (that&#x27;s optimized to run the JVM and has filesystem and block storage optimizations for ES), do I have to provide the source for that? (It seems trivial that it&#x27;s not &quot;management&quot;, but naturally Elastic&#x27;s interest lies in arguing that yes, that are covered under management layers too.)')
