Sounds like some fee that&#x27;s peculiar to US banking environment (which I have heard is extraordinarily bureaucratic).<p>KYC stands for Know Your Customer, basically anti-money laundering regulations. Banks need to have a decent grasp on whether or not the money they&#x27;re working with was &quot;earned&quot; legitimately.<p>&gt;Is this a feature? Don&#x27;t we as a society want a way to control e.g. drug lords and tax evaders moving their money around?<p>See above :)<p>Disclaimer: I think cryptocurrencies are a spillover from a couple decades of inflationary monetary policy from the fed causing people to seek yield in more and more esoteric forms. I also think they&#x27;re stupid.')
