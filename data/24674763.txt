Pettis&#x27;s basic thesis is that there is a global savings glut driven by wealth inequality (Rich people save and invest; poor people spend andconsume). The USD is the global reserve currency because America is the safest investment in the world; and America is the safest investment in the world because the USD is the global reserve currency. An excess of savings from China and Germany ends up flooding into America, whatever the latest news on negative interest rates. Capital flows are not determined by the search for highest return as in econ textbooks but by searching for security and often by attempting to build currency reserves. America&#x27;s trade deficit is driven by capital inflows (mainly European and Chinese savings), unlike the typically assumed situation where capital flows respond to trade.<p>Thus, tariffs=attacking the symptoms not the disease. The goal of a tariff is to force up domestic savings by raising import prices. Domestic savings in America are being crowded out by capital inflows, so the result would just be increased debt or unemployment.')
