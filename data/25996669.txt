If you can afford the upfront costs for that, it&#x27;s probably cheaper in the long run. IIRC, part of the motivation for Roblox&#x27;s IPO was to raise funds to setup their own hosting infrastructure to lower costs, because AWS was too expensive.<p>And if you&#x27;re making a single-player game, or a p2p multiplayer game, then you&#x27;d only need AWS for matchmaking servers and maybe some other simple accounts&#x2F;databases, or like S3 to distribute content files.<p>So while it is a stupid decision on paper to lock yourself into a single vendor, I think it could work out in a lot of cases. It might even be cheaper than Unreal, which takes a 5% cut, as long as Amazon doesn&#x27;t decide to exploit their relationship with you.')
