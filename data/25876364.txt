Driving habits, mood, and behavior have more of an impact on the range than anything else.<p>I have a 2015 with a heat pump, heated seats, and heated steering wheel so it takes very little to get comfortable. And it gets comfortable about 15 minutes faster than my old 2007 Honda Accord did.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for the 2nd Gen models but the 1st Gen models with the Sat Nav infotainment have a power monitor screen that shows how much power systems are drawing and how much range you gain when shutting them down.  I&#x27;ve never seen a gain of more than 5 miles when 100% charged, it&#x27;s usually 2 miles.  Only one time have I been in a situation where that mattered and it was entirely my own fault.<p>Another thing to consider is, that unless your commute consumes the entire range of the vehicle then it doesn&#x27;t really matter as long as you can charge every night.  I use to have a 50 mile round trip commute and I would charge on a regular 120v circuit every night when I got home, I never had issues.  If I needed to run an errand I could plug the car in at work and come out with 100% charge at the end of the day.')
