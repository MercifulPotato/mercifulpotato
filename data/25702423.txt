I was looking for beta users right as my family abruptly moved to a new city. I haven&#x27;t made time to touch it since. It essentially went from close-to-baked to mothballed. I&#x27;ll share it here with the caveat that it does not actually work at the moment due to an AppleScript-related error. If there&#x27;s enough interest in the idea, I&#x27;ll find time to look into that!')
