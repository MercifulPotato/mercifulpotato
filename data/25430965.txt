Only issues I&#x27;ve had have been with sed on Mac vs Linux. And I&#x27;ve written thousands of lines with lots of logic, generally breaking statements that become nested into separate functions. Sometimes some things become too complicated for Bash, like parsing JSON, in which case I prefer to break out and call a Python or Node script instead of wrapping my head around jq.<p>But my scripts are also either for personal use, or for internal use (5 person team) at work, so I know who will be running the scripts, why, and where (which OS&#x2F;versions). Suppose it&#x27;s a bit like developing for Apple where you can remain aware of the use (and edge) cases.')
