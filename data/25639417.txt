I&#x27;ve never heard of using Retinex in the context of dithering, and wondering what specifically you mean by Retinex-&quot;like&quot;?<p>I&#x27;m also really curious what contexts this has been most successful in. E.g. was it used for dithering in images or games back in the 1990&#x27;s when we were limited to 16-bit or 256-bit color? Or is this something more recently explored in academia or in some niche imaging applications?')
