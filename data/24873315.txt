The founders were great folk who invested a lot into the tech&#x2F;startup scene in the city. They also invested in their employees and into me. Without them, I wouldn&#x27;t have had the head-start that I did. I&#x27;m not suggesting that companies should be compelled to behave like this. I am saying that there&#x27;s at least <i>some</i> social&#x2F;ethical&#x2F;civic responsibility a company has towards its employees.<p>If you&#x27;ve hired someone and they aren&#x27;t doing a good enough job, it&#x27;s in both of your best interests for that person to be trained and supported appropriately to help them improve. If they still aren&#x27;t up to the job you should part ways but at least you&#x27;ve both tried to make it work. Employers and employees cooperating in the pursuit of aligned interests like this has nothing to do with control. Independently deciding what&#x27;s good for people and how they will best learn sounds like it has a lot to do with control but that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re suggesting, not me.<p>I do agree that failure can sometimes be a great teacher. In my experience, the best work happens in places where it&#x27;s acceptable to fail and where failures can be recovered from. Safety nets exist to allow for more risk and more failure, not less.')
