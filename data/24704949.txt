The safety of nuclear depends of governments 50-100+ years in the future continuing to maintain and provide for the upkeep of the facilities. If they won&#x27;t even do it now how the hell can we expect them to do it continuously for 100+ years?<p>It&#x27;s absolutely insane to me that people on this site can be so distrustful of government when it comes to things like privacy&#x2F;encryption&#x2F;etc, and so trustful for things like continuing to provide funding for maintenance of nuclear facilities, especially given current governments have proven themselves undeserving of trust in either regard.')
