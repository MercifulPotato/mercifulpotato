The early days of the web had a bit of &#x27;build it and they will come&#x27;- if you had something interesting it would eventually get seen and linked to. Now you have to &#x27;pay to play&#x27;. There are numerous stats about how much % per dollar goes to Facebook and Google when advertising. If you don&#x27;t pay, you&#x27;re much, much less likely to be seen.<p>The platforms are in a position of power and perhaps regulation can curtail that power. We are essentially looking at the information on the web via a lens that the platforms and their algos provide, and there aren&#x27;t that many dominant platforms to provide the number of perspectives we perhaps need.<p>It&#x27;s easier than ever to get content online thanks to the likes of Wordpress, but harder than ever to get people to see it.<p>Most webmasters who have an inkling of some information about SEO are too scared to link out in fear of receiving a penalty from Google.
