The rest want <i>one</i> of the smaller brands, something that seems <i>different</i> from the mainstream (even if it&#x27;s really barely skin deep). That has kept quite a few big players in the automotive marketplace, and despite consolidation over time, there&#x27;s still variety, which buyers want. This argument really only addresses them as a car maker, though... and not at all for their spread across industry lines.')
