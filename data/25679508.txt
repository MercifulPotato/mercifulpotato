I think I did see that before but as an American English speaker, I didn&#x27;t feel the connotation that strongly. I&#x27;ll genuinely keep that in mind and think about that. I wonder others here feel the same. I hear it more often for gears, physics, programming, or synonym for pairs or couple. Maybe it connotes to mating more in biology contexts or maybe British English?')
