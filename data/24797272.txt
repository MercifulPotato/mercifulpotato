Ostracism for the purpose of social thought control is perverse, tyrannical, and disturbing on every level. I&#x27;m amazed at how OP could in one sentence complain about the rise of extremism and by the end of the paragraph prescribe an extreme form of human torture to solve it.<p>I reckon people who reason like this probably think &quot;extremism&quot; is some concretely defined thing rather than a subjective thing that depends on the culture, the time, and the place.')
