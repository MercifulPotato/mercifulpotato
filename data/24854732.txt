It may not be tangible to you but your work is occupying my mind and you&#x27;re getting some of my best thoughts.<p>We need business culture and labor laws to shift to support this, the issue is, the intangible nature of it makes businesses cringe because it&#x27;s difficult to quantity and know they&#x27;re not being cheated, yet they sell the very same intangibles to consumers regularly set at arbitrary price points and that&#x27;s perfectly fine.')
