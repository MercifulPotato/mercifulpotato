No days off or vacations. Their farms might be worth millions, but it&#x27;s also both their home and their job.<p>Also, a lot of people don&#x27;t get that a farm (anything other than subsistence farming) is a business. It requires careful long term planning, crop rotation, dealing with buyers, collectives, auctions, risk mitigation and pricing. The farmers I know are all extremely proficient with spreadsheet software and most of them attended the Agricultural University two towns from here. Farmers are often regarded as a bit simplistic country boys, but the opposite is true.<p>I don&#x27;t envy them.')
