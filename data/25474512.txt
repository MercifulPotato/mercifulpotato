Thanks for explaining it from your perspective. As much as you were personally influenced by the people surrounding you - it was probably the exact same dynamic, but opposite (the people around me taught me was that academia was a debt-trap or a luxury for elites who didn&#x27;t want to be demeaned by real jobs) and that is likely the source of my bewilderment and even low-grade bias against the field as a whole. I can see how if you are someone who respects academics, and listened to respected academics (who necessarily experienced success) - how that would lead you down a totally different path. Seems similar to what I hear about people who try to get into acting in Hollywood - they always listen to the people who make it.<p>Feel you about unionizing though. I&#x27;m in the southern US, and we don&#x27;t see a lot success here. Still, I&#x27;m an IWW member, and my local hospital just successfully unionized a few months back - so it&#x27;s something I do truly believe is worth continuing to fight for.')
