It suggests there <i>may</i> have been inappropriate use, without offering any actual evidence of inappropriate use.<p>If the word of privacy advocates is going to be taken seriously, they really need to back their claims with evidence.  Without evidence, those who don&#x27;t care about privacy won&#x27;t be swayed.  Worse yet, they run the risk of being seen as paranoid and ignored altogether.')
