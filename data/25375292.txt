Rolling and non-rolling. You can either always stay in the rolling state for Desktop and non-critical application or, get to the bandwagon early and end-up with stable release eventually.<p>To keep on rolling, you can use the keywords (stable, testing, unstable) in sources or use release names to stop rolling when something releases (buster, stretch, etc.).<p>The nice thing about using release names is the <i>annealing</i> effect during development. First major version bumps stop (feature freeze). Then minor version bumps stop (RC state &#x2F; full freeze). Then one day you read that Debian is released. Congrats! A last apt-get and you&#x27;ve arrived in stable.')
