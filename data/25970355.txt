Item(by='syops', descendants=None, kids=[25971020], score=None, time=1612024045, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969414, text='I agree I should have used &quot;valid&quot; when I used &quot;sound&quot;.  I also clarified what I meant by &quot;logically sound&quot;.  I further stated that I was using <i>my</i> parlance when I used &quot;logically sound&quot;.<p>What is interesting is that the responses to me have been about the meaning of <i>sound argument</i> and I never used this phrase. I used <i>logically sound</i>.  Do you personally think <i>logically sound</i> and <i>sound argument</i> mean the same thing?  I&#x27;m asking out of curiosity.<p>EDIT:  Private languages and the acknowledgement of them is not useless.  It&#x27;s a basis for being able to clarify things without a discussion devolving arguments over definitions of words. We all have slightly different ideas of what certain words mean.')
