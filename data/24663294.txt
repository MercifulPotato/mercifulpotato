Notably, for locales that use &#x27;,&#x27; as decimal point excel uses semicolons as separators in both its &quot;C&quot;SV format and formulas.<p>What changed in last few version is that excel started to distinguish whether you are &quot;opening&quot; an CSV file (eg. by double clicking it) or &quot;importing&quot; it and the former tends to lead to various kinds of random breakage in presence of the aforementioned (mis-)feature.')
