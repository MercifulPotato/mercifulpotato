I have found a surprising benefit in my coding to &quot;coming to know&quot; things about library APIs and projects through mental &quot;muscle memory&quot;.  For instance, by not relying on a file browser or even a fuzzy finder, I eventually come to learn where certain files probably are... and the probability goes up the longer I am in the code base.  Similar for lib APIs; although my vim session may be on a remote machine via xterm, that doesn&#x27;t prevent me from having a local browser window open and reading API docs to find what I need often helps me understand the library better.')
