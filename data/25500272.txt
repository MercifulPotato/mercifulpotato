I was missing a &#x27;1&#x2F;2&#x27; that you have to multiply the entire product of the coins by.<p>-------- old comment enumerating all possibilities:<p>You can see the example is correct by enumerating all possibilities. For coins with a 75% bias, you can represent the possible outcomes by &quot;HHHT&quot;. Which means the set of possible outcomes for 2 such coins is:<p>HHHT x HHHT =<p>HH HH HH HT<p>HH HH HH HT<p>HH HH HH HT<p>TH TH TH TT<p>That&#x27;s 10 instances of HH&#x2F;TT and 6 instances of HT&#x2F;TH, or a simulated coin with a 10&#x2F;16 chance of heads = 0.625 bias.<p>Two 80% coins looks like:<p>HHHHT x HHHHT<p>HH HH HH HH HT<p>HH HH HH HH HT<p>HH HH HH HH HT<p>HH HH HH HH HT<p>TH TH TH TH TT<p>Which results in 17&#x2F;25 outcomes as &#x27;heads&#x27;, or 68% bias for the simulated coin. Which supports the statement that mixing biased coins is always an improvement.')
