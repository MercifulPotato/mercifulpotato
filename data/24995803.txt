From a sustainability perspective beans&#x2F;wheat&#x2F;corn and to some extent potatoes are fairly easy to store, making them suitable for central&#x2F;slow processing. I don&#x27;t have numbers on this but my sense is that a lot of the resource usage of our agricultural system is due to perishables - food that needs to be cooled, that gets thrown away if no-one buys it on time, that&#x27;s easy to damage in transportation, and that has high water content (making it heavy to transport).')
