Siri is just way too slow on the Homepod. I typically use my phone and just manage what is playing that way, which is faster and has a better UI anyways.<p>If you mean playing something with minimal latency between your source and the speaker, that is just not going to happen with any sort of speaker over wireless. Airplay is pretty good in that regard, but you can never beat just plugging in a line out to a full fledged self powered speaker, like the KEF LS50s or LSX.')
