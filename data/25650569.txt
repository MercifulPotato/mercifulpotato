I tend to let them pursue (or not) their own interests so I just make resources  available to them.<p>It&#x27;s worth emphasizing to your child the distinction between &#x27;technology exposure&#x27; tutorials, and creative work as children tend to care more about making stuff and can find some tutorials a bit tedious. Luckily there are some high quality tutorials out there now, the mid-range and lower quality tutorials will just frustrate them.<p>Related to that, I would advise you to not let them enroll in any &#x27;technology&#x27; classes in school as that will kill their interest since the educators will likely be underwhelming.<p>Also, at a certain age, if you give them too much attention for their interests they will stop pursuing it, so enjoy the next few years :)')
