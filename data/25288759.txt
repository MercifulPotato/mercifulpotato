That means people providing services as a business will not be able to claim business expenses (with some exceptions) plus they will have to draw all revenue as a salary. This makes essentially running such service pointless. They will also have to pay employee and employer&#x27;s NI (without having any employment rights), that gives effective tax rate at around 54%. There will be awkward situation where engineers would work only half a year, to pay more reasonable tax or become an employee of agency. Coincidentally the share prices of Indian consultancies rocketed upon the announcement of IR35 going forward.')
