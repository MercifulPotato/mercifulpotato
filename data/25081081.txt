Taking it lightly or in defense of free speech blindly, is not prudent. I don&#x27;t believe we can or should ban divergent speech either, but maybe such people should make their own platform. Trying to make a rational argument when all they do is ridicule, insult and make hyperboles, making policy on feelings like abuse and threats, doesn&#x27;t lead to anything positive.<p>Democracy need a balance and spectrum, otherwise there&#x27;ll be a One Party System, and people will be rationalizing that too.<p>History shows us what happens when these sentiments leap out of control.')
