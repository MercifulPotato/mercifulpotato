You wouldn&#x27;t, for example, buy an X-Box controller and expect it to work with a Playstation.<p>On the other hand, the Oculus is not an accessory to Facebook it is a platform for playing games.<p>People had no problem with tying their Oculus to an account, to manage their purchases, etc.., but people do have a problem with being forced to have it tied to a social media account.<p>I would say the difference here is that when we create a social media account we know, to a degree, that we are making a Faustian pact to have our data harvested in exchange for <i>free</i> services. But the Oculus is actually purchased with real money so we don&#x27;t expect to have our privacy violated so the company can make even more money off us by harvesting our personal data.')
