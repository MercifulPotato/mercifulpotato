Republicans generally want to <i>de-regulate</i>, Democrats don&#x27;t. Republicans generally want the free market to work things out, Democrats generally want the government to work things out.<p>Each side has been taking turns and as a result, we have had the government prevent the free market from working things out. We want everyone to be able to get healthcare, but we don&#x27;t (or can&#x27;t) force anyone to pay for insurance. We effectively incentivize people to <i>not</i> get insurance until they are sick, then we force insurance companies to take them on when they&#x27;ve never paid into the system. Somebody has to pay for all of it, and it ain&#x27;t the government.')
