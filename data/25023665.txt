I am not sure how that could possibly be misinterpreted as such.<p>The example I gave, post 2016 election tax reform benefited said real constituencies. If you do not believe me, look back what threats were lobbed and by whom at republicans if they do not deliver to said constituency. It is not trickle down, but he with the gold makes the rules. And they -- the real constituency -- happen to pay the bills.<p>In that context, I am not sure I understand the point about &quot;wealthy people [don&#x27;t] comprise a majority of relevant party representatives&#x27; aggregate constituency&quot;. They don&#x27;t, but we don&#x27;t live in a democracy. In the best of times, assuming you subscribe to taking things as they are written, we are republic ( you know, protection from the tyranny of the majority ). At worst, we already past oligarchy.<p>So... what does trickle down have to do with anything?')
