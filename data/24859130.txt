Item(by='zests', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603380917, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24858663, text='Specifically, emacs is lacking up to date examples of how to do basic IDE functionality with emacs 27&#x2F;&#x2F;28 and 2020 versions of packages. I don&#x27;t think someone can build their own IDE without being an emacs intermediate and&#x2F;or already immersed in to the emacs community.<p>Can you find me an example of a modern emacs config that creates a barebones python editor that does code completion and isn&#x27;t significantly slower than jetbrains code completion? Most of what I can find is significantly out of date or just doesn&#x27;t work. If its not possible or easy to find some barebones skeleton to build off of, I think the editor as a whole is too difficult to be worth using.<p>I tried doom but got something slower than jetbrains that also didn&#x27;t work. I haven&#x27;t yet found the time to invest into debugging&#x2F;retrying. My next attempt will probably be me restarting, spending a few hours reading about how to use&#x2F;debug packages and also getting something that does not really work. Is this really worth it?')
