Webtransport isn’t trying to compete with webrtc. It’s a server&#x2F;client protocol not a p2p protocol. And it’s not designed with video conferencing in mind like webrtc is. Webtransport is trying to be a better alternative for websockets with support for h2&#x2F;h3 and unreliable delivery.<p>&gt; WebTransport assume a 100% browser world.<p>Webtransport should work anywhere that http is available. There’s nothing browser specific about it.')
