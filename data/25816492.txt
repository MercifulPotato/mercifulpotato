For any day and hour you pick, someone will be permanently excluded (because of e.g. their job, studies), and other people will miss it regularly due to irregular life events.<p>And ultimately, there&#x27;s no point in doing that if the activity itself doesn&#x27;t <i>require</i> for everyone to be doing something together.
