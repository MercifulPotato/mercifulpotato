There&#x27;s nothing wrong with encoding natural stopping points in your commit history, even when those natural stopping points don&#x27;t always align with semantic stopping points (features&#x2F;fixes&#x2F;completed tasks). Sometimes those natural stopping points even encode data you might miss later: sometimes in making that switch you also mentally switch tracks and looking at where you stopped and where you restarted sometimes can remind you of things you forgot in between. I&#x27;ve found debugging cases where that helped me solve problems. (That said, in practice I rarely keep such &quot;natural stop commits&quot; myself, but I&#x27;ve also never been strict about it and sometimes keep them. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with them and sometimes they are useful &quot;waterline&quot; markers in a larger effort.)')
