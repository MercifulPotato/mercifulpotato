We are on zoom. I&#x27;d love to get off.<p>Google Meet? - others on gsuite domains blocked from joining, rules around having accounts etc? We need background replacement or blur. I tried before and couldn&#x27;t really make it a success (and so confusing with hangouts, chat, talk, duo, allo etc). Background replacement not as good as zoom.<p>Uberconference - audio latency is worse - we&#x27;ve dialed down our use for conference calls.<p>Jitasa - I don&#x27;t see background replace on this?')
