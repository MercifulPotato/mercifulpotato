Retail investors are around 15% -- there are many index funds that are invested, perhaps they might be the last ones holding? Even so, I&#x27;ll be damned if I understand anything about this.<p>I think it&#x27;s interesting that &quot;accredited investors&quot; (e.g. 1MM in assets) can unionize to play in the stock market (e.g. hedge funds) but that the majority of Americans aren&#x27;t permitted to unionize due to SEC rules. They are stuck with index funds. It&#x27;s like we only allow top earners to be wolves and force everyone else to be sheep.')
