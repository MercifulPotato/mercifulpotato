Item(by='tdrp', descendants=None, kids=[24689537, 24688023], score=None, time=1601881447, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24685048, text='Thank for this discussion, it is really interesting to me!<p>The surgeon proposed what was probably the algorithmic way to fix the problem.<p>Given that the OP was having issues because of their heels, odds are that the surgery wouldn&#x27;t have entirely fixed it and now the ligaments would have been unnecessarily tampered with by a surgeon whose thought was &quot;we should totally reroute those ligaments that&#x27;ll do it&quot;. OP mentioned she was a marathon runner, athletic and in her early thirties - what? did her ligaments suddenly get into a state where they needed rerouting? OK sure but why, why now, etc. I feel like even a non-medical professional could have gotten closer after talking to her for twenty minutes.<p>I am not a doctor obviously, but I have been to some good doctors and the &quot;imperfect information&quot; can significantly be improved if they actually make a more clever, targeted effort to inquire, rather than just casually prescribing surgery or heavy medication. Good doctors will talk to you, actually tell you what the &quot;algorithm&quot; prescribes and often tell you why they think it is not the case here. The best way I can describe the difference is like talking to a customer support bot vs talking to a customer support person.<p>I realize this is probably extinct now here in the US because of litigation and insurance requirements but it&#x27;s still that way in many countries. I am certain that good, fluid doctors there beat the algorithmic approach hands down, whereas good doctors here may be capped and severely restrained by it.')
