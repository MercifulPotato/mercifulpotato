The US and the UK do the same thing but somehow aren&#x27;t banned by Facebook.<p>The UK even announced a few days ago that they were using a psyops unit to counter vaccination conspiracy theories. The same unit that was previously targeting the Islamic State.<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly how they operate but I&#x27;m pretty sure they run a large network of social media bots to influence people online.<p>Disclosure : I&#x27;m French so that might color my reaction a bit :)')
