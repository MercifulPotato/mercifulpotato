[1] That data is captured by the BLS.<p>&gt; By that definition Bitcoin is a neutral asset class as well since it&#x27;s deflationary nature is also artificially imposed.<p>Deflationary is not neutral, it’s deflationary. That’s an artificial imposition of directionality. Further that’s only in isolation. Once you consider the economy expanding and contracting around it, externalities, shocks and the addition and removal of market participants - and loss of coins - its claim to neutrality is like that of a baby fighting Muhammad Ali. It requires positive control to match market conditions. It’s only neutral if you pretend the rest of the world and the economy don’t exist.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;fee.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;new-homes-today-have-twice-the-square-feet-per-person-as-in-1973&#x2F;amp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;fee.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;new-homes-toda...</a>')
