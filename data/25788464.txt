I’m still on the fence about the value add compared to cost of implementation and accuracy. One reason I like sticking to MIDI only is that it’s much much easier to keep it consistently good (assuming underlying connection logic is sound). The margin for error is so low here, you just can’t have the tech getting in the way of the music is what I am putting my bets on. I’m worried that hand tracking will end up being months of effort for something that ends up being about 75% accurate. Number is completely made up but hopefully my point comes across :)<p>&gt; Have you tried concerting sound from a phone microphone to midi?<p>If you mean converting audio data to midi, I’ve thought about it and ran away quickly after haha. Whoever solves this problem to a high enough degree of accuracy to be useful will be sitting on something quite valuable. I have my goal posts set a bit lower at first, on things I am confident I can deliver to the public, but I plan to revisit this in the future :)')
