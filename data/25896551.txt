Item(by='ccfta_throwaway', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1611525373, title='Question about Anti-Dilution', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Let&#x27;s say that you have a captable with multiple share holders, divide to two groups: group A and group B. Now the company has decided to issue new shares. The decision was made to have these new share dilute the two groups differently: 25% of the shares will dilute group A, 75% of the shares will dilute group B.<p>There are two clear scenarios to do this:<p>One:\na. Issue 25% of the shares, perform anti-dilution for group B so they remain in the existing ownership %.\nb. Issue the remaining 75% of the shares, perform anti-dilution for group A so they remain in the existing ownership % as following step a.<p>or, two: \nthe exact opposite - first issue 75% and do anti-dilution, then 25% and anti-dilution.<p>My question is:\nDoes it matter in what order this is done? Whether it is as in scenario one or scenario two? Is one scenario better for Group A and another for Group B? Or is it exactly the same?<p>And a bonus question - can this be done in a more fair way? Perhaps, at the same time? Or use some other mechanism of anti-dilution (value based? something else) to make it more fair?<p>Thanks!')
