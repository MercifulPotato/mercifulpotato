The vibe I&#x27;ve gotten from following center-left journalism is that the alignment against Trump has come at a heavy cost to traditional liberal values when it so happens Trump touts them (whether he is intentionally or not is a different matter). Some things that come to mind are Glenn Greenwald&#x27;s writings re: the left&#x27;s fascination with the Russia conspiracy, and Matt Taibbi&#x27;s writings on Russia as well as some other social issues of late. Particularly (and probably because this is the overlap where Trump is the most &quot;liberal&quot;), the left seems to have seriously backed off their non-interventionist foreign policy desires as a direct result of Trump.')
