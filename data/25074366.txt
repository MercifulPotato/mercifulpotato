In my previous office, there was an entire group (about 100-150) of programmers whose job was incredibly rote. That is, you could take a novice out of college and get them up to speed in about 1-3 months to do even their most complex work.<p>However, the other groups were much less factory-ish, though rarely anything truly novel. Only a small cadre of programmers were working on anything that <i>really</i> required novelty and creativity.<p>It&#x27;s a spectrum and that has to be understood by all participants in the discussion. Managers want everything to be like that first group, because it&#x27;s so consistent and predictable. They want to know that a project will take 1000 man-hours and be right 95% of the time. Many programmers want to see themselves part of the last group. The reality is, most of us are in the middle. There are aspects of the job that are almost mechanical, and aspects which require greater creativity or &quot;craft&quot;. If we can clarify that for the managers, it can go a long way to ending some of the nonsense.')
