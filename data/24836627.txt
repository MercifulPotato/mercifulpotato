I don&#x27;t think it will be particularly bad for 7 Pi 4s to match with a E5-2670 v2 in anyway. You can also listen to [this guy](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;HUamq0ey8_M?t=797" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;HUamq0ey8_M?t=797</a>) for a briefing.<p>From my perspective its 4*7 = 28 weak ARM cores vs 8 strong x86 cores. You can see that ARM actually had more cores, giving it an advantage plus to parallelized workload compared to x86.<p>Hell, maybe we can mix them in a bunch so that x86 runs powerful applications like GitLab, Prometheus and Postgres while ARM runs massively parallel workload that GPUs can&#x27;t handle: Function as a Service (in AWS terms, Lambda; in CNCF&#x27;s term, OpenFaaS), Linkerd handler (service mesh needs some kind of scheduling though), microservice replicas.<p>In the end CPU are all going to have a designated purposes, despite it should have had been &quot;general purpose&quot;.')
