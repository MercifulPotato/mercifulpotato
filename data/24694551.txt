It&#x27;s not easy, but many grad students can come up with experiments that will lead to discoveries of new signaling pathways inside a cell. I&#x27;m sure someone has done a census of the number of pathways in their particular cell, but for all cells? It must be a gigantic number of proteins that interact.<p>And I&#x27;d hedge that we&#x27;re no where even close to knowing how they all interact')
