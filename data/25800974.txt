But, first listed higher power systems are depleted within minutes and require expense of other systems to &quot;recharge&quot; (supercapacitor analogy) vs. glucose &amp; fat oxidation can pretty much carry on constantly but are much lower power due to slower speed&#x2F;higher complexity of their pathways (rather than just a battery I&#x27;d say an analogy of renewable energy [glucose] + battery storage [lipids in adipose] is more suitable i.e. steady input of energy source = steady utilization&#x2F;output of work that can carry on pretty much constantly).<p>So, many systems can produce energy together&#x2F;in tandem in the cells, but the higher power systems once exhausted can force your body to temporarily cease high intensity activity to rest and recover. Glucose and fat oxidation don&#x27;t ever stop in that process, but in recovering those higher power systems your body prevents you from engaging in more high energy &quot;burst&quot; activities until those systems &quot;recharge&quot;.<p>Training can allow you to modify these higher power systems to last longer, and recover quicker, but there will always be a top end constraint where every person &quot;runs out of gas&quot; when performing continuous  high intensity&#x2F;exertion activity.')
