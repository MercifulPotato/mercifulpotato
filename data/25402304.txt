For EVs, SSBs seem pretty optimal. But you can ding them for using lithium (though it’s not as rare as detractors would suggest). If you’re trying to store power generated off peak until peak demand hours flow batteries using different technologies entirely probably make more sense. There are likely to be situations where even artificially generated chemical fuels make more sense than batteries. Then there’s the hydrogen option. Also no ones proven able to massively produce SSBs yet. Etc')
