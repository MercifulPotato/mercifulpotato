NoSQL databases (specifically, eventually consistent DBs) are only safe&#x2F;sane in specific scenarios.<p>If you don&#x27;t know what your needs are, you should <i>always</i> start with an RDBMS -- it&#x27;s not that difficult to go &quot;up&quot; to a NoSQL db from there (you&#x27;re only losing information, and if you can&#x27;t safely move because of loss of ACID... you&#x27;d probably have been really fucked if you started off without it), but you can&#x27;t easily migrate back &quot;down&quot; to the RDBMS -- a NoSQL database stores almost no information about your data or its constraints.<p>And your application will almost always want transactional guarantees and to model relationships properly -- generally only small chunks of the design (design-wise; data-wise it might be 90% of the app) can be treated with eventual consistency and have real scaling needs, which you can shift over to your nosql system.<p>Apps are generally just metadata tracking with a dash of real work.')
