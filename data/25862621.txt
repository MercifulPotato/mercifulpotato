We need to return to some amount of noalcy, and none of those measures are up to snuff. Literally everyone where I live wears a mask and distances, yet cases are sky high. Somehow my grandfather caught the virus despite his assisted living home despite them being so locked down that we haven&#x27;t been able to see him in person besides through a glass window.  Masks and distancing just spread the deaths out over time, but they aren&#x27;t a solution.<p>Believe it or not, some of us don&#x27;t like social distancing and mandatory masks in perpetuity. If we had spent more money on developing these kinds of vaccines years ago, we might not be in the situation we are in now. If you like being isolated then be my guest, but don&#x27;t be on a high horse about &quot;just&quot; wearing masks, and so forth at this point. We all get it. Yet people continue to get sick and die.')
