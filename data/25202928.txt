The women have to be selective because they don&#x27;t have time to engage with each of the hundreds of responses they get.<p>It might be interesting to run a dating service that limited signups to an even gender ratio.  Or at least didn&#x27;t let the imbalance grow more than a modest amount.  Of course then most men would complain that they can&#x27;t even sign up.
