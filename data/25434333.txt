Now, you have to edit policies.json to get updates stopped, autoconfig.js and firefox.cfg to disable telemetry, legacyUserProfileCustomizations to use userChrome.css to get anything like a proper menu system.<p>&#x27;Lockwise&#x27; has dumbed down the login system so much you can&#x27;t even change field names, making many sites incompatible. Nor can you import logins from file or even point to installations to import. The add-ons system is like traveling back in time ten years, bugs and fewer alternatives than ever, still can&#x27;t figure out how to stop Tree Style Tabs from stealing mouse focus from the page onmouseover like a widget. -And these are problems that were fixed before they were reinvented.<p>For the first time in 16 years I&#x27;m seriously trying alternatives.<p>-these were my views on 83, i hope to hell 84 fixes some of them.')
