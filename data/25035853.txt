Presumably this will be visible in a Github issue or something like that, since we&#x27;re talking about OSS and presumably open issue trackers.<p>FWIW I just went back and did some searching over the faker.js issues and I didn&#x27;t see any requests that seemed obviously corporate. (I picked faker.js because that article seems to be the most recent inspiration for this discussion on this site.) Most of the non-feature request issues were malformed or from people who obviously don&#x27;t know what they are doing, but the rest were bugs that could hit big corporate users or hobbyists alike. I didn&#x27;t see any request that looked like it came from someone working at a FAANG, although I guess it might be hard to tell. The overall number of feature requests filed during the repo&#x27;s history was only 15.')
