That being said, a point-blank shot will still treat belt armor like paper - and a max-range shot will go right through the deck. That&#x27;s because both the deck armor and belt rely heavily on angling - you get a lot more effectiveness for a given thickness of armor if your opponents are courteous enough to hit it at an angle.<p>Which means that the belt armor is most effective at max range (though also the least likely to be hit) - shells coming in at 45° will bounce right off. And deck armor is best up close - 5° down angle is going to come up against quite a few feet of metal before managing to penetrate the handful of inches of thickness you could fit in a deck.<p>The trick to an immunity zone is to find the balance between the two.')
