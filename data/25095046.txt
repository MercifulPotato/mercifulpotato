Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605383323, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25094057, text='&gt; I get the impression that it sucks to be an early employee at most startups,<p>Depends what you want.  I had a guy work for us at my first startup: he was employee #6 and once we got to about 13 or 15 he decided it was time to move on.  I was surprised, but he felt the business was just too big for him.  And indeed I&#x27;ve looked at his career over the ensuing years and he&#x27;s worked for some amazing companies...always just for a year or so and always when they were very tiny.  Sometimes I noticed he&#x27;d worked with the same people, so he wasn&#x27;t leaving because he was a poor performer (we missed him) but simply because that&#x27;s what he liked.')
