I guess there is multiple ways to remediate this: the filter could be used only as fallback if the primary service doesn&#x27;t work. And it could also be rotated regularly. It could be salted (ie. thousands of versions of the filter available) making it difficult to predict which one is going to be used. These are just couple silly ideas off the top of my head.')
