With 500kb&#x2F;page I could store everything in about 180 pages (90 if I print on both sides) which is not that much.<p>Since I store backup of these git repos in a ZFS dataset, I can do incremental backups (with zfs send -I) every 6 months or so. By my estimates, I would be adding at most 1-2 pages per year.<p>Also, it is not like I expect to ever need to read that back in. I also keep redundant backups of everything in multiple cloud providers and in external HDs. Using these papers would be a last resort if everything else fails.')
