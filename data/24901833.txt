Item(by='nostrademons', descendants=None, kids=[24902454, 24902254], score=None, time=1603748601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24901446, text='The inflation part is pretty key.  $M2 has grown from about $7T to $18T, so if anything, housing prices <i>have</i> tracked monetary inflation.  It&#x27;s just that the CPI has severely lagged monetary inflation, possibly because of cheap food prices, cheap oil, cheap microchips, and cheap goods from China.<p>There&#x27;s a macroeconomic story for that: with roughly 80 million Millenials (in the U.S; ~3B worldwide) reaching homebuying age and competing for a housing stock that&#x27;s not growing nearly as fast, the ability to buy a house moves up the income ladder, so that sellers can capture money from an increasingly wealthier homebuying population.  Meanwhile, those ~3B worldwide Millenials are entering working age, driving the price of labor (and hence of anything built with labor, including food and manufactured goods) down.  CPI of goods &amp; non-professional services goes down, price of assets goes up.<p>This demographic trend reverses itself in about 10-15 years as the comparatively tiny Gen-Z reaches homebuying age, but in the meantime there&#x27;ll be an even bigger pop as late Millenials (1990-1998) reach homebuying age and there are nowhere near enough homes for them all.  I&#x27;d also expect inflation to start showing up in the CPI as Gen-Z starts to make up the new workforce entrants, boomers start dying off, and hence the labor force shrinks and wages go up.')
