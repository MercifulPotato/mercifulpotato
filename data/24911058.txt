But realistically, that choice is not an option. Therefore, I&#x27;m at a disadvantage if I don&#x27;t use the most &quot;rewardy&quot; type of card available. The cost of these points&#x2F;rewards are priced in. So the only way to recapture that is to use a high reward card. It&#x27;s a sucky model, but we&#x27;re all caught in it and the folks paying with alternatives like cash are the ones holding the bag.')
