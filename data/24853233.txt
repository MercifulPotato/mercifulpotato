I completed a BA in Econ then ended up working in tech. I wanted to move into a full-time development role, so I made the decision to go back to school full-time for my BS in CompSci.<p>I&#x27;m happy that I made the decision that I did, but I had already been pretty heavy into self-learning for years before going back to school. I could see both approaches working, but I felt more comfortable getting my foot in the door as a developer with the degree.<p>Working full-time while working towards your CompSci degree sounds rough! I didn&#x27;t even try it.<p>Not sure how helpful that is for you, but I wish you the best of luck.')
