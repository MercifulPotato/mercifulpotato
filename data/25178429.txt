Manipulation of citizens is of all time. The danger lies in how precise the targeting nowadays is, together with internet being world-wide and advanced.<p>Its the price we all paid for <i>some</i> of us having a dishonest ML data hoarder.<p>I&#x27;m involved in the integrity of elections in The Netherlands. I have a political preference, but I am able to leave that out when I manually count votes.<p>I also am aware of ways which undermine our democracy: electronic voting, strategic voting, and abused ML.

In this case with the help of an American behemoth, but there is no reason other sources cannot be abused.<p>I don&#x27;t have the solution to this problem. It warrants further investigation though.
