I set it up today and we all enjoyed it. We noticed that it helps to jump forwards in the beginning until the cacti speed up, otherwise you&#x27;ll usually land on the cactus. It&#x27;s much harder to achieve a comparable score than on chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;dino though. The only obstacles are cacti in this version, but I think ducking under birds would be far too hard.')
