Item(by='Groxx', descendants=None, kids=[25499218], score=None, time=1608580407, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25495183, text='Lets say your company is valued at $100 and all stock is claimed for current employees.  Now you want to raise money by selling 50% of your company to investors.<p>So you create $100 more and now they own 50% (at $200 valuation).  This means the investors either over-paid (2x what they were worth!), or you were strongly under-valuing the stocks that existed before.<p>If you <i>dilute</i>, they get 50% at $50, and the existing stocks are now worth 50% their value.  Because you literally sold half the company.<p>---<p>The first is pretty obviously ridiculous.  Nobody would pay 2x the worth, that&#x27;s the <i>point</i> of deciding on a value.  If they paid 2x, it just means you didn&#x27;t <i>agree</i> on the value.<p>But if they don&#x27;t over-pay, it&#x27;s the same as the second: prior to the sale, your company&#x27;s value was <i>actually</i> $200 (you were just claiming otherwise), and after the sale your employees only have $100, i.e. half the company&#x27;s value.  Their stocks were still diluted.')
