Item(by='renewiltord', descendants=None, kids=[25706202, 25706496], score=None, time=1610233716, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25703614, text='Facial Recognition Tech is obviously good if used by competent people:<p>Narrows the number of haystacks to search for needle =&gt; Reduced resources required for successful search =&gt; More crimes prosecuted.<p>Problem occurs when:<p>* Users of FRT assume all in haystack are needles<p>* Crimes on book must not be universally prosecuted<p>The first part can&#x27;t be helped. US Police, like most US government jobs, is a rest-and-take-it-easy job. In aggregate, unexceptional people doing an unexceptional job. The second part is because people want other people prosecuted but not themselves.<p>I&#x27;m in second category myself. For instance, I am quite capable of using all sorts of drugs and maintaining a productive life. Other people are not. So it&#x27;s important to prosecute other people and not to prosecute me.<p>Therefore, for these two reasons, I don&#x27;t want FRT to be used universally. I want to preserve inequitable outcomes in policing because society is stronger with inequitable outcomes - permits good life for high percentile individuals and constrains operations for low percentile individuals. Demarcating crime from uncrime is Sorites paradox.')
