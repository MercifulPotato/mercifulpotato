You can imagine OP presenting to an audience of 14 people at Amazon Devices group with a slide titled &quot;New BOM proposal&quot; entailing 6 million devices x [$0.0273 (switch price at 100k qty) + $0.05 assembly cost] + $50k engineering NRE (650 engineering hours) + $35k tooling NRE + $22k FCC re-cert + 7k ESD cert + another $100k in various certifications from continental EU, JP, Australia, UK and Brazil.
