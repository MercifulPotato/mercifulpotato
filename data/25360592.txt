I don&#x27;t mean to be flippant (it was a long day).  understand that people who are mostly in the third case are angry and disappointed, but from what I&#x27;ve seen in talking to people both when Stream was launched and after this announcement, at least some large number who are worried that that&#x27;s their situation are going to be actually getting something better when the dust settles.')
