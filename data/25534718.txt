In fact, I even own two 80186 PCs! Siemens PC-Ds, not IBM but DOS compatible. Marvelous machines. They even have MMUs made of custom logic chips, so they could not only run DOS, but also SINIX with full address space separation and supervisor mode (though no paging)...<p>The non-compatible goodies of the 80186 play a big role in making it not IBM compatible, but other things as well. In many ways it was a bit better, e.g. high resolution (but monochrome) text and graphics, and no 640k barrier.<p>The 80376 is an interesting beast because it got rid of 16bit support entirely--any 16bit segment descriptors were invalid.')
