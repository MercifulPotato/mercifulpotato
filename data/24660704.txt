I think there are different motivations behind it, but from experience it seems to be a fact. Only happens if there is a critical amount of people that share these roots though, otherwise they seem to drop their culture almost completely.<p>In my country it is pretty common for Turks and Russians to live in separate communities if they are concentrated in an area, especially if that isn&#x27;t urban, but it can happen there too.<p>I believe the motivation can range from pride to a bad conscience of having better living conditions or a feeling of having left their former countrymen behind. And probably a lot of other reasons.')
