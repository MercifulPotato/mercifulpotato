They weigh up risks of mingling against protecting <i>someone else</i>, usually nobody in particular except some misleading caricatures, which is a much easier decision in favour of taking risks.<p>&gt; no human contacts<p>I have to wonder why people are living to that extreme.  Even in the most heavy lockdowns in the UK, it&#x27;s possible for people to have <i>some</i> human contacts.')
