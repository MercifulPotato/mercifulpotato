It&#x27;s not an intentional tradeoff between infrastructure and environmental protection, or between public development and property rights.  It&#x27;s just indecision, waste, and stagnation.<p>Every time a comparison to China&#x27;s infrastructure comes up, the knee jerk reaction is to point out that it&#x27;s an authoritarian regime so of course they can force through any infrastructure project they want.  Which is fair enough, but it drowns out any discussion asking &quot;Hey, CAN we do any better in the West than we are doing right now? Is what we have good enough?&quot;')
