Item(by='Tainnor', descendants=None, kids=[24814305], score=None, time=1602976600, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24812429, text='The &quot;English creole&quot; hypothesis has been discussed a lot and it is true that English is a bit special within Europe in having absorbed a lot of material from other languages such as French and Norse, but I still think that it is very recognisable as a Germanic language (both grammatically as well as from the perspective of &quot;core vocabulary&quot;), so I don&#x27;t think that the languages &quot;merged&quot; in the same way as this maybe happened in the case of some recognised creoles. (See e.g. here for a summary: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Middle_English_creole_hypothesis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Middle_English_creole_hypoth...</a>)<p>There is still no reason in principle why English couldn&#x27;t have chosen a more regular system of spelling, especially at a time where literacy was low anyway. The idea that the spelling is irregular because you have several competing systems (French vs. Anglo-Saxon vs. Norse) might sound compelling, but I don&#x27;t think it holds water, cf. homographs such as &quot;sow&quot; (female pig) and &quot;sow&quot; (to plant) which both have Old English origins.<p>(Also I don&#x27;t think that &quot;rendez-vous&quot; is a good example. I don&#x27;t have hard evidence, but I would find it entirely implausible that this is a word of Norman origin, it&#x27;s much more likely to be a late import from the 18th or 19th century, when French was fashionable, not at all comparable to something like &quot;pork&quot;.)')
