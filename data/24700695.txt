It&#x27;s definitely subjective.<p>The reason I reach for Postgres over MySQL isn&#x27;t features or technical superiority. Although those result from the reason. Which is, PG devs consistently have &quot;taste&quot;, they have &quot;good&quot; style. They make good choices. MySQL devs are not consistently strong in these areas.  I&#x27;m guessing that MySQL is now so full of tech and design debt (like OP issue) that they&#x27;re just stuck, without choice.')
