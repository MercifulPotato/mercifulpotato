Black people are ~20% of the population, but commit ~55% of the murders, making for a per capita murder offense rate among Black Americans that is ~5x (yes, 500%) of the rate for the remainder.<p>That said, people pay way too much attention to murder and violent crime in public discourse and in their private lives for the most part. Sure, Black people may murder at 5x the rate of non-Black people, but murder is really, really rare. What about we worry about, I dunno, diabetes? Education? Population growth? Climate change?')
