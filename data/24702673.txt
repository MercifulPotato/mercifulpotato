Last I checked, they required you to commit secrets to the repo you push, which necessitates your secrets being on whatever computer (or whoever&#x27;s computer) does production deploys. Contrast this with DO&#x2F;Heroku&#x2F;etc. which lets you set environment variables.<p>Some folks suggest using a DB to store secrets on GAE, but this is (IMO) just obfuscation.')
