For example, should the same be true of newspapers? What about scientific or government publications?<p>If people should be allowed to decide for themselves what is true, should private for-profit companies also be allowed to decide what is true for themselves?<p>Do you consider stories that are verifiably false to be &quot;unfiltered information&quot;? Why should it be considered &quot;information&quot; if it&#x27;s not true? Does it matter if the information being presented was known to be false and is being published for subversive politically motivated reasons?<p>Is your framing that they&#x27;re saying people are dumb really true if the &quot;information&quot; is difficult or impossible to verify? Does it matter if it&#x27;s a breaking story and there&#x27;s only one such source of information? Does it matter if, statistically, there&#x27;s a sizeable portion of smart people that will accept published stories as true?')
