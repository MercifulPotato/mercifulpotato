Yes, there is a tad more code, but you will also note that nothing is hiding. Un-nesting simply dumbs things down. Now, who wouldnâ€™t want that after hours of squinting at a screen?<p>People love to trot out the &quot;It&#x27;s more explicit, its a bit more code but isn&#x27;t it more READABLE&quot; argument about everything. I&#x27;ve heard this argument used to oppose information hiding while refactoring functions to be smaller.<p>And I would argue that &quot;readable&quot; is subjective, and that their argument is extremely weak. I love the pipeline operator and think it should be standard in every language.<p>Also, his &quot;Maybe&quot; variable becomes a pain to maintain when you have a pipeline of multiple functions.<p>edit: for bad formatting')
