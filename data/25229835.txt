It&#x27;s not like the whole essay is telling you to act in PGs interest. Basically you&#x27;re assuming selfishness because in one possible interpretation of one sentence, it&#x27;s possible for PG to derive any benefit at all. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even possible to write an essay where that&#x27;s not the case.')
