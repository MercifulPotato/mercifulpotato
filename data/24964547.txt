Item(by='pgcj_poster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604287146, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24963955, text='&gt; Nobody has ever implied that there is any intention behind most of this type of sexist behavior<p>Sexism is when men get together in a boardroom for a secret, fortnightly meeting where they smoke cigars and conspire to underpay women and leave the toilet seat up. Since you&#x27;re trans, you should have been invited either before or after your transition... but maybe your local chapter&#x27;s patriarch was just old-fashioned. Sorry about that. Anyway, since women don&#x27;t know about this, they often use the word &quot;sexism&quot; to refer to subtle behaviors of men that make it harder for women to get a leg up in society, but that&#x27;s incorrect. Something is only officially &quot;sexist&quot; if it&#x27;s received a 2&#x2F;3 majority vote of the brothers in a chapter and been consecrated over beer and football. So when you say something is sexist when it hasn&#x27;t gone through the proper channels, it&#x27;s no surprise when men get confused or defensive.<p>Also, you&#x27;re getting downvoted because the Hacker News Guidelines require that you &quot;eschew flamebait,&quot; such as mentioning how your views were shaped as member of a minority group whose rights are considered a matter of opinion.')
