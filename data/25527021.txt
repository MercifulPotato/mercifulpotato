The &quot;glass half full&#x2F;empty&quot; metaphor expresses that difference quite well.<p>I addressed this quite clearly:<p>If you&#x27;re not generally at risk of experiencing racism (ie. you are of the majority ethnic group), of course it is easy to rule out. It&#x27;s hardly a glass half empty&#x2F;half full type of problem.<p>A glass half empty&#x2F;half full metaphor implies that the perception is simply down to personal optimism, which as I said, is clearly a gross oversimplification.')
