One example (out of many) of a necessary government intervention is to prevent monopolies from forming (or at least regulate them). Whenever one party has an outsized influence, they will tilt the whole market in their favour. It doesn&#x27;t even have to be a monopoly, if a single player makes up a substantial portion of the market, they can affect it in non-free ways.<p>Even Adam Smith recognised the need for government regulation to ensure that markets remain free.<p>Edit: I think you may have misread my comment; I wasn&#x27;t claiming that there is no such thing as a market without government interference (though that is probably mostly true). I was claiming that a market cannot be free without government regulating it to keep it free.')
