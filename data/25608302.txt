And people always have central heating on far too high for my comfort. When I&#x27;m in a building with central heating, I feel my face starting to flush and sweat prickling out on my back. It&#x27;s horrible and makes me feel really uncomfortable. And because it&#x27;s &quot;central&quot; heating, I have no option but to suffer.<p>With an open fire, on the other hand, everyone can regulate the temperature around them to their own comfort level : Too cold? Move closer to the fire. Too warm? Move further away. Central heating is the fascism of domestic temperature control!<p>[0] I realise I&#x27;m probably a rarity in this. I never have the heating on at all in my own home, even in winter. If I get a bit cold, I just stick a jersey on.')
