No exceptions or qualifications to the sanctity of free speech exist. Free speech is a faith, and no such heresies are allowed.<p>I love free speech. I think it&#x27;s one of the most important things in society. But the whole &quot;kill lies with more speech&quot; meme needs to die because there&#x27;s simply no evidence for it.<p>We should have free speech for its own sake, and recognize and mitigate its harmful effects as much as possible. If we don&#x27;t, society will turn against free speech entirely and everyone will be much worse off.')
