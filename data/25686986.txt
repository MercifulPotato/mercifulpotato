Item(by='saurik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610126210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25686560, text='Putting aside the complaints people have that this feature was flakey and didn&#x27;t really work, this one use case isn&#x27;t sufficient, as I usually switch to a new phone because my old one was destroyed... and I imagine this is the <i>only</i> reason people poorer than me get a new phone. Users need the ability to do non-transfer backups (which it sounds like this feature doesn&#x27;t support).<p>The reality is that my iTunes (encrypted) backup should include my chat message history. That the Signal client on iOS (and maybe even on Android, as while it has backup I think it is a bespoke backup) has decided that somehow Signal chat message history isn&#x27;t something one can backup at all (much less do using the user&#x27;s standard backup and restore process) is kind of ridiculous.')
