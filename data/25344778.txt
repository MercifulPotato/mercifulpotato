Looks like more body fat compared to body size is the key, regardless of gender.<p>&gt; [1] No significant gender differences in total metabolic heat production normalized for body mass or surface area were found among subjects who completed 90 min of immersion (9 women and 7 men). Nor was there a gender difference in the overall percent contribution ( approximately 60%) of fat oxidation to total heat production.…On the basis of the above findings, we accept the first hypothesis that women and men exhibit similar changes in body cooling and M˙ during cold water immersion at rest when subject responses are corrected for BF and size.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.physiology.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1152&#x2F;jappl.2000.89.4.1403?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.physiology.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1152&#x2F;jappl.2000....</a>')
