In California, there&#x27;s apparently an old law that you can&#x27;t have members-only alcohol clubs, so Costco technically has to let you buy alcohol.<p>I tried this once last year before I had a membership, and the person at the entrance told me they would need to get an employee to escort me, and it might take an hour, because they&#x27;re busy.<p>Presumably this is the kind of thing that a court would smack down, since I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re required to <i>actually provide reasonable access</i>, but I was just trying it for fun and didn&#x27;t make a fuss about it.')
