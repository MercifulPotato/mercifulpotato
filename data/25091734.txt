The Democratic Party members refer to themselves as democrats.  How often does the average person hear the word democratic versus democrat?  I don&#x27;t understand how using the more commonly used word related to a party is some rhetorical war or epithet when people outside of the Democratic Party rarely ever hear democrats use the words &quot;Democratic Party&quot; or &quot;Democratic representative&quot;.  If they don&#x27;t want to be referred to as the democrat party, they need to stop referring to themselves as democrats.  Until then, people are going to use &quot;democrat party&quot; as the shortened form of &quot;the party of the democrats&quot;.')
