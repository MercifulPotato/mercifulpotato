The only consideration that&#x27;s remotely permissible, beyond merit, is financial posture.<p>This is my stance as well, since it represents a <i>sustainable</i> solution to the fact that race is correlated with poverty in America.<p>Being poor sucks, regardless of whether systemic racism put you there or not.  Being poor deprives all children of opportunities, regardless of skin color.  (due to constraints on time, budget, and education of the parents)<p>Race-based affirmative action only solves the immediate problem that minority races are poorer on average.  Financial-need-based affirmative action solves the immediate problem, in addition to guaranteeing that, if demographics shift, we are still helping the groups most in need.')
