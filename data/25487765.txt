Perhaps some internal SEO management, or newer relevant thread linking system would be better. Some technologies I use are OLD and haven&#x27;t changed in the last ten years. Sometimes a 7 year old post has exactly what I needed. If they could add a banner and lock down voting and commenting after 3 years, that would be acceptable.')
