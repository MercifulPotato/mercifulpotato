They don&#x27;t turn a blind eye to information unfavorable to either presidential candidate, even as it might be politically advantageous to do so.<p>I&#x27;ve felt calmer and more centered since I started to read their writing. It&#x27;s really therapeutic to be able to dissociate and laugh at both sides. I think Biden is a lesser evil, but I don&#x27;t want to experience cognitive dissonance whenever I see likely evidence of his corruption.<p>I&#x27;m still interested to see some corroboration of this claim:<p>&gt; both Taibbi and Greenwald have confidently reported out technical stories they were self-evidently not qualified to report, made huge mistakes, and doubled down on them, because truthiness and advocacy is more important to them than accuracy')
