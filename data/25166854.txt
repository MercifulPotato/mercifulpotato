And on facebook it is moral and expected for women to cover parts of their bodies, that men don&#x27;t have to cover.<p>But you care about LGBT issues, and don&#x27;t care about special covering rules for women, so you&#x27;re arguing me, that one group of people should be protected because of unequal treatment, but other group of people shouldn&#x27;t be protected for their unequal treatment.')
