Note that there are a couple technical steps skipped by some expositions of Cantor&#x27;s argument. What part of the theorem are you uncomfortable with?<p>&gt; If a proof technique could prove untrue theorems, it wouldn&#x27;t be very convincing, would it?<p>But Cantor&#x27;s diagonalization argument can be used to prove that the integers cannot be mapped to integers if and only if every theorem is true.')
