The trust thing is part of the reason this is a good idea, but it&#x27;s mostly a good idea to avoid good-faith accidents. I think it is common for companies that haven&#x27;t yet had time to build those automated tools to delegate their work to senior, very trusted, engineers. But that&#x27;s not a <i>good</i> solution, it&#x27;s just more expedient, and a bit better than the database being world-writable, which is a <i>bad</i> solution.')
