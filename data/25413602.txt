So a semi is assumed at faul over a truck, thatâ€™s assumed at fault over a sedan, over a motorcycle over an e-bike, over a bicycle, over a pedestrian. Or something along those lines.<p>Always seemed like a reasonable policy to me. The people operating heavier vehicles have a higher inherent responsibility to operate them safely.')
