But the answer to this is always the same: off-topic Stallman ad hominem<p>&gt; Linux is a peculiar beast here. The kernel is largely developed by big corps, but playing by the copyleft rules, because it&#x27;s such a fundamental infrastructure.<p>Not quite. linux is the success of the past! but already corrupted by &quot;tainted&quot; kernel...<p>linux adopted GPL, which was *unthinkable* by corporate back then. But because devs didn&#x27;t cave in to &quot;permissive license fallacy&quot;, they had to eat it up.<p>The thing is, GPL is severely outdated. It does nothing to force Google, Amazon to open source their code that they profit from because of an OSS base work. GPL, with tainted kernel, merely force them to open source irrelevant parts of Android. The drivers and spyware-DRM can all remain proprietary. And does *absolutely nothing* to their bread and butter, which is hosted services on top of OSS software.<p>until we stick to GPLv3 like linux stuck with GPL, opensource is point less.')
