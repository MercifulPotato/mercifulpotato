They have marched peacefully down the street holding U.S. flags and the like, and been violently attacked by antifa elements.  They show up at left wing&#x2F;antifa demonstrations but don&#x27;t attack; they fight back when provoked.  They&#x27;ve been demonized by left wing news as &quot;white supremacists&quot; ironically even though their leader is a black guy.<p>So when you say &quot;it is pretty easy to find &#x27;they&#x27;&quot;, you need to support that statement.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to make stuff up, too, and I believe a lot of people are being censored on the basis of hearsay and madeup nonsense.')
