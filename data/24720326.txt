I struggled with the Data Science centric terminology. Uber&#x27;s 2017 post [1] was helpful in establishing the motivations and terminology of their Michelangelo machine learning (ML) platform. The main distinguishing feature of a <i>Feature Store</i> seems to be that it supports efficient batch downloading of row data that is used as the training dataset. The discussion made more sense once I figured out that <i>feature</i> refers to a column or data field.<p>Figure 4 in the Logical Clocks whitepaper <i>Hopsworks Feature Store</i> [2] helped me understand the architecture better. The architecture appears to be what I would call a <i>Hybrid Transactional&#x2F;Analytical Processing (HTAP)</i> [3] engine with MySQL cluster acting as the RowStore and Apache Hive acting as the ColumnStore. I&#x27;m assuming that the Hopsworks Feature Store periodically merges the MySQL updates into Hive and also provides a mechanism to perform <i>federated queries</i>.<p>The use of Hive seems outdated (vs. say Presto) and I wonder if the use of MySQL is required compared to directly accessing column oriented files like ORC&#x2F;Parquet&#x2F;Kudu.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eng.uber.com&#x2F;michelangelo-machine-learning-platform&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eng.uber.com&#x2F;michelangelo-machine-learning-platform&#x2F;</a><p>[2] (PDF) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uploads-ssl.webflow.com&#x2F;5e6f7cd3ee7f51d539a4da0b&#x2F;5ef397dce942172c90259858_feature%20management%20platform%20v02.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uploads-ssl.webflow.com&#x2F;5e6f7cd3ee7f51d539a4da0b&#x2F;5ef...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hybrid_transactional&#x2F;analytical_processing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hybrid_transactional&#x2F;analytica...</a>')
