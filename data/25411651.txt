Item(by='acqq', descendants=None, kids=[25411757], score=None, time=1607902913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25410897, text='So the updated values on the original page are now:<p>&gt; Intel&#x2F;M1 ratio  1.2  0.9<p>&gt; As you can see, the older Intel processor is slightly superior to the Apple M1 in the minify test.<p>I&#x27;d consider it as bigger news that M1 in one of the two tests chosen by the author (utf8) 10% <i>faster</i> than Intel, and in another (minify) only 20% slower, which is for most purposes something that most users won&#x27;t even be able to notice. It&#x27;s quite remarkable result. I&#x27;d surely write:<p>&quot;As you can also see, in the UTF-8 validate test M1 is superior to older Intel processor, and in the minify test only 20% slower, even if Intel uses more power to calculate the result!&quot;<p>-----<p>(Additionally I use the opportunity to thank again to u&#x2F;bacon_blood who verified the initial claims and u&#x2F;messe who figured out what the remaining bug in the author sources was! Great work!)<p>(Edit: the ratio 1.16 is from older native measurement. So I&#x27;ve also made an error in the previous version of this comment! I&#x27;ve wrongly connected that with the Rosetta 2 produced code. I&#x27;ve deleted that part of this message. Still the difference between 1.07 and 0.9 measured on two different setups is interesting, when another test is close enough).')
