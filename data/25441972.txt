But telling people off for being easily persuadable isn&#x27;t a viable solution. You have to deal with people as they really are, not as you wish them to be.<p>From a utilitarian perspective, fake news and persuasive technologies do real harm, and not just to the people who are persuaded. Unless something is done at the group level (i.e. by the state) the harm will continue. You might consider that an appropriate trade-off for liberty, but others can reasonably disagree without being weak.')
