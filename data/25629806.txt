Living in Poland I&#x27;d be happy to accept a salary that makes me very comfortable financially, even if theoretically the same position elsewhere pays more.<p>I think most people get it wrong - it&#x27;s not that people living in cheaper locations are underpaid. It&#x27;s people living in more expensive locations that are massively overpaid. Just because a software engineer in SF can make $100k&#x2F;year doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s what the position is worth, it just means these companies are massively overpaying.')
