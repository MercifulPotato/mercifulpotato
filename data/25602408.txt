It&#x27;s completely silent on whether the platform can take orders.  It prohibits a single specific action, and that action is <i>arranging for the delivery</i> of an order.<p>&gt; you can freely arrange for someone in an app to &quot;make an order&quot; for you and then fetch the meal.<p>You can arrange for them to make an order if you want to.  That&#x27;s allowed.  But &quot;fetching&quot; sure sounds to me like they are delivering the order.  They can&#x27;t deliver it unless they have the specific authorization from the restaurant.')
