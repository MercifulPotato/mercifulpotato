The latest and greatest breakthrough is using EBM (electron beam melting) for 3D printing second stage turbine blades from titanium aluminide in GE9X engine.<p>Those parts are continuously experiencing mechanical and thermal loads far in excess of forged or machined parts in any airframe. There is no added safety barrier for them unlike for fan blades. If turbine stage flies apart, its parts will go straight through everything in their path, including passengers.')
