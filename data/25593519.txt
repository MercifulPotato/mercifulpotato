Item(by='kempbellt', descendants=None, kids=[25593546], score=None, time=1609428695, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25593334, text='&gt; absolutely not true<p>Only the Sith deal in absolutes.<p>&gt; I feel obstructive amounts of shame, but I fought that and asked for a lower rent on my lease, and I got it.<p>Genuinely: congrats. Self-advocation is extremely rewarding, and something that I personally love to see in others.<p>&gt; But I am not going to cut in line at the grocery store even though, according to you, my feeling shame in that case is just stopping me from doing what I want.<p>If someone has a genuine need to cut in line and demonstrates that to the people they are cutting in line, I don&#x27;t see any issue here. I would take no issue being cut in line, in this situation and just think, &quot;They&#x27;ve got somewhere important to be&quot;. But still, if they did it dickishly, I wouldn&#x27;t <i>shame</i> them. I might confront them, or just...cut back. But for me to <i>shame</i> them, is such a drain of my energy... And whether they <i>feel</i> shame for an action on their own, is beyond what I care to spend my time thinking about. I&#x27;m not their mom.')
