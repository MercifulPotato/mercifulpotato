Item(by='SummerlyMars', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610641508, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25776860, text='&gt; I think there is always a temptation, a danger, for those of us in STEM careers to hold our own feelings and emotions (not to mention those of others) in contempt, as if they are somehow invalid by definition.<p>&gt; Instead, we should accept the emotional and intuitive aspects of ourselves and try to reason through them, understand where those feelings are coming from and make conscious decisions about how to move forward.<p>I agree completely. I&#x27;m distrustful of my emotions (if I feel uncomfortable with someone, is it because of things I know, or things I assume? Both are possible), but it&#x27;s a fact that I experience them, and that they affect my day to day. Reason isn&#x27;t what gets me out of bed in the morning. Emotions likely evolved because they were useful for survival. They can be very useful for directing our attention, or they can mislead us. If I feel something, I try to figure out if it&#x27;s based on things I know instead of things I imagine, and then I try to act.')
