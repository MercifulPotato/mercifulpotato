Then when I finally decided to look into it and did the breathing technique, I realized I might be able to take a cold shower. Now I&#x27;ve been taking 1-2min cold showers (after my regular hot shower), every day for the last 4 months. It gives me a huge boost of energy, way better than coffee.<p>Also, I recently read a translation and comment of the first speech by Buddha after enlightment. At it&#x27;s most basic, the Wim Hof and Buddha&#x27;s teaching seem very similar: make a continuous effort to face the uncomfortable. The main difference is in the way they go about it and the end goals. Wim Hof is just providing a very straightforward method to systematically face discomfort (in the form of cold), whereas Buddha gives a slightly more complicated method, but with the goal of reaching full detachment (Nirvana). You can also do both together.')
