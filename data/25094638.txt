It used to be a place where excellence was welcomed because people knew that if your neighbors succeed, so do you.<p>What? It&#x27;s so funny how &quot;news&quot; is able to spin a fairy tale that the masses so readily believe. Ignoring the fact that we exterminated our &quot;neighbors&quot; ( natives ) and stole their land, enslaved blacks, etc, america was never a &quot;welcoming&quot; place.<p>Almost every ethnic, racial group was banned from immigrating to the US at one point. Heck, all of asia was barred from immigrating to the US for most of the 20th century.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Immigration_Act_of_1924" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Immigration_Act_of_1924</a><p>Not to mention millions of mexican-americans who were deported to mexico.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mexican_Repatriation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mexican_Repatriation</a><p>&gt; Now, there&#x27;s just infighting, racism, hatred and<p>It&#x27;s always been that way really.<p>&gt; disdain for anything scientific and skilled.<p>Nah.<p>&gt; The average Joe wants a huge house, imported cars, hot spouse (or the millennial equivalent of such keeping up with the Joneses) but cannot accept that others who have worked harder, smarter and plainly got lucky can do better, especially immigrants.<p>You&#x27;ve described humanity everywhere, not just america.<p>&gt; Not blaming the average Joe<p>Really? Because it seemed like you were blaming them. Oh yeah, you did in the paragraph right above this one.')
