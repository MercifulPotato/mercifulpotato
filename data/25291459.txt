Then people started using GPUs for pbkdf2.<p>So we got bcrypt, which is CPU hard <i>and</i> uses enough memory that a GPU stops being particularly practical.<p>And then people build ASICs to bruteforce bcrypt faster. So we got scrypt and argon2, which are memory hard.<p>But the thing is that even PBKDF2 is pretty good. You can always just bump up the iteration count for PBKDF2 to increase security. I use a combination of PBKDF2 and bcrypt myself (pbkdf2 on the frontend, bcrypt on the backend).')
