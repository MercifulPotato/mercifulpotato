I did not expected husband to have dinner exactly when I come or wait for me if I am late for random reasons. If I found I was about to be late when he might wait,  I would call or he would call.<p>Frankly, you all have either super tolerant spouses willing to time dinner too you exact moments, or controlling spouses using dinner to keep check on you. But the relationships that come up in this discussion do not strike me as usual at all.')
