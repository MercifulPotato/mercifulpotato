Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=[25108391, 25108347], score=None, time=1605503672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108132, text='&gt; Deng shepherded economic reforms critical to China&#x27;s success after it was left in dire straits by Mao.<p>A single person isn&#x27;t responsible for anything in a major country. Especially a country the size of china. Whenever you are told it is, you are being fed propaganda. Whether it&#x27;s Xi, Putin, Trump, etc.<p>&gt; What Xi is doing now, such as halting major IPOs because of perceived criticism from successful CEOs<p>See what I mean. Do you think Xi called any journalist at the WSJ or bloomberg and told them he&#x27;s going to halt Ant&#x27;s IPO because of what Jack Ma said? Or do you think it is nonsense &quot;journalists&quot; made up because they needed a story to sell? Sort of like how everyday after the bell, the news gives us a reason for why the dow went up or down a few points? Do you just believe nonsense you read in the newspaper?<p>&gt; is more akin to Mao&#x27;s sensitive nature than Deng&#x27;s economic leadership.<p>Oh god, it&#x27;s amazing how people just parrot propaganda. Yeah, deng&#x27;s &quot;amazing economic leadership&quot;. But there is no deng&#x27;s economic leadership without mao meeting nixon. And mao doesn&#x27;t meet nixon without hundred or thousands of sino-american meetings behind the scenes. Do you think Mao just decided on a whim one day to meet nixon? Do you think Deng was the one that set out china&#x27;s econonic goals? Or do you think in a nation of 1.4 billion people, they had help?<p>Do you think that Ant&#x27;s IPO was halted because of Xi and what Jack Ma said or do you think it was because china&#x27;s regulatory agencies and intelligence apparatus had issues with it?<p>Just think about it. Everyone has the capacity to think and reason. Lucky for the news industry, most people don&#x27;t bother otherwise, they&#x27;d be out of business.')
