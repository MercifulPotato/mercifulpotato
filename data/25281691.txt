Quit your job, move across the country and then on your first day here are nine contracts to sign, no you can&#x27;t take them home we need them now. If you don&#x27;t sign you are unemployed and we want that relocation money back.<p>I used to ask potential employers when I got deep into interviews with them. &quot;Is there any way I can see all the contracts I would need to sign on my first day?&quot; and my experience is employers are very taken aback the question. How can you possibly talk remuneration when there also is some hidden contract that is part of it that you can&#x27;t see until your first day?')
