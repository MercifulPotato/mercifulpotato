I&#x27;d like to hear a talk about these things.<p>Naively I would expect that (as is the case for my MUCH smaller scale system) that I can compensate for network&#x2F;disk-bound and non-multithreaded stages by merely running two concurrent frames.<p>On a larger scale I would expect to be able to estimate RAM-cheap frames, and always have one of them running per machine, but at SCHED_IDLE priority, so that they <i>only</i> get CPU when the &quot;main&quot; frame is blocked on disk or network, or a non-parallelizable stage. By starving one frame of CPU, it&#x27;s much more likely that it&#x27;ll <i>need</i> CPU the short intervals when it&#x27;s allowed to get it.')
