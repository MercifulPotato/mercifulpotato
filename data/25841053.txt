Now, we consider the pullback [1] f* : Λⁿ(V) -&gt; Λⁿ(V) induced by f on the vector space of n-linear alternating forms Λⁿ(V) on V.<p>This is just an endomorphism on Λⁿ(V). However, Λⁿ(V) is one-dimensional, hence necessarily invariant under f*. This means f* has an eigenvalue (!). This eigenvalue is what we usually call the determinant of f.<p>This is completely independent of any choice of basis, orientation, or an inner product.<p>[1] That is, given an element w ∈ Λⁿ(V) and an arbitrary n-tuple v₁, ..., vₙ of vectors from V, we have (f*w)(v₁, ..., vₙ) = w(f(v₁), ..., f(vₙ))')
