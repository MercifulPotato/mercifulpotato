Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610813651, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25803089, text='&gt; The article says that NoSQL has no relations. Is that the case?<p>No, not as stated in the article. It is absolutely false that “no matter what format they store data in, these databases don’t support relations between data.” (that&#x27;s particularly laughable for <i>graph</i> databases.)<p>This sounds like the author knows that “nonrelational” is another term for “NoSQL”, but, as is distressingly common in the field, doesn&#x27;t know what “relational” means. (It means it doesn&#x27;t follow the relational model, who is centrally about (though the model has other elements) storing and operating on data in the form of “relations”, a particular logical abstraction (tables, views, etc., are all concrete realizations of this abstraction.)')
