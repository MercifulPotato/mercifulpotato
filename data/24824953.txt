Being around neurotypicals and teaching him proper social skills and coping mechanism.<p>Normal kids can and will learn the latter from other kids, but it is way harder for autistics. He can learn social skills for sources that are made with autistic way of thinking in mind and that will be more humane (?) I think.<p>He will also need to learn a bit different set of skills than neurotypicals (like more emotional regulation etc),  I don&#x27;t remember exactly when I found it, but there is a theory or sth that autistic people develop differently AKA on a different timeline.<p>Being in regular kindergarden will likely result in bullying so please keep that in mind.<p>Source: my autistic self being bullied since kindergarden and living with NTs for quite some time ;)')
