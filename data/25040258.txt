Gotta love Pokemon papers!<p>That said, since people shouldn&#x27;t just believe whatever they read, even if it&#x27;s published in <i>Nature</i> or <i>Science</i> or something, it&#x27;s a tad redundant to point out that papers published in academic formatting can be complete nonsense.<p>A solid peer-review can <i>help reduce</i> quality issues, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that whatever&#x27;s published is true, reliable, or trustworthy.  It&#x27;s weird that so many folks seem to think that journal articles are gospel.
