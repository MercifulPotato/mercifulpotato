It’s basically the same thing as the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The real question is whether facts and explanations are declared by an authority, or whether they must be proven laboriously to each individual prior to acceptance. If flat earth cannot be easily disproven to an individual, imagine what else we may have been led to believe on the authority of a third-grade textbook or a 30-second news report. I think their message, assuming the best of them, is not that we should accept ridiculous ideas like flat earth, but that we should be less certain about many things that we really don’t know very well.')
