The least boring part of Angular for us was rxjs and forms. It&#x27;s awesome having rxjs experts, but for folks getting started it can get messy. We decided to limit it&#x27;s usage, and things have been going pretty well so far. In terms of performance we haven&#x27;t hit any issues, but I suppose it depends on the app you&#x27;re building.<p>We&#x27;ve had successful React projects as well. There the boringness was coming from the intuitive approach for building components. We found it less boring when we had to keep up to date, be consistent (used technologies), and have smooth integrations. Hooks felt very much similar to rxjs where there&#x27;s so much semantics behind a short name to the extent you need to dig behind the implementation to understand what given hook does.')
