I&#x27;m probably biased, but one of the major strengths of Guix is its wealth of R packages that are all built reproducibly.<p>Ask different people about what they think is Guix&#x27;s major strength and you&#x27;ll get different answers, because Guix is pretty great in a lot of areas.<p>The installer script has seen some recent improvements and the interactive system installer as well.  The annoying locales thing has also seen an unusual solution recently, so we&#x27;re approaching a state where the initial impression lives up to the amazing day to day performance of Guix for package, environment, and system management.')
