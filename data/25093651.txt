Few more material, and device generations are on the way. Litho has went through more generation changes in the last 1 decade, than in any previous one.<p>Whole new device classes are on the way: optics on silicon, new memory, logic in the backend, and logic on package.<p>Semiconductor engineering is still a career suicide though, that haven&#x27;t changed in the last few decades.')
