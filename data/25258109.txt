You just saw an exploding fireball at the back of the field, and your blood just ran cold. F1 cars don&#x27;t explode that way, it&#x27;s just not something that happens anymore. And you can&#x27;t imagine anyone walking away alive from it. The couple of minutes between seeing the crash and getting the reports that Grosjean had walked out of the car alive was just awful.<p>Seeing the replays afterwards, it reminded me of the footage of Niki Lauda&#x27;s crash at the 1976 German Grand Prix. He was caught in a fiery inferno for something like 40-50 seconds, which severely damaged his lungs and face and disfigured him for life. Six weeks later, with bandages still covering his head, he was back on track, racing again. He would go on to win several championships. Luckily, it seems like Romain got away with much lighter wounds.<p>I was thinking to myself during the race about the 19 other drives, thinking &quot;how do you go sit in a car and race for 90 minutes after seeing that happen?&quot;, but these guys are made of sterner stuff than me.<p>Thank god for the halo, and the hardened monocoque (which basically stayed intact after a 200 kph crash!), and the improved firesuits, and the medical car following at the start, and the marshals at the side of the track with fire extinguishers, and a thousand other small safety measures. Romain Grosjean is alive today because of decades of tireless work making the sport safer. Thank god for Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda, Sid Watkins, Charlie Whiting and everyone else who has worked tirelessly to this end.')
