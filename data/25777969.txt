Item(by='tristor', descendants=None, kids=[25778231], score=None, time=1610640183, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25777030, text='This is a horrible argument.  Not only is is factually untrue on nearly every count, it&#x27;s not even an accurate analogy, even if it were true.<p>You can&#x27;t buy guns on Amazon for the same reason you can&#x27;t buy tobacco, liquor, lottery tickets, or cars on Amazon.  Because these are all things which are regulated by the government in such a way as to be incompatible with Amazon&#x27;s logistics and purchasing setup and customer experience.  You can buy all of those things online (except lottery tickets), but just not on Amazon.  Since Amazon sells other alcoholic beverages, they&#x27;re hardly taking a moral stance about the dangers of alcoholism.  They sell tobacco accessories so they&#x27;re hardly taking a moral stance against tobacco, they sell parts for cars so they&#x27;re surely not against private vehicle ownership, and yes, they even sell tactical gear and gun accessories (although crucially not gun parts... any more).<p>The reason you can buy a set of knives on Amazon and not a Glock is that knives aren&#x27;t regulated with more than 84000 conflicting laws between different state, county, and municipal jurisdictions across the US, including differing restrictions on transfer and shipping, and knives do not have federal regulations requiring background checks.  Regardless of your personal opinion around private firearms ownership, you should surely be able to see that the analogy you&#x27;ve presented is patently absurd.')
