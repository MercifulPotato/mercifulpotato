Strictly speaking, an OS is an abstraction on top of hardware that applications are written against. That&#x27;s it. OSes of 2007 did a good job of abstracting the hardware away from applications. They also weren&#x27;t as user-hostile as the modern ones, so one could argue that they were better. Operating systems had been feature-complete for quite a while. Those yearly updates serve no practical purpose.')
