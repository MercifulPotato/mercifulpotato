The Federal Circuit ruled in Oracle&#x27;s favor on that question and the Supreme Court denied certiorari, but the Federal Circuit wasn&#x27;t really supposed to be hearing a copyright question to begin with. They&#x27;re the appeals court for <i>patents</i>, and on other issues tied up in a patent case they are only supposed to follow local circuit precedent (Ninth Circuit, in this case). So until the Supreme Court grants certiorari on this case or another case with the same question comes before a local circuit, there can&#x27;t be any binding precedent on this matter that would apply to new cases outside Oracle v Google.')
