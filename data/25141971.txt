Stuff doesn&#x27;t actually &#x27;escape&#x27; a black hole to form Hawking radiation, rather, negative stuff goes in.<p>Photon pairs form in the vacuum all the time. When a pair forms at the event horizon of a black hole, it rips the pair apart. Half falls in, and half shoots out into space. The half the falls in, through the effect that rips the pair apart, winds up with negative energy, lowering the energy level of the black hole.')
