I&#x27;m eagerly awaiting PostmarketOS to reach full functionality on the PinePhone and I&#x27;ll give up my Android phone at that point, taking Google out of the equation as well.<p>I&#x27;m even considering trying to learn C so I can contribute to OpenBSD for my hardware that is &quot;rough around the edges&quot;.<p>[1] My wife&#x27;s PC with Windows 10 is exempt for now; she&#x27;s not a techie person at all and I don&#x27;t want to force her into something alien. She tends to borrow my Thinkpad with Linux every now and then and is getting more used to it, so we&#x27;ll see how that goes.')
