It has remained &#x27;China&#x27; ever since, just not the PRC. The people are ethnic Chinese and in fact quite a few people fled the communist forces on the mainland by moving to Taiwan, including the government itself. One example being the founder of TSMC. Another example, Foxconn&#x27;s founder was born in Taiwan right after his parents fled from the mainland.<p>I find the comparison with Korea and Vietnam factually incorrect and rather disingenuous, irrespective of what the people of Taiwan might think of reunification.')
