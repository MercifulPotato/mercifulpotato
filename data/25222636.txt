Languages like C# and Java offer you so much facilities and QOL features compared to C and C++, but in practice you have to give up most of those facilities in order to have it perform almost on par with lower level languages; Even then I think it&#x27;s still acceptable since you still have the tooling, the facilitated debugging, etc. C# for example, is keeping up with this trend of using higher level languages to code things closer to the metal and with more memory management awareness, and offering more and more features to make that kind of code more performant and with less heap allocations, since C# 7.0 or so: Span&lt;T&gt; for example is a revolution; But I use things like stackalloc, ref, fixed, Unsafe.CopyBlockUnaligned, &amp;MemoryMarshal.GetReference etc, on a daily basis to get that extra performance where it matters;')
