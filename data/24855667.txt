I’m using OS X and iOS exclusively, with Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.<p>After trying out 1Password, Dashlane, etc. I returned to LastPass - contrary to most of the reviews I found online, LastPass works much more smoothly with most sites and apps. The integration with iOS is much nicer. I found the gap between LastPass and everything else was sufficiently large that it was a no brainer to switch back.<p>I’m still occasionally frustrated with LastPass, but having seen what the alternatives are I won’t be revisiting them for a good few years.')
