I think there’s a parallel “legal news” community somewhere pointing at us here going “those nerds don’t understand how law works” :)<p>What we should _all_ be doing more actively, imo, is nudging our representatives to update the law to create legislation that answers definitively “whether APIs are copyrightable or not”. Albeit, that is a much more difficult and slower process.<p>Well, you know what they say about democracy as a form of government though: “something something yeah, it kinda sucks but it’s the best we’ve got something”')
