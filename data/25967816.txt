[1] In vast parts, it&#x27;s not much more than mildly disguised US-bashing (Dijkstra was always a grumpy old man) but that&#x27;s not what caught my eye. What did was the fact that he describes the US research landscape as a system that orients itself around short-term projects and industry desires. Dijkstra clearly expresses his contempt for this approach over what he claims to be the European way: long-term thinking and research done for research&#x27;s sake.<p>That paper was written in 1982<p>Fast forward ~40 years, and the presumed US model <i>is exactly</i> the way research funding works all across Europe today. Jumping from one project to the next, always hoping that one of your next proposals will receive funding, or you&#x27;re out of a job. Your project proposal has a weak &quot;exploitation&quot; section? Well, goodbye proposal then!
