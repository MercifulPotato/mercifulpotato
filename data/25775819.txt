At best we&#x27;ll be able to say &quot;we don&#x27;t know&quot;.<p>You see this all the time when discussing with, say, antivaxxers when a sufficient argument for them is to say &quot;I read an article somewhere where a doctor said...&quot; but when you try to raise your argument they suddenly need a whole lot of undeniable evidence + an ELI5 explanation of all biology.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s a slippery slope when platforms start arbitrating the truth, but at the same time not doing anything or doing little is a free fall and we are already in it.')
