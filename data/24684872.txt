They <i>All</i> suck. They are designed so the Ink Cartridge head will be blocked after opening for x months. And Ink Cartridge are filled with Ink but either dry up or you will never be able to make full use of it. In Colour Inkjet some manufactures even make it so have to have enough ink in ALL colours to print. Even if you try to print something without it, mixed or not.<p>Their business model is basically force you to buy more Ink Cartridge.<p>Basically Consumer Inkjet printing sucks.<p>Edit: I think Xerox or Fujitsu had a new LED based printing tech similar to Laser, they were very good for first two years, but generally speaking they dont last as long as old Laser.')
