Item(by='cgriswald', descendants=None, kids=[25341182], score=None, time=1607391796, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25339922, text='Whether the claims are true or not, the video does not support it.<p>&gt; They drew guns after entering the residence.<p>Yes, but she claims:<p>&gt;&gt; They pointed a gun in my face.<p>In the video, she clearly leaves the residence before any guns are drawn. Potentially the cop to the left of the door from the camera&#x27;s perspective has his hand on his gun, but it&#x27;s not drawn either. So if this happened, it&#x27;s not on video.<p>&gt; They pointed them up the stairs where she said her husband and two children were. Thus they were pointing guns at her children.<p>She doesn&#x27;t say that and the video doesn&#x27;t support it.<p>She says:<p>&gt;&gt; I tell them my husband and my two children are upstairs... and THEN one of them draws his gun.<p>&gt;&gt; On my children.<p>According to the video, she&#x27;s outside at this point. It&#x27;s not clear how she can know where they are, except that she might have assumed they were where she last saw them. She actually says they &#x27;are upstairs&#x27; which doesn&#x27;t mean &#x27;at the top of the stairs&#x27;, but &#x27;on the second floor.&#x27;<p>If anything, the video disputes the idea that they are at the top of the stairs. There is a light source shining down on the steps, but there are no shadows.<p>In fact, I don&#x27;t even read that she&#x27;s making the claim that the cops pointed guns at her children, merely that they <i>drew</i> the guns on her children. The video does support this claim since it could be argued that they were drawing their guns on anyone who might be in the house, whether they were physically in the same space or not.')
