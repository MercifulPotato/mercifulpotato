Especially in ML, there have been many cases where very smart people were wrong with their intuitions (the original explanation of batchnorm comes to mind), or maybe their intuitions were correct, but attempts to explain the intuition (especially when there&#x27;s a race to publish) led to wrong conclusions. I still think intuitions should be discussed and shared, but with a clearly stated caveat like: &quot;that&#x27;s just my guess, we don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s really happening there&quot;. This is how I usually explain to others (and to myself) my experimental results.')
