None of that was ever “to avoid WWIII”.<p>It cost every working American 42,000 USD. These wars cost the lives of almost 1 mio people and 21 mio were displaced. [0]<p>Do you <i>honestly</i> believe this was for the good of the world and necessary to prevent WWIII? I am not even suggesting something like “why don’t you spend all that budget on a better health care system, free education and racial equality” because I know that would just push blood pressure. But I know that you won’t worry so much about these insane spendings - because your children and grand-children will have to pay back all the debt these irresponsible arguments accumulated. So smart your generation has been!<p>WWII was a consequence of WWI. Germans are pretty chill these days and complain about increasing military budgets. So who should ever want to start WWIII???<p>And just for the sake of completing an argument: you <i>do</i> know, that Europe is now taking financial responsibility and giving shelter to those people  in the Middle East whose livelihoods were destroyed, right? The refugee crisis is not “a natural occurrence”. Europe learned its lesson and prefers spending money on helping others rather than showcasing military strength and gadgets.<p>[0]\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;us-spent-6point4-trillion-on-middle-east-wars-since-2001-study.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;us-spent-6point4-trillion-on...</a>')
