In a previous post[0], lemire confirmed that NEON was competitive with SSE (which is also 128b) comparing older Âµarch (Intel&#x27;s Skylake versus Apple&#x27;s A12).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemire.me&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;parsing-json-using-simd-instructions-on-the-apple-a12-processor&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lemire.me&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;parsing-json-using-simd-in...</a>')
