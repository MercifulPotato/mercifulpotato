I lived in Helsinki between 2005 and 2009. Overall, it&#x27;s a great place to be and if you are tempted to give it a try, I&#x27;d say go for it. However, there are a few caveats:<p>Four seasons is a joke. It&#x27;s basically 50 shades of winter and autumn interrupted by about 3-4 months of weather worth enjoying outside. It can get warm and humid but typically not for very long.<p>July and August are reliably nice mostly and you get basically ~20 hours of daylight around that time. June you can get lucky, anything else is an outlier. E.g. labor day celebrations (first of May) are a bit of a toss up on whether it will be nice enough or whether you still get snow. Mostly people just go outside anyway. But early spring kind of weather is the most generous thing you could say about the weather around that time: mostly not great but you get a few nice days once in a while.<p>The weather is one thing; the darkness is another. The two combined make for a miserable season that pretty much lasts from September to April. On the tail end of that is where you can expect winter conditions but these days even that is not a guarantee in Helsinki. The last few winters have been very mild; which in Helsinki means it is dark, wet, and grey for 8 months. If there is any Snow, you&#x27;ll hate it by April because it will have been melting and freezing up non stop since February. Most Finns don&#x27;t wear their outdoor shoes indoors for this reason.<p>Not everybody deals with darkness easily. I never had much issues with it but I definitely saw this affect others around me. Calling Finland the happiest place on earth deserves calling out its relatively high suicide rate (though a bit lower than the US: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_suicide_r...</a>). There are &quot;happier&quot; places in Europe with arguably a lot more economic baggage to justify higher suicide rates. It can be a happy place and it definitely was for me but not everyone is happy.<p>Otherwise good to know is that if you are used to the byzantine bureaucracies of e.g. the US, Germany, etc. Finland is going to be a refreshing change. There&#x27;s not a lot of it and what little there is is simple, efficient, and fair. Moving in and out of Finland were by far the easiest moves I&#x27;ve done (including domestic ones in the Netherlands, my home country). Basically, you enter the country, report to the police and then you are issued a person number and a Kela card which provides you access to things like healthcare and other things run by the government. That&#x27;s pretty much it. Moving out amounted to a couple of phone calls to update my address.<p>All, in English, of course, because nobody is expected to even be capable to learn enough Finnish and if anything Finns are super pragmatic when it comes to these things. I never had a need for Finnish interpreters to do anything. Even when officially it&#x27;s not supported, you can always find English translations for e.g. tax forms and extensive documentation. I did my taxes using the Swedish forms (second official language, a bit easier to parse) and those translations without an accountant. In Germany where I currently live, I&#x27;m completely helpless without an accountant even though I can read German quite well.<p>Quality of life is high. The VAT is high. The taxes actually aren&#x27;t that high. If you are coming from e.g. California and add up all the little state, federal, council, and other taxes, it&#x27;s ballpark going to be not very pretty (or so I&#x27;m told by friends who spent time there). Add healthcare to the mix and it gets brutal and that&#x27;s before you take care of your pension (if at all). Finland sort of aggregates all of that and does not charge you separately for those things. If you do the math, it&#x27;s not a bad deal for most people. You can get better deals elsewhere in Europe but a comparable lifestyle requires 5 figure salaries in the US because stuff just is universally expensive there.')
