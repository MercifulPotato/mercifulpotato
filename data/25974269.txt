I wanted a super organized, auto-tagged, etc document store.  I ended up caring less each year and have settled on a directory with scans organized by date that I can search through.  Occasionally I&#x27;ll rename the files or move them somewhere else, but that&#x27;s not too often anymore.<p>My current setup is:<p>- Scanner hooked up to a raspberry pi<p>- Push button on the scanner, the pi scans it in and saves a .tif file per page to my nas<p>- A script running in a k8s pod monitors that folder, performs some steps on each .tif file like increasing the contrast, cutting off the edges, detecting blank pages, etc<p>- The same script then converts those .tif files to a pdf and runs Tesseract on it for OCR<p>- That pdf gets uploaded to a folder in my nextcloud instance<p>It&#x27;s not great, but I can either use my local file explorer to search through the ocr&#x27;d PDFs or (more slowly) I can search inside Nextcloud&#x27;s web ui using the fulltextsearch plugin.')
