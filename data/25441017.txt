The things that can be implemented are for example contributing computational power. Lichess users do that [1], i use it all the time, but they do it for purely altruistic reasons. Altruism doesn&#x27;t go very far by himself when the donor consumes valuable resources. That&#x27;s why there is a cap on the total games someone can analyse, to avoid the tragedy of the commons.<p>In lichess billions of games are played each month, and lichess is accepting donations of big amounts of money, i.e. 10 dollars, 100 dollars. How about with every game that is played the players pay less than a penny, 0.1 penny of a dollar? Personally that would cost me less than a penny for each day of playing. Lichess would make a lot more money, than individual donors who pay big amounts, and everyone else playing for free.<p>See how ruthlessly i got downvoted, maybe it is the case that no one knows what bitcoin is. Bitcoin is nothing for free, everything is paid for. Using supercash almost infinitely divided, to small amounts. If that is implemented already in the traditional financial systems how come no one is doing it?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iPRNluVn22w&amp;t=2s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iPRNluVn22w&amp;t=2s</a>')
