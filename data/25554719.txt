It&#x27;s not worth it. You&#x27;re better off by any calculation in the US. Substantially so.<p>You&#x27;re missing pensions, which EU countries have, which mean in most cases you won&#x27;t find yourself broke and penniless when you retire. And work hours, which are substantially less. And vacation time, which is literally multiple times more ( 5 weeks paid minimum in France for instance), and &quot;unlimited sick time&quot; ( it&#x27;s sick there&#x27;s even such a concept in the US). What good are your millions if you have to wait to retirement to actually use them, being too busy working 60 hour weeks? Or having to go into work sick? Or ffs, after the birth of a child?')
