Our Senate and the electoral college were designed in order to get support from colonies to form the new USA. It worked well for that purpose.<p>We have entirely different goals now. We should be aiming for fair elections in which one person&#x27;s vote is equal to any other&#x27;s regardless of the state they reside. The electoral college is downright repulsive once you realize how unfairly it treats citizens in more populated states compared to those in less populated states.<p>The electoral college now has the potential of pulling the union apart. If California and New York see a few more elections in which their citizens&#x27; votes are discounted, resulting in popular vote winners losing the presidency, then it would be logical for them to secede. They can take their massive economies and accompanying tax dollars and leave this system behind, as it should&#x27;ve been a long time ago.')
