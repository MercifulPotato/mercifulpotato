The yard requires energy and materials to maintain. The room requires energy and materials to maintain, clean, and climatize. The car need gas, tires, oil, and maintainance. Even if it&#x27;s an electric car it&#x27;s still needs tires and that energy still has to come from somewhere.<p>Plenty of people in the world live in much smaller places. See HK apartment or the &quot;average&quot; Tokyo apartment as examples.<p>I owned a car for 19yr old but haven&#x27;t for 14 of the last 20 years. I don&#x27;t miss it.
