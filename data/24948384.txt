The bottom line is that I want to be supportive. And if I don&#x27;t know how, I might make a guess at it and that guess might be the natural response of &quot;try to help fix their problem.&quot;<p>It makes sense that you just don&#x27;t want to hear that. I can empathize avec depression. Just listen to me and be patient with me. You can&#x27;t fix this and it&#x27;s kind of insulting that you try, as if I was too dumb to think up your idea.<p>(This also relates to software reviews too: I&#x27;ve spent a week on this problem. You suggesting I&#x27;m doing it wrong after five minutes of review can be really insulting)')
