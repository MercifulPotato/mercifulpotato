Being in congress is a terrible job where you do not even have time to read 1&#x2F;2 of the bills you are going to vote on this week. So you count on others to help you. Mostly this is staffers, interns and lobbyists because those are the people who show up and help. If you as a citizen want to make change, then all you have to do is show up, in person and have a friendly conversation with the rep or even just with their staffers. Come with easy to understand stories, and be able to rationally talk about the other side. E.g. I realize that law enforcement has a strong story about encryption, but there is a reason we don&#x27;t require home, car and safe buyers to give law enforcement a master key. Yes, some bad cops might steal, but what is worrisome is that the bad guys might get the the kes.  That&#x27;s exactly what they are asking for here: a master key.')
