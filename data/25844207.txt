That will increase the size of the B tree nodes [2] (and other pages too but that&#x27;s probably what you want):<p>&gt; The upper bound on [the number of keys on an interior b-tree page] is as many keys as will fit on the page.<p>I think a tricky part of this idea would be the locking. Usually SQLite relies on the locking of the underlying filesystem. You could add your own mechanism that causes a lock to be assigned to a single client connection, but what if it never unlocks? (On a single machine you can tell if the client process has crashed.) You could add a timeout but what if the client process then <i>does</i> respond?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;pragma.html#pragma_page_size" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;pragma.html#pragma_page_size</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;fileformat2.html#b_tree_pages" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;fileformat2.html#b_tree_pages</a>')
