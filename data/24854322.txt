The worst part was that I tried drinking it cold, which made it sit in my stomach and build up, so I ran out of space to drink more.  I heated it up, which got things moving again, but made it taste even worse.<p>I will say though, after having the colonoscopy, my general bowel symptoms(never ending gas, mostly) improved dramatically.
