Even the anti-child-abuse book &quot;For Your Own Good&quot; by Alice Miller wrote &quot;The former practice of physically maiming, exploiting, and abusing children seems to have been gradually replaced in modern times by a form of mental cruelty that is masked by the honorific term child-rearing&quot;.  Of course the book  pretty clearly covers the dangers of corporal punishment or any kind of attack on a child&#x27;s self-worth.  The point is to push through this awkward abusive phase and bring our species out the other side more self-aware by not continuing the cycle of abuse&#x2F;neglect.')
