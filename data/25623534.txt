Item(by='vlovich123', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609697088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620705, text='The entire mathematical field of game theory describes how any agent (human or otherwise) would behave in various situations with carefully crafted rules. Mathematicians have modeled successfully how herd animals move (including humans) even when though the individual reasons for any given movement are opaque.<p>Obviously these are still primitive tools but they surely provide a better and more solid foundation.<p>You’ve also thrown the halting problem phrase around here but unless you have a paper actually establishing a mathematical proof, all you’ve actually done is state a hypothesis. Furthermore, the halting problem only says that it’s impossible to prove a priori whether or not a machine will return a result or run for infinity. By definition the algorithm it’s actually executing is computable. The closest analogy would be more that we won’t know if there is a point in the future where we can accurately model human behavior but we can continue trying and we may well succeed. Remember the halting problem says the process may or may not complete but that we can’t prove it a priori of running the process.<p>As for your “we’ll change our behavior if we successfully model”, that’s a reductive argument because it presupposes the format the solution would look like. You’re assuming that the modeling would look like “if scenario X do action Y”. Proper modes here would be probabilistic and have specific criteria for the environment and rules.<p>So more like “patriarchal societies have a probability of X% of forming when environmental pressures are set Y” or “societies are most stable when conditions A, B, C exist”.<p>If you think human behavior is unpredictable at all by computers, would you care to short any tech advertising company like Google or Facebook? After all you should be able to provide a proof and instantly devalue their CPC overnight whenever you want.<p>Edit: Also if you truly believe what you said, “social science” needs to be renamed to “social tea leave reading”. The science part is pseudo-science.')
