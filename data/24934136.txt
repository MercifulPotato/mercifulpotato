Hopefully increased adoption means more accurate parsers and support for even more languages.<p>Tree-sitter powers syntax highlighting on GitHub.com and (soon) neovim and OniVim 2. Hopefully regex-based syntax highlighting is a thing of the past soon. If you haven&#x27;t seen the Strange Loop conference talk on tree-sitter [2] yet, it&#x27;s worth a watch.<p>I think a Prettier-like code formatter using tree-sitter would be cool, both in terms of potentially broader language support and native performance.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tree-sitter.github.io&#x2F;tree-sitter&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tree-sitter.github.io&#x2F;tree-sitter&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Jes3bD6P0To" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Jes3bD6P0To</a>')
