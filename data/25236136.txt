Specifically, I create an overlay with gocryptfs in which the overlay has the unencrypted filesystem, and what&#x27;s physically written to disk are the encrypted files.<p>Then, I create another mount on the physical disk and simply sync _that_ mount to multiple remote sources. Of course, this solution is fairly simple, and does not provide the features like file moves. Further, this approach potentially &quot;leaks&quot; some information, such as how many files I have, the approximate sizes of each file, etc.<p>This was set up a while ago; will definitely take a look at NFreezer to see if it&#x27;s time for a refresh of my setup.')
