I can tune things like arena allocators and make string operations insanely fast, things I agree most problems simply don&#x27;t require, but still, its a craft that I feel very proud of conquering, and every day you learn something new.&quot;<p>I worked with C++ for years, and I while I agree with the &quot;every day you learn something new part&quot;, I also think that most employers and projects don&#x27;t benefit all that much from time spent playing with your toy of choice, so to speak. That time that you spend learning about C++ each day, could go into learning about security, machine learning, graphics pipelines and a lot of other things.<p>I switched to a job where I mostly had to use C or Python, and I no longer obsess over my hammer. Unlike my C++-job, we don&#x27;t go to C++ conferences and spend meeting after meeting talking about the language we&#x27;re using. We attend conferences on crypto, machine learning, intrusion detection, and other things that could be useful to us.<p>I agree that there is a time and place for C++, but I feel so much more productive pulling that tool out of my toolbox AFTER I&#x27;ve identified a hot region of my code, and then using it where absolutely necessary.')
