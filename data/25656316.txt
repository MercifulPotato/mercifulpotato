Microbes sticks to this, and when swallowed are neutralized by our stomach acid. But cold air slows down this process, so our first line of defence doesn&#x27;t work as well during winter.<p>There are also factors such as behaviour changes like spending more time indoors, closed windows and a lot of other stuff that also likely helps spread infections.')
