And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the suggestion of war crimes that&#x27;s humorous here, but the idea that some random guy emailed him with creative suggestions for revenge. It is a pretty absurd situation, especially when you consider how disproportionate that kind of response would be.<p>If you don&#x27;t find it funny that&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s fair to construe that paragraph as an endorsement of war crimes.')
