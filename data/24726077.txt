This is the pumped up FOX&#x2F;alt-right narrative. Domestic terrorism is the alt-right creating militias to abduct governors (yesterday) or kill state senators (see: Oregon last summer). Smashing a Starbucks window or starting a fire in a garbage can (or a half-assed molotove cocktail) is faaaaar from opening fire nightly on thousands of protestors, gassing them with banned CS gas, and trying to disappear them in unmarked cars, done by unmarked goons with no badges.')
