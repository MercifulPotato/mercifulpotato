People already bend Python into horrendous DSL-esque abominations using the flexibility already afforded. Macros might allow for these contortions to be more principled and vettable.<p>OTOH, I am not keen on this opening the door to even more stuff newbies have to learn, especially in the ML domain, where you <i>just know</i> people will use macros to do all manner of &quot;clever tricks&quot;.<p>This proposal also seems too limited to truly enable the kind of performance speedups numerical Pythonistas really want.<p>The ! notation feels icky and &quot;un-python&quot; to me. Maybe that&#x27;s just (lack of) mere exposure effect.<p>What I want instead: improve&#x2F;stabilize tools and CPython hooks for decompiling, code generation, AST manipulation, and the like. When I can go source -&gt; AST -&gt; source with confidence, maybe lets revisit macros.')
