I didn&#x27;t notice any lingering issues after maybe 2 1&#x2F;2 or 3 weeks.  The flu had me in bed for a week and weak for ten days or so and yes, it took a while longer to fully recover.  But I <i>did</i> fully recover.<p>And apparently the effect is real and exists.  I just never heard anyone say about the flu, &quot;get your flu shot or else face a real possibility of lingering mental impairment.&quot;')
