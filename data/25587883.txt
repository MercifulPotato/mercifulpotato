I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re realizing the potential of the parent&#x27;s suggestion.<p>You motivate the work through bottom-up construction, but I don&#x27;t think you have a clear explanation for who the users are. They must be:<p>1) Sure they are only going to use models that are supported by NN-512. This is a big jump for me and many people who want to do transformers, LSTMs, etc. and not just what NN-512 costs.\n2) They have to be price sensitive. But if you want larger companies, they will rarely just have one use-case that NN-512 supports; they will probably have a ton of use-cases that NN-512 supports.\n3) They want to target AVX-512. If they are a medium or larger company they probably want to have tooling around this, to support model development and later deployment.<p>Those are my thoughts in general.<p>I currently need to be able to target and deploy on PC and Mac CPUs from the past 10 years. (I know, this is specific.)<p>I think parent is saying that individual devs are more likely to try NN-512 if they don&#x27;t have to learn a new API, since most of them want to have the flexibility to fool around before committing to a new tech or bringing it in-house.<p>I guess my suggestion is really try to specifically define who the <i>user</i> is for NN-512 and what NN problems they are trying to solve, and let that shape the roadmap.')
