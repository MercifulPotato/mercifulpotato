Person B gets the cash payment, returns the stock, and some of the cash payment to A. When B &quot;borrows&quot; a stock, they are the owner of the stock, plus they have a contract to give the stock back to A at some future date. So it&#x27;s legal.<p>Last I heard, this was being phased out by one country after another. Each year, there was less and less opportunity to make any money. It might be totally gone now.')
