Including, but not limited by, A&#x2F;B tests, region-locking features, rolling to features to internal users only and so on.<p>For example, you&#x27;re developing a new version of the checkout page for your company from scratch (it can be a store selling physical goods, or a subscription service, or anything that requires payment). It means that for a while it will not have feature parity with your existing checkout page.<p>So first you implement feature parity with, say, German payment options (credit cards and Sofort). Then you set up a feature flag saying &quot;for 5% of German customers display the new checkout&quot;, and monitor it. Then you bump it up to 10%, then to 50%.<p>Meanwhile you&#x27;re working on accepting payments via Swish in the new checkout in Sweden. Once it&#x27;s ready, you add a feature flag saying &quot;for 5% Swedish customers display the new checkout&quot; (and in parallel, you&#x27;re probably already displaying the new checkout to 50% German customers).<p>And so on.<p>In their core feature flags are not really more than a glorified if statement, but:<p>- you want to view them, and handle them in a single place so that you can adjust the various parameters or quickly shut down a feature if it misbehaves<p>- this single place has to be scalable enough that it survives an influx of customers potentially triggering dozens of feature flags across your software')
