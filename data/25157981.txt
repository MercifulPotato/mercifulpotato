We expect them not to break society&#x27;s rules, and whatever capitalism allows - they can do, with no social stigma. We give each other a free pass because we know change is hard (is that the functioning of a society striving to be moral?)\nNow whatever capitalism allows - meat, unbridled consumerism, extreme selfishness etc, these are things with severe side effects. In the case of buying clothes the suffering is a bit more subtle (I suppose you refer to worker&#x27;s conditions in poor countries), and since it&#x27;s paying for someone&#x27;s job somewhere you could argue it&#x27;s in the grey area.\nBut the meat industry isn&#x27;t in the grey area, it couldn&#x27;t be more black than it is.')
