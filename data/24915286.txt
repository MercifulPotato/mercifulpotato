Leaders today want quick results, Fail-fast. These management graduates leading companies today, don&#x27;t understand empathy, research investment, innovation. They don&#x27;t encourage grass-root employees to spend time on their own choices and innovation.. everything had to be justified by business and ROI.. innovation is just a bucket and used to showcase to senior leadership..')
