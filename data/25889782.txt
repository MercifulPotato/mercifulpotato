Scientifically, this MUST be superior to simply replacing the cork (or screw cap in Australia).<p>Iâ€™ve found that if I open the bottle and pour two glasses and immediately seal and vacuum (most of) the air out, I can get about 2-4 days of the wine tasting good stored at room temperature, versus about 1 day simply replacing the lid.')
