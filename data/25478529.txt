Do something about the housing and homeless crisis and we’ll talk.<p>California doesn’t have a money problem. They have a lack of political will problem and an incompetence (or corruption) problem. The state is held hostage by NIMBYs and is chronically unable to build infrastructure. Look at the high speed train disaster for an example of the latter.<p>NIMBYs ensure that any money or effort put into the homeless problem is also wasted, as there is no affordable housing for these people to inhabit even if their mental health issues are dealt with.<p>More money won’t fix these things. It will probably go into the pockets of the people who created these problems.<p>Note that much of what I wrote applies to the USA broadly. We are taxed not much less than Canadians, but have the infrastructure and social services of a “developing” nation.<p>Give me either low taxes at e.g. Costa Rica levels OR shiny infrastructure, free college for my kids, and universal healthcare.<p>Oh wait Costa Rica has universal health care...<p>We are great at setting money on fire in this country.')
