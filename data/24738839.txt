I’m a former Ubuntu user as well. A few months in, I deleted my Windows partition. I’m not running a crazy custom config or anything; I use Gnome and don’t mess with it too much beyond that, though I did uninstall many Gnome packages I don’t use.  I am exceedingly happy using it this way. Everything Just Works. I make a point of updating packages whenever I boot the machine (I really like informant [0], which helps prevent catastrophes by checking arch news for you) and haven’t had any issues. For reference, I’ve got a Ryzen CPU and an Nvidia card.<p>I also use it on my MacBook Pro, but I did have an issue with an update which broke my install. Reinstalling was a little hairier (some kernel flags needed) than on my desktop but now it’s quite stable.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aur.archlinux.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;informant&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aur.archlinux.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;informant&#x2F;</a>')
