First, the relevant rule that is <i>kind of</i> like that is the “salary basis” rule, which doesn&#x27;t apply to all exempt employees; for instance, it does not apply to “Computer professionals who are paid on an hourly basis at a rate not less than $27.63 per hour.”<p>Second, even for exempt employees subject to the salary basis test, they can be subject to workplace conduct rules requiring a set schedule and be subject to disciplinary dock for failing to comply with that conduct rule. The structure of the dock needs to make sense as a disciplinary dock and not be a <i>de facto</i> shift to non-salary pay, but there is absolutely no rule in US federal labor law that “an exempt employee chooses their own hours”.')
