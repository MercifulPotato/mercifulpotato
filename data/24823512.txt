If there&#x27;s only http available, trusted peers are asked for two things: their host caches for that domain and whether or not the data was transferred securely via https (port and protocol).<p>If either of those isn&#x27;t statistically confirmed, it is assumed that the targeted website is compromised.<p>Currently I think this is an as good as possible approach, but otherwise I have no idea on how to verify that the website is legit without introducing too much traffic overhead for the network.<p>Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t trust any http or https with tls &lt; 1.2 website anyways. But whether or not that assumption can be extrapolated...dunno.<p>Do you have another way to verify its authenticity in mind?')
