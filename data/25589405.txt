I read the link you provided, but couldn&#x27;t find any divergence with its text though.<p>Here&#x27;s the line of thought behind my statements if it&#x27;s not clear to you:<p>1) Until a measure is made leading to the collapse of the quantum state qubits remain (possibly) in a superposed state. When a quantum gate is applied to these qubits it affects all superposed states (from a linear algebra point of view).<p>2) I took this statement from Wikipedia [1], forgot to link the source in the article: Simon, Daniel (November 1994). &quot;On the Power of Quantum Computation&quot;. 94 Proceedings of the 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science: 116â€“123.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorith...</a>')
