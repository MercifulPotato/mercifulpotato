Item(by='wazoox', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609338243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25580640, text='I visited some fantastic painted caves in Southern France 2 years ago, around Les Eyzies (where you can visit the extremely famous Cro Magnon, and close to Lascaux). The most impressive is the cave of Combarelles. It&#x27;s a cramped and wet tunnel where only 5 persons and a guide can enter at a time. Lighting is mostly from the guide&#x27;s lamp. You&#x27;re literally watching the engravings on the wall at 50 cm.<p>It will probably be closed to visits forever now. Like Font-de-Gaume, the last cave with polychrome paintings open to the public (you had to come at 8AM to have any chance of entering: it&#x27;s limited to 40 people&#x2F;day).')
