I spend more time downloading packages, and cleaning up the <i>sometimes hundreds of megabytes of random crap</i>, than I do developing. Easily finished small python projects in less time than the download-compile-cycle of Rust.<p>My python projects usually rely almost entirely on the same 3 or 4 already downloaded libraries, plus the large stdlib. They run 3.8. That experience is not comparable, and <i>not</i> in favour of Rust. Maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t use whatever Tox is, but I don&#x27;t. So no. Not beginner friendly.')
