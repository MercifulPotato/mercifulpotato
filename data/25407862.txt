To be honest, if these two were as malleable an objective as the development (usually R&amp;D is easier to speed up) by allowing mass inoculation (rather than individually shipped vials) or reduced safety&#x2F;efficacy then they could be sped up too.<p>And of course, if the govt (leaders) was competent there wouldn&#x27;t have been 300k lives lost, and arguably economic damage could have been minimized as well. I&#x27;d argue that&#x27;s a goal post that moves independent of delivery time.')
