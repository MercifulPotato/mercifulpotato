Of course that ship has sailed long ago, since modern day development seems to be insistent and mushing HTML, CSS and JS together in the same file. <i>Looks is logic is content is looks is a mess.</i><p>HTML&#x2F;CSS was also supposed to be <i>re-usable</i>. Now instead the re-usability is within react&#x2F;angular&#x2F;etc. components, so you now have to use react and javascript everywhere you want to show similar elements - if you want to have the ability to easily change them later.<p>Of course this isn&#x27;t the point. If you have the ability to work with react components, you probably are knowledgeable enough to use CSS.<p>So the only remaining use-case is &quot;way for non-technical people to write objectively bad HTML and have it look nice&quot;.<p>Which again, is fine. Sometimes bad is good enough when the alternative is nothing at all.<p>I&#x27;m still not a fan.')
