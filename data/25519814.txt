Item(by='scotu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608744127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25515139, text='&gt; Aside from outright coercion, marketing is not violence<p>&gt; Fraud and violence should be regulated<p>Fraud is just &quot;fraud&quot; because a law says so, otherwise it would just be a entity taking advantage of some other entity (that has a disparity of information about what is going on). It&#x27;s not violence either, so I&#x27;m surprised you would want fraud to be regulated.<p>I was going to respond further but I think we are in agreement that in the ideal world there would be less regulation. In the real world regulation not always works and has side effects.<p>Some people still think that that imperfect solution is better than letting corporations do whatever they want, and that yes education is good, but (in my opinion) it&#x27;s not only long term &quot;solution&quot;, it might not be enough against psychology.')
