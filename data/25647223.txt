Or perhaps the problem is the source documents.<p>&quot;Ticketmaster&quot; didn&#x27;t do anything. Ticketmaster is a company which cannot make decisions or take actions.<p>- An employee at Ticketmaster stole a password (and financial documents)<p>- Multiple other Ticketmaster employees abused that stolen information to actively attack a competitor.<p>- Ticketmaster management was aware of this and rewarded that employee with a promotion and additional responsibilities.<p>Both the thief and the managers who rewarded the the thief should be going to jail. Instead the company is paying a small fine. I guess at least <i>someone</i> is going to prison, but I doubt all of the parties who were aware are. As usual, the executives in charge walk away.<p>Hopefully there is a class action lawsuit by the shareholders&#x2F; owners of this company against Ticketmaster.')
