Not because you haven&#x27;t done good work on the article: you have. Also not because N.American homes are overheated, and the residents under-dressed: they are. I do not buy it because the Japanese live the way you suggest in the winter, and it is miserable<p>I have a mother in Scotland and I have a mother-in-law in Canada. Worst it ever gets near my mother seems to be -5C, but I am perpetually cold there as people play games with turning their heating off at certain hours and living in 150-year-old converted barns and so on. Meanwhile, in Winnipeg it seems to get to -30C on the reg and I spend all of my time there warm and cosy because if the heating goes off or the house is improperly insulated then you die.')
