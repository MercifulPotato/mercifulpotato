Hard to even think of any - maybe Chrome is faster?. Everything seems a worse , huge-padding, mobile-lookalike travesty of what we had 10 years ago. My daily desktop apps are purposely downgraded to old versions: Office 2007, photoshop CS5, the old windows Photos App (because the windows 10 one crashes!), an old PDF reader, old reddit, VLC and others. I wish i could also downgrade skype or adsense reports, or the bluehost.com control panel, or imgur.com, or the vodafone f*ckin payment page, or paypal all of which waste more of my time than they did before.<p>It&#x27;s sad really, and should be alaming , but who cares when everyone is sleeping upon piles of cash')
