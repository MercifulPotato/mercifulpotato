HN considers itself a cohort with significantly more critical thinking ability, but it will make wide and unsubstantiated, highly upvoted comments whenever a political subject comes up involving censorship, hallucinogens, systemic oppression, or unions.<p>Of course, HN is also an invaluable resource when it comes to tech and sometimes other STEM subjects. It&#x27;s just significantly less valuable for areas completely outside of it. I wouldn&#x27;t trust HN as a neutral or critically thinking source for, say, the usefulness (or lack of usefulness) of gender studies.')
