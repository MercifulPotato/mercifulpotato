In fact, since the institution has a new building it is likely it is increasing access to either education or research opportunities.<p>&gt; Let&#x27;s tax the rich more and give everyone access to higher education...<p>30% of the US does get a degree, so higher education isn&#x27;t exactly an elite marker.<p>[2-4 years of time] X [70% of the US that doesn&#x27;t have a degree] is an enormous number of hours. If someone is not going to use it then they have better things to do than academics. The risk of most of that 70% just looking back at a couple of wasted years is pretty high.<p>I suppose in fairness it might work out, but even now there are a lot of people getting degrees who havn&#x27;t managed to parley it up into better outcomes. But it is likely to be a terrible plan, expensive and with marginal positive outcomes.')
