The trajectory we&#x27;ve been on feels a lot more Bladerunner than it does Star Trek[0] and it&#x27;s honestly somewhat disappointing. All that promise, and possibly all that hubris, come to naught.<p>We have to acknowledge the impact the Cold War had and, perhaps, with it winding down as the 80s wore on the impetus was no longer there. Nobody wanted to spend the money on these grand developments and great explorations any more.<p>Yes, we&#x27;ve sent probes to many parts of the solar system but, whilst much better than not going at all, in no way is this comparable to going ourselves (it&#x27;s much easier and safer, for one thing).<p>It is weird though, because the drive towards flight and, ultimately, space exploration predates the Cold War, kicking off big time back in the Victorian era, so it&#x27;s unclear why the end of the Cold War also marked the end of that era of advancement. I don&#x27;t think it had to be inevitable. Our dreams didn&#x27;t have to become smaller; nobody forced us to become less.<p>(Of course I realise Mars is a <i>much</i> tougher proposition than the moon, but we haven&#x27;t even really bothered to <i>try</i>, which is what frustrates me.)<p><i>[0] Don&#x27;t worry: I realise Star Trek is ridiculous.</i>')
