I&#x27;ll definitely be in line to get it whenever my turn comes.<p>A thing that keeps worrying me is the amount of people I&#x27;ve seen&#x2F;chatted with (empirical evidence) that don&#x27;t trust these vaccines. The most common comments they make are: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be guinea pig&quot;, &quot;How do I know the government won&#x27;t control me&quot;, and more conspiracy theories. All of these fears seem to come from misinformation on the internet, friends and family get a ton of memes&#x2F;fake news through WhatsApp highlighting the unproven negative effects of the vaccine.\nIs there any effective way to control the propagation of misinformation on these platforms?\nHow would one even get started to tackle that problem?')
