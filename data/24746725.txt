That&#x27;s rather a peculiarity of the American system, in Europe, higher ed is more specialized and broad, general liberal arts education ends at the high school level.<p>&gt; But it never actually took the time to train, or grade us on the quality of our solutions to those assignments.<p>I&#x27;ve worked as a teaching assistant, and it&#x27;s often due to a lack of staffing and time. TA&#x27;s are most of the time also PhD students and they have projects to work on and papers to write and giving detailed feedback on assignments is infeasible beyond a certain number of submissions. The same with exams. They are optimized to be easy to unambiguously grade in the shortest time possible. There&#x27;s a conflict between two roles of the university: research and teaching. Research is more important for one&#x27;s advancement, so teaching gets neglected.')
