Renewable energy is getting so cheap that throwing kWh away can be cheaper than the cost of idling other capital infrastructure.<p>We will need to rethink a lot of our economic assumptions in energy very soon. Solar farms are already designed to produce 30% more DC energy than their inverters can handle, because it&#x27;s the lowest cost balance between PV panel capacity and inverter capacity. If somebody has an application for DC energy that can be co-located at solar farms behind inverters, and can be economical running only a few hours a day, there&#x27;s huge amounts of nearly free energy already available.')
