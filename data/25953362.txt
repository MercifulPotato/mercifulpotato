I hated it myself... and then I had to help my parents and grandparents learn the ropes with mobile devices. Turned out that iOS made them more comfortable for one simple reason: no matter where they ended up, if they felt like they were lost or overwhelmed, there was always that physical button, looking the same, and in the same exact place, that they knew would backtrack them back to &quot;the beginning&quot; - i.e. to a known state from which they could try again to do whatever they wanted.<p>So, in some ways, it is genius, and I really hated it when Apple killed it off. The problem wasn&#x27;t the concept itself - it was trying to sell it as UX for <i>everyone</i>. I think that&#x27;s one of the big problems with UX today - the things that are done under the guise of &quot;simplification&quot; aren&#x27;t actually simple.')
