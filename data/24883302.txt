According to him the cubic zirconia is the better option. I have seen many of these scans, and the instruments he uses are pretty impressive.<p>The software that runs the scans allows him view them in 3D with full rotation, correct for scanning errors and make adjustments in real-time, and has a library of cadaver teeth which can be used to automate creating a suitable replacement, which can then be modified to suit. It’s really amazing.<p>Then the milling machine picks its tools and does the carving out of a circular puck of the desired substrate. It’s a closed box and talks to the software over the LAN or USB.<p>After milling the tooth, he color matches it with powders and color swatches and then cures it in a desktop forge. Really quite amazing technology, and it fits in a couple small rooms in his home lab. He makes good money and employs his wife and another tech. Not bad for being your own boss. He gets orders from local and distant dentists, and he loans out his own scanners, as many dentists still use older or lower resolution units.<p>Apparently the milling machine costs around $150K, and the software is also pretty pricey. Not sure about the forge, but it’s also expensive. Not really sure how you would get into this field, but many of the skills seem to be something you can learn on the job. No idea about qualifications or licensing requirements, etc.')
