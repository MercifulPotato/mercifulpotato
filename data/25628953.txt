From being &quot;poor but sexy&quot; to having everything safe, clean and nice and the rents doubled.<p>Artists (of any kind) don&#x27;t make any money, and don&#x27;t want to waste time making money when they could be making art. So they need cheap places to live. Cheap places are cheap for a reason: there&#x27;s no heating, or the roof leaks, or the kitchen isn&#x27;t really a kitchen, or it&#x27;s miles from anywhere you&#x27;d want to go. That doesn&#x27;t matter if what you really want to do is spend every waking moment creatively and around likeminded people.<p>Apparently Leipzig is where the artists from Berlin are moving now, because it&#x27;s cheap. But who wants to live in Leipzig? It&#x27;s a nothing place.<p>Until 20 years from now, when it&#x27;ll be a cultural centre because of all the artists there... and they&#x27;ll have to move on because the rents will be rising.')
