I often hear people argue for &quot;dumbing things down&quot; when there is an overwhelming amount of information, but that phrase:<p>1. Treats people&#x27;s intelligence as 1-dimensional, which it is not.<p>2. Gives no clear direction to an engineer who is passionate about UX, recognises that humans are multidimensional, and is trying to ask about what their users really need.<p>You might say I&#x27;m arguing semantics, but communication matters!<p>Without it, you can write code at high speed, but you won&#x27;t learn what direction to go in order to  present information appropriately and contextually to create a rich but easy, intuitive flow.')
