At 70% (like today in much of the world) that&#x27;s certainly a practical option for most people. At 10% not so much.<p>So what happens is that beyond a certain point it stops making commercial sense to route IPv4 globally. That&#x27;s probably before your 10% mark. So by then there&#x27;s no point bothering with IPv4 for your systems unless you specifically serve that deprived market and will spend money to connect to them specially.<p>For IPv4 users the Internet still mostly works, when their system asks &quot;A? some.website.example&quot; and there is no A record because the IPv4 Internet isn&#x27;t really a thing any more, it gets an answer like &quot;10.20.30.40&quot; where that address was arbitrarily picked as a temporary local assignment for some.website.example. When they connect to 10.20.30.40 a Network Address Translation module behind the scenes does an IPv6 connection to some.website.example and hooks them up.<p>So their copy of Internet Explorer still &quot;works&quot; although some more advanced features are flaky or missing but hey, they know they have crappy 20th century Internet and ought to upgrade.<p>Inside some larger companies there already is no IPv4, and that will spread, inconsistently but it will spread, because IPv4 is a pain in the backside, it&#x27;s easier without it. Translation gateways keep things mostly working enough for people who have IPv4 only, today that&#x27;s the majority, a decade from now it&#x27;s a minority, and eventually it&#x27;s too few people to care about.<p>Eventually (probably much below 10%) the translation gateways are thinly used enough that &quot;nobody&quot; proactively notices if they&#x27;re broken, that&#x27;ll happen in some places faster than others, but the effect is to push those final people to upgrade because it&#x27;s just annoying to always be the person calling your ISP to complain when it breaks.')
