This would make sense not only because, as you say, you can start to approach herd immunity without vaccinating everyone, but also because children are weaker spreaders.<p>Obviously &quot;herd immunity&quot; is more of a gradient than a cut-off, and it&#x27;s much easier to approach it if we can vaccinate everyone, but we can definitely speed up the process (including the months-long process to even get the vaccines to everyone) if we can start vaccinating some people early.')
