I am not saying that the idea would be to have a company where everyone had to have strong personal relationships. My idea was to think of a company that is no bigger than the &quot;number of people that the human mind can keep track of in terms of their identity and relationship to you&quot; (your words) as way to have a company where everyone can at least make a distinction between the individual and the corporation (in my words, &quot;care&quot; about the people).<p>You are right that we should not expect &quot;strong personal relationships&quot; with more than a handful of people. But using Dunbar&#x27;s number was just a way to get an first approximate sense of dimension of a company size that is not so big to the point where individuals become faceless.<p>It&#x27;s more or less like life in a megalopolis vs a small town. Living in a small town does not have a personal connection with everyone, but there is a sense of a &quot;everybody knows each other&quot; even if the town has more than 150 people. less The question would then be: how big can a village or a town be until it loses the &quot;everyone knows each other&quot; feeling?')
