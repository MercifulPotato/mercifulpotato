What value is a child getting from them that they wouldn&#x27;t get from a WhatsApp group? As other commenters have pointed out, these big platforms are engineered to the last detail to &#x27;increase engagement&#x27;. To put it another way - they are purposefully addictive and I don&#x27;t see the value that might make that worthwhile.')
