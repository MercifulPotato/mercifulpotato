(We&#x27;ve also had issues w&#x2F; two files, same name different case. git supports it, but OS X can&#x27;t cope.)<p>FWIW macOS is perfectly fine with it. The FS (both HFS+ and APFS) can be configured to work in CI or CS modes. The default is CI. Since git uses the FS for part of its data storage, things break.<p>Thatâ€™s more of an issue with Git not supporting CI FS, really.')
