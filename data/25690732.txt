Tech&#x27;s revenue is eventually going to dry up, regulations will become tighter and the low hanging fruit will be picked. They&#x27;ll be less willing to pay engineers a senator&#x27;s salary and there will be more engineers to go around too. With this comes discomfort if you&#x27;re a software engineer. Your job begins to become less thinking and more maintenance. Your salary isn&#x27;t what it was, or you get outsourced, or you simply get fired because the company doesn&#x27;t need more than one smart engineer. With this comes politicization.
