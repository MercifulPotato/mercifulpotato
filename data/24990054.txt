This kind of reaction is not exactly anything new; just the medium.<p>I think that pirating streams actually helps to sell music. At least, in my limited sample pool, that has been the case.<p>I used to stream an Internet radio station that played Industrial (dating myself -no one else will), and would often grab songs from it.<p>A lot of times, the only reason that I grabbed it, was so that I could find out more about it. The quality of the audio grab wasn&#x27;t really what I wanted as a &quot;keeper.&quot;<p>These pretty obscure groups made a lot of sales (to me) because they had their stuff out there.')
