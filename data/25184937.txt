I also worked at an insurance company for over five years processing accident claims. This involved training in medical terminology and involved reading medical records daily.<p>But I am generally looking for something more &quot;plain English&quot;&#x2F;layman&#x27;s terms than the titles on that page. And a guy with a PhD in Chemistry once told me, essentially, &quot;Never read the abstract. It often says something different from the study. Read the study or skip it altogether as a waste of your time.&quot;<p>So I would like to live in a world where every research foundation has a page that says something like this (made up example):<p>&quot;We are the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and our research helped develop Hypertonic Saline, a non-drug lung treatment. We were founded in X year and since then life expectancy for CF has gone from about 18 years of age to about 36 years of age. Although a cure is still far off, our work has tremendously improved both survival and quality of life in CF patients (insert more metrics supporting that last statement).&quot;')
