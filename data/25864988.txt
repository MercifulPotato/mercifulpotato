There are plenty of folks on the political right who also don&#x27;t want to be associated with QAnon, insurrection, death threats, and the other stuff that went on in the Parler posts. Don&#x27;t fall into the trap of boxing this just into 50% vs 50%.<p>The reality of the US is: 33.7% of Americans didn&#x27;t even vote in 2020, 34% voted &quot;left&quot;, 31% voted &quot;right&quot; (the rest of the votes went to third party candidates). Those who voted on the right are further subdivided into even smaller groups. One of those smaller groups on the political right side includes extremists who attacked the capitol.<p>Distaste for Parler, due to the actions of some of those extremists who were using it actually crossed political boundaries: folks who didn&#x27;t vote, folks on the &quot;left&quot; and even folks on the &quot;right&quot;. The shunning of Parler isn&#x27;t about &quot;soft power&quot; on the left its about the fact that a small group of people managed to do something so reprehensible that a LOT more than just 50% of people felt that association with them was tainting.')
