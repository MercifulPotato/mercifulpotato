You can test them separately. You can write global reactions to state changes very easily.<p>I find hooks&#x2F;effects better than mobx or redux. hooks&#x2F;effects, redux, mobx would be my preference order. Although redux works so well that it can be used with hooks&#x2F;effects.<p>For global state I would just use a React.Context with it&#x27;s own effects. Most components do not have any async effects.<p>I do admit that when jumping into a new codebase with hooks&#x2F;effects I often find people have just butchered the concept. But I find that when I jump into codebases with mobx and redux too. \nThe butchering that people do with mobx is much worse, with massive module importing of global stores, misuse of `name?: type` inside stores because they want to initialize the store at a later time.')
