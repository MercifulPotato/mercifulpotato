You&#x27;d just grab the ignition and twist it and it would work whether or not the keys were inserted. It also had a keypad on the outside so keys weren&#x27;t necessary at all.<p>Had a couple friends decide I&#x27;d be OK with them borrowing it for 20 mins to go grab groceries or whatever, and more than a few occassions where it was parked in a different spot than I left it.')
