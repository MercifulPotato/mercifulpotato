One doesn&#x27;t need to agree to those terms.<p>Google is continuously trying to transcend this. Look at AMP, which is an attempt to run the entire internet through Google for tracking purposes. The strategy is always the same: Promise some sort of consumer benefit under the condition that everything will be tracked. Yes, one can opt out of targeted advertising, but Google still owns the data and uses it internally.<p>This new play is the exact same thing. As is all other efforts to track people, logged in or not.<p>Your choice is this:<p>Have an account and have everything you do tracked by Google (or the next company), give them all your data to use in their algos, and agree to terms that state that they can do whatever they want with the data. Perhaps then you can disable targeted advertising, although that also doesn&#x27;t really work, does it?<p>Or, second choice, do not have a Google account. However, then you are subject to subversive attempts to track everything you do and use the data whether you want it or not, illegal or not.<p>This goes against some basic tenets of law in many countries. My data is my property, not yours. Google is powerful enough to not care, but make no mistake: People working for Google and making these decisions should be in jail. Any malice and hate targeted toward them is 100% justified.')
