He knows them, and they know him. He won&#x27;t be asked to subjugate his principles to the company in an inappropriate way, in part because others know that he will go above and beyond <i>within his principles</i> to do well for the company.<p>For a business owner, the exact same thing, just replace colleagues et al with customers, suppliers, shareholders, and other partners.<p>On the other hand, a weak business and&#x2F;or business owner will be very vulnerable to principle-based compromise. Out of the need to keep customers, suppliers, et al happy, he is subject to whim and every demand. Walking away from his business means the collapse of his reputation, failing his employees, and failing his family. He is no more free than your average entry level employee.')
