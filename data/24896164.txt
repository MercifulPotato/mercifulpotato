The remote content most vulnerable to hostile change is also remote content already being loaded precisely <i>because</i> it changes; ad scripts, etc. Protecting your jQuery load is nice, and if someone did compromise a CDN&#x27;s jQuery it would be a big issue, but it&#x27;s also not what has been happening in the field. If the content <i>has</i> to change you can&#x27;t SRI it. 2. If you have a piece of remote content that you rigidly want to never change, it&#x27;s much safer to copy it to a location you control, and it&#x27;s almost as easy as SRI. 3. If a subresource fails SRI there&#x27;s no fallback other than simply not loading it, so it has a very graceless failure mode. This combines with #2 to make it even more important to put it in a locally-controlled area. Once local, SRI is more-or-less redundant to what SSL already gives you.<p>Basically, it&#x27;s one of those things that looks kinda cool at first and makes you think maybe you should SRI everything, but the real use cases turn out to be much smaller than that.')
