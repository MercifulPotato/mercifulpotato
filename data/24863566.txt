I will usually look at the main page and open a few links or conversations in new tabs, but for most links I just dip in and out of the comments with my forward and back keys since I&#x27;m mostly trying to just figure out if the entry is worth my time. If it looks like I&#x27;m going to engage with it more I&#x27;ll give it it&#x27;s own tab.<p>Why do you want to remove my choice in the matter?')
