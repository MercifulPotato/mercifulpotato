I have half a million twitter followers, and while I can write it on my blog and then tweet a link, it is nowhere near as effective as just publishing the content directly on Twitter.<p>FWIW, I <i>used to</i> despise it when people did this (post massive threads of messages), but frankly I think they fixed the UI for this years ago, and just don&#x27;t understand the complaints anymore: you click the link, and can scroll through messages as if it were an article.<p>Between it auto-flowing the messages and the longer tweet length of 280 characters, I honestly don&#x27;t see any advantage to those &quot;thread readers&quot; people keep linking to... they don&#x27;t even have larger information density, which is ridiculous. (Hell... they frankly seem to make the text <i>harder</i> to read!)<p>(And yeah: I carefully write my tons of text on Twitter such that every single message is a carefully enough crafted thought that they could just about stand alone, which I think is actually good for the content.)')
