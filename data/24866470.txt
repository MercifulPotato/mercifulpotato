This is probably about as close to an RCT as you can get.  That said, it doesn&#x27;t separate the anesthesia from damage due to the injury itself, or the trauma of the surgery.<p>Still, getting anesthesia for something like a colonoscopy or a root canal strikes me as a very disproportionate risk given the evidence.')
