(There might be some genetical component related to being susceptible to depressions, but that&#x27;s not the point).<p>I was trying to say, that the idea itself is often passed to children,  via non-genetic means, and it will burn out the part of population bearing it.<p>But that&#x27;s not fatal for humanity because there are many smart people who have multiple children, so independently of exact percentage of heritability of intellect we are not doomed.<p>And regarding to the snide comment about Elon, independently of his opinions on any issues, he have done enough to prove that he is smarter and vastly more useful to humanity than average people.')
