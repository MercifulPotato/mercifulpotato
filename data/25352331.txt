Item(by='chadlavi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607466566, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25347418, text='$800 would be outrageous to pay for an iPhone 4. For an iPhone 12? I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s so ridiculous.<p>I&#x27;ve had my current iPhone for 4 years. If I buy one $20 bag of coffee beans a month, then I&#x27;ve spent more for coffee in the last 4 years than I have on my phone. Seems like a good deal to me?')
