The bias appearing to be with the author is insane enough to make me want to question everything that he is saying. While I understand that its an opinion piece and that he could very well be 100% correct about everthing he is saying, the fact that I am getting no context as to who these people are other than &quot;this leader good, this leader bad&quot; makes this article appear to me that this is just some partisan hack complaining about politics he doesn&#x27;t like, just from his own county&#x27;s perspective. This just seems like the same boilerplate article from Democrats in 2016 saying &quot;Now that Trump is elected, America is doomed&quot; and recently from Republicans saying &quot;Now that Biden is elected, America is doomed&quot;, painting their party leaders as great heroes and the opposition as evil villains.<p>Maybe I should have the required knowledge of Indian culture and politics before reading this, but maybe since Bloomberg News is a global paper, not an Indian one, it should spend more time educating people about the facts of who certain politians actually are before resorting to calling them cult leaders.')
