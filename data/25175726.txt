The redesign is actively harmful to the quality of subreddits. It makes the subscribers the ones who dictate the content, not the community members. The vast majority of subs don’t participate in any meaningful way, they just upvote the funny picture in their feed, haha, while the people who frequent the subreddit and dictated most of the content prior to the redesign are completely disenfrachised. I’ve seen a bunch of subreddits go down the shitter because low effort memes and blog posts-like pictures conquered the front page after the redesign.')
