AMD competes mainly on price, which is not a great position to be in. Intel&#x27;s profit margins are massively better.<p>It&#x27;s possible that x86 will become less relevant in the future, but in that case Intel will still be one of the be best chip designers in the industry. They will once again produce ARM chips, perhaps borrow one or two insights from Apple&#x27;s architecture. They will continue to outsource manufacturing to other fabs, perhaps even become fabless.')
