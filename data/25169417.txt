The world went to bigger reactors in the 60s-70s because it ended up being much cheaper than building lots of small ones.  Reactor fabrication is complex, and it&#x27;s easier to just build them bigger.<p>From the 90s to the mid-2000s there was probably a window for development in this area.  But the nuclear sector stagnated as a whole, and then fracking made natural gas cheap enough that people wouldn&#x27;t consider it.<p>The jury is out on SMRs still.  They&#x27;re promising a lot, and the tech and engineering has improved.  But plunging costs of renewables mean the window of opportunity for nuclear tech is probably mostly closed in the West.  This article from a highly respected energy sector analysis group is worth a read: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.bnef.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;scale-up-of-solar-and-wind-puts-existing-coal-gas-at-risk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.bnef.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;scale-up-of-solar-and-wind-puts-...</a><p>India and China are the big markets for nuclear right now -- their energy demands continue to grow, and they&#x27;re building reactors as part of an all-of-the-above model.  France MIGHT be a potential buyer of SMRs (their reactor fleet is getting close to end-of-life), but their nuclear companies have put a lot of push behind the EPR design.')
