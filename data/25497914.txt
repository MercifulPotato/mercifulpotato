My specific situation both times was ER rooms with out of network doctors, but I agree that there can be many other situations where the law is not that helpful. My personal opinion is those would be better managed by a single payer system like they have in many other countries.  I haven&#x27;t looked at the federal law close enough to know if it covers cases other than out of network doctors.')
