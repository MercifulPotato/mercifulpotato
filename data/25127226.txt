Evidence was destroyed.</i><p>&gt;<i>Destroy: transitive verb: to put out of existence.</i><p>As the other commenter stated, nothing was destroyed. Nothing. The <i>plausibility</i> of a certain piece of evidence was called into question, but that&#x27;s not the same as <i>destroying</i> evidence. At all. It just isn&#x27;t. You&#x27;re wrong.<p>For there to be a crime of &quot;destroying evidence&quot; there needs to be a criminal. If the keys are published, who is guilty of destroying evidence? Google? The email user?  Please tell me who should be charged?<p>&gt;<i>No one is auto-disappearing messages.</i><p>End to end encrypted communications platforms Signal[0], WhatsApp[1] and Telegram[2] all offer disappearing messages. These end-to-end encrypted platforms are the de-facto replacement for insecure email.<p>So again, I will ask. How is publishing DKIM keys &quot;destroying evidence&quot; but this isn&#x27;t?<p>&gt;<i>Are you just not learning what words mean?</i><p>Take a hint from the votes. It&#x27;s <i>you</i> who is soundly losing the argument.<p>----<p>If you can&#x27;t articulate (1) <i>who</i> is guilty of &quot;destroying evidence&quot; and (2) <i>why</i> that destruction of evidence is any different from disappearing messages then you have <i>lost the argument</i>.<p>Answer those two questions <i>or</i> concede that &quot;destruction of evidence&quot; has nothing to do with this and you&#x27;ve completely wasted your time (and looked like a total jerk while doing so).<p>-----<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.signal.org&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;360007320771-Set-and-manage-disappearing-messages" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.signal.org&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;360007320771-Se...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faq.whatsapp.com&#x2F;general&#x2F;chats&#x2F;about-disappearing-messages&#x2F;?lang=fb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faq.whatsapp.com&#x2F;general&#x2F;chats&#x2F;about-disappearing-me...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mashable.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;telegram-disappearing-messages&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mashable.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;telegram-disappearing-messag...</a>')
