Item(by='teorema', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602261168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24729310, text='My experience with Julia is that for many (most?) things, you do get a free speedup basically. With other things though, it&#x27;s about the same. What this means in practice is that if you expand your use cases enough, and integrate enough libraries, you&#x27;ll incorporate some bottleneck that slows it down.<p>This is true of a lot of languages, python included, but I think when part of the language&#x27;s selling point is something like &quot;c-like speed with python-like syntax&quot; it can be a little (although not entirely) misleading.<p>Having said that, I still prefer Julia over python (at least for numerical computing, not so sure about other things). I just like the language more. I also think, with some exceptions, that I don&#x27;t have the same dependency hell problems that I&#x27;ve run into with python. Even now, I&#x27;m in the process of switching over to Julia from python for a project because the python library I&#x27;m using depends on about 6 different other libraries, but only specific versions, that you have to run in a specific standalone conda environment to avoid using the wrong combination of packages, all of which are pre-python3, and so forth and so on. Even then, when you manage to thread the needle, it still falls apart later for unknown reasons. This is surely this particular package, but my experience with Julia is that things are much cleaner (R is similarly problem-free usually but it&#x27;s a lot slower and Julia as a language is more coherent to me).<p>I&#x27;d really prefer something like Nim to be seeing the attention that Julia is getting, something more general-purpose, but there&#x27;s no consensus of momentum around something like that at the moment. Maybe in the near future ocaml will pick up steam, or maybe the next version of C++ will essentially make it look like python, or maybe there will be something not quite on people&#x27;s radar at the moment, but at the moment it is what it is.')
