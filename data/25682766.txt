Evaluate the temporaries, move &#x2F; copy into the right place, run destructors, jump? Copy elision might be hard to pull off I suppose.<p>Edit: Hmm there is an issue in handling the stack space I suppose, because there are live old parameter objects already in the place you want to put your new parameters. An ugly but possibly workable way of handling it is to have two areas for parameters. One used for odd recursion depths and another used for even ones.')
