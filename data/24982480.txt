It will provide some incentive for artists to pick tracks that will be popular enough to compensate for the reduced per play-profit, if they do this well, it&#x27;s also a track that listeners are likely to appreciate. Basically the incentives here align, and as long as they don&#x27;t start removing the existing mechanisms for discovery, there&#x27;s nothing forcing artists to opt in to this.')
