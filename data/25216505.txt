Item(by='eucryphia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606360435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25216218, text='My group of acquaintance agree not to exchange gifts, we take turns buying beers when we get together.<p>After my being embarrassed in the first year of my marriage by an expensive gift from a poor member of the extended family, I suggested to my wife that she and her sister in-law pull names out of a hat, where one family member buys one thing for one other member. It&#x27;s common knowledge I really like business socks and a casual shirt. I often get the black sheep of the family, who looks forward to his bottle of bourbon, I&#x27;m told he makes it last several months.<p>For close family, we decide on a more expensive &#x27;family present&#x27; which might be a new TV or a holiday, usually a road trip. One year it was to replace the broken air-conditioner.<p>I encourage my kids to buy experiences, not &#x27;stuff&#x27;. I still get nice hand drawn gift cards with socks or joke T-shirts.<p>My wife is the fussiest person in town so I ask her what she would like, and she knows my favourite gift is the smile on her face when I give it to her.')
