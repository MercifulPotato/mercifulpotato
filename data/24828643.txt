I just weighed a baseball sized potato I dug last week, and it was 7.5 oz (~1&#x2F;2 lb, 200 g).   So if you are picturing an average baked potato, it&#x27;s probably only 30 potatoes per day.   Which, granted, is still a lot.<p>Cooking time doesn&#x27;t strike me as a problem.  Boiling 30 potatoes does take somewhat longer than boiling 1 potato because the mass is greater, but it&#x27;s pretty much boil and forget.  Also, the boiling can probably be done by one of those women or children who are only eating 10 potatoes a day!')
