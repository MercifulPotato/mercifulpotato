That&#x27;s ludicrous honestly.<p>There have been a number of reddit alternatives over the years, typically the result of some act of over-moderation that drives angry people to alternatives. These always become cesspools of hate &amp; racism because they advertise as &#x27;free speech&#x27; alternatives (due to swinging too far in the opposite direction that drove people there in the first place).<p>I think most people who want to use the old interface are simply just using the old interface. Until they completely drop it I don&#x27;t think that will change. Because anyone can start a reddit clone but it&#x27;s useless until you can convince a mass amount of users to switch &amp; stay there, which is extremely difficult.')
