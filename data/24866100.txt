Item(by='barumi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603428056, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24858511, text='&gt; The problem is that it will move teenagers out of bicycles, scooters, and public transport, thus making roads busier.<p>These kids are not zipping around in bicycles or scooters. They are either being driven around by their parents or Uber&#x2F;taxi drivers in their 2-ton 6-seaters or being zipped around in taxis.<p>These modes of transportation are not a panacea but nothing is, and mindlessly parroting &quot;use bicycles!&quot; does absolutely nothing to address the problem. I&#x27;m pretty sure people already know that bicycles exist for a couple of centuries now but somehow they choose not to use them in spite of the colossal cost of purchasing and maintaining a motorized vehicle.<p>These vehicles pollute less, have a smaller footprint, are safer, are hard to steal, and are affordable. More importantly, they are real, exist today, don&#x27;t require retrofitting the current system nor do they require legislation changes. Sounds like an improvement.')
