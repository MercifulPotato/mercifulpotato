If I put the effort in then I know I could have a solid grasp of all stages at once but it would be a waste. If you&#x27;re programming in assembly then you&#x27;re dealing with instruction sets. You don&#x27;t need to know how transistors make up a NAND gate to program with instructions, or even how gates fit together to make higher order components. You just need to need you have a processor and memory.')
