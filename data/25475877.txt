The install base for next gen consoles is nil compared to the ~114mm PS4 and ~48mm Xbox one units sold. Given that they clearly wanted to sell to this customer base they damn well should have been optimizing for at least the pro models. I’d be choked if I was Microsoft or Sony because up until very recently (until the current base&#x2F;pro split) the implicit contract with consoles was that games would run well on them. (With a few noteworthy exceptions in the past.) This release breaks that contract and this hurts confidence in consoles.<p>Unfortunately targeting next gen for a holiday 2020 launch isn’t realistic when you can’t actually get the hardware.')
