Tell me the definition. I don&#x27;t think there is a different definition. I think it&#x27;s just that most people aren&#x27;t sure why Haskell is &quot;better&quot; than say C++.... They know it&#x27;s &quot;better&quot; but they can&#x27;t put their finger on &quot;why&quot; and they mistakenly attribute it to a more powerful language without thinking that Haskell is actually less powerful in every possible way.<p>The set of all things you can do to your computer with Haskell is less than the things you can do to it with C++. If you look at it from every possible angle you will see that either you do less with Haskell or Haskell makes it Much harder to do certain things. There&#x27;s really no angle where you can say Haskell is more powerful than C++ unless you really stretch the definition which I&#x27;m sure your subsequent reply (if you reply at all) will be doing.')
