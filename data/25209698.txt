If the idea&#x2F;app is a bust you&#x27;ve invested in the least expensive type of app to deliver (and the assets can probably be reused later in other ideas).<p>And if it <i>does</i> take off it not only fully supported on Android and mostly supported on iOS, it will run on Windows Phone, Pine Phone, the Librem 5, and anything else with an HTML5 compliant browser on board.<p>(And if you need full hardware access on iOS, going from PWA to Hybrid app delivered through the app store is a quick and easy upgrade.)')
