Hear me out....<p>Today, you could have bought AMZN stock for $3442.93 at some point during the day.  AMZN nominally has $0.01 price increments. To put that in perspective, 0.01 divided by the share price is 344,293 which means we can affect price in 1&#x2F;344,293 of a share.  That’s nuts, and actually <i>removes</i> liquidity.<p>Instead, pricing change minimums should be a percentage of a share.  I would think 1&#x2F;10,000th of a share would be more than enough.<p>Honestly, for most stocks, a nickel difference wouldn’t matter and the liquidity would be better.<p>—-<p>EDIT : meant to also add that change the time minimums to also be larger (say 1&#x2F;10 of a second) would also help liquidity and remove the need for HFT.  So, timing&#x2F;pricing deltas can either increase or decrease the need for HFT.')
