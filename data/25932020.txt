You can imagine estimating the worth (a.k.a., &quot;net present value&quot;) of a company based on its future dividends (or stock buybacks).  But any formula will contain a lot of probabilities of when each dividend will occur, the amount, and the discount factor (that is, how much future money is worth today).  So what you get is actually a distribution of how much a company is worth.<p>The stock market doesn&#x27;t deal with distributions directly.  It uses options.  A call option is the ability to buy a stock at a given price called the &quot;strike price&quot;.  So, from the prices for two call options, you can infer the probability that the stock&#x27;s worth is between their strike prices.')
