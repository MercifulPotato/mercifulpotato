It requires you to use your bank&#x27;s app to generate a 6-digit, single-use code that&#x27;s valid for two minutes. That&#x27;s the only piece of information you give to the merchant, so transactions are fully anonymous (as far as the merchant is concerned). They can&#x27;t even link transactions from the same account.<p>After the code is processed, you get a request on your phone, with the merchant&#x27;s verified name, the transaction amount, and the title of the transaction. You&#x27;re able to deny this request, so it&#x27;s perfectly safe to give your code to someone you don&#x27;t fully trust, i.e. to let a child buy something, or if it&#x27;s just more convenient if someone makes a purchase for you, but you still want to pay for it. That happens surprisingly often in families, where you&#x27;re talking about a particular product, one person looks it up and is ready to purchase, but you&#x27;re the one who actually wants it. You also don&#x27;t have to worry about the security of the device you&#x27;re entering the code on.<p>Of course, since entering a code is so easy, this often also works in ATMs and shops. You don&#x27;t need fancy, super-secure  hardware to process BLIK transactions, anything with a keypad and an internet connection will do.')
