I am not sure what perspective you are making that statement from. I am coming at it by looking at the actions of Senate Republicans for the past decade. We absolutely must judge parties by what they <i>do</i>. A party that exists simply for the sake of obstruction, while claiming lies as its policy platform during elections, must be called out as such: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanprogress.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;courts&#x2F;news&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;14&#x2F;141210&#x2F;mitch-mcconnell-a-legacy-of-obstruction&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanprogress.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;courts&#x2F;news&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;...</a><p>&gt; In the real world the democratic system should also protect against &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. Many checks and balances exists in particular to avoid that tyranny, not just three branches you mentioned.<p>They haven&#x27;t really succeeded in doing that, if you look at American history. The majority in the US has always behaved in a tyrannical fashion, making it difficult or impossible for the minority to succeed. This happened first with the Protestant majority, then the White majority. When it couldn&#x27;t do so explicitly, it did so via implicit structures that enforced this.<p>So the argument of filibuster as a check against the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; also doesn&#x27;t really hold, through experience. Its also a fundamentally racist structure: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;senate-filibuster-monument-white-supremacy&#x2F;613579&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;senate-fil...</a>')
