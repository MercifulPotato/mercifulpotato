The advantage of PlentyFS is that it effectively requires <i>no</i> storage anywhere.<p>I didn&#x27;t write PlentyFS, but was participating (mostly not helpfully) in Lars Wirzenius&#x27;s thread on Mastodon.<p>My idea was to look at an HTTP or WebDAV solution using FUSE.  The server would &quot;create&#x27; the content (thinking along the line of HTTP honeypots), the FUSE module would present the filesystem-based access.  There&#x27;s an existing WebFS fuse modele, also a WebDAV one IIRC.<p>Unfortunately, HHTP doesn&#x27;t offer directory presentation, making full filesystem semantics difficult.<p>I&#x27;m looking at other possible options as well, the concept is interesting.')
