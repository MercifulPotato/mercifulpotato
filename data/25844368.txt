Well, if your programming language internally implements &quot;arrays&quot; as hashmaps, then you&#x27;ve already lost performance-wise, of course.<p>&gt; <i>Why would you need to use &quot;modulo and division into round&#x2F;ceil&#x2F;floor&quot; on array offsets?</i><p>Whenever you&#x27;re working with 2D&#x2F;3D data in manually managed memory.<p>&gt; <i>How often you do it?</i><p>When you&#x27;re writing web services? Probably not so much. When you&#x27;re doing image manipulation or 3D graphics? All the time.')
