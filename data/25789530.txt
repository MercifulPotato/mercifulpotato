We know those never get abused.<p>No, like catastrophic loss of data, hence why I outlined a process of a doing this <i>temporarily</i> in the case of agreement with a another party to put the data entirely beyond your own use unless the party you&#x27;ve agreed the deletion with agrees the situation is serious enough.<p>&gt; But we need a search warrant to access the backup anyway so we don&#x27;t really have to delete it. Best keep it, just in case.<p>If you don&#x27;t trust the party to delete the data, then adding in a temporary period of retention makes no difference, because in that case they could just as well have ignored the demand for the initial deletion entirely.')
