Since there are no 6Ghz Spectrum time table in China. The official webpage for AX6000 is here [1] ( In Chinese ) And after I have made multiple enquiry to WiFI Alliance and Xiaomi they have somehow removed all mention of &quot;WiFI 6E&quot; from their pages. Instead referring it to WiFI 6 &quot;enhanced&quot;. You can still see some site [2] and here [3] referring it to WiFi 6E. But I think within the last 48 hours they are actively removing all WiFI6E reference.<p>Not sure if it has anything to do with my enquiry, considering no one on the internet actually cared to question and ask I would like to take some credit for it :D<p>I would expect 6Ghz to work as advertise from Intel with software update. It is Intel after all and they have at least listed 6Ghz as being officially supported.<p>Apology If I had caused any confusion.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mi.com&#x2F;r6000" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mi.com&#x2F;r6000</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gsmarena.com&#x2F;xiaomi_demos_its_wifi_6e_ax6000_router_by_pitting_the_xiaomi_mi_11_against_the_iphone_12_pro_max-news-46996.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gsmarena.com&#x2F;xiaomi_demos_its_wifi_6e_ax6000_rou...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notebookcheck.net&#x2F;Xiaomi-promotes-its-new-Wi-Fi-6E-router-with-an-Apple-baiting-YouTube-video.512923.0.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notebookcheck.net&#x2F;Xiaomi-promotes-its-new-Wi-Fi-...</a>')
