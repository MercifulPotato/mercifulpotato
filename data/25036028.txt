I&#x27;d argue their bundle is just getting started.<p>---<p>To address your points:<p>&gt; Apple have taken their absolute dominance in selling music and moved to middle of the pack in music streaming squeezed between Spotify and Youtube.<p>This is your point I agree with most, Apple music just isn&#x27;t as good and its shocking they lost so much ground.<p>&gt; Apple&#x27;s Siri is distinctly second tier, losing them both for Apple Music, but also potential shopping via smart assistant.<p>Siri just isn&#x27;t good but honestly how many people use voice assistants for more than changing songs or checking the weather?<p>&gt; Cloud comes across as Apple nickle and dime-ing their customers, insisting you need to back up your phone but providing laughable amounts of storage for free - and then becoming nagware<p>Agreed it is laughable but I would argue people concerned with backing up all their devices are in the minority of Apple customers. It wouldn&#x27;t be why most people pay $15 a month.<p>&gt; Finally you&#x27;ve got the Appstore. Apple is getting absolutely hammered on their 30% fee. At this point it looks almost certain that they&#x27;ll either change their fee structure or face regulatory action.<p>I don&#x27;t really see how this is relevant to the mediocre services Apple offers except it is an unfair advantage they have on other SaaS competitors. I suspect it may be one of the reasons they haven&#x27;t already decided to swallow SaaS competitors like Spotify, so they can say the app store is competitive and not disturb the golden goose that is the 30% fee.<p>&gt; If Apple is a services company why isn&#x27;t FaceTime adding $100Bn of market cap to Apple&#x27;s value as a competitor to Zoom?<p>I don&#x27;t think market caps, especially with the past years stock market, tell us much about the effectiveness of services. However, Apple&#x27;s current market cap is 2 trillion, 20 times the cap of Zoom. To add to this, Zooms P&#x2F;E ratio is 530 compared to Apples P&#x2F;E of 36 which indicates Zoom is wildly overvalued. Even if it was a useful comparison Apple is in a different league.<p>---<p>I think Apple&#x27;s biggest problem is the lack of one killer service to offer as part of their bundle. If they offered mediocre Apple music, Apple fitness and Apple arcade but Apple TV was on par with Netflix most people would use the mediocre services to save on the gaining number of other SaaS products modern consumers pay for.<p>Apple has the money and talent to create one killer service, they just haven&#x27;t been running a lot of their services long enough to be killers - (with the exception of music). I think it&#x27;s just a matter of time until Apple create a killer service and people getting sick of paying for multiple SaaS products.')
