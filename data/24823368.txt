It&#x27;s not because their diet is actually healthier per-se, same as healing crystals do not work. But a vegan person, same as a person using healing crystals is likely to be a strongly biased sample of the population. They tend to be more aware of their lives, their bodies and the consequences of what they do to their bodies. And that, as a net effect, yields a healthier lifestyle on average.<p>But an unhealthy person will never get healthy by eating vegan, same as they won&#x27;t get healthy by using healing crystals. It only works if you embrace the lifestyle and accept it mentally and become a &quot;biased sample&quot; yourself.')
