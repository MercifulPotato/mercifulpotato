I have killed many with rifle and bow, from treestands and from the ground, in rural Missouri and Colorado. I replied to an observation about suburban Midwestern USA deer, which is a completely different thing. Deer that won&#x27;t leave your yard can be killed with a crossbow shot from your back porch. I recommended a crossbow because they are legal in most states now during the lengthy bow seasons (a development to which I strenuously if foolishly objected), they aren&#x27;t as disturbing to your neighbors, and they are safer to use in a suburban setting.<p>I certainly don&#x27;t recommend anyone &quot;stalk&quot; across the denuded Scottish hills.')
