Give it a replaceable facade and no one would ever know when it&#x27;s 10+ years old.<p>I don&#x27;t need fancy apps, or screens, I don&#x27;t want the internet on my fridge... Just give me enough space for my food and keep it the right temperature! Same with the dishwasher, just make it work well and don&#x27;t build everything out of plastic and I bet it would last a lot longer...')
