It didn&#x27;t have any glitches during normal usage but it quickly fell apart when challenged, obviously. So it&#x27;s probably still too early and we need more distros picking Wayland up and help stabilise.<p>What didn&#x27;t help was probably the desire to force myself into liking GNOME, when normally, I fall naturally into the KDE camp, because it is beautiful without having to make things too simple, like GNOME does. Even though I agree with many of the things GNOME stands for, there is lots of stuff you wouldn&#x27;t NEED to customise, or use.<p>Will consider KDE on my next attempt!')
