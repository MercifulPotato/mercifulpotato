I don’t think it’s a job that should necessarily make me very <i>rich</i> though. Taking risk should, but just creating value that someone else can produce? There is talent scarcity but not <i>that</i> much scarcity. Other people would do my job at my pay (which I guess ties into the topic!)<p>With the highest salaries perhaps 20-40% higher than mine and marginal tax 50% making that 10-20%, the prospect is basically, would I switch jobs a few times for that little, when I like my situation?<p>If the ceiling was higher, I’d switch. It’s a self fulfilling prophecy :)')
