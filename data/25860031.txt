We <i>know</i> that the amount of energy required to accelerate an object increases as its speed approaches the speed of light. We have observed this effect. New physics will never contradict this - they may just put it in a new light, or perhaps discover a new dimension. But they will not invalidate the measurements we have so far.<p>Note that the observations done in Newton&#x27;s time were never proved wrong - we just discovered that with better measurement precision and in different regimes of speed, they turn out to have additional small terms.<p>It is perfectly possible that we&#x27;ll discover additional extremely weak forces and effects, and they may completely contradict our interpretations of the physical theories we&#x27;ve discovered, but they are unlikely to prove that the facts (measurements themselves) we know now are wrong, at least in the regimes we&#x27;ve noticed them.')
