I just know that sometimes everything shifts down on the screen and it has never been on purpose, and then I have to figure out how to undo it - usually by turning the screen off and back on.<p>I am on the 11 (I think? I&#x27;ve lost track, but its the one with three cameras), and the screen is slightly too large for easy one-handed use, at least in my case. I might opt for the mini if&#x2F;when I decided to get a new phone, but throwing $1000 at a new toy just because it&#x27;s <i>slightly</i> more comfortable in my hand feels like a very &quot;first-world&quot; solution to a not-really-problem. None of the other features this phone comes with feel like they bring any extra value to my life or warrant an upgrade.<p>But hey, newer, faster chips mean it can probably run Doom now, right?')
