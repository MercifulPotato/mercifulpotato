Item(by='jodrellblank', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602302583, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24726767, text='&quot;If I joined a more powerful group, I&#x27;d vote myself a pay cut, so more powerful groups are bad&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a comment. Unions don&#x27;t mean you <i>have</i> to vote yourselves a pay limit anymore than Democracy voting in a minimum wage means everyone in the country must earn the minimum wage. Unions don&#x27;t mean that poor workers <i>cannot</i> be &#x27;punished&#x27; with unemployment anymore than Democracy means criminals cannot be punished. A union is employees pooling forces <i>for the benefit of employees</i>, what else even makes sense? How can you on the one hand say your <i>current coworkers</i> are so awful that you don&#x27;t want to co-negotiate with them, and the reason you don&#x27;t want to do that is because then you&#x27;d have to work with them? If they are awful and not being fired right now, anti-unioning isn&#x27;t getting them fired, is it?<p>&gt; The numbers I am throwing around are pretty standard, for people working at top tech companies, and I know this because this is what many of my personal friends, with the same level of experience as me are making. None of them work at &quot;union shops&quot; though.<p>Dan Luu estimates on his blog that one piece of work he did saved his employer millions, yet he got no extra money for it. How do you know that 300k is as much as you could possibly get if all of you 1% exceptional people worked together? What makes you think that a union of top tier tech workers would get the same results as a union from a steel works? Why do so many people from the &quot;United&quot; States, living under the benefit of a massive combined armed-forces strong-arming the planet, think that combining forces is a dumb idea for dumb people which can&#x27;t work ... when the people who get paid most (CEOs, board members) act together against lower level employees to keep that being the case?<p>That&#x27;s getting into Michael O&#x27;Church territory, but you&#x27;re talking about your salary when you could be inverting the structure of the company putting tech people right on top, or something.')
