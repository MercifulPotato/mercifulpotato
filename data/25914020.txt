Articles of Unity was silenced during the entire period where it had any relevance and momentum. That the election has come and gone, and Weinstein has long stopped pumping it, explains 100 followers of a downstream account that I haven’t even heard of by the way as an avid Weinstein listener (both of them).<p>Weinstein says that Twitter never gave them a reason for the ban, and even after getting a line to Dorsey, the most Twitter would do is allow people to link to Articles of Unity on the app. It’s still banned. And when you link it PM, it still gives you a “suspicious content” warning[1]. That doesn’t just seem like a follower inflation punishment to me. It’s also not the precedent.<p>That defeats your theory on my eyes. As for a reasonable reason that AoU was banned, the most likely one to me is that someone at Twitter didn’t like that AoU was getting hashtags to trend that put people against both Trump and Biden during a critical moment in the race. Their movement would likely hurt Biden the most as it would splinter the “anyone but Trump” voter. Btw asking if Twitter banned AoU because Twitter hates unity is a very weak attempt at brainstorming the truth, is that really where your analysis ended?<p>Twitter has super selective inexplicable inconsistent bans all the time. Like “men aren’t women” getting you suspended while “kill all men” does not. Twitter has obvious heavy handed biases, so don’t overthink it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;bootylactin&#x2F;status&#x2F;1351278941751926788" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;bootylactin&#x2F;status&#x2F;1351278941751926788</a>')
