Embedding youtube into every &quot;smart&quot; device on the face of the planet probably requires that google maintain a fairly consistent private API which all of these devices can communicate with. If someone were to reverse engineer one of these devices or just throw wireshark on the WLAN, it probably wouldn&#x27;t take long to emulate the same approach...<p>What is stopping someone from using these types of internal interfaces instead of the public ones?')
