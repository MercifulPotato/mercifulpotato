I welcome corrections, but there is a wealth of literature on this topic. For the past two to three decades there has been a small cottage industry of research in Liquidity Savings Mechanisms that are designed to prevent this scenario through clever system design.<p>These mechanisms have been evaluated, simulated, and tested by central banks at greater volumes than DTCC&#x27;s system. The difference here is in orders of magnitude. The Feds handle $2+Tn.&#x2F;day. They handle $500Bn&#x2F;day at most. If the Feds can introduce these systems and maintain liquidity, then what reasoning does DTCC have?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorkfed.org&#x2F;medialibrary&#x2F;media&#x2F;research&#x2F;epr&#x2F;08v14n2&#x2F;0809mcan.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorkfed.org&#x2F;medialibrary&#x2F;media&#x2F;research&#x2F;epr&#x2F;0...</a><p>I am loathe to cast aspersions, but the aspersion I&#x27;m casting here is that they&#x27;re dragging their feet, as it would effectively end an entire sub-sector of the industry. Or, at the very least, substantially re-order it. This inefficiency is someone&#x27;s margin and profit.')
