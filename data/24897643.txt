People are willing to support projects for tens of billions of dollars not just with no guarantee of useful results, but with a every reason to think that the results won&#x27;t be useful. The LHC is disappointing in the sense that it didn&#x27;t turn up anything unexpected, but we knew that the enrgy scale required for unexpected results are much, much, much higher.<p>We hoped for better, and didn&#x27;t get it. Billions of dollars is a lot of money to spend on hope.<p>We spend it because people love the hope that high-energy physics gives. Twentieth century physics had amazing benefits, both practical and intellectual. We could never have dreamed it would be so productive. We crave more.<p>Scientists know the limitations, but I think that people in general don&#x27;t. And thats where Hossenfelder comes in, and why she always sounds so sour. She&#x27;s telling people what the physicists already know and don&#x27;t want to hear. She&#x27;s dashing hope.<p>It&#x27;s a hope that doesn&#x27;t need to be dashed. The next LHC <i>could</i> produce something as important as the transistor or as philosophically edifying as the CMB. But is that &quot;could&quot; really worth it?<p>I believe that if people were really honest they&#x27;d spend the money on thousands of much smaller experiments and theoretical projects, rather than putting all of their eggs into one rather dubious basket. But people have a lot of really unjustified faith in that basket -- as jaw-dropping as &quot;20th century physics&quot; was, it&#x27;s been the 21st century for a really long time, and we haven&#x27;t gotten jaw-dropping results like that in even longer.<p>I feel the same way that Hossenfelder seems very sour. I, too, want her to be wrong. But she&#x27;s not.')
