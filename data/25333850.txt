Much of that is likely to the benefit of all backends, but some of it surely is specific to Intel.<p>IMO this bit right here is worthy of highlighting again:<p>&gt; Especially when you consider that during the build the workstation is belching hot air and screaming like an airplane about to take off while M1 is whisper-quiet with barely warm air coming from its exhaust.<p>I have <i>never</i> run a significant amount of compilation on any machine that didn&#x27;t hit heat issues. So either the M1 is doing very well at managing heat, or Clang is doing incredibly poorly at exploiting the full system. In either case this makes the M1 look like something special.')
