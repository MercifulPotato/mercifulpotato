Not because I think it&#x27;s a hoax but because the alternative violates the non aggression principle. Is freedom more important to me than 1% of the population dead? Sure.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily think the government is doing it on purpose and colluding with big businesses that are profiting from the situation, I think it&#x27;s more likely that politicians are just incompetent (they need to save face with people who are pro and against a lockdown) and that big companies are better positioned and can push the government a bit to get what they want. As usual.<p>If you fear for you life isolate yourself. If you can&#x27;t afford to isolate ask for charitable donations (even if the more preferred approach has been to just give taxpayers money, taken with force from everyone).<p>I isolated myself and my family 2 weeks before the government forced a lockdown on us, because there was no data and I was scared of the mortality rate. After seeing the mortality rate and the age range, I stopped caring but I started keeping a distance from old people.\nI still led a pretty isolated life for personal reasons - and wore my mask to avoid fines and to respect my social contract with society, which took this decision against my will.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely curious to see if the doomsday is going to arrive or not in 2-4 weeks time.<p>If it does, I hope it will crash the economy and that I&#x27;ll make a profit or that house prices will go down (assuming I don&#x27;t die, given my kids go to nursery and are probably spreading all kind of viruses).<p>If it doesn&#x27;t, your argument won&#x27;t look very good and you&#x27;ll regret calling idiots those with a different opinion. And I guess there is still a chance of an economy crash, given the lockdown.<p>Maybe this will be a bit of a wakeup call.')
