Does that count? It counts because it&#x27;s within a six month period starting Dec 31 2020. It doesn&#x27;t count because the duration of the bet was 2017 to 2020, and therefore wouldn&#x27;t include 2021. Wouldn&#x27;t have been less confusing to state the terms as &quot;within a six month period <i>ending</i> no later than Dec 31 02020&quot; (if that&#x27;s what was intended)?<p>What if the event happened on Jan 15 2021 followed by a million casualties. Does that count? Jan 15 2021 is within &quot;a six month period starting no later than Dec 31 02020&quot;. If that&#x27;s the case, the duration of the bet is 2017 to Jun 30 2021.')
