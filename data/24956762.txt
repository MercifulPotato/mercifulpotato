For e.g., Dieter truly explored texture of the surfaces not from an aesthetic goal, but as a tool to aid functionlism (knobs have knurling, sliders have striations, grippy things had rough texture, areas that shouldn&#x27;t be touched were gloss). Jony just made things beautiful that sold well because that&#x27;s what sells. That&#x27;s what luxury brands do.<p>He threw away the german functionalism that Dieter is so well known for, and adopted the hollow aesthetics of his work. Jony was obsessed with <i>how a thing looks</i> more than <i>how a think works</i> (besides the fact that Apple mouse is horrendous to use, it at one point had a charging port <i>under</i> the mouse). He ignored and still to this day ignores ergonomics, transparency, affordances, feedback and many aspects of design that are fundamental to designing a product that interfaces with humans. Instead of looking up to the challenge to make products more usable whilst keeping a consistent coherent aesthetics, he prefers to hide things or flat out omit important features so that the design is clean. He almost had an authoritarian role at Apple - engineering had to bow down to him.<p>About the only thing Jony Ive did with Dieter Rams was adopted minimalism for the sake of aesthetic goals. Dieter would never design a clock that had a transparent face, made legibility poor and had white numerals on clear glass (which does not guarantee contrast): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;watchesbysjx.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;jaeger-lecoultre-newson-atmos-and-memovox-customised-by-jony-ive-and-marc-newson-for-red-charity.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;watchesbysjx.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;jaeger-lecoultre-newson-atm...</a><p>Jony Ive IMO is one of the worst designers in modern history despite of his success.')
