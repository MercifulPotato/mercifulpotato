Now, &quot;possible states&quot; are capped because if the state is finite in size, the number of possible states is less or equal than all permutations of it (permutations == possible states).<p>It is largely philosophical question which is &quot;memory&quot; available to the program and which is &quot;Turing machine state&quot;. In case of real programs we see that memory can be reassigned depending on requirements.<p>There are some cases when the distinction becomes important in reality. Consider a trained AI that gets &quot;baked in&quot; and shipped to the user to compress&#x2F;decompress images.<p>Let&#x27;s say it does fantastic job at compression and decompression but takes 2GB of disk storage and memory when executing.<p>If you just compress a single small image you realistically need to send 2GB of the AI plus the very small image, but when you have billions of images this static cost of the AI gets amortized.<p>The same way happens when you run any real program on an operating system. In reality the program is much larger because even if it prints Hello World it still needs to do a bunch of data like recognize your monitor it is talking to. We conveniently package the common parts of the program as &quot;Operating System&quot; and then just let exchanging the small part that will make sense when coupled with correct OS.<p>That&#x27;s also how you can have very small webpage that takes GBs of memory to execute... sadly...')
