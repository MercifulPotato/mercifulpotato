The author of the article has also posted a refutation of the counterpoints, with no substantive replies by Kinkajoe.<p>The overarching point that guzey makes is &quot;the book is not scientifically sound, despite Matthew Walker plainly stating in the introduction that it would be&quot;. Arguing that Walker&#x27;s claims are &quot;hyperbolic, [but] within reason&quot;, that it&#x27;s ok because &quot;it is a book intended for the public&quot; or that all this is &quot;justified by the important message he is trying to convey&quot; is completely besides the point! That may all be true and not change the needle one bit on &quot;scientifically accurate&quot;.<p>Making up unsubstantiated claims to &quot;&quot;convey a message&quot;&quot; in a book <i>and then later citing the book in your own scientific papers</i> is the exact opposite of academic integrity. Hence my advice to take Walker&#x27;s work with an appropriate grain of salt.')
