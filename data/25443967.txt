Nothing changed about that under the Affordable Care Act; it excluded some low-quality insurances and established a government exchange for locating insurers, but you still pick the one you want (or opt out). You can shop around for doctors and hospitals to your heart&#x27;s content, especially if you want to pay for it out of pocket. You can even haggle on the price.<p>Many other countries have a single government health system that everybody belongs to. When the UK PM got COVID, he went to exactly the same health care system everybody else did. Others, like Germany, have private insurers, but the government limits prices. And the taxpayer-funded public health care system covers 90% of people.<p>In the US it varies a lot state to state. The federal government has relatively little say in it (and had even less before the ACA and HIPAA). It&#x27;s dominated by some very large corporations which fight fiercely with each other.')
