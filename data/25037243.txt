For example, a court in NJ may ignore a case but federal courts may take it up. You can even have split circuits depending on the part of the country the cases were filed in. This leads to one court stating that something is a federally protected right, while a different circuit may rule th opposite. In some of these cases, SCOTUS may decline the case. In that event, you have part of the country being guaranteed a right while the other part might not be, and I believe that would violate equal protection under the law. Not settling the matter in this sort of scenario would in my eyes be &quot;not caring&quot;.')
