We do this by providing shareholders of private companies with liquidity so that they can exercise their options or access capital for personal use. We build technology products that help private company employees make the most of their equity and make more informed decisions. By simplifying their equity compensation, employees can spend more time on things they love doing most. We have offices in Amsterdam and San Francisco.<p>For example: one of the most complicated things for employees is figuring out how much taxes they need to pay when exercising their Incentive Stock Options or Non-qualified Stock Options. The tax planning tool inside our dashboard does just that: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.secfi.com&#x2F;#gif-container" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.secfi.com&#x2F;#gif-container</a><p>An exciting challenge we’re working on next is an exercise planning tool that tells you what you should do with your equity based on your personal. Things have been going very well here at Secfi, and we’re looking to add 10 more people to our Amsterdam engineering team. We have a variety of engineering vacancies including a DevOps Engineer, frontend, backend Python and full stack JavaScript engineers:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;secfi?lever-via=uIDfAQPGhi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;secfi?lever-via=uIDfAQPGhi</a><p>Questions?
