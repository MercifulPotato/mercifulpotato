Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=[24835516], score=None, time=1603186682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24833818, text='&gt; The point of our system is ...<p>It seems to me that, to responsibly make a statement of that form, you would have to look at when the system was created and look at the motivations of the people who created it (or made significant changes to the system and its objectives).  If we&#x27;re talking about the compulsory education system, that means looking at when the compulsory education laws were first passed, and what was said by those advocating the laws (and, possibly, deciding if they were telling the truth and if they had additional motivations).<p>Can you honestly say you&#x27;ve looked into that?  Do you even know <i>when</i> compulsory education laws were passed in your state (U.S. or otherwise)?  I&#x27;m not really picking on you specifically—I had to look it up (1874 in California).<p>I stress this because, while ostensibly school is for &quot;education&quot;, if you point out that it&#x27;s not doing that nearly as well as it could, ten people will say &quot;Well, <i>really</i> school is for X&quot;, and you&#x27;ll get about five different values of X, some of which contradict each other.  This is the hallmark of people making up rationalizations for something they truly don&#x27;t understand.<p>(To take an example, even for something like compliance—I do imagine that employers use &quot;suffered through school without getting kicked out&quot; as a sign of compliance, but if you imagined an institution <i>optimized</i> for providing that signal, I suspect making it through <i>one month</i> of military boot camp is a stronger signal of that, and obviously way more efficient than spending 12 years in school.  Or if you want compliance without that kind of physical stress, then some variant of extreme ascetic monk training would probably do it.)<p>Murray Rothbard says that compulsory education in Europe was first established by Protestant Reformation leaders—Martin Luther and his followers, and John Calvin—and that their primary motive was to promulgate their religious ideas and suppress religious heresy; and that the Calvinist Puritans brought this approach to America (starting with Massachusetts and more generally New England).  &quot;Only a year after its first set of particular laws, the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1642 enacted a compulsory literacy law for all children. ... In 1647, the colony followed up this law with the establishment of public schools. The major stress in the compulsory education was laid on the teaching of Calvinist-Puritan principles.&quot;  Doing my own research, I verify that Massachusetts&#x27;s 1647 laws[1] required that parents &quot;once a week (at the least) catechize their children and servants in the grounds &amp; principles of Religion&quot; in the very next sentence after the requirement to &quot;[e]nable them perfectly to read the English tongue&quot;.<p>As for what animated the educationists who successfully established compulsory public education in most of the American states in the mid-late 1800s, Rothbard describes it in the following link.  Rothbard is an ideological libertarian, but he forms his arguments from plenty of primary and secondary sources which he cites.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mises.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;education-free-and-compulsory-1&#x2F;html&#x2F;c&#x2F;26" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mises.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;education-free-and-compulsory-1&#x2F;ht...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teachingamericanhistory.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;document&#x2F;the-laws-and-liberties-of-massachusetts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teachingamericanhistory.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;document&#x2F;the-law...</a>')
