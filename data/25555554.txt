I know this is about hacking and fun, but I wonder if there&#x27;s no more better, certainly more traditional way of attaching these external disks to some powerful computer. What about a single server and attaching them with USB-3? Power consumption will be comparable with idling processors, but I assume the overall performance will be better with a traditional x86 desktop or server processor.')
