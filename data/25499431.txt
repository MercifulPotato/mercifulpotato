It&#x27;s not like they have ER MRIs that sit idle and then an MRI for everyone else.<p>Further, a lot of that diagnostic equipment simply isn&#x27;t needed in most cases.  For ER related problems, xray machines are commonly all that&#x27;s actually needed.  Those are fairly cheap in the grand scheme of things.<p>&gt; You need physicians and nurses and supporting staff.<p>A lot of the need for that gets cut dramatically by having a single payer system.  The reason we have big ERs is because they are required to treat before seeking payment.  As a result, many uninsured and underinsured people are using the ER as a primary healthcare system.  Give everyone 0 or low deductible healthcare and you&#x27;ll see the number of ER visits drop dramatically.')
