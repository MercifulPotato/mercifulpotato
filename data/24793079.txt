As others have said, I could not agree more.<p>As a Product Manager, working remotely 100% of the time is absolute hell. And I say this as someone who was already working from home ~70% of the time before (and I was mostly ok with that).<p>I also wanted to pick on a few of the categories you mentioned:<p>&gt; &quot;only incompetent managers need to see you in person&quot;<p>Some of the best work I&#x27;ve done is when I&#x27;m able to go brainstorm in a room with my leadership. Lacking the ability to do this as we plan our next release, or the next 3 year strategy or whatnot is extremely difficult.<p>Having competent management means that they understand when this is valuable and when it&#x27;s not.<p>&gt; &quot;your co-workers aren&#x27;t your friends&quot;<p>I hear this a lot, and I have to feel bad for people who have never experienced true friendship at work. At each of my jobs, I&#x27;ve made lifelong friends. Friends I&#x27;ve since vacationed with, stood up as a groomsman in a weeding for, etc. This is part of what made those jobs so rewarding.<p>I think the general thought is that &quot;jobs change, so that &#x27;friend&#x27; might not be around next week&quot;, and that&#x27;s true. But in my experience, if they&#x27;re true friends, changing jobs doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>This says more about me than anything, but where else am I going to meet friends?<p>---<p>All of this to say, in addition to being tone-deaf in light of the current reality in the world, these sentiments are also suspect under normal circumstances.<p>These things may be true for some people at their place of employment, or for them personally, but it&#x27;s hard to understand where this comes from.')
