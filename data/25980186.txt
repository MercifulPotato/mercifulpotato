The buyers are guaranteed for a while due to the short interest.<p>&gt; The fact that retail brokerages temporarily limiting new buyers &quot;caused the price to crater&quot; speaks at least a little bit to this interpretation as well.<p>It cratered and then rocketed back up within the hour. GME has been super volatile and yeah, cutting off the people interested in buying is going to temporarily lower demand which lowers the price, no surprise there.')
