Lots of clients have sites that require fast asset access, and from all across the globe.<p>Obviously the most sustainable option would be reducing asset heavy sites full stop, but for those cases where it&#x27;s not possible is there a more green CDN than S3? Or does the need for excess capacity sitting around the globe undermine the whole exercise from the start.')
