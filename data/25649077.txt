The evening commute is more spread out over time.<p>In the morning, you have adults going to work, kids going to school, delivery trucks rolling out, people going to get supplies they will need for the day, people doing morning exercise, and so on. Sleep is a big synchronizer that tends to get most of us aligned at the start of the day.<p>By the evening rush, most of those people other than adults who went to work are already home. Also, the times people start the evening commute tends to vary more than the times they start the morning commute.<p>Add in to this that morning weather and evening weather are quite different. Mornings tend to be colder than evenings, as they are coming off the sunless night.<p>This means that hazardous driving, biking, and even walking conditions are more likely in the morning than the evening. This won&#x27;t make a different in Florida (where the author of this bill is from), but it sure makes a difference when you get into the northern parts of the continental US.<p>Put this together and whenever you have the morning commute before the sun is up you are combining the most number of people, the greatest mixing of pedestrians and bicycles with cars, and the highest chance of bad conditions (icy roads and sidewalks, poor visibility).<p>When you have the evening commute after the sun has set, it sucks, but you have less traffic of all kinds and better road and weather conditions.<p>Thus, if you have to have one of the commutes outside of daylight, it is going to be better to have that be the evening commute.')
