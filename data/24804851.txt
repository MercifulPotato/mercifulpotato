Item(by='komali2', descendants=None, kids=[24804940, 24804988], score=None, time=1602881024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24804563, text='&gt; The U.S. government collects detailed data on who’s dying in which jails around the country – but won’t let anyone see it.<p>I want to know more about this. That&#x27;s my data, as I am that for which the government exists. So who dares to withhold it from me? Have newspapers tried FOIA requests for it? This is the first I&#x27;ve heard of this data being withheld. Withheld by who?<p>Edit: wow holy shit it&#x27;s worse than I thought:<p>&gt; The Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics has collected inmate mortality data for two decades – but statistics for individual jails are withheld from the public, government officials and oversight agencies under a 1984 law limiting the release of BJS data. Agency officials say that discretion is critical because it encourages sheriffs and police to report their deaths data each year.<p>They don&#x27;t want to let people read the reports because they&#x27;re afraid cops won&#x27;t report their murders otherwise. Despicable. Now I have more reasons than ever to continue protesting.')
