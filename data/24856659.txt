Item(by='YeGoblynQueenne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603363774, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24853922, text='&gt;&gt; it&#x27;s always 5 years away because mainstream AI researches are stuck with yak shaving their gradient descents.<p>A small correction: that&#x27;s deep learning researches, not AI researchers and not all machine learning researchers even. To be charitable, it&#x27;s not even <i>all</i> deep learning researchers. It&#x27;s just that the field of deep learning research has been inundated with new entrants who are sufficiently skilled to grok the practicalities but lack understanding of AI scholarship and produce unfortunately shoddy work that does not advance the field (any field, any of the aforementioned ones).<p>As a personal example, my current PhD studies are in Inductive Logic Programming which is, in short, machine-learning of logic programs (you know, Prolog etc). I would not be able to publish any papers without a theoretical section with actual theoretical results (i.e. theorems and their proofs - and it better be a theorem other than &quot;more parameters beget better accuracy&quot;, which is not really a theorem). Reviewers would just reject such a paper without second thought, regardless of how many leaderboards I beat in my empirical results section.<p>And of course there are all the other fields of AI were work continues - search, classical planning, constraint satisfaction, automated theorem proving, knowledge engineering and so on and so forth.<p>Bottom line- the shoddy scholarship you flag up does not characterise the field of AI research, as a whole, it only afflicts a majority of modern deep learning research.')
