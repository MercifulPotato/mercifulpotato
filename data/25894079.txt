Using current figures isn’t useful because most roads in the US are very underfunded, and we get low scores on infrastructure quality as a result.<p>Plus it’s not accounting the full cost of roads given that you need a vehicle to access them. On average, something like 15% of a households income is tied to transportation (car maintenance, loans, gas, registration, etc), which is <i>insanely</i> expensive just to be economically productive.')
