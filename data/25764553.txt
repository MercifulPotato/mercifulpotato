Our opinions tend to be on services like Gmail and Drive and Reader and Hangouts. In that case, we&#x27;re closer to a customer - or more accurately, we&#x27;re a positive externality. Google <i>does</i> offer paid support for most of these services, including an account rep that you can actually talk to in person. But you have to be paying for them. Individuals who use Gmail for free are effectively just publicity for Google so they can convince large employers to pay them for Gmail.')
