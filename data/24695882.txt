Item(by='mawww', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601974565, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695372, text='Kakoune goes the opposite way, there is no such thing as &quot;search and replace&quot; in it, you&#x27;d use multiselection for that.<p>It ends up being much more powerful because the editing language is strictly more expressive than regular expressions: you can select using a regular expression, but you can also use all the rest of the normal mode, such as select&#x2F;jump to the matching parenthesis or brace (or whatever pair of text your language use to scope things), which is not possible to express in pure regex.<p>You are far from limited to a single screen, the `(` and `)` commands rotate the main selection, so you can inspect all your selections easily if you want to.<p>In my experience (as a long time Vim user and as Kakoune&#x27;s main author) multiple selections end-up being much more attractive for quick edits where there&#x27;s only a handful instances to replace than devising the correct regex&#x2F;replacement pair, and their interactive nature makes them quicker to use than the macro alternative (which is also supported in Kakoune).')
