Item(by='kibwen', descendants=None, kids=[25133414], score=None, time=1605648178, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25128344, text='Not quite, even with normal approval voting there&#x27;s no way to distinguish between voters who want to say &quot;all these options are undesirable and everything is broken&quot; and those who want to say &quot;life is good, I&#x27;m cool with whoever&quot; and those whose votes get lost or obstructed. The reason why the notion of a &quot;protest vote&quot; is so pointless under our current system is specifically due to the indistinguishability of the first from the latter (&quot;people didn&#x27;t stay home because they didn&#x27;t like the candidates, they stayed home because they&#x27;re so content!&quot;). Additionally without mandatory voting it&#x27;s difficult to determine where and how voter disenfranchisement is happening, but at the same time it would be unethical to force someone to cast a vote without giving them the option to voice discontent with the options.')
