Even if the paper might be wrong, it&#x27;s still news.<p>Regarding practicality, you may have missed the thesis, which is that warp drives are more practical than previously thought, because the theory allows subliminal warp drives at finite energy, not only superluminal warp drives at unphysical negative energy.<p>The part about GR is just the stretch part. It&#x27;s obvious what she means about GR, that our current arguments against superluminal drives are based on General Relativity.')
