Maybe at least state something, not just put it in like an &quot;undeniable fact&quot;.<p>&gt; we need to pay large sums of money to kernel dev. depart<p>IIRC, their kernel (core) department is rather small - I really do not think that has anything to do with it.<p>They also hire already Linux kernel devs, and if they want to shape it for their OS stack, they&#x27;d need to do even more so.<p>And I&#x27;m really not sure how the mixed rant about planned obsolesce and replacement of the native clients, which are very hard to maintain for multiple OS, with using a cross platform technology instead, for better or worse, has to do anything with the initial stuff.<p>&gt; It gets destroyed when complete analphabets drive the decision about progress trough their vision of getting more money.<p>So using the Linux kernel would be equivalent of the decision of an Illiterate?<p>Further, as you seem to care about IT progress, how does fare the NT kernel with that compared to the Linux Kernel?<p>The last time I looked the NT one lacked a lot of features, from control groups, to checkpoint restore whole processes, varying amount of namespaces, scheduling (CPU, IO, realtime, ...), highly sophisticated Filesystems with lots of research going on there and in other areas.<p>Linux is multiple order of magnitudes more diverse and accepting for research, features, new design approaches, ... in comparison to the NT kernel, so please, don&#x27;t make yourself look stupid by stating as it would be the other way around.')
