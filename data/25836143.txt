We&#x27;re talking about an organization (the FBI) that was controlled by one of the most corrupt men in US political history for nearly half of its existence - J Edgar Hoover. Nothing much has changed. It doesn&#x27;t matter which side of the political spectrum you are, they are not your friend - they both tried to blackmail MLK into killing himself and sent snipers to murder a hard-right woman holding a baby at Ruby Ridge.')
