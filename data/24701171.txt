E.g. finding a median or top-k elements.<p>Every once in a while you&#x27;ll get a more exotic problem that requires something like a bloom filter or a trie.<p>But that&#x27;s just enough to get the solution. A good interviewer will also see if you can build this solution in a way that has effective abstractions. They&#x27;ll also probe real-world concerns like data locality. For instance, one solution might be better in terms of big-O notation performance but might have worse access data pattern than other solutions.')
