Apple doesn&#x27;t sell $300 phones for $1000 to people who buy $20,000 bags. Well they do but they don&#x27;t make hundreds of billions in profit by targeting the 0.01% of consumers. They do it by making lower class folk feel like the 0.01% when they spend $500 on headphones.<p>The people Apple will make their money on selling $550 headphones to probably make a lot less per year than the readers of this comment do.')
