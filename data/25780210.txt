I used to live in Mar Vista, just a few blocks from Venice Beach, and they flew over our house every night. There were times when they flew so low they caused the water in our pool to ripple (though that was rare). Now I&#x27;m down in Westchester, and we get fewer, but they&#x27;re still around frequently. I saw some yesterday, but think they were just regular LAPD, and not these particular ones. (And looking at the map of their route, they didn&#x27;t fly over us.)')
