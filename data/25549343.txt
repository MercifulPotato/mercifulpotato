Just search for the command you want to execute (regex mode is supported), or, if you don&#x27;t precisely know what you&#x27;re looking for, you can browse through the commands until you find the one you want to execute. Apart from this, you can delete unwanted entries from your history, too, and more. It should work on all terminals ranging from linux term to xterm. It was initially made for bash but it should work as well with zsh, ksh, and tcsh, too.<p>I use it on a daily basis.<p>Check out the README for instructions if you want to try it out.<p>Suggestions, bug reports, etc. are welcome.<p>Let me know what you think:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adder46&#x2F;hstr-rs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adder46&#x2F;hstr-rs</a>')
