As an Indian, our pride is one of the biggest problems. Not achieving much but taking a lot of credit for it. We even take pride in Indians that leave for abroad and do exceptionally well - CEOs of Google, Microsoft, Adobe, MasterCard are not Indians in terms of their citizenship. They&#x27;re of Indian ethnicity.<p>To the foreigners (especially Americans) - I cannot make this up. When I was in 6th standard, we had a teacher that said without flinching, or perhaps completely deluded that - 90% of NASA employees are Indians. We knew this is bullshit even when in the 90&#x27;s when there was no internet.<p>Currently, we&#x27;ve got the Indian media tied up with taking pride in the fact that Kamala Harris is Indian.<p>It&#x27;s frankly embarrassing how much undeserved pride we constantly seek.')
