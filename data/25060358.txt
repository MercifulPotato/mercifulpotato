Item(by='npsimons', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605115306, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25060201, text='&quot;External&quot; is relative; at home, I can install whatever I please, although I do prefer to stick to what is included with Debian stable, which is pretty comprehensive (it includes pychecker, pyflakes, pylint and python-contract). And indeed, mypy is there to! Thanks for the pointer!<p>At work, we are limited (for the most part) to what is included in RHEL repositories, and even more by the fact we are still on 6.9 on some projects. Hence why I mentioned python-contract, as it&#x27;s not in RHEL repos (that I could find). Thankfully pyflakes&#x2F;checker&#x2F;lint are. I will have to check for mypy.')
