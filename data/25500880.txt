You can say that their market cap should not be greater than Toyota or Ford etc because the number of vehicles they produce is a lot smaller, but the world is going electric (really, renewable) and Tesla is tee-ed up to take large chunks of the solar panel and car markets. They have said they are going to produce a smaller version of a model 3 that costs under 25K USD, which the Europeans will buy in large numbers. They will be the first company to complete FSD also.<p>My opinion doesn&#x27;t mean anything, but I think in 2030, Elon Musk will be the richest person in the world by an order of magnitude and Tesla will have the largest market cap in the world<p>Disclaimer - long TSLA and drive a model 3')
