We went down to to Sao Paulo to talk with an accelerator to get funding,  it did not go good,  I went home and picked up the Wall Street Journal and found the accelerator had gone bankrupt.<p>We reskinned a chat application for Portugese speakers and we got upwards of 300,000 members while I was still involved -- ultimately he sold the company,  not for an astonishing amount of money,  but for something.<p>Mauricio did many of the &#x27;right things&#x27;,  including going to one of the business schools in Boston (I think MIT) and working for the McKinsey group and developing a network so he knew people who had a chat application ready to skin.<p>-----<p>Something else is that I have encountered so many brilliant people from Argentina;  my short list of firms that could succeed at outsourced NLP work is heavy on Argentina -- between being in a good time zone to work from New York and the depth of talent I am a believer.<p>I don&#x27;t think they are as close knit as they could be however:  many of these good firms aren&#x27;t aware of the others.')
