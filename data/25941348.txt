If the maintainers find that code contributions are reducing their maintenance effort, which is often the case, then sure. But if on the other hand reviewing the contributions themselves _increases_ effort, then it literally is a net-negative to accept PRs.<p>(2) It&#x27;s also very possible that PRs create extra work. Sometimes reading and understanding someone else&#x27;s solution to a problem is harder than coming up with your own! Of course, one could take a laissez faire approach to maintenance and just assume good intent and do light reviews, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make for a better codebase.')
