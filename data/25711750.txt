On Android I believe Parler wouldn&#x27;t have too hard a time distributing their app on their own. But granted, on Apple devices, I think installing non App Store software is a non-starter for most people.<p>This begs a somewhat unrelated question though--why doesn&#x27;t Parler just live as a web application that doesn&#x27;t require an app? They would still have to migrate from AWS, but it would still allow people to continue using it despite Google and Apple&#x27;s decisions, right?')
