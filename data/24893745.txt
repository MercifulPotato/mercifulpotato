Item(by='Thorrez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603698684, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24893591, text='I wasn&#x27;t talking salaries, I was talking about prices for selling products, same as thaumasiotes. I mentioned salaries only because payroll is a component of the production cost of a product.<p>And when it comes to location, I was talking about the location of the buyer. You&#x27;re talking about the location of the employee. With a physical product being sold by onsite employees, the location of the buyer and the employee are the same. But with a digital product the location of the buyer and the employee are not necessarily the same, so something purchased in a high CoL area could have been produced by an employee in a low CoL area, and vice versa. So it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to change the price of a product based on the location of the buyer in that case.<p>Typing this out, I realized there&#x27;s an error in my previous comment, I didn&#x27;t need to say &quot;and fully remote employees&quot;. A digital product is sufficient to uncouple the employee&#x27;s CoL from the buyer&#x27;s CoL. The employees can all be onsite and the CoLs between the buyer and employees would still be uncoupled.')
