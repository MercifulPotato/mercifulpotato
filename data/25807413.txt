I definitely could have worded that better. If the authorities find it and tell you to take it down, you would obviously still have to comply. I just meant that I don&#x27;t think it requires you to be proactive and monitor for things like that. You just have to react. Amazon was upset that Parler wasn&#x27;t be proactive enough, not that it wasn&#x27;t complying with court orders or something. I don&#x27;t think Parler did anything illegal, so it would just all be up to their contracts.')
