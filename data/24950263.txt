Item(by='tiernano', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604139893, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24950178, text='+1 for synching. Resilio sync is also good, but not free any more (win server needs a business license). They do have an encrypted option though (you can use a server somewhere else that has your data, but very encrypted, and only the clients with that key can read...)')
