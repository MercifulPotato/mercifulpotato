The problems you mention are definitely very common for skilled immigrants here - if you don&#x27;t absolutely need to learn the language, you&#x27;re not very likely to put yourself through the hardship it entails. Especially if you&#x27;ve already formed social bonds in English.<p>That&#x27;s what I was trying to say. If you do want to learn the local language, you have to be willing and able to put up with it being pretty crappy for a few months. My experience has been that it&#x27;s very hard to integrate a new language into your persona without immersing yourself in it. For most people it&#x27;s not worth it if they can get by without. Completely understandable.<p>Now you&#x27;ve got me wondering if I should start thinking about how to teach Finnish to English-speaking professionals :D')
