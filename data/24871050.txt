(e.g. I can think about the local chairperson of the United Way as a &#x27;good person&#x27; but decide to give the the community in other ways)<p>As Mozilla goes specifically,  they have a nice headquarters which is separated by the longest 30 miles of Interstate Highway in America from their chief competitor.  They get to share &quot;expert networks&quot; with Google,  but they will inevitably be out of touch with the rest of the world in the exact same way Google is out of touch with the rest of the world.  The trouble is Google has the profit motive to give it some clarity but Mozilla doesn&#x27;t.  Without deep roots in the rest of the world,  Mozilla can&#x27;t exploit markets that are defensible from Google.<p>One could spin some scenarios where they were based in (say) Dublin,  or Frankfurt, Philadelphia, Salt Lake City,  or some combination of tier-2 cities worldwide however and still face the problem that the consumer voice is hard for a non-profit to hear.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty</a>')
