It&#x27;s about what people are used to, not to what is physically possible. Again, digital neon colors are definitely not even close to the most extreme you can get - that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not garish and ugly.<p>&gt; clearly taking in a bright sunlit day through the window next to a dark but still clearly visible interior<p>Do you think most people would call that &#x27;natural&#x27; and pleasant lighting conditions?<p>&gt;If you stand in an office and look around, it&#x27;s not like computer screens stand out as blazing white with inky black figures on them<p>If you look at them from their intended viewing angle, they&#x27;re absolutely going to stand out (unless your display is just really dumpy).<p>&gt;The idea that computer screens have extreme levels of contrast in comparison with the surroundings is simply not true<p>Feel free to name all the items in your (normally lit) office that have a higher or even just comparable contrast to your screen.')
