Item(by='PeterisP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607346219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25330622, text='GPS trackers are sometimes used, but GPS is receive-only, they allow you to track the location history if you have gotten the container and the tracker; but it does not imply having the ability to locate it if it&#x27;s lost because the container can&#x27;t send its location to you from the middle of the ocean - doing that would require essentially having a satellite radio with proper antennas, and that&#x27;s not generally done. A naval transponder would allow it to be located if you&#x27;re within perhaps 40 miles or something in the ballpark, but events like this tend to happen <i>much</i> further from a coast.<p>In any case, that would be worthless, in almost all cases it wouldn&#x27;t be worth to explicitly go out and retrieve the container even if it would still be undamaged and floating (which is unlikely).')
