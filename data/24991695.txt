Currently cloning a git repository is trivial, you can have different branches targeting different remotes etc... It&#x27;s decentralized at the core. An issue solution that built on top of this architecture would be very powerful and &quot;just work&quot; while a solution built on the side will face an uphill battle for adoption.<p>Basically my point is that I consider issues to be an integral part of a repository&#x27;s history, and it&#x27;s a weakness of VCSs not to integrate it. A lot of the time I find Github comments on a feature&#x2F;issue to be vastly more interesting and important than the resulting commit message.')
