On second thought, this isn&#x27;t all that reasonable. I think the modern european state is nationalist first, liberal second, and democratic (usually) as a distant third - that is, in order of how likely any characteristic is to break down under pressure.<p>It feels to me if you look at the trajectory from the start of the french revolution to the modern european state, even in periods of reaction, the arrow doesn&#x27;t really turn much. Reactionaries usually see the advantages of nationalism, bourgeois the advantages of liberalism, and workers the advantages of democracy - and all of the three trends get reversed at points, but if you sum them, then it&#x27;s a pretty steady gain. For instance, while the dissolution of the Frankfurt parliment was a blow against democracy, I think it probably pushed nationlism forward by putting so much power in Prussian hands.<p>So I&#x27;d credit the French Revolution with spawning and intensively testing the triad of political views that have ended up being totally dominant in Europe - you&#x27;re right that this triad is not identical with democracy, but I think it is identical with what we generally call democracy in Europe today.')
