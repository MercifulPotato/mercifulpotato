Neither is supported by Element, as you point out, so which one is the &quot;correct&quot; model that a second implementation of the homeserver protocol should follow? Which one should new clients follow?<p>Also, when is Dendrite actually going to be a usable replacement for Synapse?<p>Also, when will you hire an actual professional to represent your company on HN instead of sticking your head into every thread on your product? It makes it seem like you don&#x27;t have better things to do than be on HN all day.<p>Matrix is an amateur-hour project. I don&#x27;t understand why it is so popular on HN. I&#x27;d rather use Jabber, full stop.')
