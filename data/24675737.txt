China was so far ahead, in fact, that economic historian Eric L. Jones once argued that the Chinese empire &quot;came within a hair&#x27;s breadth of industrializing in the fourteenth century.&quot;&quot;<p>China had an iron industry earlier than that - 12th century, IIRC.  It was all starting - more iron resulting in iron tools all over the place, process improvements, and so on.  But then some bureaucrats (mandarins, which I <i>think</i> is the same thing) noticed that some of the &quot;wrong&quot; people were getting rich in all this, and the government forcibly shut it all down in the name of preserving social order.<p>That&#x27;s one of the strengths of America - more than anywhere else in the world, if you have the right idea, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re the &quot;wrong&quot; person.')
