My advisor wasn&#x27;t familiar with it, and I may have spooked her a bit try to explain it. I think to this day its great background music for programming work, but to me more because it can illicit that sense of young focus and drive that I find increasingly fleeting. Perhaps not unlike how music can &quot;wake up&quot; dementia patients. It elicits a deep base response.<p>Anyhow, I didn&#x27;t know that either about his life. Very fascinating.<p>As an aside I believe I discovered Einstein on the Beach after listening to Hydrogen Jukebox. I wonder how others come about listening to it for the first time. Especially those in their 30s like myself who were born a decade after its success.')
