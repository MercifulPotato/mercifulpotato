The claim that Google sells user data came from the traditional news Big Media outlets like the NYT and WSJ. I remember when it started actually: it happened around the time Google News launched. The narrative in the media industry became very quickly &quot;Google is making tons of money whilst we&#x27;re going through huge layoffs&quot; and the media spin went from highly positive to very negative at dizzying speed.<p>A major inflection point was when Rupert Murdoch gave a speech proclaiming the iPad was the future of news and Google was some sort of parasite sucking the blood of journalists. The tone of the output from his newspapers changed overnight and they immediately started digging around for largely fake &#x27;scandals&#x27;. The rest of the news industry didn&#x27;t need much persuading and the rest is history.<p>Claims you see on social media since then are largely just repeating the media&#x27;s talking points. It&#x27;s not like it originated there.')
