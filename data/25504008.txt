There&#x27;s nothing special or protected about the traded Cryptos, despite the speculation.<p>If a currency crisis arises and the market is frozen, cryptos will not be on the first lien right to trade for Fed assets (whatever that currency might end up to be) or even continue trading, depending on the decisions of the Fed. Hell, I don&#x27;t expect the issued currency (cash - which the long tail of people are still using) will have that right...since the Fed board members aren&#x27;t going to be running around with palettes of cash when buying goods either.')
