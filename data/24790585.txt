It means there is much more breadth of perspective, and you realize very easily that work isn&#x27;t everything.<p>It sounds like you also might not have had much experience in the current &quot;everyone is friends!&quot; startup office culture. There&#x27;s a pretty strong pressure to socialize all of the time, during lunch and after hours, with everyone. The people get laid off and they are erased from that social circle, typically people won&#x27;t even communicate with them anymore. It&#x27;s repulsive.')
