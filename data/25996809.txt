The price is right (only $6), there&#x27;s no maintenance, no noise, no energy costs, no risk of developing mold in you home from too high a humidity.<p>It works great.  Whenever my nose gets too dry I put it on and in maybe an hour or even less it&#x27;s fine again.  I also sometimes sleep with it on, when the air is dry enough to cause my nose pain.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Speedo-Competition-Nose-Clip-Charcoal&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B008DXEDCC&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Speedo-Competition-Nose-Clip-Charcoal...</a>')
