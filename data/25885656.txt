And there is already high inflation in other areas not measured in official inflation. The other component of inflation is increasing wages, but I don’t see that happening soon.<p>In terms of government debt - while the nominal value of US government debt rises, some of it is also somewhat eroded as the real value of the dollar decreases. So it looks like the plan is to monetise the debt, at least somewhat. I am not sure if paying the government debt back over time through increased taxes is on the agenda - I doubt it.<p>There is a trend of increasing de-dollarisation of world trade, which can already be seen in trade between countries like Russia and China moving to using their own currencies and the euro for a larger portion of trade.<p>I think in the future more world trade will be settled with some type of bancor type basket of currencies where USD is one component, rather than the only component.')
