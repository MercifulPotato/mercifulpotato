I feel that this might be a move I could make in the future, but at the current state of the business I prefer to keep improving the product and keeping existing clients happy than having to work on implementing new distribution systems, artificial limitations, maintaining two different product versions (free vs premium) with different feature sets, etc.<p>This is a good suggestion and I am always thinking about what the best pricing model is for such a self-hosted product. I do think that based on userTrack&#x27;s feature set, the target audience are mostly business owners who can spare a few dollars on an analytics platform if that leads to better business intelligence and increased conversions.')
