I find it very nice to use skype voice + text chat, depending on how important I think my n cents are, I can chose to speak it or write it in chat instead.. I can also express myself more clearly, because I don&#x27;t have to talk, but instead can take my time formulating what I want to say. And I can use links and pictures to support what I want to communicate.')
