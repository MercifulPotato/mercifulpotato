You mean, if I (a person that lives in the US) sees someone lose a human right, I should shut up, because some other guy who also lives in the US, who I&#x27;ve never met did something that I never approved of or endorsed?<p>Like we should all be ok with an individual being victimized because anyone who wants to say something is guilty of something else by association... I guess the victims should accept that no one should help them. How sad.<p>The truth is I think people who trot out this line should ask themselves who they&#x27;re helping. The sides aren&#x27;t the US vs China... the sides are those on the side of human rights and liberty and those that seek to deprive others of their rights. And when you stand up with your words to help those on the side of anti-human rights, you are the one on the wrong side... and no one on the human rights side gives a damn what you think is hypocritical because those actions were never from our side.')
