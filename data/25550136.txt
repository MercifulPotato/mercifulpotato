One of the most interesting aspects of games is how different ranges interact. Whether that&#x27;s &quot;melee range&quot; or &quot;slightly further than melee range&quot; really shouldn&#x27;t matter that much. Also, zerglings, zealots, ultralisks, dark templar and workers are melee in StarCraft 2.')
