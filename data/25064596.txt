And that we should be able to get a sufficient qualitative feel isn&#x27;t unreasonable: it&#x27;s just as fair for the candidate to wonder how competent the team they&#x27;re considering joining, yet we don&#x27;t let the candidate give us coding tests. And a startup will usually mean less money and prestige, so we&#x27;re not paying for the right to have interviews be one-sided.<p>This is why I prefer working for start ups and small orgs the past 8 years and avoid big co&#x27;s&#x2F;faang: less of a meat grinder from initial contact to hire and can have a larger impact on product direction while working on the boundaries of an ideas social economic impact. But its hard to find companies like this, and usually the best ones are the most desperate (assuming they can pay any salary [no matter how small relative to the market], not looking at those who cannot or choose not to at all).')
