It&#x27;s hell compared to native App development using the native technologies.<p>As a front-end developer, it&#x27;s clear to me that you only think that because you are familiar with it, same for me with js - all you need to start developing is npx create-react-app appname or npx create-next-app appname. I toyed around with react native too, and expo is godsend. On the other hand when I tried to use swift&#x2F;xcode I quickly discovered that official docs are just trash for people unfamiliar with it and community is so much smaller (I was only looking at swiftui FWIW). You have to configure things like dependencies with xcode ui while in js it&#x27;s all code. Needless to say I didn&#x27;t go through with it and will go react native next time without a second thought.')
