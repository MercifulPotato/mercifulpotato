But for me the first time I did it was the most painful experience ever. So painful in fact that they had to abort it and book me for another time and that time I went under.<p>That was before my surgery and when my intestines were all over the place. That being said, after my surgery in which they corrected the placement of my intestines, it was painless. That time, the last time I did it, I chit chatted with the doctor and nurse and it was funnily a pretty relaxing experience since I&#x27;d gotten some mild drugs before because I was nervous it would hurt as it did the fist time.<p>I have done a colonoscopy 3 times.')
