You make it sound like the company itself must invest in assuring that the rules are not broken.<p>My argument, as made in the original comment, is that a monorepo is not a git repository. It is a git repository, a build tool &#x2F; dependency graph manager, and a continuous integration system.<p>In the same way, a statically-typed project is not a collection of source files. It is a collection of source files, a linker, and a compiler.<p>The linker and compiler do not come &quot;for free&quot; any more than a build tool &#x2F; ci system do, although they have been around for a very long time so you might consider them part of the background. In a well-structured monorepo, the build tool and ci system are as much in the background as `gcc` or `go build` might be.')
