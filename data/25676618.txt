For Covid-19, all the projects based on mechanized vent bag where useless because of the type of disease.<p>There are several companies behind the project. The company who makes the electronics is Tronico (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tronico-alcen.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;markets&#x2F;medical" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tronico-alcen.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;markets&#x2F;medical</a>).

If it is approved, sure it can save life everywhere in the world. If it is not, it was a project where we learned a lot.<p>By the way, ambulance ventilators are harder to develop and to approve. Hardware must resist huge shocks and accelerations.<p>As said previously, the Rpi part and the software is not critical at all, it is here to fill a gap between the minimal UX and the expected UX.
