Think of it like using your diaphragm to inhale but in a kind of halting way combined with just dropping your jaw to increase your mouth&#x27;s empty volume and pulling a slight negative pressure (maybe it&#x27;s vaguely similar to playing a wind instrument?). You typically draw on a cigar very slowly anyways since they can burn unevenly if you draw fast or get them too hot. And yes, nicotine can be absorbed through the mouth and you definitely get a nicotine hit.<p>The same basic idea applies to tobacco pipes too.')
