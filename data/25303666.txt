It looks like the EU minimum includes banks holidays?  Where US vacation days don&#x27;t include them.<p><i>&quot;By law, every country in the European Union has at least four work weeks of paid vacation. Austria, which guarantees workers the most time off, has a legal minimum of 22 paid vacation days and 13 paid holidays each year.&quot;</i><p>So the US has no minimum, but the minimum offered is typically 10 days and the a middle class job 15 days.  On top of that you get at least 10 federal holidays off (or you get paid 2x if you work).  Many companies recognize 13+ &quot;official days off&quot;.<p>So most US employees (there are exceptions) get ~20 days off a year, while for middle class it&#x27;s more typical to get closer to 25-30.
