Lack of enforcement of international law is due to lack of ratified treaties for such an enforcement. There is a reason why the US refuses to ratify the treaty for the International Court of Justice. So far, attempts to get better enforcement mechanisms were partly successful, but not successful when members of the UN Security Council are concerned. The problem is that allied powers decided to give the UN security council members veto rights. Any change would have to start there - a larger council and abandoning veto rights. In the current political situation that will not happen, but maybe in the future it will.<p>However, you&#x27;re still under a false impression. You&#x27;re just looking at a few global superpowers and former superpowers such as Russia, China, and the US. However, the UN has 193 member states and there are countless bilateral treaties that entangle countries in a positive way.<p>&gt; <i>There is some give and take but for some it&#x27;s literally what they do for a living.</i><p>That&#x27;s not true, as I&#x27;ve said, your view of international relations is unrealistic. You&#x27;re thinking way too much in black and white terms. As I&#x27;ve mentioned earlier, even the countries who occasionally break international law normally adhere to it and consult their experts about it and try to avoid breaking it. Your remark is especially ironic in the context of a thread about Denmark. There are more countries than the US, China, and Russia. Most of these countries work quite well with each other on the basis of international law. For every case that you believe demonstrates arbitrary power abuse, you can find another case in which international treaties, conflict resolution mechanisms  by UN, and diplomatic channels have worked.<p>You&#x27;re generalizing from very few hand-picked nations, which are known to have particular geostrategical goals that other countries do not have. Denmark is not waging illegal wars or annexing regions of other countries, for instance. Most countries don&#x27;t do these kind of things.<p>&gt; <i>That was exactly my point, that there are no good or bad, no moral and immoral&#x2F;amoral countries. They do what they need to do to stay on top of the pile.</i><p>You did not understand this point. I&#x27;m saying that countries cannot be moral actors because they are not uniform entities.  Countries are not actors at all. If at all, you can talk about particular governments this way, but these change all the time. Or, you could say that certain geostrategical goals seem to influence a government&#x27;s actions, but that involve a lot of interpretation and background knowledge. You need to assign moral properties to decision makers, or perhaps governments. So it only appears as if we agree on this point.<p>Of course, there are immoral actions of governments, though. Russia&#x27;s annexation of the Crimea is a prime example of one. So are US drone strikes, Guantanamo, and the false pretenses for the 2nd Golf War.<p>If your suggestion is that governments cannot be held accountable for their actions, then I have to say I&#x27;m baffled and have no idea what made you adopt this outlandish view. They are being held accountable all the time, as well as individual members of governments if it is clear they are responsible for a certain decision.<p>Sometimes people use the country name as a shortcut and if it&#x27;s clear that they mean the governments and other institutions during a certain time period, then that&#x27;s alright. But talking about countries <i>in general</i> as if they were uniform actors is always nonsense.<p>&gt; <i>Don&#x27;t ignore something because you can&#x27;t parse it. It&#x27;s clearly the best way to form an uninformed opinion and then state it firmly, assuming you have an iron clad case. </i><p>You seem to be talking about yourself here. Psychologists call this projection. As I&#x27;ve said, there does not seem to be any substantial disagreement between us - now that you&#x27;ve changed your mind about international law, or at least chose to change the subject to a more general topic. Yes, a few countries such as the US and Russia sometimes break international law, presumably because they think they can afford it in light of too tame opposition. If that&#x27;s your big geopolitical insight, so be it.')
