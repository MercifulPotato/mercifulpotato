You could even put it on the floor or hang it from the ceiling.<p>Forced serialization: multiple people can scan a QR code simultaneously, while the NFC nearness requirement means that only one person can tap at once.<p>Restaurant table: put a QR code on the menu, scan.<p>Websites on your desktop or laptop: can&#x27;t tap, but can scan as usual<p>That&#x27;s all just talking about payer UX, not even considering seller UX. QR codes are cheaper and more flexible than NFC.<p>And, most of all, the fact that QR codes work in such a wide range of scenarios enables the biggest advantage: ubiquity. When they&#x27;re ubiquitous, they become a single payment interface that you can assume will be available no matter where you go, which is game changing.')
