Aside from the electric power-trains and battery tech, they&#x27;re just not ahead of other manufacturers.<p>A few months ago, I tried Tesla&#x27;s autopilot and found it extremely poor. It frequently took more time than expected for possible objects (that I saw) to appear on the head-unit. Further, the autopilot didn&#x27;t detect a garbage can on the side of the road and almost tried to drive me into it.<p>Why does the Tesla still refuse to put in blind-spot monitors? Why does elon still refuse to give us HUDs? Where is Android Auto &#x2F; Apple CarPlay?')
