Item(by='blincoln', descendants=None, kids=[25232250, 25232081], score=None, time=1606504808, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25230481, text='I&#x27;m also very curious about the opinions of other physicists.<p>Dr. Hossenfelder seems to have a lengthy, strong background in physics. On the other hand, every time I read one of her transcripts, I see something along the lines of the &quot;superluminal travel doesn&#x27;t necessarily result in the possibility of causality violations&quot; claim in this one. Every modern text I&#x27;ve read about physics has indicated that superluminal travel (or signaling) inexorably means that causality can be violated, unless Einstein was missing something.<p>In the last one I read, there were claims about Hawking radiation and virtual particles that also seemed to contradict everything I&#x27;ve read. Now, it may be the case that those texts really are simplified down and one learns what&#x27;s really going on in some advanced physics course, but twice in as many transcripts is a red flag for me. \nIt&#x27;s not at the Dr. Salvatore Cezar Pais level yet, but usually people who consistently claim that all of the experts are wrong are themselves wrong, and so I&#x27;d like to see some non-self-referential confirmation.')
