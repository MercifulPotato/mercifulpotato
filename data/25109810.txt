I actually think it could be considerably less than that in reality, as that&#x27;s probably the raw link speed. I don&#x27;t know the modulation techinque that starlink uses, but I imagine some level of Forward error correction (5&#x2F;6 seems common in other sat systems I&#x27;ve read about), which drops throughput by ~20%, plus other modulation overheads. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the actual real world speed per sat is half the max, possibly a lot worse in bad weather.<p>I don&#x27;t think uplink is a problem. Even 2TBit&#x2F;sec of internet capacity is cheap (especially compared to satelite launches) so I imagine this is a rounding error in the costs. I&#x27;m sure they have thought about the uplink spectrum requirements.<p>The above article mentions they think that starlink could serve 1.5million US customers when the full (12k) constellation is deployed.')
