Two generations or more of musical education where none really existed before, plus an entire generation that saw making a living as a musician as a possibility (whether or not that was true) has led to a situation where almost every town of 50k people or more has musicians in it who are as almost as good or better than any who ever lived.<p>I am fairly confident that the same thing is true of writing, painting, photography, dance: the pool of talent is out there. If you&#x27;re as old as you semi-suggest, it gets harder and harder to encounter it. I&#x27;m 57 and I have to work quite hard to ensure that I keep exposing myself to new artists and creatives - the natural tendency is to just look back on all the people I discovered between 17 and 27 and then lament them dying. Don&#x27;t do it! YouTube is a miracle in this respect. There&#x27;s so much incredible talent and invention out there. Every generation has people in it for you to respect, and they too will die and become the &quot;legends of old&quot;.<p>[* edited &quot;wallowing&quot; =&gt; &quot;wading&quot;; did not mean to sound so harsh ]')
