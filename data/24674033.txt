Sorry to hear that.<p>I will nearly always, unless explicitly asked not to, offer help to work around a bug if it is at all possible. I can&#x27;t control if someone is upset by this nor can I tell if they will be unless they say as much... but not doing so would  be significantly less helpful to a majority of people.\nSo &quot;usually&quot; does matter.')
