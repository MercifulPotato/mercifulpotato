It feels like forever ago, but they all sang the same tune when Snowden leaked those documents a few years back.<p><i>We first heard of the government’s “Prism” program when news organizations asked us about it on June 6.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;apples-commitment-to-customer-privacy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;apples-commitment-to-customer-privacy&#x2F;</a><p>Compare this to:<p>Microsoft: <i>We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and never on a voluntary basis. In addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers.

When Facebook is asked for data or information about specific individuals, we carefully scrutinize any such request for compliance with all applicable laws, and provide information only to the extent required by law.</i><p>Google: <i>Google cares deeply about the security of our users&#x27; data. We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully.

I am starting to think that all the back-and-forth with the Justice Department and Bill Barr (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;think&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;bill-barr-wants-apple-break-their-encryption-even-if-it-ncna1117841" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;think&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;bill-barr-wants-apple-...</a>) was encryption theatre and the US government actually <i>wants</i> people to use Apple devices. Think about it...Apple is a US company with major access to China and other world markets, and it writes its own software. Seems like the ideal partner for a nosy surveillance agency.<p>I just want a blazing fast aluminum laptop that doesn&#x27;t betray me at every turn. I guess that&#x27;s too much to ask these days.')
