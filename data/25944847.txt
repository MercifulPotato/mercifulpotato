It&#x27;s been perfectly usable, though I did have to take Apple up on their keyboard repair service because they did screw <i>that</i> up. The rest of the system has been entirely fine, and since the keyboard repair there have been no issues. As I recall the keyboard issue applied to the 2016-2018 laptops. If my only complaint is, &quot;the &#x27;s&#x27; key got stuck and they had to replace the whole keyboard for free, which took 24 hours at a local repair site&quot;, then I&#x27;m not too worried about it. It&#x27;s annoying, but compared to literally every HP or Dell laptop I&#x27;ve owned, it&#x27;s a far better situation. Though I hear some people had even worse experiences than my stuck &#x27;s&#x27; key.')
