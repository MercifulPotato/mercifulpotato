So far Team Total Landscaping has failed 30+ legal challenges because they could only bring trivial bullshit before the judges, and the judges have mostly thrown their cases out.<p>&gt; His attorneys are the ones that are collecting evidence and will present them to the courts.<p>See above. Giuliani is apparently charging the campaign $20,000 a day [0] (ok he&#x27;s since issued a denial[1]) and he&#x27;s the one whispering to Trump that there was fraud. Well done Rudy you scumbag, you&#x27;re scamming the scammer. But I doubt you&#x27;ll ever see the money, but maybe you&#x27;ll be able to go to some nice dinners and pay with IOUs saying &quot;Yeah the Trump 2020 campaign owes me a million dollars, when they pay me, I&#x27;ll pay you, we good here?&quot;.<p>For $20,000 a day, I&#x27;d go on stage and scream quotes from My Cousin Vinny as well, aren&#x27;t we all just prostitutes.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;rudy-giuliani-is-asking-for-dollar20k-a-day-to-launch-ridiculous-election-lawsuits-nyt-reports" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;rudy-giuliani-is-asking-for-do...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;giuliani-denies-asking-for-dollar20000-a-day-to-do-legal-work-for-trump&#x2F;ar-BB1b6qfk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;giuliani-denies-aski...</a>')
