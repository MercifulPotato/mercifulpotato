A commodity good is produced by many entities and desired by many entities.<p>Some goods are not commodities but are substitutable: when AMD made pin-compatible 386 and 486 processors, you didn&#x27;t care much about whether a 40MHz 386 came from Intel or AMD, which is why AMD&#x27;s lower prices let them build their marketshare substantially.<p>If a widget isn&#x27;t being produced at all, just sitting in a warehouse, the price can easily be governed by:<p>- the person who needs a hundred of them vs the warehouse that would like to no longer pay an inventory tax on the 110 in stock<p>- the broker who knows where the last hundred widgets are stored, and has figured out customers who really need them in ones and tens<p>- the warehouse that thinks it has all the remaining widgets in the world, and advertises them at a high price to see if anybody wants them')
