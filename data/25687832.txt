I bought in when the stock was at ~$50 in 2013 and sold after it jumped to $175. I bought into the company as I was seeing model S&#x27;s everywhere I looked and realized it was a company that was growing rapidly. Fast forward a few years I owned a house that has solarcity(owned by tesla now) panels on the roof, the roof needs to be replaced and dealing with solarcity was probably one of the worst experiences I have ever dealt with in my life. After that experience I wrote off Tesla as a really badly run company and have since never owned their stock. I think alot of the growth is FOMO and extreme hype around the cult of Elon Musk. I like that Musk takes chances and goes for moonshots, we need more of that in todays society. That being said the stock is in stupid territory and I&#x27;ll be taking a short position myself(I think even Elon thinks its overvalued).')
