But that was one of the cases dismissed over procedure. The courts essentially said they should have complained about it before the election instead of after.<p>So this is another example of the same thing. Rhetorically effective if you don&#x27;t look at the details, so media stories everywhere, but not convincing to the other side.<p>And part of this is a problem specifically <i>because</i> they never really got to have a trial and do discovery and all of that. Because if you go through the whole process then it comes out one way or the other. But if the cases get dismissed on procedure then you have one side saying &quot;all your cases were dismissed so shut up&quot; and the other side saying they never actually got their day in court and nothing to ever reconcile them because both statements are true.')
