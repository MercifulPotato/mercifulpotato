I could only find a handful of CVEs for cgit, and the last one was in 2018 (v 1.2.1)[1]. It involved reading files outside the git tree. That said, it&#x27;s not the common software to see publicly, so probably hasn&#x27;t been thoroughly vetted. But I think the point still stands that installing from source isn&#x27;t going to be a horrible security risk.<p>Similarly though -- It is a mature project without a lot of new features. I don&#x27;t think there are killer features in master that would make me want to install from source over `apt install cgit`<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvedetails.com&#x2F;vulnerability-list&#x2F;vendor_id-15775&#x2F;product_id-33075&#x2F;Cgit-Project-Cgit.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cvedetails.com&#x2F;vulnerability-list&#x2F;vendor_id-1577...</a>')
