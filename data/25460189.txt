That&#x27;s what I do when I got home from work most days: cook some rice in the instant pot, chop up some meat and cook it in the air fryer, and steam some vegetables in the microwave. Sure, it&#x27;s not as fast as heating up a burrito or something, but it&#x27;s not that much longer either and once you&#x27;ve done it a few times you can just do it on auto-pilot.')
