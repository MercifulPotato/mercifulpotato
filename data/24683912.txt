In Australia cigarettes are legal. But advertising or indeed any form of promotion (including attractive packaging) is not.  If Oxytocin were legal was legal in Australia in the same way tobacco is, the Slackers would have had their arses hauled off to jail ages ago.<p>Granted, the USA doesn&#x27;t seem to have reached the same common sense compromise when it comes to legalising cannabis.  You seem to go from mandatory jail terms for anyone who touches the stuff, to full on &quot;government get out of my way so I seduce every sucker I can find into full on addiction&quot;.<p>There are some aspects of the USA I fear I will never understand.')
