I know there is one and may be two on 13 inch models.<p>2 and 3 I’ll answer to the “best of my knowledge” but on the professional level it’s something my team doesn’t handle (I do wish I knew more!). Features get merged to dev&#x2F;stage&#x2F;main and trigger blue-green rolling deploys based on whatever is configured. The deploy is handled through AWS CodeDeploy (not my choice, also not my teams jurisdiction) which handles ticket validation&#x2F;testing&#x2F;deploying to whatever k8s cluster&#x2F;manual deployment rollover if needed.<p>I believe you can build ARM images from Docker, or at least I have a vague recollection of doing so for a Raspberry Pi, on a normal x86 machine')
