Every living thing has a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Most animals are at least in small ways, consumers of animals.<p>There is moral value in striving to maximize the quality of life in all its stages, that does not necessarily have to exclude death for a purpose.<p>Everything dies whether by accident, disease, predation, of degradation by age. Thinking things were better off not existing or better off dying of organ failure instead of being eaten doesn’t always make sense to me.')
