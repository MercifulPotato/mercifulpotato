For small game studios it is easier to find mainstream developers who can do game development rather than only those willing to master niche toolchains.<p>The side-effect of using mainstream toolchains is it has more moving parts and hence has more complexity (that is unnecessary at a solo developer scale).<p>I agree that the learning curve has become harder a creative arts designer who wants to be a solo game developer to express their creativity.<p>So maybe the real question is what are the accessible mediums in which creative digital artists put out their hobby&#x2F;amateur work today?')
