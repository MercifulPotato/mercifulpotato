Actual planning - not just vague calls for violence - occurred, in plain view, on Facebook, and nothing was done about it.  Therefore, if we apply the same standard, Facebook should not be operating this morning.  Here’s a direct quote from the Amazon letter you referred to:<p><i>”...we cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others.”</i><p>The article we are discussing clearly found that Facebook meets precisely the same criteria.  Therefore, services should not be provided to them, correct?  Whoever provides their bandwidth undoubtedly has the very similar TOS...they all have similar provisions about network abuse.<p>Also, here’s a quote from the article you’re referring to:<p><i>”People on Parler used the social network to stoke fear, spread hate, and allegedly coordinate the insurrection at the Capitol building on Wednesday.</i>”<p>I don’t know why you and others on here continue to argue that a double standard, combined with either inaccurate reporting or outright lies, is not at play here - despite overwhelming and obvious evidence to the contrary.  But it’s disingenuous and makes me sad not just for HN, but for the country at large.')
