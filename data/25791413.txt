A lot like Notion, which is actually the tool we use internally for a lightweight CRM and such (though as we&#x27;ve progressed with SN we find ourselves using it less and less).<p>I definitely think people are more <i>accustomed</i> to documents vs. cards, but we&#x27;ve many users say they enjoy the card format more once they acclimate. The real power in the cards though is less that they look like cards and more just encouraging people to be a little bit more modular &#x2F; atomic in their thinking (which humans seem to do anyway). Other great tools like Roam&#x2F;Obsidian do this by encouraging your atomic thoughts to be represented as bullet points and that can work great for some people too, but one of our goals is to have a fairly portable format that you can use anywhere (hence the push for embedding) and cards works very well for that.<p>On Supernotes you can also turn on &quot;seamless mode&quot; which makes delineation between cards disappear entirely so it just looks like you&#x27;re reading a document, and we want to add more flows like that in the future so that the line between cards and docs blurs even more when you want&#x2F;need it to.')
