Recursive calls for financial calculations easily go hundreds of thousands of calls deep.  This is why high-end actuarial modeling software either decomposes it into a dependency graph and unrolls function calls where possible, or just &quot;brute-forces&quot; it by being a thin wrapper over c++, i.e. using operator overloading on ::operator().<p>I&#x27;ve seen ill-fated efforts of capable software developers attempting to unroll the recursive function calls, and ending up with 2000 line functions that are impossible to maintain.')
