If you run a couple thousand threads on windows 10, or Android 10, or a recent Linux or <i>BSD, it&#x27;s probably fine (ish).<p>But probably not on Windows 9x, maybe not even on NT4 (although, NT4 was pretty solid), and I wouldn&#x27;t expect good results on Linux or a </i>BSD from 2000 either.<p>But macos has lowered my expectations. It&#x27;s a mash of FreeBSD from the turn of the century, with Mach from earlier, and whatever stuff they&#x27;ve fiddled with since then, plus a nice UI layer. They don&#x27;t regularly pull in updates from FreeBSD, and the killed their server line (which was mediocre at best anyway), so when it panics if you do something weird, it&#x27;s not unexpected.')
