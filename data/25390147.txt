It&#x27;s very easy to be a phone &quot;luxury&quot; brand when so many phones are sold with thin to no margins. Apple certainly props up their &quot;luxury status&quot;&#x2F;&quot;luxury image&quot; with much higher margin products in the margins outside of phones, but it is easy to see why the bar for &quot;luxury phone&quot; itself is so low that it can also be a mass produced&#x2F;mass consumed object.')
