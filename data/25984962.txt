I&#x27;m amazed that the Art Institute would open up its exhibits like this. I just looked up the Met in NYC and they&#x27;ve digitized large swaths of their space too.<p>That said, I usually already visit the Art Institute about twice a year (I live in the city) and will likely continue to do so even though it&#x27;s now on Google Maps. There&#x27;s something immediate about seeing the works in person that makes it worthwhile to be present in the space.')
