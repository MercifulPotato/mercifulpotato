Hitler complains bitterly: &quot;Russians had moved Panzer factories to the Urals and making 100 new ones every day, what can I do?&quot;.<p>That is why Hitler even made the hazardous trip to Finland. There was no other sane person anywhere near him to ask advice. It was decided there and then that Finland will stop advancing and aim to some kind of deal with the Russians. After the defeat Germany will have some kind future, but Russians will exterminate Finnish people totally like the have done to all other Finnic nations.')
