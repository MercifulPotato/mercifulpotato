Yes, it is possible to get &quot;tons of exercise&quot; on your own using body weight, but it is not the same as barbell strength training. You are much more limited because actual strength training is a somewhat scientific process of progressive overload--adding 2-5 pounds per workout to an exercise. You cannot do this easily&#x2F;precisely with body weight exercises, and additionally there is a reason the barbell is shaped as it is--to maximize the ability to support and balance the weight.<p>The argument that nobody &quot;needs&quot; gym access is akin to arguing nobody &quot;needs&quot; restaurants--they can all just cook their own food. Or nobody &quot;needs&quot; grocery stores--they can just grow&#x2F;raise all their own food.')
