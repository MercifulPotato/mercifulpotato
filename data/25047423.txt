If you make great products that people like to use, people will leave positive feedback for you.  This kind of endorsement is exactly what shills are trying to copy, so it does look similar.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m yet another happy Brother owner. I love my 2380DW, which I recently bought to replace my first Brother laser (I forget the model number) that had served me well for more than a decade. That&#x27;s in sharp contrast to the crappy HP inkjet I bought my first year of college, which lasted less than one semester, and my wife&#x27;s several inkjets through her college days (now, obviously, she uses the Brother laser) and my parent&#x27;s various inkjet struggles. Some 5 years ago, I set them up with a 2730DW, and the first service I&#x27;ve had to do for them was to change the wifi password a few months ago when they changed ISPs.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25008894" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25008894</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24977699" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24977699</a>')
