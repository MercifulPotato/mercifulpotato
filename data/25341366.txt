Item(by='PeterisP', descendants=None, kids=[25341555], score=None, time=1607397889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25341062, text='Of course, not using that license and stopping the use of that code is also a completely valid (though costly) option.<p>If the licence giver believes that you&#x27;re violating the contract, they are free to try and enforce that contact in court. A German court would almost certainly rule that the clause is unenforceable at least as it applies to that particular order-related modification (the licence requirements would still be valid for unrelated modifications). There is a nontrivial legal question whether that would imply that the requirement voids the licence as a whole or just the specific clause. Specific terms (e.g. AGPL clause 12) may suggest that it would void the whole licence, but I wouldn&#x27;t be certain on how German courts would consider it given these specific circumstances; a German lawyer might have a good idea but I do not.<p>But in any case, contractual obligations are not an excuse for noncompliance with other legal requirements. If it does turn out that executing the order is incompatible with a particular license, then you must execute the order anyway and decide what&#x27;s the best way to handle the consequences. Breaching a contract is a legally valid option as well, and in some cases that may even be the best option, if the expected liabilities&#x2F;damages are less than the consequences of complying with it.')
