The Skylinks aren&#x27;t just hashes, they contain a couple bytes extra of information as well.<p>Between the explicit list of potential hosts and a small amount of hinting in the Skylink, you can narrow down the number of potential places a file is stored to be small enough that you can just ping all of them in parallel with a request for the data. You don&#x27;t have to do any multi-hop routing to find the data.<p>This saves latency.')
