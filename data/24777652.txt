The book is free for any developer currently out of a job [1].<p>COVID was what triggered me writing this book. At the beginning of the year, I was in the middle of writing a book on growing as a software engineer. However, as COVID started and the tech the layoffs followed in April and May, I found myself wanting to help people impacted. I’ve been a hiring manager for a few years, so I offered to do resume reviews for those laid off or applying for positions[2]. I had more than 300 developers take me up on this offer in a few days.<p>I did in-depth reviews for the first few dozen people, then copied-and-pasted common observations for the next batch, and finally sent over a 15-page PDF with the most common advice, with a few pointers for the bulk of the people. Here’s an early version of this PDF[3] - which also was the basis of this book.<p>I wasn’t that happy with how little backup I had for the advice in that guide, so I started to reach out to tech recruiters and hiring managers for more feedback. I also asked people to share back how their improved resumes worked out, applying the suggestions, and started adding this into a growing guide.<p>Four months and 55,000 words later, the book is ready. I tried to give level-headed, but practical advice, with lots of examples from actual resumes (that are all anonymized). Happy to answer any questions here.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thetechresume.com&#x2F;complimentary-copy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thetechresume.com&#x2F;complimentary-copy</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;GergelyOrosz&#x2F;status&#x2F;1263855589861580800" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;GergelyOrosz&#x2F;status&#x2F;1263855589861580800</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thetechresume.com&#x2F;A_Good_Tech_Resume.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thetechresume.com&#x2F;A_Good_Tech_Resume.pdf</a>')
