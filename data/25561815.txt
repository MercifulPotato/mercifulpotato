They don&#x27;t understand the concepts of &quot;killing&quot; or &quot;life&quot; and don&#x27;t value life in the same manner as humans.<p>It&#x27;s always struck me as odd when unethical treatment of animals is justified by saying &quot;animals eat&#x2F;kill&#x2F;hurt other animals too!&quot;. We&#x27;re different from animals. Our standards should be higher.')
