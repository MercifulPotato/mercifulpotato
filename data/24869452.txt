And Hossenfelder is correct that in hindsight naturalness wasn&#x27;t a very good rule.<p>But by the same hindsight, <i>no</i> theory that could be detected in previous experiments would have worked either. In this view, making the experiments at all was a complete waste, we should just have drawn the winning theory from a hat and stopped all further work.')
