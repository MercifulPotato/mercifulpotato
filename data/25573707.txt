No, that does not make the methodology sound. They use a word like &quot;aggression&quot; which has a qualitative meaning and attempt to assign a quantitative metric to it. To assign a meaning to it, I would have to go to other studies to find out how this links to my various qualitative notion of &quot;aggressive&quot;: incidence of violent crime vs. cutting in line vs. correcting people&#x27;s grammar.<p>You may say &quot;this is impossible, the bar you are setting means that social science papers can&#x27;t even use the word &#x27;aggressive&#x27; to describe quantitative results&quot;. And yes, that&#x27;s true, they can&#x27;t. They can say things like &quot;convicted of a violent crime&quot; which we can at least agree means something objective that vaguely correlates to aggressiveness (although this has limits). The media can report this as &quot;aggression&quot; and that&#x27;s fine too, so long as we know what is actually being measured.')
