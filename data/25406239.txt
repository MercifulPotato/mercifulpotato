You’re proposing working computers and smartphones for every desk and student.<p>Computers and apps are not standardised at all. Disparity between them and compatibility issues are a massive contention when you have lots of people to educate. Not only that, even today here in the UK, not every student has a smartphone or a home computer so you’re instantly discriminating against them. The answer? Grab a standard calculator out of a box that everyone else has and loan it to them.<p>All students need a calculator for other subjects as well. In science, technology and geography they use them too.<p>And you can’t realistically control the configuration of a computer or smartphone in an exam.')
