I did it for Germany. The fuel savings are basically negligible (it was about 200 Euros per year). This is due to high electricity prices.\nIn the US at least you can say, I will pay $15k more upfront, but then I will get it back in fuel savings.\nBut in Europe people drive far less and electricity is significantly more expensive.<p>It&#x27;s still not financially wise to own an EV.')
