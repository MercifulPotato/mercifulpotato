Item(by='bpodgursky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606244678, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200753, text='Honestly, I&#x27;m pretty over the reddit contribution rules.  The rules are oriented at people who post links all day, and incredibly unfriendly to casual users, or people who generate OC.<p>Ex, many of them ask for a 90&#x2F;10 other&#x2F;self-promotion ratio.  Well, I don&#x27;t surf reddit and submit links all day, so I violated this in &#x2F;programming by posting two self-posts (in a year) about OSS side projects I&#x27;ve worked on, and got shadowbanned.   They weren&#x27;t monetized at all, they were describing completely OSS personal projects (exploring d3.js and other graphics libraries).<p>If that&#x27;s not what reddit wants... then I don&#x27;t care what reddit wants.  I&#x27;ll use burner accounts and post like a normal human being, and if they get banned... I&#x27;ll make new ones.')
