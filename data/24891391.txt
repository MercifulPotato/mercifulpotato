I ride 50KM 3 times a week, Strava&#x27;s &quot;estimated power rating&quot; is all over the place, given i ride the same trail every time i would think it should not be like this.<p>Lets be reasonable and say 160W (somewhere between all the ratings strava gave) avg for my 2 hour trip.<p>I think I am a pretty strong rider, at the peak of the season I can beat electric bikes on flat ground as my top speed is higher then theirs (I dont have a speed limiter, they do)<p>I can tell you this is NOT easy and once you realize how much physical effort it is you appreciate being able to plug things into the wall.<p>it is the sustained power output that will kill you..  You can probably dump 10w of power for a long time, but putting out serious power for extended periods of time isnt easy.')
