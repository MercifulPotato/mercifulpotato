This amplifies #1 significantly. It was less of a problem in Lippmann’s time since the News world was much smaller. He might have called this “rumor”, not news.<p>He called it propaganda and it was a big problem during his time.<p>&gt; <i>Without some form of censorship, propaganda in the strict sense of the word is impossible.</i> In order to conduct a propaganda there must be some barrier between the public and the event. Access to the real environment must be limited, before anyone can create a pseudo-environment that he thinks wise or desirable. For while people who have direct access can misconceive what they see, no one else can decide how they shall misconceive it, unless he can decide where they shall look, and at what. The military censorship is the simplest form of barrier, but by no means the most important, because it is known to exist, and is therefore in certain measure agreed to and discounted.<p>IMO we got here because social media allows people to run from one form of censorship straight into the arms of another without realizing they&#x27;re still being censored. The same thing happened in Lippmann&#x27;s time. People did not realize their circles were excluding information. The result was a couple periods of very-difficult-to-reconcile division.')
