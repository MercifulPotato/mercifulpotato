Admit it.<p>Democrat politicians encouraged this. China was already in lockdown at that point. They were following the science, why wasn’t Nancy Pelosi? Why wasn’t the New York department of health?<p>Science is full complete horse crap since anytime after the 1960s. It is a profession that seems to collect the dishonest and egotistical. The only thing worse is when you mix in politicians from the Democrat party. And the RINOs.<p>Also f<i></i>k right off with calling me “misinformed.”<p>And by the way, it causes me immense pain to know that there’s so many of you out there that are so damn blind and can’t read between the lines on anything. Pawns.<p>There’s to be no “healing process” you are a complete fool if you think the democrats want to “heal” with the republicans after they lost a dozen seats.')
