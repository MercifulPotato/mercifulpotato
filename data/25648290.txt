And we all sit inside all day in artificial lighting anyway?<p>Kids don&#x27;t give a shit about walking to school in the dark. I know, as someone who was recently a kid and resented winter &quot;daylight wasting time&quot;, I would much rather have had more hours of daylight in the afternoon when I was finished with school and could actually do fun stuff outside, rather than useless daylight in the morning while I&#x27;m sitting on the bus or in a classroom at 7:30 AM. And as an adult I feel the same about work.')
