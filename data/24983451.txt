I was just presenting things that could lead to an apparently healthy young-ish man suddenly dropping dead for no apparent reason.<p>I didn&#x27;t pick them totally randomly, though. I had a rationale: He seemed emaciated, which suggests something left him immobile for an extended period since he had food at hand. This made me think of strokes and snake&#x2F;spider bites. The former could leave you permanently immobile, but alive. Without assistance he&#x27;d have died within a few days. The latter, depending on the sort, could leave you immobile and in great pain for a day or so, with a chance to recover and survive. But if he&#x27;d already become sufficiently dehydrated he may not have had the energy or wherewithal to care for himself.<p>There are other conditions which could lead to a similar outcome. Heat exhaustion, for instance, may not kill outright. But could leave you in a state where you need assistance and can&#x27;t recover on your own.<p>Whether they&#x27;d show up on an autopsy, I don&#x27;t know. But also per the article it was a while before he was found. So given a sufficient level of decay, it&#x27;s possible these conditions wouldn&#x27;t show up or would be sufficiently hard to detect (remember, the sheriff&#x27;s didn&#x27;t even want to pay $5k for the DNA testing, he wasn&#x27;t a crime victim so their budget wasn&#x27;t paying for a lot of analysis).')
