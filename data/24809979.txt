Garland had previously been out forward by the GOP as an example of a qualified and respected judge. And let&#x27;s not forget that had Clinton won, the GOP was determined to keep that seat on the court empty for 4 years. They said as much. And when they refused to even consider Garland they also said that their newly made-up rule would apply if the shoe was on the other foot. They clearly didn&#x27;t mean that, and the rationale for confirming Barrett that you are parroting above is just that, a rationale. An excuse. Don&#x27;t pretend the rest of us are stupid. We know exactly why your position on this has changed and it has everything to do with the fact that your side has the temporary power to do what it wants.')
