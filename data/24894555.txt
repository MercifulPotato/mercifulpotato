Well I setup some handy shell functions:<p>1) copy the latest screenshot into webroot&#x2F;screenshots&#x2F;${randstr}.png and copy the url to clipboard. this replaces dropbox&#x27;s cool screenshot sharing feature. love sharing screenshots with coworkers this way, the files stays with you, you can redact easily.<p>2) serve static files the same way, if needed too. the magic&#x27;s all in the shell scripts.<p>3) explore new open source webapps running on local docker.<p>Further?<p>Build a sort of like a devtools backend server, and a mobile app paired to it to do all sorts of cool stuff: run crons, get notifications for events, monitor servers &#x2F; ssl expiry etc.<p>Limit&#x27;s your imagination. But, security is also very important.')
