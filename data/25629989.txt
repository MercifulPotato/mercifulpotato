Item(by='squiggleblaz', descendants=None, kids=[25630450, 25630133], score=None, time=1609759732, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25629104, text='Every system that relies on passwords also provides a password reset facility. The facility typically sends a token to your email address and allows you to set your password that way.<p>Doesn&#x27;t this mean that a system which relies on an token sent to you is no worse that a system with a password? With a password, you can guess that GTP used the same password on Hacker News and BigBank, and if that fails, you can try and have their token redirected to you. Without a password, you have to rely on getting that token. So if your argument is that email and SMS are insecure channels, I mean yeah okay; but it doesn&#x27;t make a system more secure if you can get in with a password _or_ an email&#x2F;SMS vs the only option is an email&#x2F;SMS.<p>I hate passwords; my password manager (the one built into Firefox) will generate passwords on my desktop, but most of the time I need to generate a password it&#x27;s on my phone (where, oddly, they have not included the capacity to generate a password). So my password is crap, perhaps not stored, and I forget it. I rely entirely on the password reset facility. But most of the time if you tell me &quot;please just sign up, think of a unique username and a secure password&quot; I&#x27;m just not going to bother.')
