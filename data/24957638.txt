Where I disagree is the need to drop semantics. Semantics are the foundation of how we organize our society. Perhaps on a small-scale or a personal level, dropping categories can be helpful, even freeing. For that to be done universally would be a disaster. I can see that being possible in the future, after large-scale social change, but not currently. The bulk of modern political discourse is effectively arguments over definitions of various categories and the membership of their constituencies.<p>Even something as minor as the category of a tomato, would matter very much to a tomato farmer when, hypothetically, all vegetable farms qualify for a higher level of government subsidies than fruit farms. Or to a retailer when, again hypothetically, fruits and vegetables are charged different sales tax rates.')
