Meanwhile your arguments are:<p>- &quot;fixation on wildly cherry picked data and missaplied (sic) statistics is the conspiracy theory&quot;<p>- &quot;There are already court cases with the best experts in the land looking at the counts&quot;<p>- &quot;They are starting to be laughed out of court because they have no evidence to support their claims&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t find your arguments compelling because you are arguing to authority. You also use a case that was dismissed that has nothing to do with Benford&#x27;s Law. Please address specifically what data is being cherry picked and why Benford&#x27;s Law shouldn&#x27;t apply in this election.')
