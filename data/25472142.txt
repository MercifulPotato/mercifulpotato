Especially compared to JavaScript and Python, which aren&#x27;t even compiled (and which I still agree with the &quot;it&#x27;s crap&quot; hivemind). Anything that needs real performance you should be outsourcing to C&#x2F;C++ FFI calls, and as long as you do that your Java app&#x27;s performance should be OK. And a key cause of Java&#x27;s big slowdown are checks e.g. for null-pointers and casts, which are <i>much</i> better than C++&#x2F;Rust&#x27;s approach of being unsafe-by-default.<p>Java is verbose, but JetBrain&#x27;s awesome IDE single-handedly fixes this problem - writing POJOs and using long-named functions and classes is fast, and IntelliJ will hide excess boilerplate so that even reading code is easier. And if verbosity is still too much of an issue, there are JVM alternatives like Kotlin.')
