They’re only used by speculators looking for quick riches, people who don’t like government-backed currencies, and criminals who want a black-market way to exchange money.<p>The second statement contradicts the first. People who don&#x27;t like&#x2F;trust government-backed currencies aren&#x27;t fanatics. The way the big banks handle money is quite reckless and dangerous, as we&#x27;ve seen time and time again. And buying drugs for your own personal use should be legal (IMO) but is not. Cryptocurrencies <i>are</i> useful. Maybe not to most people, or to Bruce Schneier, but that (blanket) statement is simply false.')
