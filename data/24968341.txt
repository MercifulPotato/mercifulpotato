Item(by='Ichthypresbyter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604326868, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24968051, text='Dutch law has two classes of &#x27;moped&#x27;- both were originally conceived as motor-assisted pedal cycles, but in practice both are now mostly Vespa-type scooters with no option to pedal.<p>Both require insurance and an &#x27;insurance plate&#x27; which is a different format from the standard licence plate seen on motorcycles. The rider must be licensed, but this can be either a car or a motorcycle licence (or a moped-specific licence which can be obtained from the age of 16, compared to 18 for cars and motorcycles).<p>The &#x27;snorfiets&#x27; scooters have blue number plates, and are legally supposed to be limited to 25 km&#x2F;h. The rider does not need to wear a helmet.<p>The &#x27;bromfiets&#x27; scooters, with yellow number plates, are legally supposed to be limited to 45 km&#x2F;h, but the rider must wear a helmet.<p>(In practice most scooters seem to routinely go much faster than they are supposed to be capable of)<p>In general, both types of scooter can use some, but not all, bike paths. A snorfiets is allowed on more bike paths than a bromfiets is- bromfietsen must ride on the main road in built-up areas.')
