It would be paradoxical to &#x27;jump start&#x27; the economies when they have been shutdown at the same time.<p>The purpose of the cheques is that help those who cannot work, and draw an income, to pay the rent and purchase food. At least that is the opinion of folks like Ben Bernanke and Paul Krugman.<p>Some people are of course labelling them as &quot;stimulus cheques&quot;, but that is incorrect: it is probably undesirable for people to <i>go outside of their homes</i> and try to do &#x27;normal&#x27; stuff. At least not until vaccines are rolled out in volume.')
