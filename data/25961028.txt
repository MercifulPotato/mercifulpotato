The first main misunderstanding is that Software Engineering is about writing code.  I would argue that is the main misunderstanding.<p>In reality, software engineering is about solving problems, business problems, process problems, machine problems, etc. using code in software as a tool.<p>The 80&#x2F;20 rule applies here.  80% of time is spent analyzing and developing solutions, 20% of time is spent writing code and developing software.<p>Too many people focus on the code part, when they should be focusing on problem solving part.')
