Going against the popular view--either site-wide or against the popular view of the people who access a given comment thread--will result in downvotes even when posting material that&#x27;s factually accurate. This tends to create a self-amplifying process where established views become more entrenched and, possibly, more extreme.<p>For example, the majority view among people who access COVID-19 posts on HN is that the disease is not a major risk. Anything posted to the contrary is highly likely to be be downvoted and&#x2F;or flagged for removal. This drives away factual information in favor of groupthink and creates nothing more than a single-sided echo chamber.<p>HN is no better than Reddit in this regard; it&#x27;s just that the groupthink hot buttons on HN are different from those on Reddit.<p>As this view itself is a view that runs against the universally accepted wisdom on HN, this post itself has already been downvoted and will likely be downvoted further.<p>As a matter of personal ethics, I only downvote material that is socially hazardous (e.g. COVID-19 misinformation), seemingly inorganic, or seemingly dishonest. Being wrong in good faith isn&#x27;t a karma crime and shouldn&#x27;t be punished. Unfortunately this is far from a universally accepted perspective.<p>With regard to why both-sides-bad arguments are not well received in the context of US politics, I feel newen covered most of that in his&#x2F;her reply to you. However, I will add that &#x27;both-sides-bad&#x27; has a really long history of being used disingenuously by the right wing, both directly and by <i>paying</i> left wing fringe candidates who use &#x27;both-sides-bad&#x27; messaging to split the Democratic vote.<p>Both sides are indeed bad (see: e.g. Obama&#x27;s execution-by-drone policy), but one side is far worse than the other (see: e.g. Trump&#x27;s children-in-cages policy) and &#x27;both-sides-bad&#x27; is usually used by the right wing as a way to trivialize Republican abuses. People who pay attention to US politics tend to be aware of this and will be less inclined to give &#x27;both-sides-bad&#x27; comments the benefit of the doubt.<p>Further, on the question of respect for democratic rights, the factual history of voter suppression in the United States is so black-and-white (literally: it&#x27;s a history of white conservatives preventing black people from voting) that anyone who does a &#x27;both-sides-bad&#x27; take on this is either grossly uninformed or dishonest. Neither option will be well received by people who pay attention to these kind of issues.')
