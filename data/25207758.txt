This was a good and healthy life that produced strong people. For thousands of years the farm was <i>the</i> producer of civilization and culture. Today, on the other hand, it has been reduced to a <i>factory,</i> and culture and tradition is increasingly molded by political organizations who sometimes don&#x27;t have the family&#x27;s best intentions at heart. The unit has been operationalized and a big part of what it once meant to be a farmer in a close-knit community has instead been reduced to being a factory worker on minimum wage (or less, if you&#x27;re an illegal immigrant).')
