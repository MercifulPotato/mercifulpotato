This was often reported as the part for big business. Actually it&#x27;s 500b to seed new special purpose banks that can operate with 10 to 1 leverage. So the 500b is actually 5.5t, making the whole bill several times larger than widely discussed.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of the &quot;chain CPI&quot; fiasco where Congress tried to reduce Social Security, but hid it in a technical detail. Except this time Democrats were on board. Neither party challenged the main narrative, and so the media didn&#x27;t bother to either.')
