Apple used to have Technical Notes that were a deep dive into how the OS is implemented. They were super helpful in troubleshooting and optimizing for Mac OS. They haven&#x27;t published anything like this in over a decade.<p>I suspect someone took &quot;hiding implementation details&quot; too seriously, and now Apple never talks about how anything works (it&#x27;s all magic). You only get function&#x27;s signature, and &quot;documentation&quot; that is basically just the function name with added spaces between words.')
