There is nothing wrong with having a main monolithic application with a few parts separated out into microservices that are necessary for performance or team management.<p>The author hits the nail on the head at the end:<p><pre><code>  If I could go back and redo our early microservice attempts, I would 100% start by focusing on all the &quot;CPU bound&quot; functionality first: image processing and resizing, thumbnail generation, PDF exporting, PDF importing, file versioning with rdiff, ZIP archive generation. I would have broken teams out along those boundaries, and have them create &quot;pure&quot; services that dealt with nothing but Inputs and Outputs (ie, no &quot;integration databases&quot;, no &quot;shared file systems&quot;) such that every other service could consume them while maintaining loose-coupling.</code></pre>')
