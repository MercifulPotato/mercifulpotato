Item(by='sdoering', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606041282, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25176311, text='&gt; I came up with Rug Driven Development<p>I so need to steal this term. Not exactly for what you are describing even if I come across this on a nearly weekly basis in so many different industries. Be it automotive, be it finance, be it what ever.<p>But - and this is were I will probably use it in the future - I come across it in agency work. You win a shiny new project proposal and need to quickly show something for your corporate &quot;partners&quot; to shine before their management. To make them look good for their yearly appraisals or what not.<p>You already know that you will never fix the underlying shit you built, because your contract will be a new pitch three years down the line and it isn&#x27;t clear if you will win it again. So let the next people deal with the tech debt - but guess what: They will just do the same. So debt will pile on and on.<p>So &quot;Rug Driven Development&quot; will be my goto term going forward.')
