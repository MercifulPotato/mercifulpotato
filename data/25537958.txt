It may be the case that a conscious mind like a human mind is a hard prerequisite to then leveraging tools to build technology that makes us immortal. In such a case I wouldn&#x27;t expect regular animals to be capable of achieving this through sheer brute force over billions of years. Might need to flatten all those additional years of evolution into CPU-time and let an AI figure out how to do it for us.')
