There are now, and a recent and pretty successful attack on the Capital. That&#x27;s why we need tighter controls now.<p>And what would have happened back then with no fences? The fences were a block back from the street, and I was inside them. Most likely there would have been a much larger visible protesting crowd along the route, and probably less conflict because people couldn&#x27;t get in in time. I completely understand the metal detectors that were there, but I really doubt the chances of someone taking a shot back then are even 1&#x2F;100th of the chances someone would next week.')
