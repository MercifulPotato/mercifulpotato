If I work for a MA based company, how do they have any claim to a portion of my income when I have no residency status there? States aren’t allowed to tax interstate commerce, after all, and not being a resident there I would have no vote for the state houses that determine tax laws.<p>I live in ID and work remotely for a CA-based company, so I’ve got a personal interest in this if CA ever decided they wanted to pull a similar move.<p>Interested to see what the result would be if this got to the SCOTUS.')
