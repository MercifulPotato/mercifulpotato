I&#x27;m more interested in achieving a practical goal - getting a large group of people to say no to leetcode.<p>My guess is more people will say no to leetcode if they think of it as  a general group anyone can join. This allows a larger amount of people to ignore idealogical barriers they might have to joining. So for now it&#x27;s a &quot;group&#x2F;job board&quot;.')
