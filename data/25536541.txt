Anyone who takes any measure to make older devices obsolete when they are still perfectly capable  should be ashamed!<p>We are in the middle of a mass extinction; we have destroyed the oceans with plastic and runoff; we have created an environmental catastrophe. Mindless media-driven consumerism must stop.')
