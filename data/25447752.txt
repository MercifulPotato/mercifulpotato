RH frankenkernels can contain subtle breakage. E.g. the Go and Rust standard libraries needed to add workarounds because certain RH versions implemented copy_file_range in a manner that returns error codes inconsistent with the documented API because patches were only backported for some filesystems but not for others. These issues never occurred on mainline.<p>And for the same reasons that the affected users chose a &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;supported&quot; distro they were also unable to upgrade to one where the issue was fixed.')
