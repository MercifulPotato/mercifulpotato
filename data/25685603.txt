I have so far rejected being on-call succesfully (it is paid, but I value more my time than my money). Soon my salary will be reviewed and the topic is on the table again: I have been asked if I may reconsider my position regarding being on-call.<p>The company explictly says that being on-call is not mandatory, there is no problem about this. Other colleagues at my same level are doing on-call and bring this topic (among other topics) to the salary review process to be considered in their favour.<p>I&#x27;m not going to change my decision, but I&#x27;m wondering how that will influence on my future salary. Even if the companay is transparent about this topic, I definitely think that not participating in &quot;non-mandatory&quot; stuff in my company makes me no favour.')
