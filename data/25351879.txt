I used these in the office for music, on the bus for podcasts, as hands-free for my phone, etc. It was fantastic. The only complaint I really had was that the Bluetooth mode didn&#x27;t work with my phone&#x27;s mic. When they broke recently, I decided to pick up some Sennheisers[1] with similar functionality.<p>With both of these, there have been times when the cord got annoying, but I really like having that option. I&#x27;ve had these new ones almost two months and have probably charged the batteries once. That&#x27;s about on-par with the heyday pair - probably less frequently, truly.<p>People hate on the 3.5mm jack, but it never fails, and I think the hate it gets is disproportionate to how much people <i>actually</i> struggle with it. And if you <i>do</i> struggle with it on occasion, having the option to flip between Bluetooth &amp; 3.5mm is easy peasy.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.target.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;heyday-8482-active-noise-cancelling-over-ear-headphones-8211-black-gold&#x2F;-&#x2F;A-79899088#lnk=sametab" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.target.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;heyday-8482-active-noise-cancelling...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B083W7V3RG" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smile.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B083W7V3RG</a>')
