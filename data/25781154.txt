I know my cousin growing up was afraid of dogs, heights, terrified of open water, and so on. He grew up with few friends, did not play any sports, and spent most days indoors on the computer, very over protective mother.<p>Honestly, in previous times he would be ridiculed for being very wimpy and scared of the world. Very little social pressure now. You can just retreat into your man cave, battle station, or cacoon after coming home from a very safe office job.<p>Masculinity is not just genetic.
