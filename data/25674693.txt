It&#x27;s widely acknowledged that the company would continue to function exactly as it is now for a very long time if they fired 95% of the staff. Heck stability and uptime would probably improve due to fewer deployments&#x2F;no new feature adds. So the graph with declining expenses and increasing revenue isn&#x27;t at all surprising.<p>The problem with this model is that you are coasting on the work done by your full time staff in the initial few years, whom you fired and replaced with part time contractors who get no benefits. Even putting the ethical issues with this aside, if a competitor takes interest in your space and has a large war chest, you&#x27;d be powerless to compete with them. And when your tech is dated and current&#x2F;new customers want innovation, your low-price contracting firms working a few hours per week certainly aren&#x27;t going to be able to offer that.<p>So while I&#x27;m happy things are working in this case, no new company that starts with the environment you are describing is going to be successful.')
