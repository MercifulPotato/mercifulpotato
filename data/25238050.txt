You don&#x27;t seem open to actually discussing anything and would rather pontificate for upvotes.<p>My suggestion: read more history books and learn to appreciate the sacrifices that your forebears made so that you have the <i>privilege</i> of having your current opinion. A lot of people died for you to to be able to have the freedom to write unappreciative, snarky comments on the Internet. America certainly isn&#x27;t perfect, but even a cursory reading of history will show you that the alternatives were far, far, worse. Unless you think Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, or the Confederate States would have been better moral leaders?')
