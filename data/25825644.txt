We&#x27;re sanitizing language to protect the egos of everyone, at the expense of derailing a conversation that actually could relate to a lot of people here.<p>My parents are NOT AT ALL technically savvy. My mother&#x27;s web browser has a ton of bullshit addons all over it, or at least it did last time I looked at her computer in 2014-ish. I can&#x27;t imagine she&#x27;s gotten much better about this stuff. But we can&#x27;t talk about this pattern because it could hurt the identity of older HN readers who are technically savvy, it&#x27;s <i>offensive</i>.<p>Ageism is bad when it&#x27;s preventing people from getting work or engaging in society in a meaningful way. I simply do not care if it&#x27;s used to make casual remarks with the specific intent of getting people to relate to an idea, e.g. people who don&#x27;t know any better about privacy are actually people you know, most likely your parents or grandparents or some of their friends. And taking part in shutting down that conversation because of &quot;ageism&quot; is, IMO, worse than the ageism itself.')
