Due to the niche target market, it only has a subset of the functionality found in other accounting apps, but this also means that&#x27;s no unnecessary clutter. In other words, it&#x27;s stripped down and simple, but (hopefully) fully functional for the target user.<p>Also, it&#x27;s non-cloud&#x2F;non-SaaS in the sense that ... the data file is stored on the user&#x27;s computer instead of being stored in the vendor&#x27;s cloud and it&#x27;s in an accessible open data format. In other words, the user has full control over their own data.<p>For various reasons, I (hopefully?) think there is a market opportunity for non-SaaS entry level accounting software.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, here are some links:<p>Web edition of the app: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gigobooks.com&#x2F;webapp\nInterim website (work-in-progress, needs more marketing and content): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gigobooks.com\nThe open source &#x2F; desktop edition of the app: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gigobooks&#x2F;gigobooks<p>Some questions to spur discussion ...<p>* Do you think it has enough functionality for the target market&#x2F;user? What other additional features might be needed?\n* If you are a target user, would you use such an app? If not, why not?<p>Any comments, criticisms, questions etc. are welcome and appreciated.<p>Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for your comments and thoughts!')
