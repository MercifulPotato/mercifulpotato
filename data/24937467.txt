They don&#x27;t have all of the information and can&#x27;t make decisions that are best for individuals.<p>My implication is that <i>individuals</i> are the best suited to decide how their wealth is used. There should not exist policy makers who interfere in the market. Policymakers, no matter how noble they might be, are never going to know enough about the conditions individual humans face, and can therefore never know how that money is best utilized.<p>Climate science is heavily, almost entirely subsidized by taxpayer money, and the products which they are selling are more taxation. This is the driving force behind the climate alarmism - give up more of your wealth and freedoms to a benevolent State who will protect you from this scary thing.<p>If they were selling actual solutions which made people&#x27;s lives easier, I wouldn&#x27;t be so sceptical.')
