In particular you should look at Project Loom, which is Java’s answer to async&#x2F;await. It’s not finished yet because the design is much more general and novel, and it avoids the “function color” problem that async&#x2F;await has. It’s inspired in part by Erlang&#x2F;BEAM’s green threading system.<p>You might also look at the JDK flight recorder, which is an amazing feature that .NET doesn&#x27;t have. The Java perspective is adding complexity to the runtime fiest instead of the language.')
