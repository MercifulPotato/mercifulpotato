While others cleanup after me, I will be completing my next task and paving my way to promotion.<p>- If it works, it&#x27;s good enough. It does not matter if I can&#x27;t explain why it works.<p>- Everything is an obstacle. Documentation? obstacle. Coding standards? obstacle. I just want to complete tasks.<p>- I do exactly what I am asked for. It does not matter if it is insecure, it does not scale, or if the entire system crashes. All of that will be someone else&#x27;s problem later.<p>- Code does not have to make sense, as long as it runs it is good enough.<p>- I worship project management.<p>B) Sustainable mindset developer:<p>- The cost of tech debt compounds over time. I should fix tech debt before more code depends on it and becomes more expensive to fix.<p>- I need to understand how and why things work. Is this really working? Do I really understand what I am doing?<p>- Reviewing relevant documentation for the technologies I use is a good idea. Making sure I understand and follow coding standards is a good idea. Well crafted coding standards can save work.<p>- I understand that not all stakeholders are technical. I need to understand the technical implications of what I am asked to do, and push back if necessary.<p>- Code is written once, read many times. Readability makes everyone more productive.<p>- I acknowledge that project management documentation and tools are a form of documentation, and as such, it is not a source of truth. When it comes to things to do, the implementation is the source of truth, not tickets.<p>Bad companies promote A), good companies promote B).')
