They already provide a platform for storage accelerator IP to be shared between this Smart SSD and their pre-existing PCIe FPGA cards that connect to standard SSDs over PCIe or networks. So porting to another accelerator platform probably isn&#x27;t as big an issue as you expect.<p>The bigger challenge I see for implementing something like SQLite on a SmartSSD is that you really don&#x27;t want your database to exist on just one drive, so you need to figure out how to do HA across multiple SSDs while still offloading most of the computationally expensive database operations to the FPGAs instead of leaving it on the CPU. I think this will condemn SmartSSDs to always working at a slightly lower abstraction layer than what the application really wants.')
