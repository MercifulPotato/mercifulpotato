(serious, don&#x27;t know the answer to that question, though i could probably look it up)<p>You can take a look here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Party_divisions_of_United_States_Congresses" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Party_divisions_of_United_Stat...</a>.  You&#x27;ll notice that the individual chambers of congress change hands less often than the presidency.<p>Additionally, Congress has a high incumbency rate.  Even in huge swing years like 2018, the makeup of Congress remains largely the same.')
