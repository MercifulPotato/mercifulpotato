A normal gas station can handle around 100 cars per hour using a handful of pumps and is refueled by daily deliveries from a big truck.  Simple.  An electric charge point capable of that will require a massive amount of electricity, electricity delivered over wires.  Look into how much it costs to run such a service to a random location in a city.  Look at the costs of putting up even a handful of towers capable of delivering a thousand amps peak load.  Then look the additional real estate costs need to facilitate 100 cars&#x2F;hour worth of charging points.  Electric &#x27;stations&#x27; are very much not drop-in replacements.  We need a very different physical infrastructure (ie smaller charge points at every parking spot rather than central stations).')
