Item(by='JamesBarney', descendants=None, kids=[24834384], score=None, time=1603171459, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24833951, text='&gt; The article reads like you took every smartass redditor on the planet and condensed them down into an article. Why can I not express emotions in an argument, or why do I need to be &#x27;rational&#x27;, or why can I not be subjective? I don&#x27;t mean this in an offensive way but why is everyone who argues supposed to pretend they&#x27;re autistic, because that&#x27;s honestly how this piece comes across.<p>The author never says you have to do any of those things.  Just that if you want to argue constructively, then maybe being expressing a lot of hostility, irrationality, and subjectivity isn&#x27;t the best way to do it.')
