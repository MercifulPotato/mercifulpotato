I can&#x27;t find any information on the alleged &quot;emergency patch&quot; of GA voting systems either. Or an explanation of why several State&#x27;s judiciaries chimed in on changing election timeframes when constitutionally, that is the perview of the Legislature.<p>I&#x27;m still on the lack of evidence fence but I&#x27;m seriously leaning toward the side of &quot;Thou dost protest too much&quot; when the response isn&#x27;t the most gruelingly painful enumeration of every detail of the process to the rest of the country.<p>You can throw all your numerical arguments about why it shouldn&#x27;t matter at me that you want.
