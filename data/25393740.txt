The language of the protocol is very general: &quot;Whereas the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or any other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices, has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilized world...&quot;<p>It is probably this very general language that lead to the restriction of riot agents. Although they do not kill by poisoning or kill by asphyxiation, their method of operation certainly involves some combination of poisoning and asphyxiation.<p>The USA has tended to hold that riot agents are not what is technically called a method of warfare because they produce &quot;...merely transient effects...&quot;, and thus do not technically fall under the terms of the protocol, but has also long held that they are not authorized for general use, either. Per a field manual from 1956:<p><i>It is the position of the United States that the Geneva [Gas] Protocol of 1925 does not prohibit the use in war of … riot control agents, which are those agents of a type widely used by governments for law enforcement purposes because they produce, in all but the most unusual circumstances, merely transient effects that disappear within minutes after exposure to the agent has terminated. In this connection, however, the United States has unilaterally renounced, as a matter of national policy, certain uses in war of … riot control agents. The policy and provisions of Executive Order No. 11850 do not, however, prohibit or restrict the use of … riot control agents by US armed forces either (1) as retaliation in kind during armed conflict or (2) in situations when the United States is not engaged in armed conflict. Any use in armed conflict of … riot control agents, however, requires Presidential approval in advance.</i><p>In Vietnam, riot agents nevertheless saw very wide application.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihl-databases.icrc.org&#x2F;customary-ihl&#x2F;eng&#x2F;docs&#x2F;v2_rul_rule75" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihl-databases.icrc.org&#x2F;customary-ihl&#x2F;eng&#x2F;docs&#x2F;v2_rul...</a>')
