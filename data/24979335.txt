The workstation market mostly shifted to x86 + Windows NT.<p>What Linux + x86 did kill was the entry- and mid-range Unix server market. Redhat grew very rich largely by offering a cheaper platform (x86 + RHEL) to run Oracle RDBMS. And when the web started taking off, Linux + x86 was the default platform (still is). Similarly, the technical computing market (clusters, supercomputers, etc.) more or less completely migrated to x86 + Linux.<p>IBM sort of survived this carnage by retreating into the high end, and by having a lot of other business (consulting, mainframes, software, etc.) that they could leverage.<p>Sometimes I wonder if Sun could have survived if they had gone for the x86 commodity hardware route. They already had built the first generation (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sun386i" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sun386i</a> ) but instead decided to go all-in on SPARC and bespoke hardware.')
