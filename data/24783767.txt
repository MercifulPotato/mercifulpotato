Since these rules are followed in many fraternities, unions, and even the US legislative branch government.  It’s very likely that the phrase is being used “incorrectly” by people familiar with that style of meeting. \nTo be fair, it is to “call the question”, and I very likely misremember it as “beg” because it’s so common. \nTo “call the question” means to end debate and vote. In this regard, the meaning used “incorrectly” in logic terms, is very precise in a colloquial one. \nSo, if you feel bad about the grammar nazis breathing down your throat, say: “...which calls the question...” and you will be safe. \nAlternatively, though, you could reserve the phrase for the times that you genuinely see a logical fallacy. The only downside to this is that you’ll likely still be surrounded by people who don’t know, and probably don’t care, about the difference.')
