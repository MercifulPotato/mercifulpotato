Have you followed the skeumorphic -&gt; flat -&gt; 3d again or Gingerbread to Holo to Material Design guidelines?<p>Dev facing: How have your migrations to WKWebView, notarised builds, M1, the Mac App Store, away from kexts, etc. been? Did you get onboard for WinRT and UWP?<p>You could argue in the Windows case you didn&#x27;t _have_ to follow these trends, but you also didn&#x27;t have to on Linux. Pidgin still works much the same as it did a decade ago.  Thunderbird is still here and fundamentally the same as when I started using it as a literal child. You can still install MATE and XFCE and have pretty much the same workflow for desktop linux you had 20 years ago on Gnome 1, except with much much better chance of arbitrary hardware&#x2F;software X working.<p>In the Apple case, you have to follow their guidelines in a much sooner period.')
