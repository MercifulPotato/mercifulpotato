This includes for example libsystemd-daemon0, which is a tiny library that implements the stable notification protocol and is a no-op on systems not running systemd. You can reimplement it yourself in pretty much any language, but lots of programs just link against the systemd library because it&#x27;s easier and has no tangible downside, even for people not running systemd. Eliminating such dependencies isn&#x27;t particulary hard but takes a lot of work. Likewise, the rest of the world has left SysV init scripts behind, so they have to write those too.<p>The second reason is that systemd provides features for which there simply is no alternative. Desktop environments are entangled with logind, because it&#x27;s the only software providing that functionality. Before logind they had a hard dependency on ConsoleKit, which was pretty much abandoned. Reimplementing all these features takes time.')
