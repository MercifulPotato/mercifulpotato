The reality is that the Qt licensing costs are a bargain relative to time saved for enterprise customers. It&#x27;s not even a question at this point.<p>The complaints usually come from people thinking of lean startups or selling hobby projects, where the licensing overhead is another non-trivial number on your cost of goods sold. Many of the complaints here would only realistically be a problem for someone selling a very small number (&lt;100) of their product per year with very low margin, which is far more rare than people think.<p>Regardless, Qt still has a separate small business license with a different pricing structure: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.qt.io&#x2F;qt-for-small-business" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.qt.io&#x2F;qt-for-small-business</a>')
