I really don’t like any tweaking or UI window dressing which Samsung placed on top of android. A bunch of preloaded apps no one wants which can’t be uninstalled. They are still worth a look if you are only going to read PDFs or comics, watch Netflix. Stuff like that.<p>The problem with an Android tablet is that the google play store is a considerable downgrade from the iOS AppStore. I think that on a phone it’s less noticeable but on a tablet you begin to really miss out. No procreate, GarageBand, the Affinity apps, Photoshop is incoming, X-Com 2 just came out.. these are just a few big ones off the top of my head. Like if you play freemium arpg games then it won’t make a difference but like Divinity Original Sin 2 is coming out for iOS.<p>Not really looking to talk anyone out of buying an android tablet but the only two decent reasons to get one over an iPad would be piracy and avoiding an apple product just cause.<p>I own an iPad Pro 12.9. Love it.')
