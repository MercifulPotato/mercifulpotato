I kind of imagine an old pentium multimedia PC that a secretary boots once per quarter to update it. It&#x27;s much better than most holding companies&#x27; sites.<p>Anyway... I feel like this article answers its own question at the start...<p><i>&quot;many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services.&quot;</i><p>&quot;They&quot; eventually succeeded, by using the www as a platform 10 years later rather than outcompeting it in 1995. Frontpage, Dreamweaver and such are tools. The internet-era equivalents (youtube, FB, IG, etc.) aren&#x27;t tools. FB is a &quot;platform.&quot; More comparable to the WWW itself than to frontpage. You don&#x27;t need tools to post on FB, so no frontpage.<p>In the abstract, a FB-like platform does a similar job to a Frontpage-like tool. Publish stuff online. The FB-like platform is a 1000X better business proposition. A FB doesn&#x27;t have to charge. It can attract users with access to other users. No hosting&#x2F;files&#x2F;responsibility. Advertising is worth more than software licenses, etc.<p>So the real question is &quot;why did the www not succeed competitively against FB&#x2F;Youtube&#x2F;Etc?&quot; Why don&#x27;t we do what we do online via www and other open standards&#x2F;protocols instead of through platforms like FB?<p>OTOH, the WWW obviously did succeed. We all use it every day, but with a third party platform like FB between us and other people. I also think it&#x27;s remarkable that the www exists at all. No one owns it. It&#x27;s not property, doesn&#x27;t have a share price... Quite unusual.<p>Tim Berners Lee is highly regarded. Zuck is one of the most powerful and wealthy people on earth. He made many other people very wealthy. Tim too, but more indirectly. It&#x27;s remarkable that a Tim can <i>ever</i> beat a Zuck. ... But history proves they can.')
