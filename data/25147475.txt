And &quot;Breitbart are a disgusting organization whose aim is misinformation&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s not so much that the main stream media outlets lie about facts. They misrepresent them because they have a bias and a specific opinion on matters that it&#x27;s so obvious to anyone that isn&#x27;t on the left. Which is why people flock to other sources such as Breitbart, which at the very least, spins and interprets the events&#x2F;info with a right-leaning worldview.<p>The overarching problem is that journalism has become a forum of <i>opinion</i> rather than facts + helping readers understand complex topics by digesting it for them. And it&#x27;s no wonder we&#x27;re becoming polarized, because we pick the &quot;opinion&quot; we like, rather than being given the facts and going with it, regardless from which source we get it.')
