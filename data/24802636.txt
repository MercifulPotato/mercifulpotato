Item(by='dane-pgp', descendants=None, kids=[24803476, 24803005], score=None, time=1602867282, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24801478, text='&gt; the Cambridge Analytica story is unraveling<p>I assume you are referring to stories like this[0] where the UK&#x27;s Information Commissionerâ€™s Office (ICO) recently found that &quot;Cambridge Analytica models were exaggerated and ineffective&quot;.  Presumably you don&#x27;t think that there could be any bias in the ICO&#x27;s investigation, despite the UK government now being run by Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings, all senior members of the Vote Leave campaign group.<p>Regardless of any bias, there is the question of whether the ICO had the data it needed to judge CA&#x27;s models sufficiently.  We have a whistleblower claiming that Vote Leave &quot;attempted to destroy evidence&quot;[1] and photographic proof that &quot;Storage crates were removed from Cambridge Analytica&#x27;s London headquarters today (pictured) but it is not yet known who has ordered them to be taken away&quot;[2].  In fact, CA were given at least a week&#x27;s notice to prepare for the search warrant[3], a privilege not afforded to most criminal suspects.<p>You might think that there is nothing suspicious about all this, and that even a fair examination of CA&#x27;s practices would clear them of any influence over the outcome of the referendum (and you may also think that all online advertising is a waste of money, because it can&#x27;t influence people&#x27;s decisions and opinions), but please do not glibly state without a citation that the story about them is &quot;unravelling&quot;.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itpro.co.uk&#x2F;policy-legislation&#x2F;data-protection&#x2F;357367&#x2F;cambridge-analytica-project-was-ineffective-ico-claims" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itpro.co.uk&#x2F;policy-legislation&#x2F;data-protection&#x2F;3...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018&#x2F;mar&#x2F;26&#x2F;the-cambridge-analytica-files-the-story-so-far" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018&#x2F;mar&#x2F;26&#x2F;the-cambridge-a...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymail.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;article-5521893&#x2F;Warrant-sought-search-Cambridge-Analytica-offices.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymail.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;article-5521893&#x2F;Warrant-sou...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eandt.theiet.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;information-commissioner-has-still-not-obtained-warrant-to-search-cambridge-analyticas-offices&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eandt.theiet.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;informatio...</a>')
