It&#x27;s just a way for elites to control commoners so that they behave in predictable ways.<p>Emotions are responses that help us learn and survive.<p>Anger is one such emotion. It helps us destroy enemies. But it can also make us short-sighted and do things that are not good in the long run, so when it happens, we need to take our time before we do something... but that&#x27;s a different discussion.<p>There is no &quot;morality&quot; on stealing or anything. What if the thing you&#x27;re stealing from me today was something I stole from you yesterday? Would it still be &quot;immoral&quot;? What if my great grandfather stole from your great grandfather many years ago and you steal it back today? What if the transactions aren&#x27;t that simple? What if the stealing happened in a much more complicated structure thoughout many generations in a network of billions of people?<p>Nothing belongs to nobody. People take whatever they can get away with. There are rules you have to make up and enforce if you&#x27;re in the business of benefiting from mass compliance. For everyone else, you follow those rules because otherwise the elites will come for you. There&#x27;s no reason to complicate this (except of course you are among the elites, in which case you have to, to make sure the masses are predictable).')
