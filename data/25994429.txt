Retiring for the sake of retiring does not make one automatically happy. Instead you should understand what makes you happier and optimize for it. As a result, FIRE does not mean &quot;don&#x27;t spend money&quot;, instead it is &quot;don&#x27;t spend money on stuff you don&#x27;t care about&quot;. Thus, I disagree with commenters framing FIRE as &quot;living in poverty to live in poverty without a job&quot;. One can be FIRE (or on track to) and still live a great life spending enough money to be happy.<p>That&#x27;s why I think your question is a bit backward. Instead of wanting to reach FIRE in 10 years, try to understand why you want it. FIRE is just a tool giving you ~40 additional hours per week. Why do you want this time? If one is unhappy with their life before FIRE, they will just have 40 more hours to be unhappy.')
