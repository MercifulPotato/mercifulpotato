Linux and possibly others usually refuse that without root approval, but I don&#x27;t know of any systems where it&#x27;s actually officially impossible. That said, it <i>is</i> rather difficult to exploit in practice, since being able to map memory at address zero is practically a vulnerablity in its own right, and you&#x27;d need to chain through that to get anywhere.')
