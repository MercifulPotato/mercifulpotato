We&#x27;re really just reaching for something that increases wages faster than raises.<p>And really it highlights the issue that not only is it hard to get fair profit-sharing, it&#x27;s also hard to get market-competitive raises.<p>But of course a company is going to say it&#x27;s hard to decide who gets how much, because they have an incentive to pay their employees as little as possible, regardless if it&#x27;s through base wages, raises, or profit sharing. There always seems to be an excuse.')
