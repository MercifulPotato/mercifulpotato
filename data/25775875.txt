But you really need to be an expert (or team of experts) to identify those situations, then architect and configure appropriately.  Where it bites people is the &quot;AWS by default&quot; mentality many folks have (after a decade or more of lots of positive press) without understanding what they&#x27;re using or why they&#x27;re using it.  Many people who make these decisions are shielded from the direct impact of any cost overruns too, to there is less reason to be sensitive to that.  Almost any time I&#x27;ve worked with orgs using AWS, any reference to cost is &quot;an engineer is more expensive!&quot;.  Which is sort of true, but there&#x27;s also typically no way a company could just accidentally hire 27x more people than they budgeted for in a single day, or that a rival company could force-hire those engineers in to your company without you knowing about it, sticking you with even just a day&#x27;s cost for 50 engineers, for example.')
