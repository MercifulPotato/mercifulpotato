Humans can cope with error rates around 5% (and even higher) when recognizing words because we can use context to deduce the intended meaning, or ask for clarification when the word doesn&#x27;t match the context. AI has some way to go until there.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say this is useless, quite the contrary. Being able to transcribe words in conversational language is hugely useful (for both nefarious and non-nefarious purposes). It&#x27;s just that it refers to understanding the words, not the sentences :).')
