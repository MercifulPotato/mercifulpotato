If your code isn&#x27;t on Github and there is nothing really specific I can search for I will not find your code. This might be more the fault of search engines, but still. Sometimes &#x27;gitlab&#x27; or even &#x27;sourceforge&#x27; will result in something useful if it really isn&#x27;t on Github.')
