It&#x27;s always been passed on, or I have received a new one. - Admittedly this is just my POV, and I fully understand people have their own experiences - but I would like to think that in some small part, I am helping with that sustainable process.<p>IKEA in this case, I am glad that they are at least trying to do something (again not saying other companies don&#x27;t but we are in a thread about IKEA&#x27;s recent work!) - and I would like to think that to round of the ring of sustainability that it isn&#x27;t just the companies that need to input, its the people that use it too.<p>Maybe I am being too idealistic, but I will do what I can in my small little bubble to be part of that sustainable process!<p>I realise I got this far and didn&#x27;t think about the point I was trying to make! - But yeah, from my perspective I don&#x27;t feel like IKEA design it to be disposable, but I am sure other people have other experiences too :)')
