The D1 Mini and the other microcontrollers I recommended all can be bought without headers soldered.<p>Headers pre-soldered is a big dealbreaker for me. I almost exclusively use JST-EH connectors for personal projects in place of headers. They are 2.5mm spaced so they fit in 0.1&quot; spaced pins, and are much more secure than headers and won&#x27;t easily get pulled out and jumbled up.')
