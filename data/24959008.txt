This is not really true since it contradicts Goedel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem. What the method of forcing uses, however, is a pair of theorems by Mostowski: the reflection and the collapse theorem that let one find a model of any finite(ly axiomatizable) portion of ZFC. Finite axiomatizations of set theory (say, GB) have similar tricks. His intuition is right on though.')
