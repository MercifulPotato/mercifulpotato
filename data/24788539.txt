Literally every printer was suffering from constant paper jams and other mechanical malfunctions.  In 2020 a top consumer or business printer will not jam on you.<p>The business printers in 2000 had slow processors and more ram.  It was significantly bad that printing PDFs spent more time processing the file than putting toner on page.<p>Finally, the interfacing for printers today is fantastic.  I know this isnâ€™t about toner on page, but having wifi connection, an LCD touchscreen interface, and them generally being a little smaller has made the experience better.<p>The only thing that was better about printing in 2000 is that back then printing was more useful because so many people wanted paper copies.')
