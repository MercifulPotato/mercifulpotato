In 1994, I was a high schooler volunteering at a famous west coast science museum (it was either that or work at Taco Bell, thanks dad), and one of my tasks was to make a searchable employee directory...<p>I don&#x27;t remember if there was any other option on the server we had, but I had to write that sucker in C!  Reading and parsing a .csv file, handling search options, working as a CGI program, what a pain, especially for a dumb high schooler like me!')
