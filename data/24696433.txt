It&#x27;s estimated that we have population of over 2.000 wolves, they need large territories so it&#x27;s natural to migrate outside the borders. Hopefully they will be protected everywhere at same level. I never heard here about threat to humans (we as a nation spend a lot time in forests for mushroom and berries picking, recreation, etc) beside rumours and fake news ignited by hunters - they want to end strict wolf protection to be able to hunt for them.<p>Wolves were always here in Poland, and now they are already on most polish territory, even near big cities. They are in forests just outside Warsaw, my friend is now hearing wolf pack 30km outside from Gdansk in northern Poland. Of course that farmers reports loses and this is some cost for the state, that is paying out for those.<p>But this is our european heritage and we need to make everything to preserve it. Nothing to be afraid of.')
