So it seems risky to lock-in to one version.<p>If there are better ideas or fundamentals on which to build the root of another space, then what the Gemini is protocol is saying is that -- make your own protocol and name it something different.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s risky to lock-in to <i>the</i> Gemini protocol because:  It&#x27;s very minimal, so A) clients should be minimal as well, and B) Gemini documents are human readable without a client.  So if Gemini doesn&#x27;t work out, your *.gmi files will hardly be useless blobs of tags.')
