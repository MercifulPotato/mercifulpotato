In the case of &#x27;pushing&#x27; air in, the average of something like 40deg F with 300deg F is 170deg F. Even if ambient is 70deg F, by replacing air with ambient, that&#x27;s a 2x better cooling, not to mention the energy saving from just using a fan compared with cooling with an air conditioner or some other equipment.')
