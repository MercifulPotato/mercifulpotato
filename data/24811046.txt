Mark Twain already suggested it:<p>&quot;A Plan for the Improvement of English Spelling: For example, in Year\n1 that useless letter &#x27;c&#x27; would be dropped to be replased either by\n&#x27;k&#x27; or &#x27;s&#x27;, and likewise &#x27;x&#x27; would no longer be part of the\nalphabet. The only kase in which &#x27;c&#x27; would be retained would be the\n&#x27;ch&#x27; formation, which will be dealt with later. Year 2 might reform\n&#x27;w&#x27; spelling, so that &#x27;which&#x27; and &#x27;one&#x27; would take the same konsonant,\nwile Year 3 might well abolish &#x27;y&#x27; replasing it with &#x27;i&#x27; and Iear 4\nmight fiks the &#x27;g&#x2F;j&#x27; anomali wonse and for all.
