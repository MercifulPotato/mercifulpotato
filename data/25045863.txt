Item(by='davrosthedalek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605016237, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25045724, text='Mainz-Kastel is a district of Wiesbaden, right across from Mainz. As the name implies, it used to be a part of Mainz, but after WWII, the Rhine was a convenient border between the French and US occupied regions, so it was made a part of Wiesbaden. Culturally, Mainz-Kastel is very much Mainz though, sharing for example the tradition of &quot;Fassenacht&quot;, Mainz Carnival. \nSo most people there feel like being Mainzer, and enjoy the beautiful view from across the river onto the Mainzer Schloss (Palace).')
