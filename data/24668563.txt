One disagreement though:<p>&gt;Actual implementations try to improve performance by rebuilding the hash table as more items are inserted, using a new hash function with larger K. This can keep the linked list sizes bounded by some constant, which means O(1) lookups but at the cost of rebuild operations which are at least O(N).<p>Even ignoring the rebuild operations, it&#x27;s still not O(1), because if you use a different (evenly distributing) hash function with larger key size, you necessarily need more computations to compute K, and so lookup time increases.')
