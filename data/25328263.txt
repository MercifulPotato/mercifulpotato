The owner of the network is serving under age kids.  Push too far and its white lists only and block all other IP and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll get deep packet inspection forced on us.  Some folks have serious problems with Google Images Search, but you can actually deal with that.<p>I would also say anyone hard coding DNS into a device is just absolutely unprofessional.  Its basically a red flag that any filtering the owner of the network doesn&#x27;t matter to them.')
