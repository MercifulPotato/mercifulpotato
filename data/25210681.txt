We&#x27;ve recently released the code:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MikeJaredS&#x2F;hermiter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MikeJaredS&#x2F;hermiter</a><p>I&#x27;ve done some comparisons versus the P^2 algorithm (using the OnlineStats implementation in Julia) and the Hermite series based algorithm appears to have comparable accuracy in the tests conducted. The Hermite based approach has the advantage that it estimates the full quantile function though, so arbitrary quantiles can be obtained at any point in time.')
