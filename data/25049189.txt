Folks routinely balk at typical mid-level comp of ~$500k even here on HN so it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that the knee-jerk reaction is that ~$4M is out of reach.<p>Frankly, the software industry has an incredibly low barrier to entry compared to other high paying fields (medicine, law). Sure, not everyone will reach some &quot;distinguished engineer&quot; level but you don&#x27;t really need to in order to live a life of abundance. Nowadays, if you grind enough leetcode you can land something to the tune of $250-300k (in Seattle&#x2F;Bay Area). Once you factor in stock appreciation and job hopping every 3 years, comp only goes up. I don&#x27;t make the rules; it is what it is.')
