They are mainly interested in comparing the Pfizer results for days 13-21 (89% efficacy) with real-world data. \nThey show that the real world data is actually showing only ~50% protection in days 13-21, compared to 89% in the Pfizer data for the same period. This is somewhat disheartening.<p>HOWEVER, the Maccabi paper is not measuring the same thing as the Pfizer study. The Pfizer study only looked at symptomatic infections (Covid19 symptoms + positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2), while the Maccabi paper is also including asymptomatic infections.<p>Neither study includes sufficient data to accurately compare with the other one - the Pfizer study did not do PCR tests on anyone who didn&#x27;t show symptoms, so we don&#x27;t know how many asymptomatic infections they had exra; and the Maccabi study didn&#x27;t record symptom information, so we don&#x27;t know what percentage of those infected were symptomatic.<p>All of these numbers and facts are explicitly mentioned in the Maccabi study, it&#x27;s not me reading into the data on my own.')
