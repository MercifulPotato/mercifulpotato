It does have some clear advantages, and I&#x27;ve repeatedly cited the rapid deployment of the hardware and connectivity in this very discussion, for example. It hasn&#x27;t come up much so far in the parts of the discussion I&#x27;ve been in, but I would never claim there is no-one with a good use for the more niche services among the hundreds available from the likes of AWS, either.<p>However, I mostly operate in the world of smaller businesses, and in this world simplicity is king when it comes to infrastructure. We are interested in deploying our software so people can run it, whether that&#x27;s for a client&#x27;s internal use or something that&#x27;s running online and publicly accessible. Setting up a new server <i>is</i> mostly a case of installing the required OS and hosting tools, and then our software will take over (and that work would be essentially the same wherever it is hosted), once you have the hardware itself installed and connected. Configuring a new office network <i>is</i> something you&#x27;d probably do in a day, again once the physical aspects have been completed. You slightly mangled the timescales I actually suggested in your quote, BTW.<p>These systems are often maintained by a small number of team members who have the relevant knowledge as a sideline to their day jobs. And this approach has been working for decades, and continues to work fine today. Perhaps I have just never met the bogeyman where the operational requirements to maintain the IT infrastructure for a small business (say up to 50 people) are somehow unmanageable by normal people with readily available skills in a reasonable amount of time, so the arguments about somehow radically improving efficiency by outsourcing those aspects to cloud services have never resonated much with me. It&#x27;s a big world, and of course YMMV.')
