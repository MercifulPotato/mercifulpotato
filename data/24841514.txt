Leaving aside the whole argument about whether or not we should really be calling software developers engineers, a lot of these same people are advertising themselves as full-stack. I&#x27;m sorry, but you going through a 10-week bootcamp or even getting a 4 year CS degree does not make you full-stack.<p>It&#x27;s comparable to how we laugh at recruiters when they ask for 5 years in a given language that has only been around for 2 years. You clearly don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>I always tell the folks I mentor through bootcamps they should figure out which area they like best, focus most of their efforts in that area, and then advertise themselves as a front-end developer or back-end developer or whatever, not full-stack. The upside down T approach. Show recruiters and hiring managers you at least know enough to know what you don&#x27;t know.<p>And stop complaining on LinkedIn about how unfair it is that you don&#x27;t have a million job opportunities pouring in or about all the applications you submitted and didn&#x27;t hear back from - yes it&#x27;s annoying, but if you advertise yourself as something you&#x27;re not, you&#x27;ve likely already wasted someone else&#x27;s time, so understand they probably don&#x27;t want to waste anymore giving you an explanation for why you were passed over.')
