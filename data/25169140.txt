I got the screens of 2 MBPs who suffered from staingate replaced, for free, under the recall program (which, due to consumer law protections, lasts longer than 2 years <i>for consumers</i> (not businesses)). One barely suffered from it; they replaced it anyway. One of these MBPs I even bought 2nd hand. I wrote this message on it.')
