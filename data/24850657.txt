If you check what you were booted with (&#x2F;proc&#x2F;cmdline), it probably includes something like `init=&#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;systemd`.<p>Docker requires you to set a single entrypoint not because it&#x27;s &quot;baked in&quot;, but because that&#x27;s the way linux works: when you create a new namespace, you run a single program as its pid1, just like when you boot linux, a single program is pid1.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to set pid1 of a docker container to runit or various other process runners to run multiple processes.<p>Arguing otherwise is no different than arguing that linux only supports running one process because if you set &quot;init=&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash&quot; at the cmdline, it gets ugly real fast to run a multi-process system off it.')
