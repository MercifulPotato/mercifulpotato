I.e. they aren&#x27;t handling traffic for 3rd parties on their backbone (well, in this case, they do offer that though), just traffic between the mutual peering entities. As a result you&#x27;re never sending them something they didn&#x27;t already have to pay to get.<p>Also it&#x27;s not as simple as distance. A lot of data between 2 world class datacenters is pretty easy and cheap, the fiber is already there. A lot of data to the rest of the world is a PITA and a physical&#x2F;logistical nightmare.')
