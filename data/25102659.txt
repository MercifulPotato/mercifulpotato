On the internet, <i>everything</i> is a story, and if the story is about someone like you, obviously they can&#x27;t be a villain either.<p>+ Exposure to information that conflicts with (even weakly held) beliefs tied to a person&#x27;s identity often triggers defensive rejection of the new information and <i>strengthens</i> those beliefs.<p>+ Group dynamics are in play for public interactions, so there is always a performative aspect even for ostensibly 1-to-1 communications. This often doesn&#x27;t get turned off for private electronic channels such as email.<p>And so on. A lot of these mental quirks are like ratchets that only ever tighten. Although each in isolation is often self limiting, the limiter can be bypassed by some other quirk, after which the ratchet can tighten some more.')
