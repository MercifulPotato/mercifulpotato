C is fundamentally outdated as a language and rely on assumptions and restrictions from the 70s.<p>Unfortunately each time someone wants to replace C, they stuff the remplacements with the unnecessary evolved constructs I talked about.<p>A language shouldn&#x27;t need to be &quot;written properly&quot;. Manual memory management doesn&#x27;t have to be hard at first place, it is made hard by C weakly typed nature and horrid syntax.')
