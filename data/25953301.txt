In the end, I suspect that sophisticated scoring system would still need to draw lines that some will disagree with, and we&#x27;d be back where we are now.<p>Sophisticated scoring might also bring common critiques, like ratings being biased or opaque (or just confusing). I recall Netflix had a issue when they made their star rating a prediction of what you would rate it (based on your previous viewing habits).  It confused a lot of people who thought it was simply the average star rating.  They since switched to percent-match as a result, and dropped star-reviews in favor of thumbs-up&#x2F;thumbs-down.<p>Come to think of it, your suggestion may lead to something like percent-match for apps...though I suspect rating apps along dimensions the way Netflix does TV&#x2F;movies may be tricky.  Maybe different dimensions for different categories in the app store?<p>I&#x27;m still intrigued by a distributed approach that filters opinion through the sieve of the social network...I think it has more promise than centralized rating systems that attract abuse.')
