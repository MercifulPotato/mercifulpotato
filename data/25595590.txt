I would say around 10% of them use python, with the vast majority choosing pypy over cpython.<p>I would guesstimate at least 100k lines of pypy is written per week just from these contests. This covers virtually every textbook algorithm you can think of and were automatically graded for correctness&#x2F;speed&#x2F;memory. Note that there&#x27;s no special time multiplier for choosing a slower language, so if you&#x27;re not within 2x the speed of the equivalent C++, your solution won&#x27;t pass! (hence the popularity of pypy over cpython)<p>The sheer volume of advanced algorithms executed in pypy gives me huge amount of confidence in it. There was only one instance where I remember a contestant running into a bug with the jit, but it was fixed within a few days after being reported: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeforces.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;entry&#x2F;82329?#comment-693711" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeforces.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;entry&#x2F;82329?#comment-693711</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foss.heptapod.net&#x2F;pypy&#x2F;pypy&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3297" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foss.heptapod.net&#x2F;pypy&#x2F;pypy&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3297</a>.')
