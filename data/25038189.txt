Item(by='dahart', descendants=None, kids=[25038516], score=None, time=1604947880, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25037324, text='&gt; I&#x27;m not really talking about the software as it exists at any given moment. The right to make a copy and use it is explicitly granted by the license. I&#x27;m focused strictly on change requests.<p>That&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s just messy to speak in ethical absolutes about unpaid labor if it only applies to change requests and not the software itself. It&#x27;s also messy to focus on the economic value of change requests and ignore the economic value of the software itself. It&#x27;s messy to be perfectly comfortable with the open source license, but later expect that any communication with the author about the software should not fall under the terms of the license the author chose.<p>I&#x27;m wildly in favor of companies paying for their change requests, and wildly in favor of open source authors being paid for their work! I just don&#x27;t quite agree with the framing of ethical absolutes you&#x27;re proposing.<p>By and large, the majority of people using open source aren&#x27;t making any change requests, and the majority of the people that do ask for changes are not demanding free work, they&#x27;re reporting bugs, making suggestions, letting the authors know what would be more useful to them, but not expecting that it will happen. There is a minority of people (often newcomers) to OSS projects that expect responses and help, and they may be in the wrong, but the authors are under no obligation to attend to them, and often say so. All that said, many companies are already supporting OSS financially.<p>Why should we limit paying for OSS to change requests anyway? I&#x27;d love to see authors being paid for software that&#x27;s used in commercial deployments. I&#x27;d love to see the authors compensated for their software&#x27;s value. But we cannot ignore the fact that by choosing to release it openly, they are choosing to forego the requirement that they be paid. For some people, that&#x27;s acceptable even if others ask for support.<p>&gt; Assuming the painting cost nothing to copy but costs alot to change, then I agree.<p>Yes that is what I mean, and what you meant before that too, because that reflects the reality of open source software. This is why the art shop theft analogy wasn&#x27;t great in the first place.')
