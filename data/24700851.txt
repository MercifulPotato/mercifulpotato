In the classic HN example, isn&#x27;t Dropbox just an inferior Rsync?<p>Eg, if someone wants to clone something and it manages to succeed, they clearly got _something_ right. Either a captive audience, a better UX, a better pricing structure, etc. There&#x27;s almost always room for ~innovation~ competition, so why poke fun at it?<p>I suppose if you think it&#x27;s truly inferior in every way compared to Caprover your tone might make sense - but even then, i&#x27;ve never heard of Caprover, if i was a customer looking for this product <i>(and i may be)</i> i&#x27;d probably have defaulted to DigitalOcean for this. If that alone ends up being profitable for them - a Caprover clone with a well known name - why <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> they do it?<p>I see these types of &quot;HN Dropbox&quot; comments on HN so frequently and i just don&#x27;t get it. There&#x27;s lots of angles to product viability, and these comments seem to be purposefully ignorant. Not saying you are ignorant, just that the comments seem to <i>try</i> to ignore any logical reason for competition.')
