No, we did not mine for our own minerals. What is your point? If our company was unable to secure hardware it would have ceased to exist. A shame for the company, its employees, and clients, but that&#x27;s business.<p>&gt; The analogy is: if she didn&#x27;t like being denied because of her race, she should have started her own busline.<p>Right. The above is <i>not</i> summarizing the reason why our society has a problem with the events that occurred. The problem is <i>why</i> Rose Parks was denied service.
