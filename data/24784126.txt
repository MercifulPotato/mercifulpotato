However:<p><pre><code>  An antitrust question to Mr. Pichai was seen as inappropriate,\n  raising questions about the candidateâ€™s judgment.\n</code></pre>\nNot being able to ask material questions about the very environment they&#x27;re being asked to perform in, is frankly bizarre.<p>Hopefully the candidate chose a better place.')
