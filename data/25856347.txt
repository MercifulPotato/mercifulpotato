It&#x27;s so fast it can execute an infinite loop in about two minutes.&quot;<p>A coworker and I went out for lunch. Not realizing that I had already read the joke, he asked me, &quot;So, have you heard about the new Cray 3?&quot; I replied &quot;Why no, how long does it take it to execute an infinite loop?&quot;<p>Back at the office, he described this to our colleagues. Trying to recreate the event, he said to me, &quot;So, have you heard about the new Cray 3?&quot; In front of everyone else, I just said, &quot;Why no.&quot;<p>&quot;I hate you&quot;, he said.')
