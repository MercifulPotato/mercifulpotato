Projectile when inside a git repo also has a lot of good stuff for navigation, see projective-find-file and other fn from the package.<p>I will leave this here for the small set of people that use both emacs and windows. The &#x27;everything&#x27; extension for emacs is really great, instant HD(s) wide file&#x2F;folder search. If you don&#x27;t have Everything.exe installed on your windows machine i&#x27;d urge you to go try it. (with or without emacs)\nAs far as emacs integration this is what I use for it. The 2nd function requires the projectile and perspective extensions, it opens a new virtual-desktop-thing inside emacs.<p><pre><code>  (if (eq system-type &#x27;windows-nt)\n    (use-package everything\n      :config\n      (setq everything-cmd &quot;C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Everything\\\\es.exe&quot;)\n      (setq everything-ffap-integration nil)))\n\n  (defun open-file-from-anywhere ()\n  (interactive)\n  (everything))\n\n  (defun open-file-from-anywhere-in-new-persp-if-in-project ()\n  (interactive)\n  (let* ((fpath (everything-find-prompt))\n         (f-projectile-root (projectile-project-root fpath))\n         (project-name (projectile-project-name f-projectile-root)))\n    (if f-projectile-root\n        (progn\n          (persp-switch project-name)\n          (find-file fpath))\n      (progn\n        (message &quot;File is not in a valid project directory&quot;)\n        (find-file fpath)))))</code></pre>')
