It&#x27;s a combination of so many things, but I have somewhat crested the hill and feel comfortable in public spaces again. It&#x27;s obviously not over yet, we&#x27;re not inoculated and it could get re-introduced. But I can be pretty confident with the situation right now.<p>The biggest issue is just the factor of the unknown. It was never clear what&#x27;s right, what&#x27;s overreacting, what&#x27;s underreacting, am I doing too much am I doing too little? Someone sniffs down the hall and your imagination goes wild...<p>But we know so much more about it, and what protections are in place, that a lot of that anxiety of the unknown is gone. I have personally learned about myself, what my comfortable levels of risk are, and I have seen how my country responds to outbreaks and it has filled me with great confidence.<p>To everyone still amidst the pandemic, know that you&#x27;re carrying some extra cognitive load even if you&#x27;re being totally reasonable about everything. So don&#x27;t feel bad if you&#x27;re feeling worn out, and I hope we&#x27;ll all be on the end of it soon enough.')
