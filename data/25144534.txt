If I start linking companies that don&#x27;t do affiliate stuff, they charge a lot less.<p>I listed like for like companies.<p>&gt; In 2013 it was 10 billion.<p>&gt; People made apps in 2013, even though 70% of 10 billion is less than 10% of 80 billion.<p>&gt; They&#x27;d make apps for 10% of 80 billion and they&#x27;d definitely make apps for 25% of 80 billion.<p>I don&#x27;t think you understand how percentages work. You are comparing the total amount of revenue available to the revenue share per purchase. That just isn&#x27;t a valid way of comparing the two.<p>&gt; Everyone standing up and refusing those billions of dollars in solidarity is more outlandish than anything I&#x27;ve said.<p>If they raised the rate soo high that it was unreasonable then yes the would be a mass exodus.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s much easier for a fee to be &quot;worth it&quot; than to be &quot;reasonable&quot;.<p>Now you are just playing semantics. I think we will leave this here.')
