We knew that we had to make useful ads if we wanted people not to block us.  We knew we had to make them unobtrusive and even enjoyable.<p><i>We knew that we had to build an ad product people enjoyed if we wanted them to be effective and not get blocked.</i><p>And we knew some people would block them anyway, and that was fine.  Heck, we even added an option to turn them off if you paid us, so that people had options.<p>I used to not run adblock as a way of supporting sites I liked, but then all the ads got so bad I just couldn&#x27;t do it anymore.  Now I just find other ways to pay for the sites I love.')
