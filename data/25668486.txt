This minikeyvalue is a nice simplification for George&#x27;s own use case.<p>SeaweedFS has filePath -&gt; fileIds -&gt; locateVolumeServers -&gt; lookupOnVolumeServerByFileIds. These levels of indrection give the system more control of the data management and placement. For example, one file can be mapped to multiple file ids.<p>minikeyvalue has key -&gt; locateVolumeServer(by nginx) -&gt; lookupOnVolumeServerByKey. This removed the file id indirection level. This means the data is placed on statically organized volume servers. And the whole value needs to be on one volume server. So the value can not be too large. Obviously this large value is not a requirement.<p>There are no need to over-engineer anything. If this is what is needed, no need to add more levels of indirection.<p>And no need of being critical about this project. It is efficient and it works. It is a piece of code that the author can easily fix if any problem happens. The code and the language are just tools to get the job done. His goal is autonomous driving, not a general-purpose key value store.')
