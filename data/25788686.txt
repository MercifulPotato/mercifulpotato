Then got exposed to x86 which I hated with a passion.<p>Keep in mind I was quite young then and x86 had so  many oddities and inconsistencies that it made it really hard for a beginner.<p>In Uni when making a compiler I choose to target PPC as I figured anything was better than x86.<p>I kind of regretted it. I was new to RISC and the heavy use of registers threw me off. E.g. using registers for all function arguments except when there where too many. Using a register for return address but then needing to use stack anyway of call stack got too deep. How every address had to be loaded in two steps.<p>On top of that PPC did not offer a smaller and simpler instruction set. It was quite large from what I remember.<p>So getting something akin to feeling like 68k was a dream that got popped.<p>But I would say RISC-V gives me a bit of the 68k feeling as things are kept really small and beginner friendly.')
