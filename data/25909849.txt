Because that&#x27;s what a startup is, with no guarantee that it&#x27;s ever going to drop back down to merely 40 hours a week.<p>Anyway, if that&#x27;s what you want... the secret is to know your customer, which usually means knowing yourself. Find some domain that interests you, something you&#x27;re already doing, and say, &quot;Hey, I could automate that.&quot; It&#x27;s easiest to see that something is slightly uncomfortable when you&#x27;re the one being slightly uncomfortable.<p>You relieve that discomfort, and then you look for other people who are similarly uncomfortable. And convince them to pay for it, either in money or in attention. &quot;Free with ads&quot; is very low friction and helps you find those people.<p>This is the reason I encourage programmers to have interests outside of programming. Nobody wants to pay you to program. They want to pay you to make their lives better. That&#x27;s easiest if you know their lives. Any outside interest -- ballet dancing, glassblowing, small engine repair -- puts you in touch with other people who might have needs that can only be recognized by other practitioners.<p>That you don&#x27;t have any interests -- honestly, that sounds like a question for a therapist, not HN. You&#x27;re doing something with those 8 hours you&#x27;re spending neither working nor sleeping. If they&#x27;re spent staring at a wall, or even a TV or a monitor, it might be worth taking a look at just what it is you want out of life.')
