Sub6 5G has similar propagation to LTE. Sub6 has way less capacity than mmWave though.<p>I guess in the future operators will use both frequency ranges in parallel in a macro&#x2F;micro cell format. If you happen to be within the range of a mmWave micro base station you will use it. If not the sub6 macro base station will make sure you remain connected with “good enough” speed.')
