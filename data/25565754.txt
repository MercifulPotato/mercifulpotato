I wouldn&#x27;t recommend every one of them (some have wacky interfaces, slow compile times, and&#x2F;or experimental designs), but many of them are excellent, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very difficult to tell them apart.<p>Regardless, I find your insinuation that Boost users are &quot;stupid&quot; to be extraordinarily uncharitable to library users and developers.')
