The unfortunate truth is (I&#x27;m sure you know) that it will take you a very large investment of time to achieve this (several 10s of thousands of dollars at least in opportunity costs etc, but how does one measure time not spent with a partner&#x2F;child&#x2F; etc?) And the payoffs are uncertain -- people who know beautiful deep math, again unfortunately, are mostly working in academia. So that&#x27;s payoff both in the salary sense, and in the &quot;what can I practically do with this&quot; sense. But, humanity needs its pioneers, including mathematical pioneers!')
