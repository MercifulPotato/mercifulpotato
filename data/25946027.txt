Apologies in advance: This stuff is much too personal to post under my real identity.<p>Exactly this, in my experience.  I am from a upper-middle-class family.  I live in East Asia now, and wealthy by local standards.  Whenever I travel to developing countries in Asia, I am regularly reminded of my upper-middle-class-plus-plus status by the straightness and whiteness of my teeth!  Yes, literally, I can count on many, many hands how many times random strangers approach me on the street&#x2F;bus&#x2F;train&#x2F;hotel&#x2F;airport in developing countries with comments about my straight and&#x2F;or white teeth.  (Please: Do not read humble-brag into that.)<p>Could we, perhaps, say that accent is a big social divide in UK, whereas teeth are a big social divide in US?  I would love to hear from Canadians, Kiwis, Aussies, Saffers, etc...(anyone!) about experiences in their home culture.')
