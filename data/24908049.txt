Police departments, by contrast, have no liability if they get it wrong. Officers themselves are disproportionately male and have traditional&#x2F;regressive upbringings (as demonstrated by the high prevalence of domestic abuse against officer spouses).<p>Then too, we must consider the rights of the accused. Simply being arrested can be a huge life-altering event. Being docked pay or fired is more proportional to the size of the infraction. And society needs a gradient of responses: not every offense should consumer the resources of the police and the courts... that simply doesn&#x27;t scale, and it&#x27;s not a humane solution.')
