Is there really no way to do something simple like xfer money or view balance without using your phone? If so, why did you even open an account, I&#x27;m assuming that since you are on this site you are at least a little bit technically inclined.<p>Just looked, and apparently Revolut is 1) app only 2) tied to a mobile number. So not only is it annoying to use, but likely also susceptible to sim jacking. Again, why would anyone want to use this; I hate having to deal with wells fargo (they bought a loan I have) but even they seem less crappy. Not trying to hate on OP, I&#x27;m just shocked at how crap their service appears to be.')
