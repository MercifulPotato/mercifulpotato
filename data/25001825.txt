Jones, a computer scientist at the University of Iowa and co-author of the book Broken Ballots<p><i>A fundamental flaw of direct-recording voting machines—that is, ones where you pull the lever on an old mechanical machine or you touch the touch screen on a modern one—all of those machines end up being completely impossible to audit. There’s no way to know whether the machine was honest or not, short of taking it apart and actually being able to inspect the mechanism. We have no good way of doing that with software. The complete lack of any auditable record of the count, so that you had to completely trust programmers, was a real problem. [But] the vast majority of votes in the U.S. today are being recorded on paper ballots that are filled in by hand. That makes me feel reasonably good. And furthermore, a growing number of states have some kind of an audit law.</i><p>Broken Ballots book website: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;timbergroves.com&#x2F;bb&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;timbergroves.com&#x2F;bb&#x2F;</a><p>Douglas W.
