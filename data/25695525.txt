They are not under Trump at all. The Park Police, the FBI, Homeland Security cops, and the military all ultimately report to the President. The District of Columbia has a strange arrangement with its own elected officials and police, but not as much independence as a US state.<p>This matters during a coup attempt. Note that when the Capitol Police did get backup, it was from the DC police and the Virginia State Troopers.  Neither was under Trump&#x27;s control.')
