If things continue down this road, my feeling is that Bitcoin and perhaps a few other crypto currencies will end up with some sort of gold-like role in the investment landscape.<p>Note however that I&#x27;m referring to bullion, not rare coins that are collected for their own sake and that can fetch prices that far exceed those of their gold content.')
