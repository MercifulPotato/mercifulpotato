Until the 1990s, most Americans, indeed most Westerners outside of (maybe) Holland and Sweden would have been considered &quot;authoritarian&quot; by those lights. Do you believe Westerners were &quot;authoritarian&quot; for all of human history until ... say, 1997 or whatever? I was alive back then: it was very obviously less authoritarian on almost every level. And mind you, I score fairly &quot;non authoritarian&quot; (aka not so conservative) on this test.<p>Anyway, I appreciate your constructive engagement, but I am extremely allergic to bullshit which dehumanizes normal people. I mean, we decided as a society that dehumanizing gay people and feminists was bad: the reality is people who are don&#x27;t think the last 10 years of modernity is an amazing success are not particularly authoritarian, but dehumanizing them absolutely is.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;authoritarian" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;authoritarian</a>')
