Item(by='unishark', descendants=None, kids=[24893741], score=None, time=1603698328, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24893060, text='&gt;  But it&#x27;s strange that its lead example is the Times&#x27; expos√© of Trump&#x27;s taxes, which even it admits is &quot;real information&quot; that suggests &quot;potentially real&quot; tax fraud (plus Trump not being as wealthy as claimed, what a surprise). Should it not be news that the Times found what Trump had been going out of his way to conceal for four years?<p>It&#x27;s hard to follow but his complaint here seems to be kind of a wonkish insider lament about the media reaction he expects to follow the NYT story, not the story itself. And in particular that his own article years earlier in Rolling Stone already told the same basic story about Trump as con man but I guess won&#x27;t get any credit.<p>As for the list of bombshells, there a link to another story which steps through many references to news stories in turn, in a narrative style, not an enumerated list.')
