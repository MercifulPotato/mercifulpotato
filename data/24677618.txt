I rarely work out of my home office these days, so after reading up on people&#x27;s negative experiences with the new MacBooks, I&#x27;ve settled on a Mac Mini.<p>Half a year later, and it&#x27;s... okay. It gets the job done. But then so does my old trusty Asus UX32LN (i7-4500, 8 GB RAM), running Ubuntu with all the hardware working out of the box. I&#x27;ve had more hardware glitches with the Mini so far than I&#x27;d had with the UX32LN.<p>Software-wise, I don&#x27;t feel much difference. I pretty much live in Emacs and the browser, and both work everywhere. I like the polished feel of macOS (although I&#x27;ve had a brief encountered with it in the Snow Leopard days and it felt _more_ polished back then), but I do miss the customizability of Linux (the macOS maximize&#x2F;fullscreen experience is subpar).')
