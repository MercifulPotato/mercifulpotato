Item(by='ravenstine', descendants=None, kids=[25786780, 25784533, 25784955], score=None, time=1610664227, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25778185, text='For the past few years I&#x27;ve called Pasadena(I live in the general area) the &quot;land of helicopters&quot;, but I didn&#x27;t know that LA in general was seeing something similar recently.  People keep telling me that Pasadena&#x2F;SGV must be a good place to train helicopter pilots, but I don&#x27;t buy it.<p>It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve bothered to actually look at these helicopters, but a lot of them are pretty nondescript.  Not obvious news or police helicopters.  Multiple times a month I hear them circle around at night, but I never see anything in the news about an incident or a fugitive.  When I ask on Nextdoor I never get replies despite it being loud enough to keep me up.<p>Then again, I just realized that &quot;Helicopter Hell&quot; is more alliterative.  I think I&#x27;ll call it that from now on.')
