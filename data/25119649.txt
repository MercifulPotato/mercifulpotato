Which means dissenting opinions or alternative explanations other than climate change for various phenomenon are more quickly dismissed and shut down.<p>For example, say a massive forest fire happens. We see people try very hard to attribute the root cause to climate change, even if the true cause is decades of fire suppression. Repeat for literally anything that could plausibly be explained by climate change.<p>Similarly, there is a very strong narrative&#x2F;bias surrounding covid. Any data or study going against the narrative has to fight 10x as hard for survival vs. a study confirming the narrative.<p>This is not unique to science polarized across political parties. A similar thing happened (is still happening?) with Alzheimer&#x27;s research. Basically research dissenting from the prevailing theory were systematically denied funding and shut down by the most influential figures in the field.[0]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21911225" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21911225</a>')
