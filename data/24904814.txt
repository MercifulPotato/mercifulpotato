Often TERFs – Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists have spoken about the term ‘menstruators’ being erasure of femininity. But, femininity is not biological, so why should it be centred around this. Also, this does not in any way complicate ‘periods’ or ‘feminism’ but instead nuance it. This has been a common critique for the inclusion of any intersectionality in feminism, but intersectionality makes feminism more comprehensive. Another thing to notice is the constant discourse around the ‘body’. It says, transmasculine people still have ‘female bodies’, but using such terminology delegitimises trans people by reducing them to their anatomy. This implicit construction of gender through biological sex leads to violence against trans people, discrimination in availing health care and complete erasure of non-binary folks.[..]<p>Why can’t transgender people call themselves transgender? If anything we must work towards erasing the taboo around transgender.')
