The build is invalidated and has to be re-run if either the branch or upstream is changed.<p>Now, caveats etc, this was a collection of single applications in a big microservices architecture, and as the project grows it becomes more and more difficult to manage something like this, especially if you get more pull requests in the time it takes to do a build. But it is the way to go, I think.<p>Anyway, since tests and CI are not definitive, you also need a gradual rollout - 1%, 5%, etc - AND you need a similar process for any infrastructure change, which gets more and more tricky as you go down to the hardware level.')
