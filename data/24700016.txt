Understand that &quot;the best way&quot; for the team or business is not necessarily the same as &quot;the best way&quot; for you personally or &quot;the best way&quot; overall. You are likely missing some context about the choice. Be mindful of reputation risks, time costs and maintenance costs involved in changing the approach.<p>When you&#x27;re asked to code something you don&#x27;t agree with (including ethical issues) your options include: silently accept their approach, refuse to do their approach, propose an approach (with conversation or code) and gracefully accept the result, or find another job. Be aware that different organizations will react differently to those approaches. Under no circumstances should you fall into the trap of spending a week to convince the team to adopt a change that would save a week of costs.')
