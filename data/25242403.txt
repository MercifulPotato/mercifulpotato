Sure there have been a lot of different kinds of pressfit shell, but I would avoid them all except BB86&#x2F;92 (Shimano).<p>Hub spacing in QR is standard at 100&#x2F;130 for road, 100&#x2F;135 for mountain.  Thru-axle is somewhat new and I think we&#x27;ll standardize on fewer than that eventually.  I think some of those are a lot more popular than the others.')
