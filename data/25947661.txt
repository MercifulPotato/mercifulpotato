Item(by='btinker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611862306, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25944935, text='&gt; There are a lot of projects (sudo being the most recent example) supported by a team of developers in the single digits (or just one) that are relied upon by projects raking in millions if not billions in annual revenue.<p>But the whole reason they are relied upon is them coming for free. If sudo users where expected to give something back it wouldn&#x27;t have landed on millions of machines in the first place.<p>FOSS coming for free means, of course, maintenance being dependent on the authors&#x27; whims. Not paying means not being owed anything.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s not sustainable. FOSS is a gift from the developers to the world. It&#x27;s not a business model or a way to make a living (at best it&#x27;s part of a strategy to make a living).<p>It would be great if we all could gift something back be that help with maintaining or money.<p>But we should be careful not to demand support. Everyone &quot;whising up&quot; and only relying on software they either maintain themselves or paid someone to maintain might look different than we imagine. Might just be people buying proprietary software rather than funding open source development.')
