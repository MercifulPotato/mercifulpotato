Not as long as you want to have a social life because you&#x27;ll basically end up forcing everyone around you to jump through hoops to meet up.<p>With a phone, the exact place and even the exact time can be let to the last minute. People say &quot;lets met at noon at union square&quot; and then one person is 10 minutes late and they can confidently message people &quot;I&#x27;m late, be there in 10 mins&quot; vs  no phone = friends have to just wait 10,15,20,30 mins and hope they show up and then given up. Similarly, where they are, in front of Macy&#x27;s, at the coffee shop, over the the Apple store. All of that is, in 2020, decided at the moment and lets people enjoy their time while they wait for everyone to arrive. Without a phone you have to plan in advance some exact spot because there is no other way to coordinate.<p>People will downvote this saying we used to do it before cell phones and that real friends would put up with it but it&#x27;s 2020 and the normal etiquette has changed.  If 8 people met up and 1 doesn&#x27;t have a phone it&#x27;s that one that&#x27;s making the other 7 jump through hoops. Everyone has to wait until they show up, no one can change any plans.<p>I suppose you could give up a smartphone or a feature phone and then the phone itself will not be a distraction but you&#x27;ll still have the issue that most people coordinate via texting apps like Whatsapp or FB Messenger')
