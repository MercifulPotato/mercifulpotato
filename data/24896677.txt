I tried to read it early on in my mathematics studies and couldn&#x27;t understand it. Until you&#x27;ve done a number of proofs and start to see commonalities between them (e.g. proof by contradiction, induction, etc.) you don&#x27;t have the mental scaffolding to learn more systematic approaches to proofs. I realize the book attempts to teach these techniques, but in my opinion it is hard to motivate these until someone has actually needed to use them to solve problems they&#x27;re interested in.')
