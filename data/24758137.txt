Apparently you are aware that you shouldn&#x27;t do certain things, but you don&#x27;t have the discipline to not do them.<p>This is going to sound harsh, but discipline is part of being an adult just as much as common sense is. If it is really true (I&#x27;m not sure it is, but let&#x27;s assume it is here for the sake of argument) that most people in the US are more like you than like me, unable to exercise the required discipline in a situation like this, then that is a very, very bad thing for the US, because you can&#x27;t have a free society if its citizens lack the discipline to do what they know is the right thing to do. And that puts all of us at the mercy of whatever the idiots in positions of power want to do to us in the name of &quot;protecting our safety&quot;. I don&#x27;t want to live in that kind of country. Do you? Think carefully.')
