Currently halfway Gullivers Travels, and re-ead and re-discovered some great classics through your project.<p>What are the plans for other languages, if any?<p>I noticed that you have e.g. German or French originals translated to English. Is there place in the project for the original languages?<p>And what about translations to other languages? If I&#x27;m going to read a translation of Les trois mousquetaires, I&#x27;d prefer a translation to my native language instead of English.<p>Edit: saw the thread about this down below too late; was on mobile.
