An Iranian remark about unsafe vaccines was pulled (so not true)<p>2. If you don&#x27;t use racial slurs, call for hate or violence, there is no problem for anybody.<p>3.

This is companies denying &#x27;you&#x27; access to a megaphone if you use it to call for violence, hate and use racial slurs.<p>The idea of &#x27;heavy censorship&#x27; is ludicrous to me.
