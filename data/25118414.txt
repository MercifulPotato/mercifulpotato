HN loves them, because hey, there are interesting technical questions about their deployment, but they accomplish nearly nothing.<p>The real issue is that even when police impropriety is discovered, with mountains of evidence to support it, oversight bodies have no ability to censure the officers involved.<p>In Seattle, for example, the civilian oversight office offers non-binding disciplinary suggestions to the only body that can discipline police officers - their union. Unsurprisingly, the union takes those non-binding suggestions, and puts them right into the paper shredder. On the county level, until quite recently, the oversight organization couldn&#x27;t even subpoena records from the sheriff&#x27;s department - it would <i>ask</i> the department to turn over records, and the department would kindly tell them to go pound sand.<p>The only other form of oversight is raising a criminal case against the officer involved. Because of the discretionary nature of prosecution in this country, and because of a huge conflict of interest, where 99% of the time, prosecutors work in tandem with the police, prosecutions are frequently sabotaged for political reasons. (See the Breonna Taylor indictment - where the prosecutor deliberately sabotaged the case he presented to the grand jury.)<p>And on top of that, the bar for a criminal conviction of a police officer is astronomically high.<p>No amount of body camera technology is going to fix either of those three problems.')
