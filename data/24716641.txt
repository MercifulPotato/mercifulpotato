Anecdote time: :-)<p>As a Swedish&#x2F;Finnish man (and a somewhat stereotypical nerd at that), I&#x27;m paler than probably 95% of the world population.<p>Although facial recognition features (in the sense of trained AI models) often work fine on me given a good quality underlying photo, what often fails instead are preprocessing steps or color correction, especially in real-time systems. This can be the camera itself or software handling the image later.<p>For example if I&#x27;m in a Google Hangout in a normally lit room and then I move into slight sunlight or a lamp, my face will overexpose into a blob that looks like a low quality photo of the sun. It renders white, like #ffffff proper white. It&#x27;s not actually overexposed at the hardware&#x2F;camera level, but the software &quot;corrects&quot; it that way.<p>This typically never happens to other people.')
