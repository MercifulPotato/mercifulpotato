But to the extent that people can deprive companies like Disney of revenue without breaking the law, I kind of feel like they should do so. Not just by avoiding their products, but by making it harder for them to make money in general. It would be good at this point for companies like Disney to fail and for the media ecosystem to become more diverse.<p>There are extremely negative effects that come from allowing one corporation to own so much culture. I&#x27;m not going to break the law, but I&#x27;m also not going to lose sleep over Disney the corporation losing profits, because I want Disney to lose money, and I want them to produce less content. I don&#x27;t want Disney to be the biggest media producer on the market, they&#x27;re crowding other people out and using their leverage to control things they shouldn&#x27;t be able to control.')
