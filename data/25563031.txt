(Anyone with a 5 year-old, or indeed any child, can no doubt rattle off a list of this stuff pretty effortlessly...)<p>&gt; it&#x27;s probably not a win<p>Sorry, but who are you to judge that?<p>I offered to take my daughter to see one set of grandparents a few weeks ago, involving international travel and - how can I put this? - a somewhat liberal interpretation of the rules.   The grandparents <i>bit my arm off</i>.   Their choice.   Yes, they had a fantastic time with their granddaughter for about 24h.<p>People die all the time, for all kinds of awful reasons.
