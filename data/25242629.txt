My desktop is using 32gb of DDR4 ram and laptop is on 16gb. When I did controlmylights.net I was using almost all of the 32gbs, maxing out the gpu &#x2F;cpu. I don&#x27;t normally run that heavy of a production on my system but it was nice to be able to do it (2x resource heavy OBS stream setups (Twitch&#x2F;YouTube), MongoDB, Redis, NodeJS application, openFrameworks). My desktop raised the temperature of the room by at least 5 degrees F, it was a mini space heater. I definitely could have made that project in something lighter, maybe using Rust, but it&#x27;s nice to have the headroom. The next performance upgrade for me will be overclocking my 8700k.')
