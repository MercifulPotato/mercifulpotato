This includes simple things as explicit names for types like u8 instead of char (as you are going to assume the size of char anyway, let&#x27;s be honest... most code won&#x27;t work on 16 bit char platforms). But it also includes stuff like unifying naming conventions, or providing a good package manager. C++ has multiple package managers, as does js. But rust had a great one from the start and for now there doesnt seem to be the need for people to use alternatives, because nobody had to come up with them. So no balkanization of standards and the costs for users that this entails. Maybe with age this will change, but for now Rust is doing quite well.')
