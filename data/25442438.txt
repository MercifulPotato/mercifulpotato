In other words, FB wants Apple to cooperate and make personalized ads a <i>dark pattern and hidden default</i> -- instead of it being out in the open and transparent as a customer <i>choice</i>.<p>I&#x27;m not against advertisement.  I sometimes even <i>pay</i> to see advertisements.  (E.g., when I pay for a ticket to a Home &amp; Garden show at a convention center, I&#x27;m paying to have booth exhibitors &quot;advertise&quot; their new products to me.)<p>It&#x27;s ok for Facebook to serve ads.  They should do it in a more transparent way and this iOS 14 change to explicit IDFA is more consumer friendly and <i>ethical</i>.')
