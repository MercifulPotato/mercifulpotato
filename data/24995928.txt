I&#x27;ve worked in the farm all my youth and this summer we lived on the place and did some small scale gardening.<p>I don&#x27;t have any (at least many) false thoughts about how cool and romantic it will be. It will be hard and frustrating at times but waay more fulfilling than the current tech job. We&#x27;re planning to start scaling little by little, year by year, me working still remotely. The main reasons we&#x27;re doing this are that I&#x27;ve dreamed about this past 15 years and to raise our kids in a healthier surrounding and teach them how to grow food and take care of animals.<p>For anyone having similar dreams checkout Richard Perkins&#x27; educational job in the regenerative agriculture space. He has written excellent book Making Small Farms Work[1] and he has active Youtube channel[1] as well as internet courses.<p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ridgedalepermaculture.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;new-book-making-small-farms-work" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ridgedalepermaculture.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;new-book-making-sm...</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;mrintegralpermanence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;mrintegralpermanence</a>')
