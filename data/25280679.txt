They take very good care of their people, and the only downside is the lack of a home office, but this is not felt.\nI don&#x27;t know another company, or at least I think there are very few that take care of their people like that. The atmosphere is very positive and relaxed, and the projects we are working on are unique, once in a lifetime.\nDon&#x27;t pay any attention to the grumblers, there will always be some. The information about the projects on the Internet is very small, but believe me, there is no place to touch such work.&quot;')
