For food, one person enters the data from the label on the back, other people scan the barcode with their camera and it&#x27;s added as consumed. That&#x27;s how MyFitnessPal works, as well as alternatives that use OpenFoodFacts under the hood. For other types of data, you have other aggregators that are used for a specific use case (Pocket for Articles, Last.fm for music, Trakt.tv for shows&#x2F;movies, Goodreads for books, various device trackers for steps&#x2F;heart rate&#x2F;sleeping patterns etc).<p>Then you use tools that combine those things together, like Exist.io. Alternatively, you go through a middleman route like Zapier&#x2F;IFTTT&#x2F;Integromat&#x2F;NodeRed to not have to fuck around with each API separately. <i>Then</i> you use a system that visualises it all.<p>Granted, there are some blind spots that will make you have to enter the data manually (example: with Netflix you have to manually download a CSV, and it only includes the title and a date, not the time of the day nor the watch time), but that&#x27;s really not that time consuming. It takes me about two minutes per day to fill in the missing fields in my system, and I spend a few hours every two months or so fucking around with the data to find some correlation that I simply wouldn&#x27;t be able to find otherwise.')
