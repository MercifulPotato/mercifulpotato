It&#x27;s not even close. I use Linux but definitely not for its UI.<p>Windows can out-of-the-box do HiDPI, multiple monitors, multiple desktops, trackpad gestures, hardware accelerated UI rendering, facial recognition logins, and more. It was designed as a desktop OS.<p>On Linux some things are getting better if you stick to the Wayland+GNOME stack, but it&#x27;s still so bad I can&#x27;t recommend it to people on technical grounds. Use it if you believe in free software, not because you think it&#x27;s &quot;better&quot; (it&#x27;s not).')
