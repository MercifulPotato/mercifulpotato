The one I’ve seen (I forget the name) comments afterwards if the template isn’t followed. Perhaps it even allows you to directly close and lock the issue in those situations.<p>Alternatively, if you’d truly “pay good money” it shouldn’t be hard to find someone to do it for you, reviewing issues and pinging you on the actionable ones. I’d enjoy that work; I like keeping repositories clean.')
