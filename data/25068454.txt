This is because it saves all HTTP responses (including headers). So in `serve` mode it replays everything as if the server was giving it to you. But in practice, cookies don&#x27;t matter much (unless their used by the client in JS), since we&#x27;re not talking to a server anymore, just serving responses from disk.
