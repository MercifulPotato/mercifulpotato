Item(by='SkyLinx', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1611075883, title='Ask HN: Paddle and test accounts / multiple webhook URLs', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi, quick question for who uses Paddle for subscriptions&#x2F;payments.<p>I was told by someone of the staff when they approved my SaaS that I could create test accounts so not to pollute the main&#x2F;prod account with dev&#x2F;staging data.<p>When I signup it says that they will verify the account, so it&#x27;s weird if they verify multiple times the same company. I asked but I am still waiting for a reply.<p>The other reason why I would like to use test accounts is because Paddle only allows you to specify a single webhook URL, so unless I use some sort of proxy&#x2F;forwarder of the webhook requests, I have no idea of how to use Paddle for testing with multiple separate environments for my app (dev&#x2F;staging&#x2F;prod).<p>What do you do to work around Paddle&#x27;s limitations in terms of testing?<p>Thanks!')
