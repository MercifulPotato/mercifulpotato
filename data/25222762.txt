Come on.<p>&gt; Just not true. Historically, Web dev meant crazy amounts of code hacks in order to target different browsers. Again, it wasn&#x27;t better tech - it was far worse and costly. Remember Flash, ActiveX, Silverlight, etc? Lots of successful sites and web apps used them to work around this problem.<p>I absolutely remember those, and they didn&#x27;t work around the problem at all. You could not use Silverlight on Linux, you could use neither in text browsers nor on old machines, they weren&#x27;t accessible,... The plug-in requirement itself scared many users away. I am so grateful to Steve Jobs for effectively killing those technologies.<p>&gt; Yes, I mean getting rid of the hacks and plethora of libraries needed to accomplish simple, age old software goals.<p>Libraries are good, though JavaScript is in great need of a rich standard library, as problems with npm show. Hacks are arguable: how many were really necessary, and how many came from people who refused to learn the language well but pasted code samples from the web.')
