I have done a lot of PHP programming, and would be very happy to never work in it again. I have a tremendous respect for the language.<p>It also has –literally– tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of expert developers, worldwide. Many of these developers used to stink, but are now much better, as a result of their work with PHP.<p>It also has a <i>massive</i> support infrastructure.<p>HN doesn&#x27;t really appeal to the types of developers that make the lions&#x27; share of PHP (and C++) implementation base, so you won&#x27;t always hear about it, hereabouts.<p>I remember reading an article, some time ago, called <i>&quot;IT Runs on Java 8&quot;</i>[0]. It talked about how much of the IT landscape is composed of folks working in tech and patterns that are not considered &quot;shiny&#x2F;sexy.&quot;<p><i>[UPDATE]: Not a problem. I do the same thing ;).</i><p>The main thing that PHP has, that <i>very</i> few other languages have, is a <i>gigantic</i> implementation surface. In one of my more successful open-source projects, I deliberately wrote it in PHP (4, then, reluctantly, 5.6), because I knew that would give it a far better chance of being implemented.<p>I was right. It is now fast becoming the <i>de facto</i> world standard for its demographic.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;veekaybee.github.io&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;10&#x2F;java8&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;veekaybee.github.io&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;10&#x2F;java8&#x2F;</a>')
