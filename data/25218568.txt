Don&#x27;t be snarky. Have curious conversation; don&#x27;t cross-examine. Please don&#x27;t fulminate. Please don&#x27;t sneer, including at the rest of the community.<p>As for your link, I&#x27;m aware how they claim it works, and even if that is all true (we can&#x27;t audit the source code), then it is <i>still</i> a compromise of E2EE. E2EE is between two devices, a receiver and a sender. The third device also able to receive, without the sender knowing or agreeing about it, is dangerous. Why? Because you can&#x27;t know for sure the receiver has access to both machines. If you consider laptop and PCs are much less safe than mobile devices, then the danger is obvious.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
