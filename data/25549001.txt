It lowers the bar further; allowing all their iOS developers who have been developing ARM code for decades now even easier access to the Mac space too.<p>It is indeed a great time to be a Mac user again!  I was all set to get a 16GB MacBook Air to replace my 2015 MBA.  Then I started seeing videos of  games running either natively or under emulation on a 16GB MBA and the performance shown was more than good enough that I think I am now going to hold out for a MacBook Pro or laptop that can at least get to 32GB of RAM and leave my Windows gaming machine behind.  32GB mainly because of my asset subscription addiction in Cities:Skylines.  Should have better GPU performance too which never hurts - not that I require top tier GPU for the simulations&#x2F;strategy games I like.  Still like my 1080ti in my Windows box but not expecting that in a laptop - from Apple or anyone else.')
