For example when I used to do professional laptop repair, I discovered the &#x27;18650&#x27; is only a size rather than a catch-all for all 12V cells, and isn&#x27;t recommended to daisy-chain the various good ones together if they only share the same voltage. There&#x27;s over a dozen different colors that indicate these batteries were built by various suppliers with use cases such as fast discharge rate, higher peak voltage, greater capacity, or a cost-effective battery that survives fewer discharge cycles. Creating a pack with mismatched batteries could cause the load balancer or device to operate outside of spec- don&#x27;t cheap out on your power source!')
