If you guys are ever hiring, I&#x27;d do anything to be apart of such an innovative place!<p>This is the kind of work that gets me excited to live every day.<p>This really shows though, to the point of the article, that TypeScript at scale really lives up to its name, albeit with some quarks (and in this case, some of those quarks are also due to the environment it operates in). I have also found over the years my experience has been positive when you adopt, most notably, the points about keeping all your packages across projects&#x2F;repos up to date, particularly keep your TS versions rolling upward to prevent definiftion file incompatabilities is necessary.<p>I&#x27;m curious though, as I&#x27;m sure there are several authored libraries (not every repo I assume is a pure app), do you guys run into issues where you have to use a lot of complex typings (like using a function type to infer a given type even though the type you&#x27;re inferring isn&#x27;t a function, and other type dances) or has this not been the case? I&#x27;ve not had much of an issue with this, though I&#x27;ve had to do some pretty complex <i>extends [[type]] ?</i>  stuff to get it to infer correctly in some situations where I want things to be as generic as possible.<p>This was an informative and interesting read, and I&#x27;m grateful you guys published it. Keep up the excellent work!')
