Outsourcing is the primary way the developed world has &quot;cleaned up&quot; so far.<p>The only way we will substantially reduce CO2 emissions is to develop a source of energy that is carbon-free (or incredibly low carbon) and <i>cheaper and easier to deploy than coal and gas</i>. Reductions without that are politically impossible. There is no other way. If we don&#x27;t succeed in doing so, we should plan for significant climate change as a certainty and begin planning our adaptive response.')
