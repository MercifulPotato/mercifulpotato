UK is setting itself up to be in a very similar role, i.e. Canada::USA -&gt; UK::EU.<p>When you are the junior partner in a tightly coupled trade partnership, you have a lot of nominal freedom in practice you are going to steered by the larger  player, both intentionally and not.<p>Who was it that said, &quot;When America sneezes, Canada gets a cold&quot;? I think that was originally a european saying, so we&#x27;ve come full circle.<p>I&#x27;m not sure people in the UK have really come to terms with this, yet.  There is no plausible return path to, say, pre-war UK on the world stage.  There might be room for another Canada though.')
