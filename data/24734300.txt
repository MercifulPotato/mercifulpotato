Would you please be able to elaborate on that and the &quot;field of study&quot; change?<p>1.) Is there a guide to figure out which level you fall under?<p>2.) Lets say based on my years of experience (4 years + MS), I qualify for level 4, does that mean if I don&#x27;t have base salary of 217,000 in NYC, then I am not able to obtain a H1B?<p>3.) If you have a related degree like analytics or data science, are you eligible to work as software engineer or has that become invalid?<p>4.) How long is this expected to run its course if no litigation or no other outside force provides adequate changes?')
