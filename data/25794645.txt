It increases the body count on the other side, but does nothing to help those in the US about to be atomized. It&#x27;s not like the missiles will collide in mid-air.<p>What matters is the <i>believed threat of retaliation</i> because that may <i>prevent</i> an attack in the first place. The optimal system in terms of human life and safety is:<p>1. All foreign governments 100% believe that the US has complete capability to retaliate with devastating force at a moment&#x27;s notice and will do so with zero hesitation.<p>2. But the US actually has no such capability so that an accidental first strike on a false alarm is impossible.<p>The tension between those two is the hard part. :)')
