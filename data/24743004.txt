I guess there is some logic to this design language. Cars are after all big hunks of metal so being painted metallic rather than earthy or natural colors somehow makes more sense than trying to disguise their nature as mechanical objects. I wonder if in an increasingly technological, cyberpunk world people subconsciously want their technology items to look “techy” or serious.')
