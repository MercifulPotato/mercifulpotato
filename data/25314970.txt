They&#x27;re reliant on Moore&#x27;s law and cheaper and cheaper energy, with more and more trust overhead processing by validating transactions, which doesn&#x27;t necessarily scale, creating a need for proof-of-stake entities to substitute.<p>Etherium (the system) contains within it proof of stake, but external entities (e.g. Kraken, etc.) can still validate proof of stake, if desired. Personally, I&#x27;m unsure if Etherium&#x27;s proof of stake on its own is enough, because I think blockchain can be compromised (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;19&#x2F;239592&#x2F;once-hailed-as-unhackable-blockchains-are-now-getting-hacked&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;19&#x2F;239592&#x2F;once-hail...</a>).<p>So, that&#x27;s essentially why they choose Etherium (proof of stake).<p>Global equity and inequity revolves around those that essentially &quot;hold&quot; the value (proof of stake), and banks hold the money in our current financial system, largely based on USD (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;forex&#x2F;11&#x2F;popular-currencies-and-why-theyre-traded.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;forex&#x2F;11&#x2F;popular-curre...</a>). Large banks have the ability to basically &quot;re-use&quot; debt multiple times, creating debt from debt (via Fractional Reserve Banking) as well as other means (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;investing&#x2F;081415&#x2F;understanding-how-federal-reserve-creates-money.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;investing&#x2F;081415&#x2F;under...</a>). Wherever you are and whatever chaste you&#x27;re in, if you can sell your potential for paying a bank back, they can create money out of debt for you. Yes, this devalues the currency, but if you do well with it, you come out on top, you give back in interest, and the overall value is greater than the inflation of the currency, and outsiders investing in those companies can be important. If investment, etc. fails or the market fails, that system fails. Otherwise, it kind of works ok.<p>The proof-of-stake entities will hopefully continue to generate value similar from nothing&#x2F;debt to help those that can help others until this world is done and we move on.<p>Of course, if there were no money and we all just did work for each other, I think that could work also. While money was still made from work, there is some element of communal living &#x2F; working for each other in Christianity (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;AskBibleScholars&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ah5850&#x2F;did_early_christians_live_in_communes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;AskBibleScholars&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ah5850&#x2F;di...</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;wgbh&#x2F;pages&#x2F;frontline&#x2F;shows&#x2F;religion&#x2F;maps&#x2F;arch&#x2F;recovering.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;wgbh&#x2F;pages&#x2F;frontline&#x2F;shows&#x2F;religion&#x2F;maps...</a>).<p>But, 1960s hippie communes tended to get corrupted by drugs, relationship problems, abuse, etc. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1998&#x2F;08&#x2F;03&#x2F;us&#x2F;excesses-blamed-for-demise-of-the-commune-movement.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1998&#x2F;08&#x2F;03&#x2F;us&#x2F;excesses-blamed-for-de...</a>) And countries that adopted Communism and Socialism have tended to include leaders that really mistreated their population or performed other atrocities, or it just didn&#x27;t work (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Human_rights_in_the_Soviet_Union" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Human_rights_in_the_Soviet_Uni...</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnesty.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;countries&#x2F;asia-and-the-pacific&#x2F;china&#x2F;report-china&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnesty.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;countries&#x2F;asia-and-the-pacific&#x2F;ch...</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heritage.org&#x2F;progressivism&#x2F;commentary&#x2F;three-nations-tried-socialism-and-rejected-it" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heritage.org&#x2F;progressivism&#x2F;commentary&#x2F;three-nati...</a>).<p>I&#x27;m not an expert in these things, so let me know what I&#x27;m not understanding.')
