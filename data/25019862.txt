Key to this is the unbalanced wildcard that is the United States Supreme Court. While the Supreme Court has the ability to basically make any law or any decision no matter how flimsy the textual language support, the United States is not a democracy, it’s a dictatorship. without that fear of what a court could and would do, Trump would have never won his first campaign.<p>I always hope that some moderate politician will come along in deemphasize the power of the bases. A strongly pro environment Republican, or a true honest pro life Democrat. Unfortunately what we’ve seen, and continue to see in this election is at the wings in each party are all powerful.<p>We need to rebuild institutions that have been shaped by decades of imperial President rule. I agree with the chaos engineering example that was given earlier. We now know what part of the system don’t scale.  Something that we cannot permit if we want to continue having a democracy is presidents acting like they can ignore law, make appointments were not in recess, pass executive orders with the force of law. We also need to stop excusing his behavior because of parties and links. Obama gave trump the weapons that he used in office with a national Labour relations Board debacle and his immigration orders. Trump orders were simply the flipside of that coin.<p>It’s time to re-factor America. we may want to consider going as far as making the presidency more of a Prime Minister role, as opposed to an independent position. The country and the stakes are now so high that we cannot afford to have another Donald Trump.')
