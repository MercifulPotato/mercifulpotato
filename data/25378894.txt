Platforms where money goes directly to content creators are the best way of going about that. But even PH is pretty good at paying artists who use their platform.<p>What PH is really bad at is content moderation. Should they improve that? Absolutely. Is this grounds for legal action? Maybe it is. Is this a good reason to boycott them as an individual? Go for it! But is this a reason for a payment processor to get involved? I think it&#x27;s not. But you&#x27;re free to disagree.<p>As for &quot;soul-sucking debasedness&quot;, please stop imposing your sense of morality onto others. Yes, there are some people who are forced into porn for various reasons, and we as a society should try to prevent that -- just like we should try to prevent all kinds of abuses. But there are many people who enjoy working as porn stars. Don&#x27;t judge them.')
