That may be a moot point because i think were only talking about science serving as an advisory function but where do we draw the line as to what is an acceptable rate of change and what is not? See thing is there are a whole bunch of issues that need to be worked out. Im glad that this is being discussed in a public forum but as ive already suggested it seems these decisions have already been made for us and our discussion over them is mostly irrelevant. Its more a matter now of justifying what has been done over determining what we should do as a society. Nobody voted for this. But thats whats happening. So now we just have to deal with it and try to keep it from turning into something ugly.')
