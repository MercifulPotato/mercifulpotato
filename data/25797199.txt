Too bad, I just dumped it and got on this new app, so you guys better install it just to have the privilege to communicate with me.&quot;<p>Umm, no. I use both WhatsApp and Signal (way before this hysteria began) but the &quot;just leave&quot; mentality isn&#x27;t realistic. Most people don&#x27;t care about this stuff enough to install a new app and start using it. Even for people who will join it, it takes time. The network effect is still there.<p>Being on HN too much and&#x2F;or having social circles full of people who think like you misleads people.')
