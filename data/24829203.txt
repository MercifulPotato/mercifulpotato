There&#x27;s no clear obvious intuitive big line between &quot;natural talent and hard work&quot; and &quot;illegal chemical cheating&quot;.<p>yep, it is all individual. Some people have nice biology, some will get nowhere without &quot;stuff&quot;. A recent blood test showed some anemia (that explained why \ni had such low level fatigue and tiredness threshold in the recent times, and you couldn&#x27;t just make through it on pure will because it is like an engine with closed air intake - no oxygen, no burning) Started to take B12 and iron - things improved remarkably, physically and mentally. If i were a competitive athlete should i be forbidden from such a &quot;cheating&quot; way of increasing of blood oxygen carrying capability?<p>My understanding they ban testosterone which also increase the blood oxygen carrying capability. Which means that  you&#x27;re lucky to be born with high testosterone, and you&#x27;re doomed otherwise (like me - i&#x27;m on a lower side). How is that a level playing field then?  No exercise can compensate if you get less oxygen.')
