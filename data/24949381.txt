Red tape, regulation and lack of political will (due to unfavourable views on nuclear technology) will continue to see most countries fall behind on this.<p>It&#x27;s really quite sad. Nuclear has a negative connotation to most but it&#x27;s the future. Interstellar space travel will rely on the nuclear technology that should be worked on today.<p>I reason that we should be building and developing these technologies now rather than continuing to rely on burning carbon based fuels to power our homes. The technology is there. The will is not.<p>Sadly, too many dummies keep on pandering on about how it&#x27;s dangerous which in turn, drives up cost - then other dummies come along and say &quot;Oh it is too expensive&quot;, without understanding the first group of people that drove the cost up to begin with.')
