So compared to probabilities, ranks are indeed limited in this regard. For instance, you can learn probabilities from data but there&#x27;s no obvious way to learn ranks from data.<p>But for subjective belief they&#x27;re still useful. Consider the problem of diagnosing a system with components that fail in rare cases. However we have no idea about failure probabilities. We can then use ranks. A diagnosis for some observed behaviour would then be the least surprising (i.e., lowest ranked) failure state that explains the observed behaviour. This is also the reason for least-surprising-first execution: the most important prediction or hypothesis is the  most likely one and thus the least surprising one. There are some concrete examples in the paper which demonstrate this.<p>I am currently thinking about combining probabilities with ranks so that you can reason about both kinds of uncertainty in the same model. This could be implemented using a programming language that supports both ranked choice statements and probabilistic choice statements.')
