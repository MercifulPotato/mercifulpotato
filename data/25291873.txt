I agree that freedom of association, when considered alone, would allow wage fixing and price fixing and all sorts of anti-competitive behavior.<p>We&#x27;re moving away from areas where I&#x27;m confident I know what I&#x27;m talking about, but I think as a society we&#x27;ve decided that while anti-competitive laws do infringe on the rights of business leaders, we&#x27;re trying to balance their rights with those of everyone else, and the laws are necessary to prevent a permanent class divide between business leaders who cannot be challenged, and workers under them. In the long run, allowing complete free association among CEOs would limit the freedoms of the rest of society.<p>Society is a constant project of balancing various conflicting rights, and this is one of many cases where we limit the rights of a few to defend the rights of many.')
