(e.g. with $30 of quad-NANDs you can build a lot)<p>In the early 2000&#x27;s I would avoid Staples to avoid crap brands like VTech and go online to seek out Plantronics instead.  AMZN got a reputation as a fair dealer for things like HDMI cables compared to a place like Best Buy which might only stock a $99 monster cable.<p>Slowly AMZN got worse and I have less trust in the marketplace products than I did before,')
