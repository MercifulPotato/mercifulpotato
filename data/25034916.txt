Putting my editor in fullscreen is against visual clutter, but I don&#x27;t have to shut down my laptop not to read HN instead (or do I? excuse: was not doing a deep focus task right now, but waiting for slack replies. Waiting makes me jump to other apps right away... So glad I don&#x27;t have build times in my job).')
