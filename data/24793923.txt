Things needs to be practised to be really understood. We&#x27;re not living in the matrix where you can upload knowledge into your brain, you need to actually practise something to understand how it works.<p>Not to mention that all knowledge is contextual and dependent on its environment. Doing the same things over again in a different environment may yield different results, old failures, through tiny changes may turn out to actually work now. That&#x27;s what makes constant experimentation and repetition necessary to rebuilt robust systems.<p>that&#x27;s why markets are more effective than central planning, and why evolution is the most robust mechanism on earth. Having twenty companies build the same product is more wasteful than having one committee do it, but only competition, incremental change, and reinvention really are able to explore the entire space.')
