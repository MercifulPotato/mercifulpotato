A few <i>minutes</i> per month is the most devops any startup would need to do in reality running their own VMs or servers, after an hour or two of setup. And that hour or two is often less than faffing around getting all the labyrinth moving parts of AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;etc. working.<p>And the whole thing becomes a transparent farce when you look at providers like Azure, where their own admin interface is so slow and prone to random breaks you have to ask:<p>How is this scalable?<p>It&#x27;s clearly not scalable for themselves, so how is it &quot;scalable&quot; for everyone else?<p>There are benefits, mainly for me I&#x27;ll use them for hassle free deploys[1], but the whole thing sometimes feels like a massive con to sell the performance of a potato by advertising it as a jet engine.<p>[1] Like a month back I deployed a demo prototype web app I wrote in 3 hours onto Azure straight from github with like two clicks, and got the contract, can&#x27;t really beat that.')
