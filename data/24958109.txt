Sweden has probably some of the best hip arthroplasty outcomes but the cost of these is roughly 5-10 times lower than in the states. I think the system is somewhat stacked against you, if doctors (also human beings) spend 80-100 hours&#x2F;week during their residency, they expect a financial reward afterwards or no-one would agree to that.<p>Orthopedics is also somewhat of an odd medical specialty with lots of incentive issues and a scarcity of good clinical trials. In a study from Sydney they found that among the 50% of the surgeries that had been evaluated with randomized clinical trials (RCT), only in 50% of the cases the trials actually supported the surgery. It is though much more difficult to randomize people to surgery, doing the blue or red pill is much easier.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure also that a big part of the problem is us doctors failing to identify if a patient is part of the long tail or not, i.e. does he&#x2F;she not fall into a particular study&#x27;s inclusion criteria or not? Hopefully we will be able to shortcut this problem with deep learning tools but as most self-driving-car enthusiast know - there is a big difference driving around in the parking lot from the open streets.')
