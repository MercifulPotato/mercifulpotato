While I understand the goal of this guidance is to make technical communication as clear and concise as possible, I also feel like it leads to a world of boring writers. And (IMO) boring communication actually should be recognized as worse communication, in comparison to communication that combines technical detail with human deliverance.<p>The problem is all the more exacerbated when the guidance uses a checklist-like rubric such as:<p>-&quot;this sentence exceeds X word count, consider splitting&quot;<p>-&quot;this sentence uses passive voice, use active voice&quot;.<p>I remember &quot;revising&quot; parts of my senior design to score higher against a similar rubric, despite being confident that the revision was overall worse.<p>Writing quality is inherently subjective, maybe to the chagrin of engineering types. Even though there are horrendous emails and documentation in the wild, I still think teaching people how to write with tools like this isn&#x27;t the solution.')
