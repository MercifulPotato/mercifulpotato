I&#x27;m fairly certain the government spends more dollars (doing things like factoring enough primes AOT to be able to decrypt ~20% of <i>all</i> https traffic in realtime[1]). Often things that community concludes to be &quot;unlikely&quot; or &quot;difficult&quot; are well within the governments ability - cue &quot;SSL added and removed here ;-)&quot;<p>I think the fact that the cryptography community didn&#x27;t pick up on Crypto AG&#x27;s subterfuge says a lot, IMO.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2015&#x2F;10&#x2F;how-the-nsa-can-break-trillions-of-encrypted-web-and-vpn-connections&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2015&#x2F;10&#x2F;how-t...</a>')
