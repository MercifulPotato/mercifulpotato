I can think of a few things that might be interesting (no idea if you&#x27;ve already done them though):<p>* Try a language like Racket. It can feel really liberating, because it&#x27;s so easy to just get boilerplate stuff out of the way. Beautiful Racket is a nice book to kinda give you a feel for it. [1]<p>* Maybe try doing homebrew development for an old game console? Gives you a taste of embedded development in a fun way, and on a platform that you know isn&#x27;t going to change. Also gives you the opportunity to learn things like drawing graphics or making music. Because the hardware is limited, it kinda takes the pressure off in terms of being able to draw well etc.<p>If this interests you at all, maybe pick one of the older&#x2F;lower powered systems, like NES or Gameboy.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beautifulracket.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beautifulracket.com&#x2F;</a><p>EDIT: Actually, something that&#x27;s done wonders for my motivation&#x2F;drive is exercise, eating well, and intermittent fasting. I have much more &quot;mental&quot; energy these days, and motivation just seems to come with it.')
