As the BE-4 gets closer to production, and the Raptor gets some flight tests under its belt, a clearer picture on the thrust to weight and dynamic range of throttling will become better understood.<p>But the really awesome thing is <i>three</i> orbital class re-usable engines available from US vendors for the first time ever. This bodes well for the US space industry. Not so good for Aerojet&#x2F;Rocketdyne which, in my opinion, has basically rested on its laurels as the &quot;only game in town&quot; for US built engines for far too long.')
