Legal knowledge is negligible among most employees. Even thought the law says a thing, intimidation and threats always do the trick. No one really drags companies to courts given the long intervals of a case, costs, plus mind boggling amounts of corruption involved in anything.<p>Secondly even things like notice period are not enforceable. I have seen situations where a manager would block a person&#x27;s relieving letter for standards 3 months waiting, while the receiving company wants the candidate to join in a month. The candidate asked for manager to give it in writing in a mail and the manager instantly approved the notice period to be reduced to a month.<p>These days the internal separation portals block such approvals, and getting it changed is a long drawn process which  will spawn beyond a person&#x27;s notice period. And if a person requests a change while they are employed they will be fired.<p>Existence of a law means nothing in India.')
