I&#x27;m failing to find justification for RH and others to restrict buying but not selling of GME.<p>Your first link is for penny stocks, and the restrictions revolve around the usual pump-and-dump. You&#x27;re allowed to go long, and can trade between days.<p>Your second link is for OTC, and I fail to see how this is relevant to GME. GME is traded on formal exchanges, and brokers that haven&#x27;t arbitrarily restricted buying aren&#x27;t having any liquidity issues.')
