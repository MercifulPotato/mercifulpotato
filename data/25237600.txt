They are using nitrogen gas, effectively displacing oxygen and asphyxiating the patient. This is massively important because of how inhumane poisonous gases tend to be, and how humane death by inert gas is.<p>Your body calculated whether you are asphyxiating by measuring your bodies ability to expel CO2, not it&#x27;s ability to intake oxygen. As long as you can expel CO2, your body thinks everything is fine, even if there is no oxygen to breathe. As such, sufferers tend to not even realize that they are dying.<p>I&#x27;m not a big proponent of the death penalty, but if we are going to enforce it, I see no reason to make it any more gruesome or unpleasant than it has to be. Then again, I strongly suspect that the suffering of the convict is a big part of the reason we do things the way we do. A 12 gauge buckshot shell to the back of the head seems far more humane than the electric chair, and has existed for longer (well, maybe not 12 gauges specifically, but shotguns in general). The only reason I can think that we keep inventing these overly complicated and yet still gruesome ways to kill people is to ensure that the convict suffers, while being just humane enough that people can palate it.')
