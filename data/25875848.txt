We just don&#x27;t see powerful &quot;blue dog democrats&quot; and moderate republicans holding the keys any more.<p>While moderate candidates have more independent appeal - it&#x27;s voter turnout that wins elections, even in competitve districts. Appealing to emotions, especially appealing to fear has been extremely successful at getting turnout for particular voters (ie, anti-abortion voters for example). Maybe that will calm down or moderates will turn out more and end this trend (as they did with Biden) - but even competitive races can turn out extreme candidates.<p>Another possibility to consider, is that what we call &quot;competitive districts&quot; are really just &quot;moderate districts&quot; to begin with. Places the population isn&#x27;t particularly threatened by or well-served by either party. In that case, it makes sense that they would be both more competitive, and more moderate.')
