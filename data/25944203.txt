They only make money when they actually sell, and as soon as a significant number of them do sell the price will fall and the money the others think they have made will vanish. And then some.<p>So a few hedgies might lose a few bucks, but all the WSB people piling in are not a cuddly gang of friends, and not all on the same side and the savvy among them surely know that. The smart ones will sell and leave the rest holding the can. It&#x27;s the poor saps piling in at $300+ who genuinely think they are sticking it to the man that I worry about.<p>The people who have actually made money so far are the ones who already had stock and have ben selling on the way up, because the stock being bought must have come from somewhere, not the ones who have gone long now and will end up long when it collapses again. It&#x27;s amazing how many journalists and commentators get this so badly wrong.')
