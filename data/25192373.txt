The generated faces have too perfect teetch, sometimes illogical changes in skin texture and hairiness,... But one thing really stands out on its own and I think I could be just as correct if I only relied on it.<p>See how all these pictures are propely lit and exposed and seem like they were taken with a decent camera? Now notice how this isn&#x27;t the case with hair, especially transparent parts of loose long hair, where you see individual hairs.  These parts look like they have way more noise and like they&#x27;ve been taken in low light with high ISO, somewhat like in a bad HDR composite. This may not work for slicked hair or bald people, yet it&#x27;s pretty evident in almost all other cases.')
