All these companies claim to be neutral, and while I think they genuinely try to be, for various reasons they aren&#x27;t able to stick to that standard.<p>The point of contracts is that you give up certain rights. On Monday, I can&#x27;t sleep in all day because I&#x27;ve got an agreement to work. I have to set aside some money for rent because I signed a lease.<p>What these companies are doing may be legal in practice, because of the difficulties in litigating, but it&#x27;s never entirely legal to make promises and then break them, whether they&#x27;re through contracts, terms, or even marketing claims and advertisements.<p>When they make those claims, they voluntarily give up their right to say anything they like. Being able to give a right up is part of having it in the first place.<p>Twitter could change their terms to say, &quot;we will ban or block people we have political differences with, or when bad PR is making us feel uncomfortable.&quot; Then banning people for those reasons would be 100% legal, because they would have reserved that right.')
