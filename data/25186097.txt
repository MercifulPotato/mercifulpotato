The apps not talking to the vendor is just a band-aid.</i><p>And what if you can&#x27;t discuss protests or protest organization on any of the apps you are allowed to install on your device, as Apple has made the case already in Hong Kong?<p>This all starts with the tools. Without tools, we cannot even begin to effect change: to organize protests, to communicate with other organizers without surveillance and interference (Poitras can probably testify to this), to reach potential voters.<p>In Apple&#x27;s jurisdiction, there are essentially zero options on the ballot for candidates that wish to roll back US state&#x2F;military surveillance. Voting is not a useful or practical tool in this fight.<p>Private communications tools (as well as arms) must remain out of the instantaneous reach of the state. Once those are compromised, there will be no way to effect practical change or resistance.<p>If Signal&#x27;s iOS publishing certificate were revoked tomorrow and Apple temporarily stopped signing self-builds, we&#x27;d be there right now with iOS phones.<p>We&#x27;ve already lost this freedom on mobile. We need to fight to preserve it on desktop&#x2F;laptop.')
