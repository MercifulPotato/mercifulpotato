People choose a career path for many reasons besides ability, such as individual personality, ability <i>in alternative jobs</i> (note the quote in your first link which points out that &quot;girls outperform their male counterparts on achievement tests in stereotypically feminine subject areas&quot;), or even their experience being bullied in high school with regard to the job.<p>Furthermore, if you want to come to valid statistical conclusions about whether a discrepancy is due to a particular cause (and can&#x27;t just do a RCT), it&#x27;s not enough to just ignore plausible confounders until they are &quot;provable&quot;. You need to systematically control for all possible confounders.')
