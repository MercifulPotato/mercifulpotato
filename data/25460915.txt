Social norms are what keeps science healthy — without good social norms, people would’ve responded to p-hacking etc. by saying “great, let’s all do it!” rather than trying to fix anything.<p>The importance of comparison with social norms is also sort of reason why people aren’t thrown into insane asylums for claiming that the literal creator of the universe has personally ordered them to eat each week a small token of unleavened bread which have been magically transformed into human flesh by a prayer in honour of the last meal the supreme being had with his mates that one time he took human form right before he prearranged his own temporary execution in order to give his non-mortal other self an excuse to not put people’s immortal souls into eternal damnation by default.<p>Also the broad reason why Washington is not heavily criticised for owning slaves.<p>None of this is to say that evil social norms are not to be challenged or fought against, just that it’s really <i>really</i> unusual to have someone who can <i>both</i> do that <i>and</i> avoid taking down Chesterton Fences.')
