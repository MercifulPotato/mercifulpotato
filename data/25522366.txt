Targeted treatments take a long time to develop, and only cure one type. The vast majority of cancers are still treated using a sledgehammer approach. I had lymphoma, and took both a general poison (bendamustine) and a very narrowly targeted monoclonal antibody (rituximab). The bendamustine kicked my ass a bit because it&#x27;s simply poison. The rituximab hardly had any side effects at all, because it only targeted specific cell types (both healthy and cancerous cells of that type, but still focused).<p>The idea that there is or ever will be a &quot;cancer cure&quot; is a popular misconception. There are hundreds--if not thousands--of cancer variants. The more targeted the treatments are, the fewer patients any one treatment can help. It takes a decade or more and hundreds of millions of dollars for each targeted treatment. There&#x27;s still an enormous need for broad-spectrum treatments in addition to targeted ones.')
