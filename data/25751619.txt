I used Vent&#x2F;TS&#x2F;Mumble&#x2F;Skype for years while playing WoW and within 2 minutes of downloading Discord it clearly blew all of them out of the water. Joining a new server was frictionless, channels and settings were clear and understandable. It combined everything from those 4 services into 1 and did it better. I wouldn&#x27;t call that &quot;frilly features&quot; it&#x27;s just a flat out superior product.')
