You are indeed making a contract for the sale of the license itself. Otherwise subscription models wouldn&#x27;t work and would even be legally allowed to share and resell the software, which you aren&#x27;t (i.e. just because it&#x27;s possible to resell an acquired license while keeping a working copy, doesn&#x27;t make it legal to do so).')
