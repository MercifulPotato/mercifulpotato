Every person&#x27;s addiction is unique, but self-isolation is a common trait among alcoholics (and probably people with addictions in general).<p>One of the best exercises we did in recovery was list out as a group what our priorities in life were. It was things like &quot;my partner&quot;, &quot;my career&quot;, &quot;my health&quot;, &quot;finances &amp; having money to live comfortably&quot;, &quot;having friends&quot;, etc. And when we were done and were happy with our list, the instructor went up and wrote <i>alcohol</i> at the very top. When you&#x27;re deep in addiction, even if you know it&#x27;s not rational, even if it&#x27;s not what you want, the addiction is your top priority. If you have free time, that&#x27;s how you spend it first; when you have money, it&#x27;s the first thing you budget for; when you&#x27;re doing other things, it&#x27;s what you think about. And for a lot of people, self-isolation makes it that much easier to feed that addiction.')
