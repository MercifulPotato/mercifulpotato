That doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t use it...because people like it.  But it adds complexity and &quot;business risk&quot;, whether you like it or not.<p>In some spaces (ML) you&#x27;re going to have to ship some Python, but what I was saying was that I would rather not.<p>My role the past few years has been some mix of deployment engineering &amp; systems engineering and the conclusion that I quickly came to was that deploying scripting languages like Python&#x2F;Ruby&#x2F;etc is the realm of assholes. ...which was a funny lesson because mainly through my career I&#x27;ve worked in smaller scale shops using almost exclusively scripting languages.')
