Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609534059, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25606642, text='&gt;  To add a little detail to what others said, amphetamine and its salts are explicitly a Schedule II controlled substance in the US.<p>Though, Schedule II means it has accepted medical uses, <i>so it is not illegal</i>.  For instance, <i>lots</i> of kids are prescribed amphetamines for ADHD.<p>The part of the policy that actually references &quot;controlled substances&quot; only forbids apps that <i>facilitate their sale</i> by non-pharmacies.<p>I think the GGP has a point if you replace &quot;controlled substances&quot; with &quot;illegal drugs.&quot;  The reviewer obviously seems to think the terms are synonymous (which is false), and banned the app under the clause that forbids &quot;encourag[ing] consumption of ... illegal drugs.&quot;<p>Leaving everything else aside, this reviewer pretty clearly failed to understand and reasonably apply the policy as written.  Reference != promotion and &quot;controlled substance&quot; != &quot;illegal drugs&quot; (all illegal drugs are controlled substances, but the reverse is not true).')
