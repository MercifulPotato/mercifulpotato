It would be one thing if they had the button but it was missing on certain videos. But as far as I know, that&#x27;s not the actual situation.<p>Software doesn&#x27;t always have all the features that end users might want, and the mere absence of a feature doesn&#x27;t necessarily tell you why it&#x27;s missing. Also, it&#x27;s not some weird, suspicious thing to write software which fills in a feature gap in some other software. (Google encourages add-on software on other products, too. For example, Chrome extensions and Gmail add-ons.)<p>But, maybe there is some legal reason why this could make sense. Maybe some terms of service or licensing (for video uploaders or for regular end users) says not to download something, which would make it clear that the download feature is missing on purpose.')
