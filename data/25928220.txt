There&#x27;s three data models (or sets thereof) that are mostly the same - MOSTLY.<p>I could make the tables flexible (add columns to fit all data models). I could make the queries dynamic (make the table part flexible). But I&#x27;m duplicating code instead.<p>As the proverb goes, a little duplication is better than the wrong abstraction. There&#x27;s bits of code in here where the author tried to be smart, but queries like &quot;select id from $table where x = $y&quot; really throw my editor (and brain) off.')
