I also overshot &quot;assertive,&quot; but the alternative was that everyone would continue to steamroll me to the point of despair. Assertive wasn&#x27;t enough to safeguard my dignity.<p>It is indeed exactly as you said. The world chewed me up for being innocent. I was routinely physically assaulted at school. These things were passed off as roughhousing or joking and the adults never intervened, and some even seemed to appreciate the &quot;humor.&quot;<p>The adults rolled their eyes at me essentially for being weak, it was sort of like &quot;sigh, what are we gonna do with that kid?&quot; It occurs to me now that these were bitter, jaded people who hated a child for his naivet√©.<p>If I defended myself, I was the bad guy. At some point I thought: &quot;it doesn&#x27;t make sense that I am the one who is right and that everyone else is wrong, so maybe I should be more like those guys.&quot; But then I got punished too. For example, it was considered funny for people to kick me in the balls at times. It had happened to me 10+ times and nobody got punished. Regrettably, I did it once to another kid and it was a scandal and I got punished.<p>I am in a healthy place now but I thank God I got through the teen and young adult years without becoming a criminal. I think I easily could have, because I came out of school a deeply damaged individual.')
