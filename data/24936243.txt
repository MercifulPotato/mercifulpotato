Item(by='ajarmst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604007347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24933054, text='Greenwald has done important, admirable work. As has <i>The Intercept</i>.  Unfortunately my estimation of both has catastrophically declined.  <i>The Intercept</i> outed an important source (Reality Winner) with comically incompetent OpSec, which is unforgivable given their niche. Greenwald was once an important critic from the Left of the Obama Administration---which got a pass on a lot of things (&lt;cough&gt; drones &lt;cough&gt;) that Republicans wouldn&#x27;t have. Unfortunately (and for some complex and sometimes understandable reasons) he moved away from trenchant criticism and into a sort of foaming unhinged rage at former members of that Ã¥dministration. At times, he rivals Infowars performances, except I don&#x27;t think Glen is just playing a role.  He&#x27;s demonstrably unable to report in a professional manner on Biden, and non-propagandist outlets (are there any left?) are right to decline to publish the article---as is demonstrated by an even casual look at his Twitter feed when Obama, Clinton or Biden are mentioned.  Greenwald has some justification for his resentment, but that doesn&#x27;t make him a credible source.')
