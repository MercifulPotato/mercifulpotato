Your remarks about its genetic lineage and development in a single area are spot on and relevant.<p>&gt; Only since the 1850s has the Japanese borrowing of loanwords really took off, and those are mostly limited to English words[...]<p>Are you sure you meant to say English? [   <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sino-Japanese_vocabulary" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sino-Japanese_vocabulary</a>  - though even the article you linked specifically says it has a large portion of Chinese loans ]. Though Chinese borrowing started in the 4th century into Japanese, so - are you saying Japanese borrowings from Chinese particularly accelerated in the 1850s (If you could find some source for this claim, it’d be appreciated - I wasn’t able to find one and it seems unlikely, given that this was the point at which it started to lean more European in terms of its borrowings)?
