This is interestingly enough happening both in the US and Western Europe.<p>That&#x27;s why I think that the left digging in is a losing strategy. The more radical they appear the more people they&#x27;ll push in the other direction. Currently that&#x27;s 50-50 in the US and the Democrats didn&#x27;t seem to learn much from the past 4 years.
