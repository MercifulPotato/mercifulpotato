Arguably, FB owes its success precisely to its exclusive status in the early days, and to rising prevalence of affordable devices in the world. It’s difficult to know whether it was successful because it became open, or it happened independently. However, I agree that social networks played a significant role in recent past. (I think that could be fading away, though.)<p>&gt; Similarly, I&#x27;ve tried migrating from Twitter to Mastodon. But no one I know uses it, so why bother?<p>&gt; I would pay for Facebook&#x2F;Twitter, but on the condition that other people are also paying. As soon as people start leaving, there&#x27;s no much point.<p>I don’t think it’s worth treating FB&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Mastodon as some sort of window to the whole of humanity. There are interesting people who do not engage or have no presence on Twitter or Facebook.<p>Competition is tough when the biggest players radically undercut on price by being free thanks to investor and ad money, riding on network effects of the past. However, users are waking up that by engaging on a free ad-supported service they become the product. The way it’s going, more and more people are using ad-supported free platforms to self-promote, campaign, spread different kinds of evangelism, and&#x2F;or link to profiles to elsewhere online where higher level of engagement is possible. Where they link to is where new social networks have an opportunity.<p>---<p>I think plurality of social networks and a single network for everyone both have their problems.<p>A plurality of networks presents a challenge in that it’s difficult for one person to engage on many disparate platforms (consumes time and effort), but this can be addressed: for example, with paid networks that don’t need to show ads and can thus offer complete APIs, we just might see fully featured multi-network GUI clients bridging them together.<p>Having a single network where everyone participates, on the other hand, seems unrealistic—even in a single country. This, I think, can not be addressed at all (except by having a government maintain its own censored avenue for discussion, which is only really compatible with a very authoritarian regime).')
