Why not Google?&quot; And then we have the conversation - it&#x27;s a short conversation:<p>Well, you cannot prosper in an environment if you operate on inaccurate or censored information. Google &amp; YouTube censor information and track everything you search for or watch. Today your views align, tomorrow they may not.<p>Secondly, you must insure yourself against tail risks, and having your Gmail account &quot;cancelled&quot; is a yuuuge tail risk. Therefore, avoid bundled Google products.<p>Then a few months will go buy, and I&#x27;ll see they are now using Firefox and DDG.<p>When you have these conversations, it&#x27;s important that it not be about <i>your</i> identity (open source!
