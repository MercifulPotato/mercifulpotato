Weight is one point against battery packs, but easy refill&#x2F;swap and maintenance are two points in their favour.  When you start to deal with volume commercial vehicles the cost of maintenance and repair adds up and is considered a part of doing business.  If you try to tell me that your load-bearing conformal battery packs that are critical to making the truck move are an item my depot mechanics cannot touch or repair I am going to show you the door.<p>If my truck are loading&#x2F;unloading they are probably doing it at customer facilities so charging is unlikely to be an option.  If they are loading&#x2F;unloading at my facility then I can swap the battery pack at the same time.')
