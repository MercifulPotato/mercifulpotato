Sometime the project is so long and problems so hard that you tend to procrastinate. One trick I learned was to add reward just for the start. For example, I have a huge watch later list on YouTube that I never get around to watch. So I star that on one screen and on other screen actual work. More often that not, I then turn of YouTube and go along with my work.')
