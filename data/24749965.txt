If they shipped on CD a 20 track song you&#x27;d get under 10 minutes of music.<p>Second, most songs have a great deal of post production -- effects are applied to dry tracks; often groups of tracks are mixed down to a &quot;bus&quot; track, which is then mixed into the next level of the mixing tree.  Eg, there might be six mics on a drum kit, and the engineer will work hard to shape the sound mic by mic, changing EQ, reverb, panning, etc, to get the desired effect.  Then that final drum bus is mixed into the next level.  Often these mixing and effects parameters is dynamic, changing throughout the song.<p>There is no standard for these effects, nor for the mixing parameters, so to achieve the final result would require, essentially, shipping the workflow for a specific DAW application.')
