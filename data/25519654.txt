Chat application vs. neural network.  A neural network is mostly compute a chat application is mostly io.<p>If you work with a framework like nodejs the framework agrees with your assumption but nobody is going to write a neural network with it. Ironically JavaScript is the language showing a sort of resurgence for fp but nodejs is the worst platform for it due to its focus on io based concurrency.<p>Still though you will notice that despite the above caveats for node the framework still follows the classic pattern of segregating state away. Typical nodejs apps are stateless along with most web apps. If you worked with frameworks that have request handlers as the primary pattern you will see that this pattern tries to segregate io away as much as possible by turning the abstraction into a request&#x2F;response combinator<p>So basically, The compute part of any application, no matter how small is a prime candidate for combinators via segregation of compute and side effects.... but of course if your application is io bound or highly stateful you can only go so far.')
