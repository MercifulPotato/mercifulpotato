(Which is not to say that it&#x27;s purely Preview.app&#x27;s fault. Maybe all of these PDFs were created in a bad way, would not surprise me at all. Could very well be that Preview.app is actually &quot;improving&quot; and fixing old bugs&#x2F;cruft, breaking things that worked before but never should have in the first place. As the end user that doesn&#x27;t really matter for me though, as I said in the post itself.)')
