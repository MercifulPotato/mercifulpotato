You could say it&#x27;s a &quot;western&quot; thing, but definitely not an USA thing (although they do tend to claim it for themselves like they invented it).<p>What&#x27;s unique to the USA is the weird idea that personal responsibility is somehow a counter-argument to regulation. &quot;Guns don&#x27;t kill people, so everybody should be free to own them&quot;. At the same time, it&#x27;s mostly the american left that argues <i>against</i> personal responsibility just because it&#x27;s considered a right-wing belief.<p>To come to a conclusion: As so often, the USA is wrong, on both sides. The only &quot;right&quot; mentality, in my opinion, is one that acknowledges both personal responsibility and the option for society to step in.')
