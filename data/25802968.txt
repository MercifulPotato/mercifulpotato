For example, Michael Levitt has a Nobel Prize and I&#x27;ve publicly criticized him when I was convinced he was utterly wrong: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;raphlinus&#x2F;status&#x2F;1297182969514270721" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;raphlinus&#x2F;status&#x2F;1297182969514270721</a><p>The mask issue was a debacle from a scientific communications point of view. In the early days, there was legitimate debate among scientists regarding the value of masks. But I think the main thing that went wrong was a paternalistic attitude, trying to address supply chain issues of N95 mask usage by medical and other frontline workers by convincing people that masks weren&#x27;t effective. That, I think most agree, was a huge mistake.<p>Of course, your actual statement that highly regarded virologists tweeting that masks were &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;couldn&#x27;t be effective&quot; is false, and you probably know that.')
