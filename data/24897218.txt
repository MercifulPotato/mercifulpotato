I currently maintain 2 repositories, 20k and 60k LOC, and I consider both applications fairly small as it&#x27;s super easy to cruise its modules&#x2F;files. In my books, a large system is probably around 500k LOC and I&#x27;m curious how that&#x27;d work with Go. It&#x27;s all about project structure and organization of packages. A single file with 3k LOC is most likely unmanageable. 20 files with 150 LOC each is also not much helpful. However, 5 files with 600 LOC each is a much more balanced split. You are not getting lost in files and each file is of reasonable size. Obviously, it&#x27;s not always possible and highly depends on application specifics, but I&#x27;m just trying to make a point. One should always strive for a project structure that doesn&#x27;t require too much of a brain juice to comprehend the structure. Otherwise it&#x27;s possible to get lost in 2-3k LOC regardless of a programming language.')
