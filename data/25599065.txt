Rather, it was incredible to see the entire financial industry quickly rebuilt on top of sound money.<p>I agree that small transactions and mining can be (and are being) improved, but not for the same reasons. It&#x27;s silly to blame bitcoin for government corruption and people taking advantage of government subsidies. Bitcoin is simply doing what was always done more efficiently.<p>I would expect that an individual like Bear would be more in tune with what bitcoin was trying to accomplish.')
