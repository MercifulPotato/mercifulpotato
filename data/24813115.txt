An example where this might be useful is the dialogue in Twain&#x27;s novels, where he would often try to capture the particulars of his characters dialects.<p>But for most writing the goal is to share meaning, not voice. What would we do for a word like `data`, which has at least 5 different pronunciations that I&#x27;ve heard. Accepting all of them would probably lead to the opposite of the goal. Picking one leads to the same controversy.<p>Add to that people often aren&#x27;t aware of their own pronunciation. Personal example is that in my dialect I have the fool&#x2F;full merger. I wasn&#x27;t aware of this, I simply heard the language other people spoke as I pronounced it. At university I literally didn&#x27;t believe people who were telling me that they pronounce those words differently. I just couldn&#x27;t hear it.')
