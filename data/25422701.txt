It would be the case if there was some deterministic abbreviation from URL namespace qualifiers down to namespace prefixes, but there is not; instead, they are template variables, which can be shuffled throughout an XML document, requiring security software to constantly and reliably keep track of the value of the variable at multiple points. People sign URLs and JSON documents all the time with schemes that don&#x27;t have this goofy property.<p>There&#x27;s a similar problem with XML entity references, which have been happily breaking enterprise security for over a decade, because nobody has a good mental model of how entities in XML documents actually behave.<p>It seems fair at this point to blame the standard.')
