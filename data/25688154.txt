Losses were well into six figures, without taking into account the opportunity costs of working a regular software developer job. Which is what I&#x27;m doing now, and am very happy. There is no way I would ever do it again.<p>The list of lessons learned is very long, much of it having to do with sunk cost fallacies and the &quot;winners never quit&quot; theory.  I was able to keep at it so long because I had a lot of money saved up. &quot;Fail fast&quot; would obviously have been smarter, but I believed in the idea. (Still do, sorta, though the world went in a very different direction, high flexibility rather than high data quality.)<p>I have never been good at selling things. I made a million mistakes, but the main lesson learned is &quot;just don&#x27;t&quot;. Trying and failing leaves scars that &quot;fail fast&quot; doesn&#x27;t take into account, and I&#x27;m less resilient than I had been.')
