Maybe not immediately - though it&#x27;s a complex questions, with assumptions and counterarguments, but not clearly leading to your conclusion.<p>We also see that modern state - where laws are complex and judges have leeway to interpret them how they present-intently want, has drawbacks. That&#x27;s the problem which we face - and want to fix. How&#x27;s your problems bigger than this one?<p>&gt; We need the human here to disambiguate and match against statement and then intent. And adding political necessities to that process hurts it.<p>We somehow don&#x27;t have mechanism to ensure the intent of a judge is as we expect it to be. Sometimes honestly - I can imagine e.g. a conservative judge who really never imagined a marriage for couple of the same gender (not a very good example, sorry).')
