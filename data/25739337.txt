Game over.<p>MSM, including Facebook and Twitter, empowered this monster and profited from it. This joke of a candidate was propped up and put front and centre instead of being ignored. They fed the Troll and moments before he turns to stone, they take credit for cutting him off.<p>The final straw for me was in 2016 when he was nominated. I deleted all social media and actively avoided US news--even then I&#x27;d hear conversations about it everywhere--even outside of the US.<p>Good luck America, you&#x27;ll need it.')
