A business has tangible roots in a community and can generate revenue when there&#x27;s a monetary collapse, which is much easier for someone to trust if they haven&#x27;t grown up in a stable economy. My old country doesn&#x27;t even have 30 year mortgages, for example. If it did, mortgages expiring now would have been signed right as the iron curtain was coming down, which drastically changed the Eastern bloc&#x27;s financial systems almost over night.')
