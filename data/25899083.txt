He is highly intelligent, has an incredible work ethic and is a very kind and considerate person.<p>He went to prison for 6 months for a minor financial crime, something that was very out of character for him. The judge did not wish to send him to prison (she said that in court) but the prosecutor insisted that the prosecution would appeal any non-custodial sentence. So the judge gave him the minimum 6 months. That custodial sentence ruined my father&#x27;s life, made him basically unemployable, despite his brilliance and integrity, and ruined my family&#x27;s life too. Now my parents live in poverty and I have $23 in my bank account, with rent due tomorrow. I expect to be homeless by next week. Not a great situation for somebody with clinical depression.<p>Intelligent, good people can and do end up in prison and it can ruin lives (and not just the person behind bars, but also the people who love them). Good people do sometimes make terrible mistakes. My experience of this taught me so much. The really hard way.<p>For anyone who has a family member in prison, or has a similar story to mine, I feel for you.')
