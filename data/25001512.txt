Jailbraking alters the firmware making a jailbroken iPhone different from from a mint one.<p>I did not know about that one but I did know of AppValey and others that work based on enterprise certificates. I am not sure what prevents Epic from using this method to create an alternative store or why Apple does not claim that if you want you can have alternative stores on iOS therefore there is no antithrust issue.<p>Of course AppValey and the like require installing a root certificate.<p>Also, none of this allows you to unlock the bootloader.')
