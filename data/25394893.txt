VAT. for something that reviews told me would be quicker than my MBP.<p>I&#x27;ve been blown away at how much faster&#x2F;snappier it feels in day to day use compared to my 2018 16GB MBP. With the COVID situation I&#x27;m seated at my home office 95% of time now, rather than ~35%.<p>One of the biggest changes has been that instead of having a jet engine level of noise next to me most of the day now, I have something that I haven&#x27;t heard a noise from once in three or four days. It takes up way less desk space as well. It&#x27;s much easier to tuck away somewhere than a laptop which you always have an emotional connection to needing portability with. I&#x27;ve had Photoshop, Illustrator, Media Encoder running encodes, After Effects, loads of web tabs open and it still feels cold to touch. More desk space, faster, less noise, less heat. It&#x27;s ticked all those boxes.')
