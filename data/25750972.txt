Item(by='munk-a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610475414, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25750736, text='&gt; <i>something</i> must be driving this phenomenon<p>I think that thing is the shift from being anti-science from being uninformed and ignorant to being anti-science being praise worthy since &quot;You can like see through all the BS man&quot;.  There was once a time when facts and the act of gaining knowledge were really highly praised by Americans but that has shifted.  IMO, one of the highest praised virtues today is that of grifting, if you&#x27;re a scientist and smart then whatever - but if you&#x27;re an idiot and manage to trick people into thinking you&#x27;re a smart dude then all praise to you.  You beat the system, you&#x27;re playing 4D chess!<p>I <i>think</i> (again heavily into my opinion) that this shift occurred because politics shifted to a point where politicians were incentivized to support policies that were actively harming their constituents - discovering that lead was unhealthy and all of the other side effects of pollutants - put a lot of money into the anti-science campaign and let the demonization of intellect flourish.')
