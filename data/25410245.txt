And people are not really evaluating things rationally.  For example, in the beginning those types of programming languages were completely infeasible to implement due to hardware constraints. So people were not used to them. That created a type of prejudice.<p>Another example. Look at CISC versus RISC.  When the context is raw machine code or assembly language, you absolutely want more complex instructions because otherwise programmers are going to a competitor that provides them.<p>But then when you have high-level languages that part of the equation changes and reducing instructions gives other advantages.<p>Neural networks might be another example of an advance that was shunned initially.')
