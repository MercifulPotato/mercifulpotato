The end result is that a lot people who shouldn&#x27;t have gotten a financed phone in the first place will get their phones locked instead of simply getting a cheaper phone.<p>Making financing more accessible to risky customers means more repossession. The repossession rate is simply a matter of company policy and not a matter of personal responsibility.<p>The economic downsides of people having their phones locked will far exceed the benefits of being able to buy a slightly better phone.')
