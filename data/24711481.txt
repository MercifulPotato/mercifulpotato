If you do a lot of interviewing, you&#x27;ll find there&#x27;s many people who have been working for years, basically ripping off employers, and in many ways they&#x27;re unaware of their shortcomings.<p>The saddest cases are when you have someone with some seniority, smart and some potential, but they grew up alone (to put it somehow). Either without a mentor (where they&#x27;re smart but work in a vacuum) or with a bad mentor and picked enough bad habits to make them dangerous.<p>They have so many things to unlearn, that you should hire them for a much junior position than their resume experience would indicate. In general that&#x27;s a no hire situation, it&#x27;s much better to hire inexperienced developers and just train them properly.')
