I think it&#x27;s a perfectly valid reason to &quot;snitch&quot; if the driver was truly at fault.<p>The driver is always truly at fault in the current legal environment.  A driver can&#x27;t just blame it on the car to escape liability.  The comments here talking about the legal ramifications for these tags are misguided.  For these tags to matter, there would need to be legislative changes to shift the liability to the autonomous system and that would likely only happen once we reach at least level 4 autonomy.  Plus once we get to that point, whether the driver is paying attention or not shouldn&#x27;t matter anyway.')
