(Needless to say, apps depending on the accelerometer, selfie cam, etc. for major functionality would not work.)<p>This is already the case with the latest generation of Macs. No speculation necessary. It&#x27;s possible and has been done. Also Chromebooks can run Android apps.<p>What remains to be seen is when (not if) Windows would mimic what Apple did, as they have been doing for the past decades. I suppose the easiest way would be to run Android (and Google Play) on WSL. Android and Google Play can run on x86â€“no need for emulation. How clunky this turns out is how willing MS and Google are to work together.<p>In the end there will just be two platforms you would have to support as a GUI applications developer: iOS and Android.')
