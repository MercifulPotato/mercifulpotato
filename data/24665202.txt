Some OSes (Debian comes to mind) explicitly acknowledge this.<p>Increasingly it&#x27;s simply a naive and unjustified belief.  Applications must be considered as untrusted necessary evils.  Allocating them a minimum level of access is prudent.<p>Flatpak promises this, but fails to deliver.<p>Package managers offer this by convention, but rely on users (and security researchers) discovering and reporting malicious behaviour.  Mitigation is retroactive:  fixed behaviours or packages removed from the distro&#x27;s repository, but the damage is done and existing deployments remain.<p>The underlying issue is one of packaging, updating, and distributing sandboxed apps.<p>And in recognising that packaging systems serve users, not developers.')
