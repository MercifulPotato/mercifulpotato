The blame for the whole thing is definitely on news sources not fact checking the credibility of their sources (come on seriously a random twitter account?).<p>Under a reasonable system, this person should be interviewed to see what their connection to Seth Rich was and possibly what their initial motive was for forging and publishing what they had.<p>Having said this, I do see some issues down the line around how this unmasking could be abused. Someone might post something they think is trivial and a parody but could have dire consequences based on a chain reaction of events that happen.')
