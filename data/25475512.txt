Makes more sense to how the the possible &quot;design&quot; space for novel proteins could be limited. Designing novel active sites could be especially tricky, more than it&#x27;d seem at first glance. A folded structure that&#x27;d effectively transfer electrons from one target species to another in a catalyzer protein could likely be outside the explored &quot;vocabulary&quot; of extant proteins as it&#x27;d require specialized pathways and precise positioning. Chlorophyll is pretty unchanged in evolution as I understand it.Thanks, interesting background! I&#x27;ll keep an eye out for the <i>de novo</i> design algorithms.')
