Item(by='remus', descendants=None, kids=[25455019], score=None, time=1608194502, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25442157, text='&gt; Can the company simply cut you off then?<p>Yes. They&#x27;re offering you the service under a particular set of terms. If you don&#x27;t like those terms then the company is not obliged to adjust it&#x27;s terms to suit you (assuming the terms themselves are legal in the first place, for example they don&#x27;t break anti-discrimination law). In theory you could try negotiating the terms with the company to something that is more favourable for you, but as an individual you&#x27;re not going to have a lot of leverage to get a company like google to offer a service that&#x27;s specially tailored just for you! Negotiating is a lot more common in B2B services though, where you can have a lot more money on the table so it&#x27;s worth it for both parties.')
