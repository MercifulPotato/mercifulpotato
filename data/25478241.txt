I&#x27;m just wondering in what context or culture beer is considered free (gratis).<p>&gt; For example, they are used to distinguish freeware (software gratis) from free software (software libre). Richard Stallman summarised the difference in a slogan: &quot;Think free as in free speech, not free beer.&quot;<p>This is just repeating the phrase and doesn&#x27;t answer my question.<p>&gt; As the English adjective free does not distinguish between &quot;for free&quot; and &quot;liberty&quot;, the phrases &quot;free as in freedom of speech&quot; (libre, free software) and &quot;free as in free beer&quot; (gratis, freeware) were adopted. Many in the free software movement feel strongly about the freedom to use the software, make modifications, etc., whether or not this freely usable software is to be exchanged for money. Therefore, this distinction became important.<p>This article seems to only explain the distinction between &quot;libre&quot; and &quot;gratis&quot;, and treats the idea of beer being free as a given.<p>Is there a particular culture where &quot;free beer&quot; is a common phrase? Why not say &quot;free as in beer, not free as in lunch&quot;?')
