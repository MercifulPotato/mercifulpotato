The only problem is that I cannot really afford to live there.<p>I have some unresolved health issues and for many years have been working exclusively online because I could not handle commuting.  But for me it has not been easy to find high-paying programming jobs online.  There are just many more low-paying contracts and often I run out of money before I find a high-paying one which seems like it will have a workload that&#x27;s manageable for me.<p>So now so I have something which is totally fine in a way in that it&#x27;s about $2000 per month (to handle all of the programming and servers for an automated cryptocurrency trading system that seems to be going nowhere but has been a steady income for several years) and I have Thursday and Friday to work on my deep learning classes.  And I can easily manage to get by in Tijuana on that much.<p>But this kidnapping thing is terrifying.<p>Maybe Rosarito will be safer than Tijuana?  I mean my neighborhood here in Playas _seems_ very safe.  I would have to move to a ghetto or something in the US.  Which I would not really quite be able to afford.')
