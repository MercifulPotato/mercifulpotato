They had a hard time finding new software engineers to work as consultants.<p>So they got the idea, that they could hire other STEM Master&#x27;s and PhD&#x27;s, offer them an average software engineer salary and train them up to become good software engineers. Many software engineers scoffed at the idea - so you&#x27;re hiring people from Physics to do web apps - pfff, what do they know about creating software?<p>Well, I&#x27;d say a third of my coworkers at the time were from &quot;academia&quot; - I felt absolutely no difference. The company is thriving and they have more than quadrupled in size since I worked there five years ago.')
