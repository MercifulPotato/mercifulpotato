But its not Amazon’s fault.<p>I think this is precisely correct, and it&#x27;s really strange to me that a company developing innovative software would decide to apache license all of their work but I still feel for them.  I&#x27;m guessing that they wanted to build a thing and make some money off of it while mostly just contributing to moving tech forward and that&#x27;s a super noble goal... but that noble goal would have been much better served by using a license better tailored to OSS free use for non-commercial purposes and pursuing individual agreements for commercial use.<p>Then again, if it was launched with such stringent requirements would so many contributors have helped them develop into such a usable product?')
