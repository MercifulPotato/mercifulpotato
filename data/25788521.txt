The woman consciously and deliberately allocating her energy (spoons) is not the life of an addict. Addiction is generally a life lived unconsciously.<p>If I was going to put it into spoon terms, it’s that you start your day with 30 spoons. Everything you want to get done that day requires a total of 20. But, you still end up short because you spent most of your spoons on drinking&#x2F;blow&#x2F;porn&#x2F;games and in your moments of lucidity you just think “what the fuck”.')
