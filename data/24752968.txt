But I like how comver explains well some of the concepts. I expand with a few more:<p>- Is the release stable? Alpha, beta, experimental new features?<p>- Does the release have known vulnerabilities? How insecure is it? (of course, this changes as time passes and might stop being tracked, so it&#x27;s not easy to manage)<p>- Did a new release break back-compatibility? How much? Are we breaking everything, or just slightly changing the behavior of one function?<p>- Does the release include new important features or API changes?<p>- How often should I check for new releases, or how can I get notified if there are important unexpected changes?<p>To me, any non-toy software project needs to respond very clearly to all these questions. If it does, I don&#x27;t care about semver or not semver. If it doesn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t care about semver or not semver.')
