I don&#x27;t think peaceful protests can solve a problem that entrenched at all, but neither can foreign-incluenced Marxists<p>We know now that the National Guard should have been called out in downtown areas, and arsonists should have been shot. Many moved from city-to-city, burning as they went.<p>Regarding your comment about web site banners, it&#x27;s likely that when the Marxists started to burn downtowns, companies wondered what exactly they were supporting. They got a clue well ahead of the Democrats - it took Pelosi 2 months to denounce the riots, which really meant the party supported it.<p>You can learn more about the CCP involvement by watching recent Youtube NTD&#x2F;Epoch Times channel videos. They have experienced China-watch reporters on staff researching CCP inroads into the US.')
