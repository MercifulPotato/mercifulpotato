Commercial systems are generally 20-24 bits and have resolution in the 10-20 <i>micro</i>radians range...100-1000 times more precise than we need.<p>But ultimately the control system has nothing more than input voltage to the galvanometers to steer them, and depending on the source of inaccuracy they may or may not be able to overcome it.')
