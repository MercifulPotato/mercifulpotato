Yes, the US was incredibly stupid and had a big hand (the biggest) in its own downfall. No, that doesn&#x27;t mean China&#x27;s hands are clean in the matter. Ultimately, politics are amoral and it doesn&#x27;t matter, but to the extent that we&#x27;re interested in making purely academic moral distinctions there&#x27;s no need to whitewash China&#x27;s actions. They did us dirty, and if we have the option to do them dirty back, we should take it without the slightest sliver of shame or guilt. Politics is amoral.<p>In any case, we absolutely <i>should not</i> let our natural inclinations towards an underdog story cloud our judgement. China isn&#x27;t an underdog anymore.')
