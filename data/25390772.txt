As I said at the time, if anyone can find an example of a story from those accounts making the HN front page, I&#x27;d like to hear about it at hn@ycombinator.com; examples of cases we missed are hugely helpful in plugging holes. But certainly the vast majority of their efforts went nowhere.<p>People try every day to plant stuff on HN&#x27;s front page, and every day our anti-abuse systems catch such efforts and apply different types of counter-action depending on the case. I&#x27;m not saying no one gets away with it (obviously we can&#x27;t know that) but I can say for sure that anyone getting away with it would have to be way smarter than that group.<p>In case anyone&#x27;s interested, it happens that I&#x27;ve been working for the last few weeks on a new type of anti-abuse system, which is designed to more tightly enforce this site guideline: &quot;<i>Please don&#x27;t use HN primarily for promotion.
