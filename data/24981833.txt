For example: the government paid ISPs $400 billion dollars (!) to create a nationwide fiber network, and the ISPs pocketed the money and didn&#x27;t do it. No investigation into what happened or anything. The money is just gone. Clearly corruption is the only explanation. Politicians have been bought.<p>Why voters don&#x27;t know&#x2F;care is another issue, but it might have something to do with the fact that the news media has also been bought.')
