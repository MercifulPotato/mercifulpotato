Free to use for a single user, and I&#x27;ve tried it out on Raspberry Pi, Linux x86_64, Windows and Android. Seems to work well, except there appears to be some issue with accessing Windows via the secure IP (neither ping nor Remote Desktop appear to get through the Windows firewall, despite having a specific firewall rule for Tailscale) [2]. Can SSH into e.g. Linux hosts using PuTTY from Windows without issues.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailscale.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailscale.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tailscale&#x2F;tailscale&#x2F;issues&#x2F;854" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tailscale&#x2F;tailscale&#x2F;issues&#x2F;854</a>')
