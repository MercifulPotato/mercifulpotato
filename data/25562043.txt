Through an economist&#x27;s lens efficient trade and alignment of incentives are fundamental and governments exist only incidentally to ensure those.  There are various schools of economics that suggest limiting government&#x27;s role <i>only</i> to the enforcement of private property rights and kneecapping its ability to do anything else.<p>It&#x27;s much like how to a physicist, vectors are real objects that live in the abstract concept of a vector space, while to a mathematician vector spaces are fundamental axioms and the existence of vectors is just a consequence that falls out of these axioms.')
