That doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m not &quot;innocent&quot;. This is not a fringe concept: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nothing_to_hide_argument" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nothing_to_hide_argument</a><p>Yes, I agree we should have secure private messengers. But that has nothing to do with this discussion. First off, email is not a secure private messenger. Second, email would not become &quot;more secure&quot; by removing the accidental, partial non-repudiation that DKIM provides. Third, this comment chain that you are replying in right now, is about whether there exists <i>any</i> legitimate need for a third party to authenticate emails with DKIM after the emails have been sent. tptacek claimed that no such legitimate need exists. I&#x27;ve been arguing against this with a specific counter-example.')
