I can&#x27;t even fathom using WhatsApp for any kind of serious communication because of how inconvenient and unreliable it is. &quot;Can&#x27;t download media, please ask them to send again&quot;, my ass. What kind of engineering does even lead to this?! And the fact that I have to use my phone while sitting in front of a computer is a non-starter. The web version still uses the phone and occasionally wipes itself completely so you have to set it up again.')
