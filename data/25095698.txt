The bitterness comes from Evan deciding to make backwards breaking changes to the new version of the language and forcing you to spend days to update your code base.<p>It’s been so long that I don’t even remember what the changes were and can’t bother going back and look.<p>One example that stuck in my mind is when he decided that users should not be allowed to use the prime(‘) character in variables name.<p>It was not because that this character was now used in some other way. It was just him deciding he didn’t like that in variable names, so he not only forced it to the language codebase but to all the users as well.<p>Of course this was easy to change but gives you an idea. The rest of the changes where in the same spirit but much more difficult to change.<p>So it has nothing to do with small vs popular language. Imagine if Stroustrup had come out and said that since C+11 variable names would be case insensitive and operator overloading was forbidden.')
