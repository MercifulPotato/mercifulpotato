They get activated when you look at it the wrong way and sometimes not even that is necessary.<p>Good alarm is something unique. You need something that the thief sees for the first time and not something that is mass produced and installed in millions of cars. When a thief sees something for the first time, they are going to pass for an easier target that is not going to surprise them.<p>I have a plaque on my driver side door. It says &quot;I am electronics engineer and I designed the alarm myself.&quot;')
