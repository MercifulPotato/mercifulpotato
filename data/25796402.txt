I think it&#x27;s perfectly fair to question just how much value police (and other &quot;non-productives&quot;) are actually producing and a lot of businesses could do with trimming a bit of labour out of middle management - but there are reasons these jobs exist and they can add a lot to team and societal productivity.<p>1. I don&#x27;t ascribe to theories on anarchist utopias where if everyone <i>can</i> kill everyone else no one does out of politeness, I&#x27;ve played Rust.')
