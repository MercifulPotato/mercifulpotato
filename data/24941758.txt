The law is not purely mathematical and algorithmic. I think a good example that moves outside of IP law is murder vs manslaughter. Two identical killings could fall under different charges simply due to what the killer was thinking at the time. And we want it that way. It would be unfair and not accomplish anything good to treat an accidental and an intentional killer the same way.')
