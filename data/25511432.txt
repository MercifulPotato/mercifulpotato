In said book the author posits that the Spaniards were mostly outnumbered and resorted to &quot;theatrical violence&quot; as a way to exert control over the population and turn them into a compliant labor force.<p>That still makes them pretty bad though, even if there is a somewhat rational reason to be bad.
