As often as the rich get caught in tax dodges, much of the &#x27;currency&#x27; that flows is only loosely denominated in dollars.

As a board member, I&#x27;d use my success to hire or partner with anybody I had the slightest positive feeling for, until there is just enough money left over that I don&#x27;t have the biggest target painted on my forehead.')
