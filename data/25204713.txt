That said, can we avoid this type of comment on HN? All kinds of geeks out there find things outside the norm interesting and I&#x27;m sure some community is interested in this type of hardware.<p>Shaming and insulting people who are interested in things you find impractical doesn&#x27;t really fit with the spirit of HN, IMO.<p>EDIT to refer to guidelines:<p>&quot;Be kind. Don&#x27;t be snarky. Have curious conversation; don&#x27;t cross-examine. Please don&#x27;t fulminate. Please don&#x27;t sneer, including at the rest of the community.&quot;')
