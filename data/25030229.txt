We had more luck with the phones in hotel&#x2F;museum foyers as they were usually not updated as often. I remember hanging out at the skate ramp near the Rijksmuseum and taking it in turns running over to the payphone near the entrance to try the latest tricks someone had passed on. Then a friend&#x27;s dad got an internet connection and it changed our lives forever.')
