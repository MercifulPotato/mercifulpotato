Wikipedia&#x27;s biggest SEO factor has to be the massive amount of backlinks it gets. Those are purely organic and happen simply because it is generally the best authority on most any topic. It&#x27;s more of a testament to how genuinely good Google&#x27;s algorithm has become rather than some masterplan by Wikipedia.')
