Item(by='loup-vaillant', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610203702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25695593, text='The beauty with DH based schemes like Noise is that when Alice sends a message to Bob, Bob doesn&#x27;t quite get a cryptographic proof that Alice sent a message. Bob gets a cryptographic proof that Alice <i>or Bob</i> sent a message. Bob only know it came from Alice because he did not send the message to himself.<p>He could have, though. So he can&#x27;t (cryptographically) prove to the rest of the world that the embarrassing message really came from Alice. At best, he can prove that the message came from [Alice or Bob], but he&#x27;ll have to disclose his private key to do it. But as soon as he discloses his own key, <i>anyone</i> can forge messages to him.<p><i>(Note: it is possible, still without using signatures, to make sure Bob is not fooled by forged messages from the outside even if his key was leaked: he only have to provide a freshly generated ephemeral key pair into the mix, which necessarily hasn&#x27;t leaked yet. This provides what we call Key Compromise Impersonation resistance, so we can&#x27;t force Matrix goggles on him just be cause we stole his key. Unfortunately, this requires Bob to provide that ephemeral key, and that only really works with online protocols. On a PGP-like system, this means that we have to chose between deniability or KCI resistance: if you use signatures, you lose deniability, and if you use only DH, you lose KCI resistance. My personal opinion is that one should be responsible for their own keys. Therefore, I&#x27;d sacrifice KCI resistance before I sacrifice deniability.</i>')
