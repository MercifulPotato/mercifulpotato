Item(by='shlant', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603520115, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24875363, text='make no mistake - Bali is a very cool and magical place - but in terms of infrastructure and long term comfort, it&#x27;s definitely lower on  the list for us personally.<p>Most accommodations (especially in Ubud) are of the &quot;open air villa&quot; variety - they look pretty but aren&#x27;t the most comfortable and are vulnerable to weather, insects and rats. Power outages and water pump issues are also fairly common. On top of that, if you were to catch COVID in Indonesia (but especially Bali), the hospitals are not really something you want to have to rely on. Lastly, as a &quot;digital nomad&quot; (cringey  term, but descriptive) dealing with hardware issues on Bali is expensive and something like Apple Care has multi-month waiting times.<p>In comparison, Penang is much more modern. Newer apartment buildings with high vacancy rates and lower rent, better grocery stores, better product availability. It&#x27;s also has some of the best medical care in the world (number 1 from 2019 retirement index). On top of that, you have easy access to lots of hiking, beaches, parks, and world-class food (including arguably the best durian in the world).<p>We have been going to both almost every year for the last  5  years, but Penang is definitely a better long-term option for us and Bali is more of a vacation.')
