I was objecting to the claims “super computers can&#x27;t even compete with the intelligence of an ant”, which is false, since the impressive behaviours an ant displays are not learned, and the learned aspects aren&#x27;t competitive with what computers can do, and that “[the] way we do AI can never achieve that, since it always relies on human intelligence to decide all of those things”, which is also false, because online learning research exists and works, if imperfectly.')
