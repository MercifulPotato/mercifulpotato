So you would let all media companies censor someone &quot;because they don&#x27;t like him&quot;?<p>The only reason you trust private media companies is because they are supposed to be as neutral as possible, not political.\nIf not neutral, then perhaps society should start treating them for what they really are - private political machines.<p>Furthermore censorship is stupid.
