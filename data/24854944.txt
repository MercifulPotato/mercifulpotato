We have deep respect for the German language and for other languages, but HN is an English-language site;<p>(2) we&#x27;ve gotten complaints about this title being misleading and&#x2F;or completely wrong.<p>I&#x27;ve edited the title now in an attempt to be more accurate. (Submitted title was &quot;Germany&#x27;s Bundeskabinett approves draft law allowing WhatsApp&#x2F;Messenger backdoor&quot;.) If there&#x27;s a more accurate and neutral title we can change it again.')
