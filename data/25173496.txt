I&#x27;d say it is a stretch to argue that Germany was to blame for WW1 (post-WW1 Germany was forced to take the blame but the reality was a lot more complex).<p>You can then also argue about the context&#x2F;contribution the harsh treaty of Versailles made to WW2. But to <i>not</i> blame principally Germany&#x2F;NSDAP&#x2F;Hitler for WW2 after Germany marched into Poland is pretty absurd.')
