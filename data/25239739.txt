One of the lectures describes basic logic gates so one doesn’t go from that to reorder buffers in a single quarter.<p>I think the Weste text book is an excellent introduction to the reality of (mostly) modern digital VLSI design.  My only gripe is it’s weak on analog, which is my forte.  For An introduction to the reality of that I think Baker’s text at cmosedu.com is better.<p>Basically, if you have interest in the subject buying a used copy of Weste is not likely to disappoint.  Or perhaps see if your local library can snag a copy before you buy.')
