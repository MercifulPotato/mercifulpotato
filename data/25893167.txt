That means fewer people will die, and people will return to restaurants, stores, and offices sooner.<p>Even if they were wrong (I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s true), that is still a  judgment call that is well within a state&#x27;s right to make as long as it has a rational basis, taking into account the situation on the ground.<p>The same is true if they weighed the risk of 10% of the restaurants violating the rules and spreading the virus, and the difficulty of enforcement, against the economic and societal harms.<p>Your complaint would be better directed against the 10% of restaurant owners who refused to comply with the rules and ruined it for everyone else.<p>(In the LA case, by the way, it looks like the judge found that the county hadn&#x27;t weighed the risks and made a judgment, not that their judgment was incorrect. I understand that outcome was quickly stayed by the court of appeals.)')
