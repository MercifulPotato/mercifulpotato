Early TSCs weren&#x27;t frequency stable, but most (all?) now use some fixed frequency, something around the bus speed, and the most recent models even tell you what the frequency is. With that, you could have sub-microsecond timers, if your system isn&#x27;t too busy and&#x2F;or you have the right priorities set for preemption.')
