The end of WW2 saw the western powers and Soviet Union join in an alliance that thwarted the Nazi plans of a world empire where a master race (white folks) would be explicitly and morally entitled to enslave the rest of the world. Such an ideology is an anathema to liberal democracy and communists alike, and formed one basis of the alliance that crushed the Nazis. Only after the war and the common enemy was defeated did the split between liberal democracy and communism become the main conflict, and even then it rarely escalated to hot war.<p>BTW, to evaluate ideologies based on counting the dead in conflicts between powers, or on number of victims in famines that occur because of failed policies implies ideological and historical ignorance, despite the popularity of such blame games on social media. But it shows that people are getting fed up with all the killing at least.')
