The people who were &quot;harmed&quot; by this were folks who tried to use Robinhood to do ultra-short-term (seconds-level) trading in an attempt to capture micro-swings, and Robinhood is a terrible platform to do that (and, honestly, people who thought Robinhood was a good platform to do that kinda deserve what they got ;)<p>For normal investors &#x2F; traders &#x2F; gamblers, this shouldn&#x27;t make a difference.  The reality is that most micro-swings in a stock are indistinguishable from random noise, so if a price &quot;should&quot; have been $10.05 and you paid $10.07 on Robinhood, it&#x27;s just as likely that 5 seconds later you&#x27;re at $10.03 as you are $10.11.<p>So....<i>shrug</i>')
