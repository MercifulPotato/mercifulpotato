The holocaust&#x27;s occurrence could have been as false as the sun orbiting around the earth, but provided it&#x27;d be as sensitive as it now is, it would have been just as illegal.<p>Which is also why it&#x27;s in particular Germany that bans it â€” the holocaust is no more or less true in different places of course, but the denial thereof is far more sensitive in Germany.')
