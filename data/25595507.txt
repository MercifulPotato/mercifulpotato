But I started my first job when I was 13. When school was not in I worked 40 hours a week or longer and when school was in I still got 20+ hours. I was paid 4.15 a hour, and have had a w2 every except two. I am now nearly 39.<p>I assume thr problem is the wage? As long as it is on par with local wages I can&#x27;t find a issue with 14 year olds working.<p>Being able to work at age 13 was one of the single best things that allowed me to succeed, and move from what was surely doomed to be a poverty ridden life to making 6 figures by 30.<p>Much if my daily work life still uses skills and work ethic built from those days working long hours in thr hot sun picking up other people&#x27;s trash.')
