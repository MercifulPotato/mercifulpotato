The Snapdragon 888 seems to compete with the Apple A14. I wonder why there isn’t more comparisons between the A14 iPad Air and the M1 MacBook Air. Microsoft’s SQ2 chip for the Surface integrates a better GPU into a Qualcomm based SoC. Perhaps GPU performance is a key differentiator. I find it odd that the 2+4 big.LITTLE A14 isn’t trounced by the 4+4 big.LITTLE Qualcomm SoCs.<p>A dark horse, especially with respect to GPU, is Nvidia after their ARM acquisition. These are interesting times.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25251229" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25251229</a>')
