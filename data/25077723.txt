Simple tools that hide the magic are harder to build.<p>The fix is in because vscode itself will be forkable at any time. It will just be that _services_ from microsoft and other companies will be designed for the tool.<p>For example, this AI code completion behavior. I can say right now that if tabnine had a version working in Pycharm that did not break autoimports, I would already be paying a monthly subscription for it.  Jetbrains should be offering something similar ASAP.<p>Another example would be PaaS for frameworks using Azure. Start a project, choose a domain name, instant staging and production deployments.<p>Anyone could build these kinds of plugins to sell in services. It will really be about who does it best. Though, I think Microsoft is specifically positioning itself for a long term play here and I think much of it centers around vscode.')
