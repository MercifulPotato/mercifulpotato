But it&#x27;s possible that many such people poking around may still generate interesting leads.<p>Depending on how effectively intraoral scanners can scan things other than teeth, offering to scan random objects people send&#x2F;bring in, on a best-effort&#x2F;no-warranty basis, may also generate practical interest.<p>(Also, wow, looks like these things are in the $25k range?)')
