They don&#x27;t have to make people feel warm and fuzzy.  If there is a use case where a driver-less truck is slightly cheaper for equivalent results (or a lot cheaper for lesser results) they will get bought.  The competition in OTR trucking is brutal like that.  If the quarterly or annual operational cost comes out to be a tenth of a cent per mile lower than a dry van operated by a conventional steering wheel holder you can bet Swift, Schneider, Walmart, and anyone else with thousands of trucks will buy then for a portion of their fleets.  They kind of have to to hedge their bets at that point.')
