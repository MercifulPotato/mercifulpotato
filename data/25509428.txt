That&#x27;s not what the law actually says. It doesn&#x27;t mention &quot;platform&quot;.<p>The term used is &quot;digital transmission service&quot;, which is defined in terms of the <i>undefined term</i> &quot;service&quot;. Perhaps there is some established narrow legal definition of the term &quot;service&quot; that will keep this law from being abused? Let&#x27;s all hope so!')
