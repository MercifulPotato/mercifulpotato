Personally I like spelling colour, humour etc. with a &#x27;u&#x27;, pronouncing &#x27;z&#x27; like zed. Which standard do we use? I mean, British, American and Canadian English, to use three big ones, all use different spellings and pronounciations for different words. I personally, would not be happy having to standardize to either American or British English and I doubt Americans or British would be happy standardizing to the others.<p>And that&#x27;s not even getting into all the other English variations out there.')
