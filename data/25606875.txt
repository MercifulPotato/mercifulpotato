What a waste of energy on Apple&#x27;s part and a perfect grounds for a lawsuit. Apple approved this app with no problems and all of a sudden there is a problem where nothing has changed. Take them to court and dispute it. I assure you they will not be able to prove that this app violates the contract that was agreed to.<p>What I see here as complacency on peoples&#x27; part here is ridiculous. Companies and people never stop until they are tested. Apple would have never made a small business contract for the app store had it not been for Epic&#x27;s lawsuit.<p>There even a comment below where Apple had no issues featuring the app: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;story&#x2F;id1470456860" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;story&#x2F;id1470456860</a><p>This is winnable in court. Settle for Apple paying for the cost of re-brand and lawyers if they do not want to continue the dispute in court.')
