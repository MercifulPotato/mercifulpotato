The good North-South corridors in the VA&#x2F;NC area are going to be the Great Appalachian Valley (i.e., the I-81 corridor) or further east as far as the Fall Line (i.e., I-95 corridor). West Virginia doesn&#x27;t expand that far east, excepting the area around Martinsburg.<p>WV is a really crappy state to build any sort of hub in. Geographically, it&#x27;s dominated by a desiccated plateau: every watercourse carves a gorge, with the depth of gorge largely determined by how big the watercourse is. The population of WV is really spread out with no concentrated urban areas. The most concentrated regions are along the major river courses of the Ohio, Kanawha, and Monongahela Rivers, along with the population in the small sliver of the Great Appalachian Valley within its borders.<p>&gt; with a marketed Hyperloop speed (emphasis on marketed) of 670mph<p>That is the targeted top speed, AIUI. However, geography hits your butt hard here: it&#x27;s a simple consequence of physics that higher speeds make your engineering headaches grow more than linearly. Your curve radii grows quadratically with speed, and curve transition length is cubic. Trying to reach max speed in the environment of the Appalachian Plateau will be extremely expensive in terms of viaducts or tunneling, and making up the height difference between the Plateau and the valleys to the east is also going to be challenging.')
