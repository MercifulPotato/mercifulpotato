I&#x27;ve spent time in most of the U.S., minus Alaska and a few north eastern states, and some states have very distinct boundaries between city and rural atmosphere.  In some states, I found places I was not supposed to be and it was made abundantly clear to me.  There are some places that saying the wrong words or having the wrong beliefs can be incredibly dangerous.  The degree of difference varies from state to state and also seems to change based more heavily on latitude. Not sure I understand why it works out that way.')
