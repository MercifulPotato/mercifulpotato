When Israel bombed a heavy water facility in Iran, they did a press release that the Israelis did an unprofessional fly over in Iranian airspace and the Iran air force intercepted and chased the Israelis away... no, they bombed the facility and got out of there before the Iranians even understood what happened. Oh, and Israel had, I think one or two teams on ground. They got picked up and evaced just as fast as well. Iran doesn&#x27;t have the best history of telling the truth when it comes to their failures.')
