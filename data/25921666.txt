It was the one place that I would go and find almost everyone I knew, and if I posted something there, all of them would have access to it.<p>Similarly, I&#x27;ve tried migrating from Twitter to Mastodon. But no one I know uses it, so why bother?<p>I would pay for Facebook&#x2F;Twitter, but on the condition that other people are also paying. As soon as people start leaving, there&#x27;s no much point.')
