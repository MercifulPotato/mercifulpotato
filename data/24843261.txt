Or could it be those rose coloured glasses that HN tends to view Apple through.<p>Or more like &quot;users are literally brain dead and cannot be trusted to change the channels on their TV&quot; coloured glasses.  If you only trust your users to watch TV, then get into TVs instead of computers.<p>We don&#x27;t fault the maker of a drill when a careless user drills a hole in their hand.  We fault the user for being careless.  At what point do we start doing the same for computers?  The advantage of physical power-tools is that their mechanism of operation is readily apparent, open, understandable, predictable.  If Apple really cares about their users, they should start investing in making software open, understandable, predictable.  This is a much harder problem, and probably less profitable, than just building another TV, but I&#x27;d rather live in that world than this one.  I don&#x27;t need another TV.')
