And be low-carbon (~10gCO2&#x2F;kWh). Whereas the £40&#x2F;MWh estimate for wind included <i>gas</i> power generation, which is at 400gCO2&#x2F;kWh. Given how wind has a typical load factor of 20-30% max in Western Europe, you’d be using gas at best 70% of the time, meaning an average carbon intensity perhaps around 300gCO2&#x2F;kWh.<p>So for the same price (or even double that as a first step - nuclear costs decrease radically with lower risks perceived by investors), nuclear gets you &gt; 30x less carbon in the atmosphere than wind+gas. That is <i>not</i> insignificant.<p>&gt; they&#x27;re only used on such days, then the cost per Joule is even worse.<p>Nuclear isn’t like gas: it is fixed-costs infrastructure, meaning that the more you use it, cheaper it gets. So you want to use it as much as possible. (French nuclear plants oscillate between 75% and 90% load depending on maintenance schedules.) So on a windy day, nuclear load won’t typically change too much, but rather gas and coal usage will go down to let wind electricity match up with demand. This means nuclear gets you less emissions even in that case.')
