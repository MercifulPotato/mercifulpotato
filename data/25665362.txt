Item(by='ghostwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25665655], score=None, time=1609979924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25665107, text='&gt; Yes, there are criminal election offenses.<p>&gt; You filing a civil lawsuit has no role at all in that process.<p>You have two sets, one of them is criminal, another is not. How do you establish whether they are criminal or not prior starting the formal process in the court? There are wtinesses that need to be heard during the official process, and there&#x27;s warrants to be issued to bring additional evidence of a criminal offence, or perhaps there&#x27;s no criminal offence, but it has to be established during the initial hearings conducted at the court.<p>&gt; You donâ€™t have the ability to do so even then, because the warrant is issued to the police, not to you.<p>sure, that&#x27;s what I mean, the police and other authorities have to go there and bring (if it exists) an evidence to the court in addition to those that have been filed with the case. That&#x27;s not the job of the litigant prior submitting their case.')
