Even without seeing the original script next to it, it&#x27;s fun to try to reverse engineer what each text box is meant to mean. Surprisingly enough considering how supposedly sophisticated the machine translation is, a lot of these are the types of basic mistakes that you would expect from a beginner or a really bad computer translation.<p>I suspect they translated each text box separately, instead of joining multiple text boxes into one string - because I frequently get much better translations than this from deepl. Japanese is a language that is often difficult to understand without context, so the smaller the chunks of texts are the worse a computer will do.<p>Stuff like: \n&quot;Your brother is probably a man. Probably an adult.&quot; is just a bad translation of でしょう.<p>&quot;Put the bomb in the ring in his hand&quot; The second part is an overly literal translation of 手に入る, and the ring was probably called 爆弾の指輪 or something<p>”Very!&quot; is probably just 全く<p>etc<p>These are things any intermediate learner would know, and yet AI models still struggle with them.')
