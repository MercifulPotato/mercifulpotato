When I think about it now, it&#x27;s clear I&#x27;m really comparing these two states:<p>1. uBO defaults + uMatrix which is mostly in &quot;allow all mode&quot;<p>2. uBO in medium mode (as defined by the above video) w&#x2F;o uMatrix installed<p>I think (2) is safer than (1).  I&#x27;ve been in (1) mode pretty much since I started using uMatrix (2 years?).')
