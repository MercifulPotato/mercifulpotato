There has been a review of this content, a large organization that has a lot of reporters generating content. The NYT could have done a better job on this. Kudos for the NYT for admitting its mistake. It&#x27;s not the first, it won&#x27;t be the last.<p>I just have one problem with some of the commentary here - I&#x27;m willing to wager a sizable portion of the commenters on this board who are experiencing schadenfreude because they hate the NYT most likely get their news from a significantly less reputable news source that would never admit to making a mistake or perform a correction.<p>Maybe you hate the NYT because it&#x27;s too liberal and you listen&#x2F;watch&#x2F;read the WSJ or Fox News or Breitbart. Maybe it&#x27;s because you think the NYT isn&#x27;t &#x27;liberal&#x27; enough, and you read Jacobin or Common Dreams or watch MSNBC. This isn&#x27;t about your concern over adherence to the truth. Many of these comments is about your joy when you point a finger and laugh like Nelson from the Simpsons when the news source that doesn&#x27;t completely and consistently deliver the information that fits your exact and already hardened world view has anything that diminishes it&#x27;s credibility.<p>This is like Tucker Carlson and Glenn Greenwald accusing the media of covering up the Hunter Biden laptop story. Both want to destroy the same political contingent but for completely different reasons.<p>If you are holding the NYT to a standard that your own news source does not adhere to you are the problem.')
