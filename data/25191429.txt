Leaves more screen space for the video.<p>The reason I found them useless is that the suggestions were too specialised. I usually do not want to watch a dozen videos on the same topic. I usually want to watch one high quality video about it, then move on. Same with channels. I do not want to follow ten channels about each of my hobbies. One channel or two high quality ones is enough.<p>So, even though the linked project is super cool from a technical perspective, I am not sure how the algorithm could be improved to attend to my taste.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hakon.gylterud.net&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;youtube.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hakon.gylterud.net&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;youtube.html</a> (YouTube self-defence)')
