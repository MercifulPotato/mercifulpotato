I did not say any such thing.  I said that it could benefit &quot;society as a whole.&quot;  I highly doubt a capitalist society would adopt such a principle.  Nor did I say that any country spying on their own people was hypothetical.<p>If it is &quot;tiring&quot; to attempt to argue with me, it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t fall for your pathetic rhetorical attempts to inflame, and you don&#x27;t seem to be able to read what I said without making a straw man out of it.  Name calling does not constitute argumentation.  Do better, please, if you can.<p>BTW, I am a English native speaker.  I truly wish I could get a refund on my English language instruction, and instead have had the luxury of being born somewhere civilized.')
