Item(by='artjomb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610811085, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25793230, text='A part of my work tasks consists of reviewing answers to security questionnaires.<p>These are reasonable questions and I see quite a lot of value if they are filled out extensively and in a good faith approach. Most of the answers of usual security questionnaires can be deduced from the responses to this DSQ.<p>I really have a problem with Q6:<p>&gt; Have you had any security breaches in the last two years?<p>&gt; If yes: please explain the breach, and provide copies of any postmortem&#x2F;root cause analysis&#x2F;after-action reports.<p>Almost nobody will answer this truthfully. I see a couple of options: \n1. There was a breach and it was public, then why are you asking. Do your research!\n2. There was a breach and it was not made public. The company will likely not admit it to you.\n3. There was a breach but it was a) not relevant to your case&#x2F;b) internal&#x2F;c) the data lost was not customer data&#x2F;d) we forgot that there was&#x2F;etc.<p>While lying in case of 2. might make the vendor liable (IANAL) they might be able to argue that 3 was actually the case.')
