Because Influenza (unlike some other causes of &quot;flu&quot; symptoms) is most widespread in winter, each hemisphere uses data from the other&#x27;s winter to plan their seasonal vaccine. But this is like predicting the weather, even when you&#x27;ve had practice and are good at it on average, sometimes you miss badly.<p>If you either guess wrongly what to vaccinate against based on the data from the other hemisphere, or Influenza mutates significantly after your cut off date to evade your profile, the vaccine is much less effective than normal, and higher than normal rate of hospitalizations and deaths results.<p>Influenza is endemic, we never even wiped out the variant from the &quot;Spanish Flu&quot; pandemic last century, it&#x27;s still with us is an attenuated form.')
