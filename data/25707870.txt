I guess you&#x27;d need to rely on user reports to claim that but you&#x27;re definitely going to end up with false reports for sure.<p>On a side note, how could Parler ever operate if Trump pulled Section 230? Wouldn&#x27;t they instantly be considered culpable (as would every other company) for their users content? It seems like a lose-lose threat.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MNIxatQ0fKU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MNIxatQ0fKU</a>')
