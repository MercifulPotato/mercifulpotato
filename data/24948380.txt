Older dictionaries and encyclopedias very clearly contradict the newer ones on the left-right measure of fascism and Nazis.<p>So, correcting for the projection:<p>&quot;I understand that it is appealing to try to dilute the meaning of &quot;fascism&quot; by applying it overly broadly until it loses its meaing. Whataboutism is also convenient way for the Left to distance themselves from the evils committed by the left-wing Nazis and other far-left fascist groups.&quot;<p>The facts don&#x27;t change just because some people want to fling a dehumanizing insult.')
