There&#x27;s a few parts that seem to extrapolate too far, or view everything from a pre-determined lens of race to chose their narrative.<p>One example is the claim that the U.S.&#x27;s lack of universal healthcare is the result of racism. The project goes on to detail how the Freedman&#x27;s Bureau (which provided healthcare to former slaves) was prematurely closed, making the case it was because &quot;legislators argued that free assistance of any kind would breed dependence and that when it came to black infirmity, hard labor was a better salve than white medicine.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sure there were legislators that took that view, but other sources point out the organization was only intended to last for one year after the Civil War. When an extension was proposed, the main objections were that it was too expensive and would infringe on States rights. (Unironically, some of the same arguments used today).<p>Race is certainly part of the fabric of the nation&#x27;s history and colors many of the problems faced, but I&#x27;m not sure race can be used as the root cause of every malaise as the project seems to allude.')
