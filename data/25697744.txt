There was a lone sun workstation that printed some of the shipping docs in latex.  I believe that was left by Paul Barton Davis.  By early 97, the website (Netscape) and database (Oracle) ran on DEC Alpha hardware.  Peter is wrong about switching to Digital Unix because Sun had bad support.  The switch happened for 64bit reasons.<p>There was almost a 24 hour outage of amazon.com because Digital Unix&#x27;s AdvFS kept eating the oracle db files.  Lots of crappy operating systems in the those days.')
