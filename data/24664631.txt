Most people don&#x27;t realize what&#x27;s going on, and of those that do, most of them are profiting by it.  The few that see what&#x27;s happening clearly and don&#x27;t like it are a tiny minority with (relatively) no money.<p>To answer your question, I think people have much less agency than we think we do.  Our brains run the show, not our minds.  It would take so much energy to <i>do something</i> about e.g. surveillance capitalism that the brain settles on a useful illusion (agency) and ignores the data that would require energy expenditure for dubious returns (most people in the panopticon are doing relatively well, eh?)<p>It&#x27;s not a very good answer, I know, but I have been convinced that there&#x27;s no deeper reason.  It&#x27;s caloric cheaper to be a good &quot;coppertop&quot; than to wake up and become &quot;Neo&quot;.  (Yes, a <i>Matrix</i> reference.  I am not ashamed.)')
