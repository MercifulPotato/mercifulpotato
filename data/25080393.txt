But if it can&#x27;t share the library ecosystem, it might as well be a different language for all practical purposes. And it turned out that there aren&#x27;t enough people who were interested in a Python&#x2F;.NET combo for its own sake, so it remained niche. Any new implementation of Python on top of .NET VM would likely get similar reception for all the same reasons.')
