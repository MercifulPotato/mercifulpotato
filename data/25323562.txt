(C5 level non-complete quadriplegia)<p>I miss my walks immensely. They used to put my mind at ease like nothing I have found since.<p>No point in this comment other than to express my envy towards those can enjoy such a hobby still , and to express a bit of loneliness and hard-to-reconcile personal emotions when told the benefits of walking.<p>I know, already! I wish I could!<p>I was very fit my entire life through very little additional effort other than nightly walks &amp; some lucky genetics -- although unfortunately those hobbies landed me into a net-negative position -- I suggest the hobby to anyone that has a few minutes to spare a day.<p>I hope that pedestrian safety and road design continues to improve.')
