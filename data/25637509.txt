I went the route of not paying more for hardware without RGB and am regretting it 6 months later. Disabling the RGB on my GPU persists across OS re-installs as well as driver updates, but my RAM and motherboard&#x27;s lights require their own program each constantly running in the background in order to NOT have a light show on at all times. Furthermore, when turning on the computer all of the lights are on in full rainbow until these programs launch and ultimately turn off the lights.<p>Because of the additional friction involved I do not agree with the just turn off rgb mentality many in the hobby push')
