That it is the Russian Zvevda module that is leaking&#x2F;cracking is likely related to the fact that it is also the oldest module in the ISS.<p>The ISS is&#x2F;was scheduled to be retired in 2024 (aka 3 years from now) but there are calls to keep it going. My fantasy would be to have SpaceX move it into the Lunar L1 Lagrange point which would keep it in use but it would have to deal with more cosmic rays, also station keeping would be an issue unless we could really get energized tether station keeping to work (lots of solar energy to provide power, but not a lot of mass to provide thrust, so tethers are energized conductors that push against the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field)<p>Parking it in L4 or L5 could keep it for future generations but it would be even more of a challenge to go visit.')
