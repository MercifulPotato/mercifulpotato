These assignments could be &quot;random&quot;, or chosen by Pi itself, or through some algorithm, or by hand by the composer.<p>The above doesn&#x27;t even touch on filtering or effects that could be applied... which themselves could be controlled and&#x2F;or assigned by digits of Pi.<p>There are an infinite number of ways you could represent any given sequence of numbers as sound, which are really only limited by the composer&#x27;s imagination.<p>So what does Pi <i>really</i> sound like?  It doesn&#x27;t sound like anything, or it sounds like anything, depending on what choices one makes.')
