Item(by='julianlam', descendants=None, kids=[25383981, 25385456], score=None, time=1607653648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376695, text='The HBC has been coasting on it&#x27;s reputation as &quot;Canada&#x27;s oldest corporation&quot; for too long.<p>The selection is poor, everything is overpriced, and store layouts haven&#x27;t changed since the 50s.<p>Remember that scene in Queen&#x27;s Gambit where Harmon buys a dress at the department store? That&#x27;s basically HBC except they&#x27;ve given HBC a new coat of paint and proclaimed it ready for the 21st century.<p>HBC was one of the prime places to do a wedding registry. They had nearly all the stereotypical registry items, but you had to go in and scan them. I tried using their online backend to add to a registry, and it is firmly stuck in the 90s, stopped working, and nobody bothered to fix it.<p>They do this weird thing where there are multiple counters scattered throughout the store, manned with helpful ladies to answer questions and ring out purchases, except they&#x27;re always unmanned, except one (on the other side of the store you&#x27;re standing in), and that one counter has 5 people in line, some who wish to do returns, which take extra time.<p>Their policy seems to be to sell their HBC card at every chance, and if someone decides to sign up, you will be stuck in line while they fill out the entire form. Remember, there&#x27;s only one till open, and because they ask about the card right before payment, the session cannot be put on hold, in order to ring someone else in.<p>When I worked at Zellers in 2005, they had an ancient text-based GUI for their POS. It&#x27;s fast if you know what you&#x27;re doing, but nobody at HBC seems to know how to use it. Oh, and HBC still uses this system in 2020. Want to see a piece of history? Check it out.<p>I can&#x27;t wait for HBC to die. It should&#x27;ve gone instead of Zellers. All this they&#x27;re doing to try and defer rent payments is just the death throes of a once great corporation that decided they had it all figured out, and that nothing ever needed to change.<p>There&#x27;s one nice thing about HBC, which is that they make nice mugs, I guess.')
