Xnm stopped having clear physical meaning when manufacturing moved to non-planar process.  TSMC already has 2 nm nodes in research and  sub-nm process research is next. sub-1 nm should be coming around 2025.<p>Best way to track progress is to follow MTr&#x2F;mm² Millions of transistors per square millimeter (it&#x27;s not exactly transistors but transistors and flip-flops with different weights) It tells us how many logical components tehre are per mm².')
