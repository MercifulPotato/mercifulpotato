That is a <i>big</i> barrier to getting more players or even larger maps (it used to be that ludakris size was unplayable before DE&#x2F;UserPatch optimizations). Given how many players can&#x27;t even clear the multiplayer performance benchmark without dramatically reducing quality settings, I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;ll bump up the player cap unless they decide to re-architect a good part of the engine internals.')
