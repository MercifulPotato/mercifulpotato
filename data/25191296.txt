Unless you&#x27;re super embedded in the Alexa ecosystem, you&#x27;re giving up... what, the bottom-of-the-barrel streaming services and some minor convenience&#x2F;savings when it comes to online shopping?<p>All but the most specialized products on Amazon can be found elsewhere. You&#x27;ll pay a few extra dollars for shipping and it might take a couple extra days to arrive. That&#x27;s about it. As a silver lining, you&#x27;ll probably get to use a slightly-less-terrible web interface. And frankly, if you&#x27;re habitually making full use of Prime, you may want to re-evaluate your shopping habits anyway.<p>I understand why Google and Apple and Microsoft are able to get away with what they do. It&#x27;s hard to ditch one and practically impossible to ditch all three. But Amazon? I just don&#x27;t get it at all.')
