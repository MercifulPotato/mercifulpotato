The RF design is supposedly more complex and advanced in Ruckus APs with advanced antennas and their proprietary BeamFlex technology... not just reference-design SoC stuff.<p>See this reply (and others in the topic) for some “insight”: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;networking&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9vj2dh&#x2F;comment&#x2F;e9l3lya" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;networking&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9vj2dh&#x2F;comment&#x2F;...</a><p>Also... since I’ve been looking at Ruckus APs recently (they offer several WiFi 6 APs) I learned that their APs have two part numbers with different prices. The &#x27;901&#x27; part numbers ship with Solo AP firmware that can run in either Standalone mode or will join a Ruckus ZoneDirector or SmartZone controller. The less expensive &#x27;9U1&#x27; part numbers ship with “Unleashed” code that will not connect to a ZD&#x2F;SZ controller, and instead look for a local Unleashed network. The price difference is due to support entitlements; controllers license number of APs per controller&#x2F;cluster, and Unleashed support is one license for up to 25 APs in the network. (Seems like most home users go with Unleashed. [1])<p>Also, one thing to note with some Ruckus APs (like those that support 802.11ax) are the PoE requirements. The RF power is reduced and&#x2F;or some features become unavailable depending on the power available. (It’s all listed on the AP data sheets, just need to be aware of it.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commscope.com&#x2F;product-type&#x2F;enterprise-networking&#x2F;wireless-access-points&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commscope.com&#x2F;product-type&#x2F;enterprise-networking...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commscope.com&#x2F;product-type&#x2F;enterprise-networking&#x2F;control-management&#x2F;controller-less&#x2F;controller-less&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commscope.com&#x2F;product-type&#x2F;enterprise-networking...</a>')
