From my understanding the debate was still on going; can I ask why you would prefer sweeteners over white sugar?<p>Edit: I love how you can’t ask a genuine health question here without being down voted. The sugar industry has spent decades brainwashing people and using fake science to push sugar. Even recently I thought there were a lot of concerns over sweeteners hence why I asked the question hoping to gain some insight as why that is not the case. I have always thought sweeteners were worse in many ways but I don’t have any thing backing that up. I was genuinely asking because I am now wondering if I have it wrong about sweeteners. Thank you to those who added some insight.')
