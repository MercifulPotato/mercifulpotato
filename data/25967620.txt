An irreverence, certainly. It is necessary to not operate within the intellectual framework of a field in order to revolutionize it. Incrementally modifying the framework is extremely difficult because there are usually networks of reinforcement of the current structure (or it wouldn’t be stable..) so a non-incremental “jump” is required to climb a different hill. This jump is mythologized as starting from scratch, though often times most of the weirdness goes away and only the essentially advantageous difference remains as the company or project matures.')
