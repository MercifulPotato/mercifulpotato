So yeah, surprising.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure how Georgia&#x27;s senate runoffs work.<p>&gt; The only reason this was under contention days after the election is that PA wasn&#x27;t able to start counting their mail in ballots until election day. This was a choice made by the PA legislature. I don&#x27;t know why. If PA was allowed to precanvas, PA would have announced like FL on election night and this would have been over Tuesday.<p>Well, maybe. PA still looks to be within 50k votes, and while it&#x27;s possible that precanvassing would have allowed the election to be called on Tuesday night, the policy of accepting votes postmarked up to election night even if they arrived late would still leave things potentially up for grabs. And there&#x27;s a LOT of close states this year. (And to answer &quot;why&quot;, I believe it&#x27;s to prevent vote counts from leaking before people actually go and vote)<p>The more general point that &quot;If there was a blue wave, we wouldn&#x27;t be worrying about states with margins of under 50k votes or talking about how control of the senate will be determined later&quot; still stands.')
