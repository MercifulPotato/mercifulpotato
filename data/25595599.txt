Is it fair that instead of shipping that feature you really want this month, you have to do accessibility features?  I don&#x27;t think the answer is black and white.<p>FWIW, accessibility seems hard.  I am not a good web dev, and the conversations that spin out from these accessibility conversations frequently go right over my head.  I can build a pretty basic React site, but I have no idea how to add accessibility components to that, or how I would test whether my site is accessible or not.<p>Part of this problem is probably lack of exposure.  I know what a screenreader is, but I don&#x27;t know how they work.  I don&#x27;t know what makes it easy to traverse a page with a screenreader and what makes it hard.  It would probably help  a lot if we forced devs to have experience with accessibility tools so they know they work.')
