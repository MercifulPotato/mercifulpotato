My main issue is I have a lot of decision power in this company (without being in a management role), and I know that I cannot just move to another company and do what they say. I want to have something truly mine.<p>I am going to create a mobile game. I already have friend who is a graphic designer (and a gamer). We are pretty excited about some ideas and mechanics we&#x27;ve been exploring. I don&#x27;t want to create &quot;yet another RPG&quot; that no one will play, but a &quot;simple&quot;, entertaining game with a well defined business model and a well defined market target that hopefully will have enough traction to generate income.
