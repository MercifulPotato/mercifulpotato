It&#x27;s not an either&#x2F;or scenario. For those people who desire E2EE by default, well let them use Signal in peace. For those people who desire the greater flexibility of infinite independent chat clients and a higher uptime, let them use Telegram in peace.<p>The Signal community took a wrong turn into if it&#x27;s not E2EE we hate it. There are people who should be using E2EE but it&#x27;s not everyone and to insist on this narrative is going to drive a lot more people away from Signal than it is going to recruit.')
