Item(by='vorpalhex', descendants=None, kids=[25354251], score=None, time=1607458825, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25347952, text='&gt; Is this a service you would use?<p>Yes! I already use a non-privacy centric service like this, and would very much like to swap it out.<p>&gt; Would you pay for it?<p>Yes. I&#x27;d be willing to pay $30&#x2F;year for quicker updates. Maybe have a freemium model of an update per 30 mins or 60 minutes, a middle tier of 5 minute accuracy (good enough for most users) and then a premium tier of ~30s accuracy. Maybe play around with the amount of people in a group too - it makes sense to charge more if you&#x27;re sharing with a small family versus a single friend.<p>As always with subscriptions, please make them have clear pricing, an option to pay annually (even if there&#x27;s no savings) and allow auto-renew to be opt-in instead of by default.<p>On the monetization front, you likely can leverage the same infrastructure for an Enterprise version of the app. What many companies want is a rough geofence app that can let them know when someone is abroad for work and give them location specific information - &quot;Oh hey, you&#x27;re near the Ohio office. The alarm code is XYZ, and your badge has been given temporary access for the next 3 days.&quot;<p>Especially if you can assure employees that they&#x27;re only giving rough location information to their employer (&quot;Mary is in Nevada&quot; and not &quot;Mary is at So-and-so brothel in Las Vegas&quot;) then it feels like an acceptable tradeoff of information and benefit.')
