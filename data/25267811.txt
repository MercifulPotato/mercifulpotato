Since that&#x27;s not particular to Erlang&#x27;s messaging model; that&#x27;s true in any system where you have a synchronization point that is being hit faster than it can execute. Seems weird to call that out as a notable problem, as such.<p>What&#x27;s unique to Erlang, and -could- be prevented (by limiting a process to a single receive block, and having a type system prevent sending any messages not in that receive block), if you wanted to change the model, is the fact I can send arbitrary messages to a process, that will never match on them, and because it&#x27;s a queue, will cause it to delay all following messages from being handled. Hence my focusing on that; yes, that&#x27;s a potential problem, no, it&#x27;s not a particularly likely one.')
