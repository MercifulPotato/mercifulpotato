But it&#x27;s not the problem we&#x27;ve been discussing in this thread, and I think it&#x27;s important to make clear distinctions between the issues. It&#x27;s common for people to leap from some other issue to &quot;astroturfing! shill! spy!&quot; explanations, instead of facing the original issue.<p>[1] Here&#x27;s why, if anyone wants an explanation.
