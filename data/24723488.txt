The argument has been made elsewhere in the thread but basically they have a real product with real usage &#x2F; data creating a positive data feedback loop that will lead to incremental improvements.  The question is whether it will improve along an asymptote far from full self driving (what most people believe) or some leap occurs in the future or some technology can be added to their capabilities to achieve full self driving at some point.  The latter is possible imo even if highly unlikely.<p>The fact remains they are out there, and you can buy them, and they can do some sort of self-driving.  Waymo is an impressive tech demo at this point.')
