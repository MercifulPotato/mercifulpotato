Nobody owes you any sources. If you choose to dismiss what someone else says (instead of researching it) that is totally fine, but they don’t owe you that.<p>If you respond to them by saying “citation needed” you’re not helping. Number one, your claim that a citation is needed might be wrong - they might not actually need to provide sources because their point is extremely widely proved already or is extremely easy to verify. Just because <i>you</i> think the claim needs evidence doesn’t make it so.<p>Number two, requesting a citation doesn’t refute what the other person said. It might be true. But because humans use various heuristics that are still rooted in tribal in-group or out-group thinking, it will be perceived like a “win” or like you “got them” and people will keep a mental tally, so the rhetorical effect actually <i>worsens</i> the quality of discourse.<p>When I see someone saying “citation needed” it immediately tells me (a) they are too lazy to research it for themselves, (b) they are too lazy to steelman the argument and engage it assuming it’s valid, (c) they are too lazy to produce their own counter-argument and (d) they want “credit” for “winning” the other side of the argument, but without actually contributing anything that answers whether the claim is true.<p>Of course, people posting tons of claims that don’t have evidence also come off badly - but the right thing to do is either ignore them, steelman their argument or provide a counter-argument. Pedantically demanding evidence is worse, even assuming that strong claims should have strong evidence. It harms discourse more.')
