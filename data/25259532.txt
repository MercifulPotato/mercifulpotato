Yes, they implemented it in a high power design, and yes, they did a great job, and it is really performing well, but all of this has been common in cell phone chips available from various vendors for over a decade.<p>Multiple cores, multiple DSPs, ISPs, GPUs, secure enclaves, encryption engines, high speed serial controllers, ADC&#x2F;DAC, plus all the stuff to support the cellular modem such as viterbi encoders&#x2F;decoders. All these little specialized blocks all embedded on the chip, and the DDR soldered directly to the top of it.<p>This has been a common technique for over a decade. Why isn&#x27;t your phone as fast as the M1? How long do you think the M1 would run on your cell phone battery? Everything is an engineering trade off.<p>So Apple basically took the last decade of smart phone architecture, and blew it up with more transistors, to accomplish more processing throughput.<p>They didn&#x27;t invent the technique of hybrid multi-core silicon by any stretch of the imagination.<p>You can go back to the mid 1990s and find single chip 56K dialup modems with a general purpose CPU, a DSP, onboard RAM, onboard NOR FLASH, and a half dozen dedicated modem hardware blocks, all on a single die.')
