I have about 5 different profiles, aliased to things like `chrome-work`, `chrome-personal`, `chrome-dev&#x27;, etc. I would love to use FF, but iirc FF doesn&#x27;t provide something like `firefox --profile=someIdentifier` that opens a new window in my desired profile.<p>edit: Apparently this is bad info.
