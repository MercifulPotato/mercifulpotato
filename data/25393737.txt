I don&#x27;t remember that being in there.<p>Clearly it isn&#x27;t and I believe in freedom of association completely too. If a business wants to not serve <i>anyone</i> for any reason, I recognize that - clearly law has developed to qualify this.<p>This notion of freedom of association has no bearing on my ability to criticize Youtube for doing something I find wrong.<p>I can simultaneously believe that what Youtube is doing is wrong and they&#x27;re completely allowed to do it.')
