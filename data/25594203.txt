I think this is true for most new stuff in any city. From Stockholm to Milan, from Melbourne to Tokyo. It’s the general money culture you’re addressing, not necessarily from SV.<p>I wish we would have uniqueness to the city. It’s becoming all a monoculture of Eames fake bar stools and Edison bulbs illuminating your exceptionally well crafted macchiato. This started in late 2000s actually. I was just in Kyoto before the pandemic and a lot of traditional old cafes are being replaced by the most hipster japanese shit I&#x27;ve ever. You know the old cafes that served 10cm thick toast, I specifically remember one by the Tajima (sic?) market when I used to travel there back in early 2000s.<p>Honestly, I want to preserve culture, but that&#x27;s &quot;too conservative&quot; and you get attacked for saying these things.')
