They caused an immense amount of work (more so than affecting revenue and costs; the premium quotas at least in Europe didn&#x27;t generate much revenue and the quotas were there more out of fear of excessive use).<p>A lot of adoption of Google services was driven by not having to worry about quotas. Making quotas a concern again will pave the way for people to start competing with them by offering cheaper storage in a way people have been unable to compete with them for years.')
