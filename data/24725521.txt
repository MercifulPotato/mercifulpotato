I don&#x27;t really have to build large systems, I work mainly with programs I&#x27;d describe as duct tape and wrenches. They&#x27;re small and one-off, and the main goals are to compose them quickly and arrive at a stable behavior that I can write solid tests for. With ocaml, I think the way I&#x27;d write a lot of programs I use python for is roughly the same way, just piping a bunch of crap together and then cramming it into a test harness, but with ocaml I can have type safety and speed and a higher level of footgun to do work with. For me. I do weird work.<p>If I was a more typical software guy, I&#x27;d be able to relate a lot more.')
