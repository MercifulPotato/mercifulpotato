Even if you earned an average 1% a week while short-term trading on $10K capital as bitcoin channels sideways or broadly down, that&#x27;d be an extra $400 a month for which you wouldn&#x27;t have to be working for anyone but yourself. On top of that, the experience and any unused funds can be applied forward for an acceleration of profits over time.<p>The practice is accessible and a lot of helpful technical trading lessons can be learned within a matter of weeks or months. It&#x27;s easier in many ways than the stock market, where a baroque layering of various conditions like deadlines, splits, earnings, and other variables must be figured into trading.<p>Always protect your capital, set stops, notifications, etc. but IMO there&#x27;s a lot of profit to be found if you have some amount of capital set aside, and it comes at no cost to you except as relates to your chosen risk threshold. (You can never lose what you don&#x27;t risk)<p>Just an idea, I wish I had started doing this myself years ago. Good luck and I hope the startup works out well for you also.')
