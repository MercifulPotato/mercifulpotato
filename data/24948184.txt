One great example is when you try to stuff more characters into a text field than it can accommodate. By default, MySQL just truncates the string silently; Postgres just doesn&#x27;t allow it.<p>That&#x27;s your opinion, but the truth is not necessarily black and white.<p>Postgres will probably lose more data in your case when the application developer doesn&#x27;t handle the exception for a text field too long, and loses the whole row. (If you&#x27;re an application developer, you should audit your code now.)<p>A well-written application using Postgres would have to truncate the data before insert, achieving the same result as having MySQL auto-truncation, but with more initial and on-going maintenance effort in the case of Postgres.<p>And the existence proof that MySQL&#x27;s behavior is ok is that MySQL is the most widely-used relational databases, and powers most Internet sites.<p>Source: DBA.')
