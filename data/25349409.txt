An asteroid big enough to crater to the mantle, sending out massive waves of lava and darkening the sky for years would do.<p>No, it wouldn&#x27;t. That would make the Earth much less hospitable than it is now, but still much more hospitable than Mars.<p>&gt; It might wipe out all humans on Earth.<p>This is not evidence of being less hospitable than Mars, since humans cannot survive on Mars. Even at the worst point of this disaster, human life would be easier on Earth than on Mars under normal Martian conditions.')
