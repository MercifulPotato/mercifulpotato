Arm can do lots of cores which is very good for servers, but single threading performance is still a significant necessity on user end hardware.<p>The M1 is great because it&#x27;s low power with optimized performance, but on a desktop you can have well over 500W+ and that&#x27;s normal.<p>I don&#x27;t see anyone else making only mobile arm chips for laptops other than trying to be like a Windows Chromebook. The software compatability will be a nightmare.')
