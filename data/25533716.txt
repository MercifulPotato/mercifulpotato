It&#x27;s definitely non-traditional.<p>Instead of a continuous gradient for the color, show patches of color in a randomized order. Display the colors over top of grayscale gradients of different sizes. This helps to deal with the trouble of human perception being affected by background and by solid angle. You might also want to consider showing the new color right over or around an image of the user&#x27;s choice.<p>For example, on a small screen, you might have a 256x256 patch on a 512x512 grayscale gradient for the currently selected color, and numerous 16x16 patches on 32x32 gradients for the choices that the user can make.<p>With each click on a choice, the whole array of choices is redone.<p>Available choices are provided as variations of the current choice and any colors that might have been bookmarked. Take the current choice, and vary the hue. Take the current choice, and vary the saturation. (including the negative extreme, positive extreme, and grey) Take some properties (hue, saturation, etc.) from the current choice, and others from a recent bookmark. Probably also throw in a 3x3x3 sRGB to make dramatic changes simple. Be sure to include everything that is within 2 or 3 units of the current choice in sRGB. In a plane that slices through the current selection and the grey line, provide choices that run along lines from the current choice in 4 different directions: black through the current selection until out of gamut, white through the current selection until out of gamut, along the saturation axis both directions, and along the L axis parallel to the grey line.<p>So with each click, you head in the direction you prefer.')
