It&#x27;s good to know that it&#x27;s contested, but all the intelligence organs (from both sides) denying a hacking took place is how things always go.<p>They denied that the Stuxnet was a cyberweapon too, for years after all the details were public known.<p>That said, the argument that there wouldn&#x27;t be a computer controlled pipeline in 1982 is kinda strong. If I were interested enough on the history, I&#x27;d start looking from there.')
