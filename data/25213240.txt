So many sites sit behind Cloudflare now and Cloudflare now uses hCaptcha, which is a big win. And the hCaptchas themselves are easy to complete. No more wondering if you actually clicked on &#x27;all&#x27; the traffic lights anymore, yay!<p>I inspected the source code of Google&#x27;s reCaptcha offering and was disgusted at how many bits of information they were collecting. They also seem to be fingerprinting users so they can&#x27;t keep registering new accounts on a platform, locking out anonymous users who are usually the best types of users on the platform, as IMHO anonymous voices are (usually) the best voices, or at least the more <i>interesting</i> of voices.<p>Google&#x27;s reCaptcha code seemed to be very keen on knowing my &#x27;cadence&#x27; or the way I used my mouse and how quickly (or how slow) I completed the captcha. It also looked at things like timezone, screen resolution, battery charge level etc So they could determine if it was &#x27;you&#x27; who was using the captcha, soon after, in a separate session (even on a different device!)')
