There is no intrinsic difference between your naming versus mine other than mine takes a millisecond longer to read the longer names. My version is quite ugly as well, but ugly naming has no negative effect on your code. It&#x27;s all about understandable naming.<p>..let&#x27;s jump back a bit to something else you said:<p>&gt; First off this &quot;clutter&quot; exists in the English language itself yet I hear no one complaining. I don&#x27;t communicate with other people using shortcuts and context aware abbreviations like your suggesting.<p>This level of clutter doesn&#x27;t exist in the English language, because we do use the contextual shorthand GP is leanings towards all over the place.  I&#x27;m fairly sure you do the same, but possibly aren&#x27;t aware of doing it because it comes so easily in natural language.<p>For example, using this paragraph from the Wikipedia page on <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>:<p>&gt; Juliet visits Friar Laurence for help, and he offers her a potion that will put her into a deathlike coma or catalepsy for &quot;two and forty hours&quot;. The Friar promises to send a messenger to inform Romeo of the plan so that he can rejoin her when she awakens. On the night before the wedding, she takes the drug and, when discovered apparently dead, she is laid in the family crypt.<p>And changing it to use your insistence on descriptive names with &quot;cluttered English&quot; instead of contextual shorthand, it becomes:<p>&gt; Juliet Capulet visits Friar Laurence for help, and Friar Laurence offers Juliet Capulet a potion that will put Juliet Capulet into a deathlike coma or catalepsy for &quot;two and forty hours&quot;. Friar Laurence promises to send a [independent] messenger to inform Romeo Montague of the plan so that Romeo Montague can rejoin Juliet Capulet when Juliet Capulet awakens. On the night before the wedding [between Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet], Juliet Capulet takes the coma drug and, when discovered and apparently dead, Juliet Capulet is laid in the Capulet family crypt.<p>(parts in [] I&#x27;m unsure about because it&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve read&#x2F;seen the play)<p>Long identifiers <i>are</i> exhausting to read, even with native speakers, because of the heavy repetition that has to be read and discarded with every single use.  It&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t speak or write like in that second example.')
