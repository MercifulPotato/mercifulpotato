Item(by='BadInformatics', descendants=None, kids=[25981669], score=None, time=1612062242, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25975299, text='In my limited experience and anecdata, governments have been so trigger happy in getting rid of and&#x2F;or marginalizing technical staff that there are few qualified individuals in the procurement office who can properly draft RFPs and evaluate proposals to keep bidders accountable. What you&#x27;re left with is mostly (M)BAs and admin types who can hammer out high-level Word docs of specs but not much else. In that environment, it&#x27;s not surprising that Deloitte, McKessen, IBM and co (or as I like to call them, the Procurement Vampires) can lowball and BS themselves into these projects. If you don&#x27;t know anything, better the devil you know, right ?')
