Being kicked of one service is survivable. Getting kicked off all the major ones is a real existential threat to any company. Network effects aren&#x27;t just users talking to other users, but platforms with overlapping terms of service clauses and what they allow and don&#x27;t allow. Find yourself in the Venn diagram of what most of them won&#x27;t allow and your system becomes functionally unworkable in today&#x27;s society.<p>The flip side of this is that if, years from now there&#x27;s a &quot;free speech&quot; payment processor, cloud host, social network and all the rest, de-platforming for a different subculture than the current mainstream service providers allow becomes harder. We talk about the balkanization of the internet, but there&#x27;s a possible future where there is a balkanization across cultural lines based on overlapping ethos, not just geographical divisions.')
