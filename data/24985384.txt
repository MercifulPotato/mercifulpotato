Even if that is the stated purpose, it&#x27;s rarely the outcome. In most instances I feel that fair and equitable are often opposing outcomes in a divorce. Is it fair to split the assets 50&#x2F;50? Is that equitable? How do you even measure the equity for non-monetary contributions? Now, how do you account for whether or not the person would have needed to perform the same tasks outside of the marriage (cooking for themself vs cooking for two)? Most of the court&#x27;s solutions for this are either based on inflexible formulas or on the emotions and bias of the judge.<p>Your statement about credit for paying all the utilities is not how it works. In fact, that can work against you. Like I stated before, lifestyle can be a big part of the decision. The spouse paying all the bills may still be required to pay many of them because the other person has a lifestyle the court wants to preserve. Take for example the divorce in California where a man had a porn addiction and the wife was ordered to pay alimony to continue supporting that addiction.<p>Your example of a startup is not the same. A startup is property, which can be sold and has inherent value. Being acquired during the marriage, that makes it marital property.<p>Coming back to your previous comment, do you really think that is a fair split at 50&#x2F;50 even though one person provided the intellectual capital and work? That would be devastating to most people to have their &quot;baby&quot; of a company ripped from them to the point where they no longer have majority ownership.')
