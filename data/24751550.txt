There&#x27;s too much focus on narrative and less on facts. In reality there&#x27;s no narrative. There&#x27;s no black and white. Most things are shades of gray. You&#x27;d expect journalists to give you facts, instead their focus is on creating emotion through narrative, while rooting for their story, downplaying inconvenient facts.<p>It&#x27;s quite sad.')
