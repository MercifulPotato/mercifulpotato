The very nature of that terrain configuration produces fairly extreme seasonal temperature variations (that is, very hot summers and very cold winters) as well as extreme daily temperature variations (that is, hot days and cold nights) because such places are far from the large bodies of water and also don’t have tree-cover, both of which serve to moderate rapid temperature changes.
