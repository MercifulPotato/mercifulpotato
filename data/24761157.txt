My biggest concern is career progression. In the office, it&#x27;s easy to jump into conversations where you form connections with your coworkers, and find out who are the decision makers, gurus, and informal sources of information. I joined my company after the lockdown started, so have not met any of my coworkers face-to-face, and I feel that not being able to tap into those threads of information is going to leave me out of the loop.')
