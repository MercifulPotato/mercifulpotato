Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605090463, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25047958, text='Same; there&#x27;s so much important information in the WWDC videos, and part of me wanted to watch them all when I was still doing iOS development. But I can&#x27;t watch videos, I don&#x27;t have the attention span, and sitting to watch &#x2F; listen just makes me go to sleep.<p>It&#x27;s a me thing, not down to the presenters or anything. But all that I ask is documentation and &#x2F; or blog posts.<p>I hope that anyone that is making a presentation also writes down the contents as a blog post and&#x2F;or documentation. Please. For examples, Go&#x27;s blog is pretty good (although there too one is often pointed at a presentation or slide deck for certain subjects)')
