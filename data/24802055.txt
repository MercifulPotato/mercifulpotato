For instance, potato chip bags have shrunk since the 2008 financial crisis while pricing has increased.  Mass market textiles are also no longer durable like they were even twenty years ago (has anyone purchased Marc Jacobs apparel recently?).<p>I was just reflecting on <i>The Organization Man</i> last night and received from the get-go a nice little gem from a man giving a Yale commencement address in 1908:<p>&quot;Here merit is the sole test. Birth is nothing...Here only a natural order of nobility is recognized, and its motto, without a coat of arms or boat of heraldry, is &#x27;Intelligence and integrity&#x27;.&quot; (p16 2002 UofPenn Press)<p>And then the author, Walter H. Whyte, remarks:<p>&quot;But the very industrial revolution which this highly serviceable ethic begot in time began to confound it...by the 1880&#x27;s the corporation had already shown the eventual bureaucratic direction it was going to take...the big organization became a standing taunt to this dream of individual success.

Chandler, Jr. is a great read corroborating the growth of agglomerated industry, and Joseph Schumpeter&#x27;s <i>Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy</i> also has some good passages relating to this phenomenon of the homestead getting saturated.<p>But I&#x27;m an eternal optimist and see this as the price of progress :)')
