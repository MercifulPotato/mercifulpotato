Actually, out of what you just said, D3, MobX, and React all have not removed any of the APIs you could&#x27;ve used back in 2018. Did people maybe rewrite some tools to support hooks, and in doing so find that hooks were a more concise and readable solution? Yeah, they did, so we moved to hooks.<p>&gt; a year spent just writing and learning good software in Python gains me so much more transferable skills to anything I touch as a software engineer in the future<p>How so? This is a complete non-sequitur. If you consider data science &#x2F; ML to be the entirety of software engineering, then maybe you have a point, but since you even put (for example) beside Python it just looks to me like you hate JS and will pretend it&#x27;s not software engineering so you can avoid it. Any time you&#x27;ve spent tweaking build systems or updating libraries for no reason is on you, not on JS.')
