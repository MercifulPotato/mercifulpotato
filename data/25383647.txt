It was a little unclear which was supposed to be used as some applications used the former and then it was common to have a &quot;backend for frontend&quot; that would solely deal with communicating between... ah, you know what, I don&#x27;t even want to think about it.<p>Suffice it to say, the React application in question made use of the okta-react library which meant that the actual SSO dance was part of the Javascript bundle being shipped<p>That in itself isn&#x27;t a problem but Cypress seems strongly designed around the idea that you never leave the domain. We got that to work but then when 2FA was mandated, we were kind of screwed.<p>We didn&#x27;t have a TOTP seed to generate a passcode as part of the auth flow which is highly questionable of course but we also didn&#x27;t have a solution to bypass the actual authentication step either, as it wasn&#x27;t an API call to a backend (we controlled)<p>Anyway, we tried making a service account that has 2FA disabled only to discover that 2FA was mandated at a network level (unless you were on a specific subnet we later discovered) meaning we would just see some arbitrary &quot;error 53&quot;<p>Anyway, This isn&#x27;t to say that Cypress is anyway at fault here but I have seered in my memory, from the tens of hours spend on this crap, the sight of threads where people would &quot;How do I use this with Okta&quot; and the developers essentially saying &quot;Oh, yeah, you shouldn&#x27;t be doing that&quot;.<p>Having said all that, while I remember finding Cypress pretty handy, I&#x27;m more fond of Testcafe myself :)<p>Ah also, I believe a lot of teams made use of a Zalenium... cluster? Bunch of instances anyway. I also recall a number of people having the above issue with no solutions')
