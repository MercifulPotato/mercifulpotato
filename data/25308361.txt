Typically I&#x27;d purchase a few tshirts, socks and underwear at the half a year or a year mark to replace ones I&#x27;ve gotten rid of.<p>Lately though this hasn&#x27;t been going as well. I think partly due to Covid lock downs I&#x27;ve gained some weight around the middle and some jeans no longer fit. I&#x27;m resisting buying replacement jeans hoping to lose the weight instead. Not going well so far.')
