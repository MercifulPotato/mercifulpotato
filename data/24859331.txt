Consumer&#x27;s trust in companies is far more nuanced and complex: we may for example trust that if we buy an Apple device it will be well built, but we don&#x27;t trust that we&#x27;re getting good value for money because we know Apple has a reputation for being expensive.<p>This is an excellent feature of capitalism. Incentives are front and centre, people don&#x27;t (usually) try to deny them. Everyone understands them and is taught about them as children. People constantly recalibrate their levels of trust in corporations and distinguish between them based on clearly marked and well protected brands. Firms seek out and inform consumers about reasons to distrust their competitors as well. There are systems like bankruptcy, the stock market, and CEO bonuses that at least <i>try</i> to align company behaviours with what people want them to do, as expressed through purchases in the markets. Of course they aren&#x27;t perfect but they do at least exist.<p>Non-corporate institutions are a much murkier affair. NGOs, charities, governments and universities tend to make a lot of very dubious claims about their own trustworthiness and incentives. Many people have an utterly blind faith or even ideological loyalty to them. They often blur the boundaries between themselves, make unfounded claims of political neutrality, claim higher moral purposes, may claim they are indispensable or can&#x27;t be shut down or allowed to fail, and invariably say they aren&#x27;t &quot;corrupted&quot; by profit.')
