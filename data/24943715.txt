I loved the 2D-ness of the games, the attention to details, the scripts, the colors, the music. You could tell there was a talented team behind those games. Games have now gotten so complex  graphics-wise but it seems to me that they lost something it&#x27;s very hard to pinpoint, maybe the limitations of that age was what made the games more creative? Or maybe it&#x27;s pure subjectivity on my part.')
