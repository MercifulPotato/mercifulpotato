Eg in Germany there&#x27;s long been an enormous stigma against violent video games. I haven&#x27;t talked with German gamedevs for some years so maybe this loosened up since. But basically, if you worked in gamedev you preferred to tell your neighbours and acquaintances that you work &quot;in IT&quot;. If they would find out you work on video games they&#x27;d pretty much fully cut you out of their lives.<p>(Note, to my anecdotal experience this is a purely German thing. I don&#x27;t know other European countries where the same stigma exists)')
