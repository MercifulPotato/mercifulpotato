Docker DB container would be spun up at the start of testing (using a package such as testcontainers-scala). Then the DB would be setup using the migration scripts (using Flyway) so it has a known state. Every test (or set of tests if they&#x27;re linked) would have a pre-hook which nuked the DB to a clean state. Then the docker container would be shut down at the end of testing. I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s even some way to have this run concurrently with multiple DBs (one per thread) but we never did that. Is Java&#x27;s ecosystem for this type of tooling just that much better?')
