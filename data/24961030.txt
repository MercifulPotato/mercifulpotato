On the github page it lists reducing costs by 30%<p>From a first-read perspective those are vastly different numbers (30-99%), for what all sound like the same thing (reducing bandwidth by 99% sounds like it should reduce my costs by 99%).<p>Might want to be more specific (or pick a single number).')
