Places like Boston and DC have car break ins but they&#x27;re not rampant like in SF<p>Edit:<p>For those unaware SF downgraded a ton of (formerly felony I believe) property crime to low level misdemeanors with very light sentencing guidelines (termed &quot;catch and release&quot; by many) which results in nearly zero law enforcement action being taken against them .  The result of this is that all sorts of petty theft and theft adjacent behavior (like breaking into cars) is far more rampant than in many other cities because (obviously).<p>I support treating petty property crime as petty but you can&#x27;t accidentally allow &quot;crime with a victim&quot; type crime to go unenforced in the process.  Victimizing other people can&#x27;t be an activity that has positive ROI in the long term.')
