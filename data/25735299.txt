Even &quot;objective&quot; facts presented with the omission of other &quot;objective&quot; facts is propaganda. Look at something you think isn&#x27;t propaganda. That&#x27;s propaganda for your particular brand of sensibility about what is or isn&#x27;t propaganda.<p>Propaganda is inescapable, like politics. It&#x27;s all about whose you like the most at the present moment or which kind you&#x27;re epistemically indoctrinated into. :3 (For me, I like scientific empiricism, but that position, too, is just a philosophical&#x2F;political&#x2F;propagandist leaning, frontloaded with all the assumptions and priors that go along with it. And I also think it&#x27;s the best one, and I think it&#x27;s dumb to disagree.)')
