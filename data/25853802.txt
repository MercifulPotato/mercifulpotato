Item(by='blyry', descendants=None, kids=[25853866], score=None, time=1611189040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25852346, text='&gt; results in the construction of “luxury” housing instead of “affordable” housing<p>I&#x27;m really hung up on the quotes here. Isn&#x27;t this because the market rate is <i>currently</i> distorted by the preexisting lack of supply though? So a developer isn&#x27;t actually building &#x27;reasonable&#x27; apartments with a level of furnish that is &#x27;affordable&#x27;, they&#x27;ve got granite (sorry quartz, granite is out!) countertops and heated tile floors because they can capture more rent than the cost that way?<p>I&#x27;m curious to what extent this is due to market distortion via governmental policies, or just developers&#x2F;capitalism &#x27;spying&#x27; a neighborhood near the end of it&#x27;s natural lifecycle.')
