A lot of the &quot;tips&quot; boil down to &quot;be young and healthy&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t be old and unhealthy.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve read some peer reviewed research as well but most of that is focused on outcomes and genetic testing of IVF embryos rather than natural fertilization. I get the impression that fertility isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s well-studied outside of really generic health indicators like weight and age. And a lot of fertility information seems to focus on ages 20 to 35. They seem to assume that after that age you&#x27;ve given up on starting a family or that you already have one.')
