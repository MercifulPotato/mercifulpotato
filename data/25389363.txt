I don&#x27;t think org-mode is the best for me in terms of keeping organized notes, I find that I like Joplin&#x27;s[1] interface more for that. Although I&#x27;ve thought about emulating the interface of Joplin by using folders and treemacs[2].<p>Org-mode really shines for logging. I use it at work to keep a daily log organized by sprint. Org-mode really gets out of your way and makes logging easy. It is deep and has a ton of features, but the base feature set is really simple and easy to get started with.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joplinapp.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joplinapp.org&#x2F;</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Alexander-Miller&#x2F;treemacs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Alexander-Miller&#x2F;treemacs</a>')
