I called everywhere, couldn&#x27;t find them to save my life, and I hesitate to tell you, I even learned that Norton grapes are not the same color inside as they are outside.&quot;<p>But, Poon says, it wasn&#x27;t in her interest to go back to writer and explain that Norton grapes aren&#x27;t the same color inside and out. &quot;The whole scene hinges on that. So in my little mind, I justified it. I thought, well Hannibal lies about everything — he&#x27;s telling you it&#x27;s jelly when it&#x27;s made from the bones of young women — so he&#x27;d lie about Norton grapes too.&quot; And Poon knew she would have to create these nonexistent grapes from scratch. &quot;So I peeled and dipped grapes in food coloring, hung them all around my kitchen studio, dripping dye, and then once they were semi dry, because of course grapes won&#x27;t dry, they&#x27;re juicy, I dipped them in wax and dusted them with corn starch.&quot; That night she got a phone call from the producer asking about the grapes. He said the plan sounded fine, but she should also have a backup grape made a second way by 8:30 a.m.[..]')
