The hypocrisy is not going unnoticed. Amazon contributed nothing of value to open source, then they basically stole the hard work of others and again contributed nothing back and now they&#x27;re going so far as to preach about open source. Please. The sad part is, users won&#x27;t care and customers won&#x27;t care because at the end of the day ease of use wins.
