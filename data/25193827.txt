I really enjoyed it, up until the final fight against the big flying robot cat thingie. I felt super betrayed about a game without stress suddenly flipping on all its principles. Suddenly it was a stressful action game. Super hard. Tried a dozen times. Failed. Became angry with it, put it down, never started it again, and now when you mention it my feelings about that game are like 30% niceness of the initial part and 70% bitterness about the crap ending. Or was it even the ending? I will not know.<p>To game makers out there: know your category, and don&#x27;t break it.<p>There was an old space quest game that was like this too. Final mecha fight that turned a thinking game into an action game and with it turned friends of the game into enemies.')
