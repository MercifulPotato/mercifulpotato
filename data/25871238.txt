I know at least one company (Acme Inc) that doesn&#x27;t offer anything like Amazon, but does have clients who can access their &quot;own&quot; (client-specific) data hosted in Acme Inc&#x27;s Elasticsearch cluster; it&#x27;s a somewhat marginal (but still important) feature in the product, yet still, due to it, Elastic maintains that Acme Inc resells Elasticsearch and thus needs the &quot;Enterprise&quot; license to be in compliance.<p>So, Elastic are not only going for AWS and people who cannot host their own Elasticsearch, they are going a bit wider than you imply here.')
