But when it works as intended, the telephone &quot;world&quot; offers something that the Internet world often no longer offers: end-to-end connectivity.<p>Even the cheapest phone plan will come with a phone number that&#x27;s reachable from anywhere and can reach anywhere (provided you pay the call fee). Most consumer-grade internet plans come with a single, <i>dynamic</i> IPv4 and no IPv6 (or the IPv6 prefix is also dynamic). No end-to-end connectivity is possible unless you engage in some NAT traversal workarounds that require an external server.')
