For example, &quot;SELECT id, clmn FROM tbl WHERE clmn = 999999999999999999&quot; may return records where `clmn` is &#x27;999999999999999999&#x27;, also where `clmn` is, for example, &#x27;999999999999999998&#x27; (because those big integers are too big for DOUBLE and, when converted, they have the same representation).<p>So the correct query is &quot;SELECT id, clmn FROM tbl WHERE clmn = &#x27;999999999999999999&#x27;&quot;')
