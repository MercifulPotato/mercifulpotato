Those who didn&#x27;t but followed orders anyway were probably doing so out of fear, not simply because humans are order-following rubes.<p>&gt; <i>No, if we were to do the experiment in modern terms, you would place an actor in the chair and have a professor instruct their student that they are experimenting with correcting racist behavior out of the subject in a humane way. Would a liberal student reject this sort of experiment in 2020?</i><p>If you think a liberal student of 2020 would follow orders instructing them to torture a racist, but would reject an order that wasn&#x27;t accompanied by a justification tailored to their ideology, then it sounds like you agree with my take.  Given a free choice (e.g. no threat to kill their family if they refuse) people will follow orders if you convince them of the necessity of those orders by appealing to their ideologies and biases, but will refuse orders if the explanations for those orders are incompatible with their ideologies.  But this is the <i>&#x27;water is wet&#x27;</i> conclusion, not the attention grabbing conclusion Milgram sold to the public.')
