All cars have numberplates for tracking, and identifying these in CCTV and dashcam footage can be useful in identifying those who have caused accidents or other damage. Vehicle manufactures have a lot of regulations that they have to comply with.<p>For electrical distribution networks and equipment there are also many safety mechanisms in place, such as insulation, circuit breakers, surge protectors, and lots of regulations covering the installation of electrical wiring in buildings. While growing up, everyone learns of the potential dangers of electricity, e.g. don&#x27;t stick a fork in a socket and keep that hairdryer away from the bath tub. Similarly everyone knows the damage and trauma that can result from car accidents.<p>The same is not currently true of social media. I don&#x27;t know what the right answer is regarding regulation - I&#x27;m wary of unforseen negative consequences it may have and the potential for it to be poorly thought out. But I think education on how to use social media responsibly is important. Things like be careful about how much information you share about yourself, don&#x27;t believe everything you read (check to see if the source of news is reliable), learn how to identify fake news and propaganda, and even how to decide whether to opt out of using certain services altogether.<p>I agree with your main argument, but it&#x27;s overly simplistic - we should think about how to achieve the benefits of new technologies while minimising the costs.')
