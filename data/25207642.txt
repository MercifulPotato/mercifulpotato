Other highly intelligent animals do not seem close to even the first steps of space exploration. Perhaps a better term than intelligence is &#x27;culture&#x27;.<p>The fact that human abilities are very limited in some ways supports this. For most evolutionary branches it was a much better strategy to develop excellent eyesight, hearing, running or fighting than to trade off mediocre ones against a sort of general-purpose intelligence and communication skills.')
