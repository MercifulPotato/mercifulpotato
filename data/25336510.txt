The discussion was about whether we should have natural gas hookups in new homes. Obviously backups are good, as is increased electrical reliability -- but it&#x27;s not clear that building parallel natural gas <i>and</i> electrical infrastructure is a better use of resources than just using those resources to make the electrical infrastructure more reliable.<p>PS I grew up in a wood-heated home in Vermont and stacked cords of wood every year. Except for freezing my ass of every morning until the fire was going, I think wood heat is  great. Unfortunately it does have some particulate issues in urban areas, and (related) doesn&#x27;t scale well. But I&#x27;m not saying people shouldn&#x27;t use it where it makes sense.')
