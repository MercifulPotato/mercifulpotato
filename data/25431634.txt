[Emacs] doesnâ€™t make itself as available to regular computer users as something like Excel does.<p>The word &quot;regular&quot; is the load-bearing word in your argument. Your examples suggest that you feel end-user programming is not going on unless the user is taking advantage of some visual affordance like context menus to discover and use the program&#x27;s capabilities.

Is the distinction useful? I don&#x27;t know.<p>edit: typos')
