Some will survive whatever natural disasters hit.  As the supply of working ones dwindles, repairers will thrive.  The skills and equipment necessary to repair waterlogged or crushed computers is still orders of magnitude less than that required to build a new one.<p>&quot;Mining and repairing macbooks&quot; as a strategy could last for 1000 years or so if necessary.  Of the billions out there, at least a few will be working in 1000 years, if there are humans around with the desire to repair them.<p>As the repairs get harder and the supply dwindles, there will be more and more incentive to reinvent processes to make new ones.   It wont be anywhere near as hard 2nd time round, because I&#x27;m sure across all of those billions of buried macbooks there are designs of all the machines necessary.')
