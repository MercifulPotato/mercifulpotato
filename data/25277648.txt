They characterize several fatal and transmissible neurodegenerative diseases in humans and many other animals.[3] It is not known what causes the normal protein to misfold,<p>A lot of them take years to even be discovered once your infected and we&#x27;re still not sure what causes them to misfold.<p>We&#x27;re making proteins in a lab, have done only a few years of study on the safety and have approved them for human consumption. We may not see or understand the consequences for decades.')
