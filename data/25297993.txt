And yet the currency keeps growing in value week over week. Should I not be paying you less and less over time? If the currency increases in value 7% in a month, should I not decrease your pay proportionally?<p>And are you really going to negotiate that day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, year-to-year? What if the value drops significantly in the middle of the day? What do I pay you at the end of the week?<p>After all, the value of the currency is going up. I didn&#x27;t decide the value of your labor was going up. It&#x27;s staying the same.')
