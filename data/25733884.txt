From the wording of the AWS contract, it sounds like the language is loose enough that any user can pretty much be terminated at whim.<p>If&#x2F;when this lawsuit gets publicity, my guess is a lot of C-suite executives are gonna be looking over their shoulders and evaluating how screwed they&#x27;d be if their current cloud provider decided to deplatform them.<p>Amazon&#x27;s probably counting on the fact that 99% of its customers&#x27; business doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with politics, and therefore they&#x27;ll write off the threat. But the counterpoint is that cancel culture has become so pervasive into people&#x27;s personal lives that who knows what might happen.<p>If an executive shows up to a Trump-rally or posts a politically incorrect meme on his personal time, it&#x27;s not outside the scope of possibility that AWS&#x2F;GCP could demand that the company fire the person or else have their account terminated. The zeigeist is increasingly moving to the ideology that &quot;silence is violence&quot;. Are companies, like Coinbase, that espouse political neutrality next?<p>Any company can now find itself on the wrong end of a cancel culture mob. If said mob has controls over your cloud providers TOS, then that&#x27;s a major business risk.')
