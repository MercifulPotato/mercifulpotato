They are not.  They are a <i>conclusion</i>.  Uniform laws are the best explanation that anyone has been able to come up with that explains all the observed data.  But this was not <i>assumed</i>, and in fact it still isn&#x27;t.  The idea, for example, that physical constants change over time is very much a hypothesis that is given serious consideration.  It just turns out that there&#x27;s no evidence for it.')
