I suppose with &quot;TPM&quot; you mean the &quot;Secure Element&quot;, which on iPhones and modern Android phones contains the disk encryption keys.<p>Like a lot of other smartphones, the main difficulty in running something else on an iDevice is the locked bootloader. It won&#x27;t run anything not signed by Apple. If an exploit like checkra1n is used to defeat this, iPhones can run Linux in principle [1], of course practically restricted by a lack of a large amount of drivers required to run Linux well.<p>This iDevice OS lockdown completely reduces to 1) the locked bootloader which must be &quot;defeated&quot; - which M1 Macs contain a built in tool for - and 2) the only OS with drivers for the hardware being Apple&#x27;s Darwin. So no, the TPM isn&#x27;t a large part of why it&#x27;s so difficult to run anything else on an iDevice.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.project-insanity.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;16&#x2F;running-postmarketos-on-iphone-7&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.project-insanity.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;16&#x2F;running-postmar...</a>')
