Like, a LOT.  So much slower that I am sort of amazed that MicroPython has any traction at all.<p>An 80MHz microcontroller running C can go about as fast as a 800MHz microcontroller running MicroPython, if the benchmarks a friend showed me are accurate.<p>An 80Mhz microcontroller is a lot cheaper than an 800 MHz microcontroller, though the difference is getting smaller.')
