The technical machinery makes much more sense now. But the intuition still lacks.<p>An attempt. To map an R^2 vector into G^2 is trivial, (a,b) =&gt; a x + b y = (1, a, b, 0). The reverse is hard. s 1 + a x + b y + d xy = (s, a, b, o) =&gt; (?, ?). Or perhaps G^2 is a superstructure of R^2, and most elements of G^2 can only be projected (somehow? perhaps trivially?) to R^2, but with loss of information. Which leaves the grok question: what does a vector in G^2 actually represent? Perhaps scale + x position + y position + orientation angle, as the use of &#x27;i&#x27; suggests? If so, then in R^3 xy, xz any yz represent rotations in the respective planes? Which leaves a bonus puzzle: what does (multiplying with) xyz represent?<p>FWIW, at this point it&#x27;s likely I can compute the answers using the code in the OP and well crafted multivectors. Time permitting :)')
