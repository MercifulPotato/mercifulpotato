Item(by='josephg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610579508, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25768516, text='&gt; Funnily this is a similar effect to java culture poison-swapping into javascript after class and decorator syntax was added.<p>This is a great insight. I remember arguing at the time that adding that stuff to javascript was stupid, and people responded arguing that it increased accessibility of the language. It’s heresy, but I think there’s something to be said for bringing people in to a language slowly so they have time and inclination to leave their past experiences at the door. Rust uses the borrow checker. Ruby has metaclasses and it’s excessive magic everywhere. Javascript used to use prototype based inheritance and callbacks. I use classes sometimes and async everywhere but we paid a price for that syntax. The price was in our previously more cohesive identity as a community around how JS was written.')
