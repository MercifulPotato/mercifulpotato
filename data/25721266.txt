Naturally, this evening I did my first stir fry with it and it was a blast! Cleaning was pretty simple. After I had finished eating I put some water into it, got it boiling, and used the spatula to scrape of the crusty bits. Then I cleaned and rinsed it under running hot water with some support of a brush. After a bit of drying off back onto the stove set to high to dry - and to polymerise the remaining traces of cooking oil to reinforce the seasoning. Cool off a bit and then apply a very thin layer of oil for protection.<p>That might sound a lot, but it really only takes a few minutes!<p>I&#x27;ll do this every time after using the wok. I expect it to be good for a very long time. There might be easier ways to achieve this, but that&#x27;s what extensive research has taught me to do.')
