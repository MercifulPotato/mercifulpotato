AWS outages make the news and customers treat them like natural disasters. We host a few services on AWS but the bulk of our stuff is on-prem. When AWS has issues none of our customers cared -- they were annoyed that they couldn&#x27;t do their work but were otherwise totally understanding and none of the blowback fell on us.<p>When one of our upstream ISPs had an outage and prevented some of customers from being able to reach us people were mad at us even after the explanation. AWS is enough of a household name that you can say sorry &quot;AWS is down right now&quot; and people will sympathize.')
