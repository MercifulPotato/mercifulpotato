There is no such thing. The &quot;intrinsic value&quot; of a bucket of rice can be enormous if you&#x27;re starving, and yet it&#x27;s practically null now. The &quot;intrinsic value&quot; of gold is dependent on one of its extrinsic qualities, rarity (plus another, convention).<p>Value is just the measure of the willingness of people to give you something in exchange for something else. It&#x27;s not in the objects themselves, but in the head of the people.')
