A good example of this is flat earthers or anti vaxxers.

Also observe your sense of omniscience (&quot;They&#x27;ve got no scientific or reasonable leg to stand on...&quot;, demonstrating your perception that you&#x27;ve reviewed all the evidence and arguments from the community).<p>I believe that a reasonable debate first requires that all parties realize and acknowledge the illusory nature of consciousness, and in turn reality.  But this seems to be an extremely unpopular idea, so we may be waiting a long time before we can have a reasonable debate.')
