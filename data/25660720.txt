Verifiable credentials mean that you pick up a phone and call the references the candidate gave you.<p>What you are describing is essentially &quot;it varies widely in rigor - so we must subject every candidate to a full CS exam, because we don&#x27;t trust anyone.&quot;<p>Even in medical field the schools and standards vary, especially between countries. And there are good and bad doctors. Heck, some have even got their diplomas fraudulently.<p>However, that doesn&#x27;t mean you will have the prospective hire sit in for an multiple hours&#x2F;days of redoing university examinations during an interview - as it seems to be the rule in software engineering (and pretty much nowhere else). You would be laughed out if you tried that.<p>Especially for a <i>senior</i> position, where the candidate has a past experience you could ask about (i.e. not a freshly out of school student).')
