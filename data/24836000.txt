My only point is that Red - as far I&#x27;ve seen it at least - tries to maintain a great deal of compatibility with Rebol, while Arturo used it as a starting point. (Arturo can be run as valid Rebol code, only if you stick to the absolute basics)<p>Even using it as an inspiration, it&#x27;s obvious that I absolutely respect both projects.<p>Again, what I&#x27;m trying to do is take the good points and create something completely new.<p>Looking forward to hearing your feedback&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;suggestion&#x2F;anything. I&#x27;m all ears! :)<p>(Code contributions are also 100% welcome!)')
