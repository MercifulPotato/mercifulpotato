My house gets dirtier now and I’m forever cleaning it, doing dishes.<p>* The distinction between the beginning and end of my work day.<p>* Having free space in my house.<p>* Off the cuff dinner and drinks with colleagues.<p>* No lag meetings and whiteboard sessions.<p>* Having intervals apart from my family actually felt healthy, although we have adapted to being around each other 24&#x2F;7 I guess.<p>* When someone of greater rank than me in an inconvenient time zone wants to have a meeting with me involved, I have to attend. I’ve practically lost all my mornings from 6am - 9am, 3-4 days a week.<p>Things I like about fully distributed:<p>* Everyone is remote now so it’s forced us to treat everyone more equally, not just favouring those in the office.<p>* Less interaction with middle management, this <i>might</i> make it harder to get bonuses etc.<p>Disclaimer: I just lived in a city 5 minute bike ride from my office so I had a convenient setup, could go home and make lunch etc.<p>When I had an office I had slack, I had work from home, cafes, sometimes.')
