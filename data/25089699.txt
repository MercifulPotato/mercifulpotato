The amount of non-toy software actually verified in them is zero.  I&#x27;m not even sure if there&#x27;s any non-toy software written in Idris besides the Idris compiler itself.<p>Coq&#x27;s track record is better, but its language is ugly as hell in comparison (and to actually do anything you&#x27;d need to extract to Ocaml&#x2F;Haskell anyway and the same applies to Agda).')
