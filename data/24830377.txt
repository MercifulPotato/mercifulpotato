It always felt unreal to me and there was no satisfaction in it. Now, I immensely prefer playing the computer - it goes at my pace, I can get up and leave, I can take all the time I want for my move, and if I do something dumb I just undo back to where I feel comfortable and play better. When I get legitimately stuck I ask the computer for advice.<p>In this way, I basically always win against a superior player. It may not be ideal for practice, but I just play for fun and find it satisfying to win.')
