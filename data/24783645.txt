I mean, Western companies talk about code &quot;ninjas&quot; all the time; and I have heard a few samurai and zen references too.<p>Japan talking about Christians isn&#x27;t particularly different. Christianity and comparisons to it are made relatively casually, with much less cultural weight than they would have in the US or Europe. Here&#x27;s a Japanese rap song [1] whose lyrics [2] go, &quot;As the Bible is to a devout Christian, so to me is is the Zulu Nation&quot; (translation [2]).<p>So in my opinion the &quot;internet Jesus uses secret creed&quot; thing is at least mildly clickbaity. It&#x27;d be the equivalent of seizing upon the name &quot;Zen of Python&quot; to write an article about &quot;A Language with a simplicity driven by Buddhism&quot;.<p>-----------------------<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TnJMBcQFNME#t=2m51s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TnJMBcQFNME#t=2m51s</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;genius.com&#x2F;Genius-english-translations-aklo-rgto-english-translation-lyrics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;genius.com&#x2F;Genius-english-translations-aklo-rgto-eng...</a>')
