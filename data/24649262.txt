For Germany that is securing gas and not releieing on a single source like the US for its energy.<p>I don&#x27;t see how it makes any sense for Putin to poison Alexei. There is zero benefit for him. However an anti Putin oligarch or the US (which we found out recently wanted to poison Asange. I wonder what they would have used and who they would have been blamed... ) have something to gain.')
