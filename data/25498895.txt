At some point the simplest and most realistic thing to do is to ignore what does not directly concern you.<p>From what someone else has commented they are accessible from Norway, so they may already be in breach of the GDPR depending on how they track visitors. Are the Norwegian authorities going after a small-ish organization from Virginia? Nope. They are not even aware that those guys exist and won&#x27;t bother anyway.<p>I do agree with you, though, that it is absolutely fair for non-EU websites that don&#x27;t want to have anything to do with the GDPR to block EU visitors.')
