They aren&#x27;t producing video games for the same reason that Cobra Kai is now a Netflix production. Google doesn&#x27;t have what it takes to adapt to a new market and actually adapt. Can I view the exact pixel your eye browses to whilst playing a video game and use that to sell you incontinence pads? No. Well then Google isn&#x27;t interested.

Funneling tonnes of cash into businesses they didn&#x27;t understand and then failed in because they had no idea how they were going to capture any more value from their core market that share holders had already accounted for.')
