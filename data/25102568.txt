They&#x27;re super cheap, and it is handy to be able to turn a bunch on or off with one command.  Or have them turn on when you get home, etc.<p>What really keeps me going with home automation is the door &amp; lock control.  Being able to monitor the status of the garage doors and the deadbolts on all doors is worth the price of admission.  The kids each have their own code to get in the house, I can lock the doors from afar if they get left open or unlocked, I can check the status at any time, etc.  I have the system close &amp; lock everything at bedtime if it isn&#x27;t already, and it communicates status to me as things are opened&#x2F;closed&#x2F;locked&#x2F;unlocked.<p>I could give up the lighting if I had to.  I could just use the built-in scheduling on the thermostat.  No biggy.  But the locks and doors functionality is worth the effort.')
