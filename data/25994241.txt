Item(by='teddyh', descendants=None, kids=[25994682], score=None, time=1612215029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25994013, text='&gt; <i>Try turning on &quot;Fast seek&quot; in VLC&#x27;s Input&#x2F;Codecs preferences tab.</i><p>That <i>is</i> a bit better, but still not close to what mpv does.   That option also causes VLC to sometimes get “stuck” while skipping, i.e. when you skip many times in quick succession, sometimes the playback gets to a certain point, and any skips will then not skip past that point – you will have to wait a few seconds for normal playback to progress a bit, and then you can skip again.  This interrupts your flow, makes you wait (and forces you to partially watch a section you <i>expressly</i> wanted to skip), and is, needless to say, very disruptive when skimming a video.')
