I have a primitive tool to delete user and all its posts with a single click. I also don&#x27;t allow TOR traffic. Possibly in the future no proxies too. Each channel owner can moderate and ban whoever they need to, either just the user or its IP address if he&#x2F;she comes back (right now it&#x27;s very easy to create a new user, just clear the cookie and you have it).\nOf course website must be somewhat popular to attract that crowd. I hope that in the beginning these tools will be enough. On the other hand dirty content won&#x27;t necessarily be moderated if it&#x27;s in  a dirty channel and it&#x27;s not illegal.')
