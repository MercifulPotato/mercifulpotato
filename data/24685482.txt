The employee can quit for a new job and then just gets sued before they can start work. So then the employee either has to wait out the non-compete period (sometimes these are paid out), losing valuable work time, or they have to get a job in a demonstrably different sector&#x2F;area, where skill transfer may not be as advantageous.<p>You’re right that this does create a toxic, unmotivated workforce.
