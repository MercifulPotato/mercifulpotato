Item(by='ezrast', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610151346, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691763, text='Take a look at the &quot;daily new deaths&quot; graphs for each of those countries on the site you linked. All four of those countries fall to near zero over the summer. Their first-wave lockdowns worked, eventually. The USA&#x27;s did not; people just kept getting infected all summer long.<p>The second wave has hit hard, but deaths in Slovenia, Belgium, and Italy are at this point all trending back downward. USA&#x27;s are not. Extend those graphs out and we&#x27;ll be well ahead in deaths before long. The UK isn&#x27;t trending down either, but their leadership is suffering from a lot of the same problems as the USA&#x27;s with not taking this seriously.<p>Also note that all four of those countries are reporting fewer infections than the USA - their deaths per capita come from higher case fatality rates. This suggests that the death rate has more to do with their hospital systems being worse-positioned to handle the influx of patients than how the spread was managed.')
