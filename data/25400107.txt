Nobody writes lat&#x2F;lon.  So, your analogy is perfect enough to largely disqualify stylistic arguments.<p>Lat&#x2F;lon is a data set primarily used by applications.  IP addresses are much the same way aside from private networks and experimentation.  If you need to describe a private space in IPv6 you have link local addresses that begin with fe80.<p>Modern routing tables are primarily defined by dynamic protocols, such as OSPF.  If you really need to express a static IP address directly, such as for remote access to a switch, the IP address will be provided to you.  This is why Cisco now requires Python for the CCNP.')
