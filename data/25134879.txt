In the case of a skyscraper that requires more power you then have only to upgrade a localised substation. In order for the entire country to consume considerably more _current_ that requires a global upgrade everywhere. There are 400,000 substations in the UK.<p>I&#x27;m also not saying it&#x27;s impossible, it&#x27;s just something that the govt has to do first for this to even be feasible. It also makes the timeframe very impractical. The govt doesn&#x27;t appear to ever address this or even begin the work required.')
