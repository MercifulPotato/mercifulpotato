HDMI is a separate device; also, in a thread somewhere Paul Davis of Ardour fame explains how exactly infeasible it is. (And you won&#x27;t be able to do &quot;real time&quot; on a GPU anyway if it&#x27;s not graphics.)<p>Why? HDMI comes from the graphics card with video and audio.<p>Also I&#x27;m pretty sure a graphics card can handle audio effects in real time. 44k samples per second per channel is going to take a lot less than running complex shaders on 240 million pixels per second.')
