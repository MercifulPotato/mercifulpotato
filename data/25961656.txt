Item(by='maccard', descendants=None, kids=[25964581], score=None, time=1611950532, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25960231, text='&gt; Yes, I think Factorio&#x27;s engine is more complex and difficult to implement well than a typical AAA game with rich graphics and &quot;realistic&quot; physics.<p>I think this is maybe true, but it&#x27;s not a fair comparison. The real comparison is how much effort would go into making factorio with all of its polish in a 3d world rather than a 2d world.<p>Factorio&#x27;s technical impressiveness (?) Comes from how well it&#x27;s designed and implemented. The limitations that it imposes are part of the reason it runs so well, and also what make it such a great game.<p>&gt;   The physics system is a complex bit of math but is fairly isolated from the rest of the engine and has relatively few entities to process. If it gets things &quot;wrong&quot; in minor ways, the player is unlikely to tell.<p>The difference between doing the above for physics and graphics is orders of magnitude in how expensive they are, and how complicated they are to implement. You&#x27;re right that most people don&#x27;t notice when they go slightly wrong, but they often go catastrophicly wrong. (Much more often in 3d than in 2d). Factorio skirts around this by not running a general purpose physics sim for the game logic, and constraining the problem space (which to me is even more impressive than getting a 3d physics engine right)')
