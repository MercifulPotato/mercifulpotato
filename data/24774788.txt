But turning it off and on again (while the signal condition is good) resets the high bitpool setting? And the workaround presented here is to basically disable the adaptive feature? If so, doesn&#x27;t that then mean it&#x27;ll start cutting out as you walk away, or is that that <i>also</i> switching to &#x27;dual&#x27; mode prevents?')
