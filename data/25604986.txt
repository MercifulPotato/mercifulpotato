Thus, the virus cannot be made more infectious without decreasing lethality.<p>There is however an interim period, as evolutionary arguments are long-term arguments, where the virus can be both more infectious and more deadly, before settling into its stationary state.<p>The molecular perspective isn’t too useful against an evolutionary argument as well — evolution is always a sum-of-the-parts system. The question is simply: is the virus ultimately more capable of spreading? And at least in the extreme, an instantly killed host is unlikely to do an real spreading, no matter how trivially the virus <i>could</i> spread (had the host persisted). And in the other extreme, a completely non-lethal virus can survive and spread forever, especially in dense populations, especially if it doesn’t incapacitate the host significantly (acting as a simple parasite), allowing it to continue meeting new hosts.<p>Of course, a virus that doesn’t need the victim to be the host is a different story; eg malaria persists and spreads through mosquitos, so it could instantly kill humans and yet receive no evolutionary pressure against it.')
