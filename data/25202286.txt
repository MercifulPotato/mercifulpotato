With TVs it means I usually stick to Sony. It&#x27;s a compromise because I genuinely like Sony&#x27;s TVs and it&#x27;s increasingly harder to find good TVs here that aren&#x27;t extremely user-hostile re: analytics. It looked like Sony are the lightest offender without going for a dramatically worse TV. They have one ACR toggle but I plan to switch it off and maybe even delete the package via ADB.<p>My family insisted on a Xiaomi TV because it&#x27;s much cheaper, so we agreed on just not connecting it to the internet. I set up a one-off personal hotspot to update it (in case they fixed bugs in the ISP or such), then killed the hotspot. With them it&#x27;s more of a (irrational?) suspicion in Xiaomi rather than anything proven, e.g.: I wouldn&#x27;t dare touch Samsung until they stop selling what are essentially data-harvesting ad displays.')
