The goals work for me, not the other way around. If I realize partway through the year that circumstances have changed or I set a bad goal, then I do something else.<p>This happened to a small degree this year. I knew that making a course would prevent me from achieving my goal of 10 blog posts, but I felt like it was okay to deliberately miss that goal in favor of something I thought made more sense.<p>But generally, I try to set goals that are high enough in abstraction that they don&#x27;t require adjustment when circumstances change.')
