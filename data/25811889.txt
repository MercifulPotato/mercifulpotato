It&#x27;s like you haven&#x27;t used a <i>good</i> touchpad. If you say things like &quot;Much quicker than dragging a pointer around everywhere&quot;, then <i>your current touchpad sucks</i>. If it ever feels like you&#x27;re <i>dragging</i> the cursor around, then you&#x27;re dealing with a touchpad that has inadequate sensitivity and precision that forces the cursor speed to be set unreasonably slow. Likewise for your complaint about zooming. A <i>good</i> touchpad is every bit as responsive as a touchscreen, and you&#x27;re not blocking half the screen with your opaque hand.<p>And on top of the touchscreen offering almost no advantages over a truly <i>good</i> touchpad, Apple&#x27;s touchpads have haptic feedback that isn&#x27;t really possible with a laptop-sized touchscreen. They also support a wider array of multi-touch gestures than most touchscreen software can recognize, and that&#x27;s <i>before</i> getting into third-party software that adds more gestures, such that touchpad gestures can replace about half of the keyboard shortcuts I use.')
