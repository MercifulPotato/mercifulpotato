Anandtech has nice charts here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16214&#x2F;amd-zen-3-ryzen-deep-dive-review-5950x-5900x-5800x-and-5700x-tested&#x2F;8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16214&#x2F;amd-zen-3-ryzen-deep-di...</a><p>TL;DR is that 5950X cores draw about 6W each with all cores loaded at around 3.8GHz per core. They scale up to 20W in the edge case where a single core is loaded at a full 5GHz.<p>&gt; And the M1 is running at a lower clock.<p>Comparing a power-optimized laptop chip to an all-out, top of the line desktop chip isn&#x27;t a great way to compare efficiency because power scaling is very nonlinear. The AMD could be made more efficient on a performance-per-watt basis by turning down the clock speed and reducing the operating voltage, but it&#x27;s a desktop chip so there&#x27;s no reason to do that.<p>Look at the power consumption versus frequency scaling in the Anandtech chart for the 5950X: Going from 3.8GHz to 5.0GHz takes the power from about 6W to 20W. That&#x27;s 230% more power for 30% more clockspeed. Apple is going to run into similar nonlinear power scaling when they move up to workstation class chips.<p>If you really wanted to compare power efficiency, you&#x27;d have to downclock and undervolt the AMD part until it performs similarly to the Apple part. But there&#x27;s no reason to do that, because no one buying a top of the line 5950X cares about performance per watt, they just want the fastest possible performance.<p>Comparing to an upcoming Zen3 laptop chip would be a more relevant comparison. The Apple part is still going to win on power efficiency, though.')
