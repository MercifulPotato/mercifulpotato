We are well off because we can make cheap things (including food). To make things arbitrarily more expensive would make everybody worse off.<p>Likewise clinging to inefficient means of production. The poor countries in Africa are poor because they can not produce as efficiently as other countries. Not because other countries give them cheap stuff.<p>I mean we would be making things more expensive via taxes, and give the tax money to Africa so that they can buy things more cheaply. Why not just sell them cheaply to Africa to begin with? Cut out the middle (tax) man.')
