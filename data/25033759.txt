I don&#x27;t have any funds to spare to help him out. I&#x27;m chronically broke myself.<p>I&#x27;ve done lots of nice things for people over the years for free. A lot of the things I&#x27;m good at are inherently hard to monetize (most moderating positions are unpaid, for example).<p>I was homeless for years. I still write about homelessness and try to provide other forms of support for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.<p>Some of the things that would help:<p>1. Universal health care coverage in the US. (&quot;free&quot;&#x2F;provided by the government)<p>2. Fix our housing policy issues such that more small housing in walkable neighborhoods becomes available.<p>If those two things were done, a single adult could potentially support themselves on part-time minimum wage work while renting a single room until they get back on their feet. That&#x27;s currently not feasible.<p>I am not against open source. (I just submitted my first pull request to open source a few hours ago.) But I do recognize that there are systemic issues and we need to make it easier for people to make their lives work so they don&#x27;t wind up all pissed off over what they have done for free when something goes sideways.')
