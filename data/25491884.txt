You can use a random access oterators with functions that take output iterators, forward iterators, multipass iterators etc. Of you had untelated concepts for each use case the system would be more complex.<p>&gt; Isn&#x27;t a contiguous iterator a leaky abstraction in that an iterator is just an interface that shouldn&#x27;t expose how the data backing it is stored?<p>Seeing thought abstractions and specializing algorithms is what makes STL style generic code efficient.<p>And it is not inconsistent at all.
