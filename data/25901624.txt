All the encryption warnings become meaningless at some point, because someone is always having issues and refreshes the session or something like that. Does that mean we&#x27;re getting MITM&#x27;ed?<p>You can&#x27;t delete Signal contacts, like, ever. My signal address book and synchronized chats are flooded with plain numbers, or self-titled user names (which also invites for identity fraud...), because I deleted those contacts in my phone (which ofc I need to do, because it&#x27;s used for privacy settings in other apps...). That&#x27;s a problem for many years now, the github issues get closed by maintenance bots.<p>I am a somewhat tech-savvy person, but even for me the user experience leaves me annoyed and uncertain about some basic functionality you expect from messaging apps these days. I stopped recommending it to people some time ago. Don&#x27;t want to blow my chances to migrate people to something fundamentally better.')
