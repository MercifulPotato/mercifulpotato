When you are forcing them on real history, you kind of prove there is harm.<p>The raids were real, but groups who performed them were behaving differently then Dothraki. They wore different cloth. They had different military tactic (notably smarter more coordinated one). They were actually organized and had much more complex internal culture.<p>They did raids, but were not Dotgraki. Had people did not claimed Dothraki are like those who did raids in reality, there would be no harm.')
