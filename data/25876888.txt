Buried nuclear blasts can dig pretty big holes (Sedan crater and all the other craters in the Nevada Test Site, which looks like the surface of the moon) and are certainly a huge fallout threat, but the claim of nuclear strikes against buried silos causing a nuclear winter is a new one to me.<p>Some napkin math: the Sedan test was optimized to dig a big hole, was buried almost 200 meters deep, and moved about 11 million tons of earth, leaving a crater of 0.005 cubic kilometers.  The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambura, which caused a &#x27;year without summer&#x27;, ejected 160-213 cubic kilometers of material into the stratosphere, something like 32 thousand times as much as the Sedan blast.  I&#x27;m guessing each strike against a nuclear silo would probably create craters a fraction the size of Sedan.')
