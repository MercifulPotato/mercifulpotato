I still don&#x27;t understand a few things though.<p>&gt; Profession like engineering, arts, temple building, city planning were all done by the 4th class.<p>What&#x27;s the use of this &quot;class system&quot; if one class covers such a broad area? Isn&#x27;t it so broad as to be useless?<p>&gt; clearly saying everyone is born lower class unless they earn their place.<p>Was this ever true in practice? It&#x27;s <i>definitely</i> not true in the present, and I find it hard to believe that parents were ever so enlightened as to compel their children to &quot;earn their place&quot; through such struggle.')
