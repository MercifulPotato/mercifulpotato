Even in a full nuclear exchange between all major nuclear powers, places such as patagonia, and new zealand will likely be unscathed.  Particulate matter does not generally cross the border between the northern and southern hemisphere and the vast majority of weapons will be detonated in the northern hemisphere.  This doesn&#x27;t include the countless habitable islands with the potential to sustain reasonably sized villages.<p>A similar story exists for bio-weapons and other means.  It&#x27;s definitely possible to end civilization today, but such technologies are unlikely to end humanity - worst case, rehabitation of the main continents takes 1-2 centuries for the worst fallout to decay and enable farming.<p>While I don&#x27;t subscribe to the view, there is modest evidence that scientific progress behaves like any other process of discovery - as a series of S curves where early progress is slow but speeding up every year, followed by a spike of progress and ultimately a steady period of diminishing returns.')
