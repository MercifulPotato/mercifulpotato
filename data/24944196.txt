Wayland won&#x27;t be production ready in a long time. Seriously it just came up here a few days ago, and just yesterday a friend of mine tried Linux on his desktop for the first time. He chose fedora for whatever reason, so ended up with gnome on Wayland. Since Steam was important to him and he&#x27;s running an NVIDIA card, after an hour of struggling I just guided him to disable Wayland. Not only did it fix all Steam issues, but it also fixed a problem he apparently had where applications occasionally lost mouse clicks. Needles to say, his first impression of Linux wasn&#x27;t too great, but once games worked properly he was happy. Let&#x27;s see how long he can do without Windows. :)')
