For a kind person it takes courage to be rude. It takes courage to say no, because it&#x27;s so easy to say yes, because it feels good and it feels right (and I guess is also better for your health?).<p>I would stop trying to change people or even thinking you can. Someone will pretend they changed all thanks to you, only to be themselves again later when they&#x27;re done robbing you.<p>There&#x27;s a pervasive pattern of the narcissist type surrounded by submissive people and leaving a trail of submissive victims. These people are immediately repelled if they sense you&#x27;re a waste of their efforts. When you&#x27;re submissive, they&#x27;ll take from you and betray you later. When you&#x27;re not, they don&#x27;t even ask. They reveal themselves immediately. But they make their money and build their empires by collecting those who yield to them and remain loyal despite occasional revelations of their true character or lack thereof. Trump could easily be seen as such a phenomenon. But most people who are OK with their job will yield to keep it (backed by the psychopathic behavior of corporations and their lack of character, because they aren&#x27;t people). And many will submit just to make money (even to evil). So there are no shortage of such people to take advantage of. And the more people thrive by doing so, the more we create. Some may even become president.<p>If you believe you&#x27;re water, seek water. That is the best approach. Strengthen your water coalition. Stay healthy, strong, and happy. Once you&#x27;re good, then fulfill your purpose.')
