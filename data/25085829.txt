The vast majority of subreddits are fine.  Toxicity is compartmentalized to specific subreddits, which you can very easily avoid.<p>On the other hand, I find a community like Stack Overflow to be much worse because the BS can strike any time, any place.  Between questions marked &quot;Off-Topic&quot;, and snarky replies, and the non-replies (&quot;We won&#x27;t answer your simple question because you should not be asking that!&quot;) you can&#x27;t avoid the negativity.')
