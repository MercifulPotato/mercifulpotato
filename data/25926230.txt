Noone uses their retro car for day-to-day business. They maybe use it to drive out on a warm summer day, but not to go to work. Just like how you&#x27;d use a retro computer in your spare time to enjoy some classic games and not to post on Hacker News or get actual work done.<p>Technically, sure, you can use your retro car every day. But most people don&#x27;t, probably because it would be less practical and also lower the value of the car over time.')
