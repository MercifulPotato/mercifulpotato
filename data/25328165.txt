Maybe the answer is the opposite of what we are thinking.<p>LEGO already has a massive advertising program, and they know that everyone knows who and what they are. So they may not need to specifically target you, because they know that sooner or later, you’ll go to Target or Walmart or Amazon, and buy their products. Whether it is for your own kids, for yourself, or for your nieces and nephews.<p>However, Water Clarity Filter Company, just came into existence a few years ago, and they’re now making a push to sell their products.<p>Now, Water Clarity Filter Company knows that they can’t spend the money like LEGO can for mass advertising, and either way, it won’t be effective. They know that their best bet, are to target home owners, that may or may not have a water filter, but maybe with a little targeted advertising, they might jump on the opportunity to buy a water filter on sale.<p>So when you see this ad for a water filter, you may not be interested in buying it now, but maybe you will next year. And the odds go up, if you are also within the target demographic range that they are looking for.<p>The same can be said for a LEGO competitor, say Blocky Block Toys. If you’re in their targeted demographic, they may want to advertise to you to make you aware of their toys, as an alternative to LEGO.')
