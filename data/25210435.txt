Ultimately that stock has a value, a share of the company&#x27;s profits and assets. If you find a stock that you can purchase at a reasonable price for your expectation of those profits and assets, it doesn&#x27;t matter what that CEO says.<p>If value investing doesn&#x27;t appeal, you can absolutely play speculation games against all of the other people playing speculation games. Value investing is dull and plodding, and to be honest, the usual advice about index funds feels hollow on a day when the S&amp;P 500&#x27;s P&#x2F;E is pushing 40.<p>But I, personally, would rather leave my money in a bank account than play speculation games in any asset. I just don&#x27;t have the stomach for it. If you do, I wish you the best of luck.')
