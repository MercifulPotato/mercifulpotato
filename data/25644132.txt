Everyone agrees Copenhagen is just kicking the can down the road.  I&#x27;m just saying, let&#x27;s not act like we have a ton of viable theories to fill out the rest of the road; in the meanwhile, we still have to perform measurements and make predictions, and the projection postulate is handy for that.<p>(It would help tremendously if we ever measured quantum states that weren&#x27;t &quot;collapsed&quot;, but as we&#x27;ve never done this so far it makes most of the stochastic collapse stuff hard to justify, even if it seems intuitively like the right approach).')
