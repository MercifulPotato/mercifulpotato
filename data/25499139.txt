Some of us go against the grain, and that&#x27;s a good thing. But you appear intent in making any true <i>belief</i> in unpopular alternatives into a sin. God forbid someone have a <i>fringe</i> belief! <i>Fringe</i> is BAD and <i>consensus</i> is GOOD. No independent thought. No room for dreamers and speculators and hunch-havers in your world. At most they can coldly look at evidence for alternative theories while not <i>believing</i> them (and resist all cognitive biases with superhuman ability). Have you even considered that fringe belief, and obsession and cognitive bias in <i>its</i> favor, is essential for progress too?')
