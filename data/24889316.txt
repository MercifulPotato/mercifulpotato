For a technical audience, they are amazingly unaware of &quot;Systems Thinking&quot;. Saying &quot;MEH, there are other pollinators&quot; is lazy thinking. Our ecosystem is a vast web of interconnections. You cannot predict how one HUGELY important species being destroyed will affect the rest of our ecosystem.<p>FWIW honeybees are not part of the native US ecosystem, they were imported from europe. They are likely important if not critical to the pollination of several cash crops, but they&#x27;re not an ecosystem concern in and of themselves.<p><i>However</i> giant asian hornets are rather indiscriminate in their hunting, in fact their main prey in japan are large insects like mantises (as well as other hornets). GAH taking root in the US would be an unmitigated disaster all around, not just for beekeeping.')
