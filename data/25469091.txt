I don&#x27;t think that really is the bottleneck. You still need a LOT of testing as the viral antigen you are trying to vaccinate against can have similarities to human proteins for example, and the antigen might simply be a bad antigen for immunization - and this requires a lot of testing and studies.<p>The normal yearly influenza vaccines are also fast for example because they are well known platforms and also the antigens repeat historically and are thus (relatively) well tested.<p>I guess my point is that the problem of the vector to get the antigen in contact with the immune system is orthogonal to the problem of selecting the antigen for overall cross reactivity and efficiency and the latter is still a difficult and timeconsuming problem.')
