These are more than typographical errors (did you read the above?). Willful concealment of exculpatory evidence (his lie to cover his mistakes) is a civil rights violation, depriving the accused of a fair trial as prescribed under Brady vs Maryland. This is not de minimus as it should fit the definition of official oppression or malicious prosecution, much greater issues than the summary offense citation. So if you give a free pass on misdemeanor offenses of the trooper as de minimus, then surely the summary offense should be dismissed?<p>Not to mention that it does not matter what the severity of the offense is. The same protections of the law and adherence to rule of law is necessary at all levels to ensure the integrity of the system and the protection of the people&#x27;s rights. If you contend that a traffic violation doesn&#x27;t merit the same attention and protections by the system, then I would contend that the traffic violation would be a de minimus infraction and doesn&#x27;t merit any attention at all - better a legitimate outcome that some half-ass fuckery that violates the rights of the citizenry.')
