She is presenting her findings, showing exactly how she did it, and asking for feedback (&quot;I hope I hear more from people who have done more than me&quot; - 43:10).<p>You can follow her workflow and disagree - and probably will! But that&#x27;s ok - that&#x27;s how science works. I look forward to many well-written posts going through her analysis and showing alternate interpretations. I&#x27;m guessing she looks forward to this too.')
