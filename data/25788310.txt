Usually by doing the bare minimum to load a second-stage bootloader off the disc, and letting the second-stage bootloader do the rest of the work, since 512 bytes (actually only ~440) is really not very much.<p>The second is UEFI.  The firmware will load a PE-formatted executable from a .efi-suffixed file on a FAT32 partition which has the EFI System Partition (ESP) flag set.  Since this PE file can be any size, a second-stage bootloader is not generally necessary (but may be interesting for aesthetic reasons e.g. if you don&#x27;t like PE).')
