For larger file, each object in S3 is about 4MiB. Most of S3 Client will do the similar thing to GET&#x2F;PUT small parts in parallel to speed things up. Overall, JuiceFS should use the similar number of GET&#x2F;PUT request comparing to use S3 directly.<p>Second, all the List and Head request go to Redis, they are free, so you may save some cost on API costs.<p>Third, the frequently read data will be cached in your local disks, so you will also save some cost on GET&#x2F;PUT requests.')
