They care about marketing. And customers aren&#x27;t willing to hold them to task for their BS.<p>I work for a <i>US defense contractor</i> who uses their infernal software - specifically for export restricted communication no less! Apparently it&#x27;s very easy to get FedRAMP authorization[0].<p>Zoom has no reason to care about security because their customers clearly don&#x27;t care. E2E encryption is just another marketing bullet for their website. There wont be another backlash because everyone who cares already abandoned the platform.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.fedramp.gov&#x2F;#!&#x2F;product&#x2F;zoom-for-government?sort=productName&amp;productNameSearch=zoom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.fedramp.gov&#x2F;#!&#x2F;product&#x2F;zoom-for-governme...</a>')
