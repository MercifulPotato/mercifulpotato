Videos discussing political opinion on a certain topic without calling for violence are removed.<p>&gt;I&#x27;d like to just keep it to the facts of whether this FTC action could, in this user&#x27;s opinion, be part of such a thing.  [Gathering information on users for the purposes of censorship]<p>Thanks for any opinion or feedback.')
