People from the cities get exposed to a more rural or fly-over life and people from the center of the country get exposed to people and ideas from the bigger cities. There&#x27;s a huge gap between the cities and the rest of the country, and that gap is just growing wider. It&#x27;s been the source of a lot of political discomfort, and that&#x27;s not going to go away if we keep up this economic and political segregation.<p>Another good intention might be to spur economic activity in areas where the local economy is in decline or completely gone. There&#x27;s a lot of money and wealth and opportunities created in cities that only trickles back down to the rest of the country <i>very</i> indirectly (through government subsidies paid for by taxes, for example). Imagine if even half of West Virginia University&#x27;s engineering graduates stayed local and built their fortunes in Morgantown (or Charleston) instead of moving to San Fransisco to work for Google or Facebook. Their tax revenues staying local would be <i>huge</i> for a <i>lot</i> of people who are suffering in abject poverty in WV right now.')
