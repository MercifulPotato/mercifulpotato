Less analysis is needed when one converts from Access to the new thing because the ideas are road tested. But one problem is that modern web stacks are a bloated incoherent mess that take an army of specialists to manage. That may be part of the reason for the resurgence of &quot;no code&quot; tools.<p>But the real fix is to simplify web stacks for smaller projects. We don&#x27;t need Rube Goldberg routing engines&#x2F;URL-prettifiers, ORM organics, Bootcrap organics (UI), Async&#x2F;Await bloat, etc.  We want our app track some local e-paper-work, not be Netflix. A Learjet will do, don&#x27;t gear it for Jumbo Jets. Time for a KISS web stack to become a de-facto standard.')
