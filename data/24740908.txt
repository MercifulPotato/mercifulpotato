Different foundations respond to that pressure in different ways.<p>I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to assume that just because a project is at a foundation that it is independent by any useful definition.  It&#x27;s possible for dominant players to set things up such that they maintain effective control over the governance of a project which resides at a foundation.  It&#x27;s possible to generalize when you know the foundation, but it&#x27;s not possible to generalize across all foundations.')
