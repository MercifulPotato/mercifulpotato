Republicans say &quot;smaller government&quot;, yet the government doesn&#x27;t shrink. Democrats say &quot;out of Iraq&quot;, yet the troops are still there.<p>I actually think by and large politicians try to deliver on their promises. Democrats: healthcare, gay (and minority) rights, increased social safety net. Republicans: less immigration, lower taxes, less regulation. Overall, Democrats tend to reduce military spending (or keep it below the trend for the rest of the budget), while Republicans tend to increase it.<p>It is true that none of the parties is making a serious effort to balance the budget. But that&#x27;s a genuinely hard thing to do from a political standpoint.')
