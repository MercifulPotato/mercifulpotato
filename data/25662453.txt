In a way, I think this kind of rhetoric empowers these kinds of protests and inspires people into thinking these actions might actually work.<p>In reality, the long term impact of these actions is only going to hurt Republicans. As per The Economist [1], in 2000 the election was decided by only ~600 votes in Florida but still only 36% of Gore supporters felt the election was fraudulent. Only 23% of Clinton voters felt the same in 2016. Yet now, with an election decided by margins an order of magnitude larger than in 2016 and three orders of magnitude larger than in 2000 a staggering 88% of Trump supporters surveyed said they believed the election was fraudulent. This kind of brazen hypocrisy, and now coupled by the actions today, are going to stick with the Republican party for a long time. Most of the Republicans I know are aghast. I&#x27;m sure the set of Republicans I talk to are not representative (mostly college educated professionals), and that they&#x27;ll alter how they communicate with an outwardly liberal person like me (deliberately or instinctively). But I think the Republican party is going to recognize Trump as a catastrophe that is leaving a deep scar in the party.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;21&#x2F;donald-trumps-refusal-to-concede-is-harming-america" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;21&#x2F;donald-tr...</a>')
