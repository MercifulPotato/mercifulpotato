Even if code is GPL if you own it you can do what you want with it. That includes licensing it to someone under a _different_ licence. Being available under the GPL does not mean it can&#x27;t also be available under another licence, such as a proprietary one. Which is what is done in this situation.<p>&gt; but it does redefine the choices to &quot;clone software entirely&quot; or &quot;fork existing software and share changes&quot; .. it removes the option of &quot;fork existing software and DON&#x27;T share changes&quot;<p>None of this is true.')
