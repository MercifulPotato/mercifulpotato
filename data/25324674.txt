Item(by='ecpottinger', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607273654, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25323846, text='BeOS and Haiku not only used MIME types but they also use the magic number approach to add a MIME type to a file if they only got the raw file.<p>Also unless I read the docs wrong SmallTalk added MIME types for creator&#x2F;editor&#x2F;viewer to a file.  So you could find what created a file but could tell the OS to use a different program to edit the file and even still another program to just view the contents.<p>Please correct me if I am wrong.')
