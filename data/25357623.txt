Looking back at all the hassle that it has always been in Processing and OpenFrameworks (p5.js is lucky to have a browser do the heavy lifting here) this doesn&#x27;t surprise me, so kudos to Nannou for taking the time to try and figure this out properly.<p>Still, do you have any idea on what the progress is in that department?<p>Does the Rust ecosystem provide specific alternatives for individual set-ups? For example, in my case I only care about video capture for Linux. I see that there is a v4l crate out there, as well as something for ffmpeg[1][2]. Is that easy to combine with Nannou? I have zero experience with Rust but if this is not too much hassle I might give it a shot.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guide.nannou.cc&#x2F;why_nannou.html#goals" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guide.nannou.cc&#x2F;why_nannou.html#goals</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;v4l" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;v4l</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;ffmpeg-next" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;ffmpeg-next</a>')
