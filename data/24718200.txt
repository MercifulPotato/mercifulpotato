Or maybe your employer suddenly thinks it doesn&#x27;t need to care about equality or employment law and the like etc now we&#x27;re out of the EU, or are taking a liberal interpretation of any new legislation that is screwing over the workers etc.<p>If the company is going bust after brexit there probably isn&#x27;t much here that can be done, but if it is just downsizing&#x2F;cost-cutting etc or instigates some questionable &amp; unfavourable new policies you at least have some element of help, even if it is just giving you some advice or sending your employer a letter from their legal people etc.<p>Might buy you some time or a better exit-package if nothing else. Having looked down the barrel of two potential-redundancies (that were avoided eventually) in the last few years without anyone to talk to about &quot;is this fair? am I getting screwed? what can I do?&quot; etc, it is well worth it for the peace of mind and the feeling that you have someone who can go out to bat on your behalf if you think you&#x27;ve been screwed IMO.  Everyone talks about how the employee-employer relationship is totally skewed towards the employer, this at least feels like you stand a chance if anything bad happens.<p>Uncertain times.')
