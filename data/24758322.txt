Have to say something about this declaration.<p>First of all, its principal authors are legitimate medical specialists, who happen to hold a contrarian opinion. This is fine. Science doesn&#x27;t work without discussions and clashes of contradicting point of view.<p>However, the declaration is written in very political, not scientific language. The mention of &quot;herd immunity&quot; doesn&#x27;t give it any good points, too. Regardless of what anybody might think, most epidemiologists are quite aware that full lockdown is a nuclear option, that will be tried only after all other means have failed. We hate lockdowns just like everybody else. As the nuclear option, it works, but all of us are currently busy trying to figure out anything, really anything, that could bring the reproduction rate below 1 without resorting to a full lockdown. We work long days and weekends for that. So it is quite unfair to blame researchers and politicians for this. Nobody wants it.<p>And just in case â€” no, you wouldn&#x27;t want to leave the virus with the reproduction rate &gt; 1 unchecked. With that, sooner or later (but in quite a short time, several months top) medical systems everywhere will be catastrophically overloaded. Then, all the hell breaks loose.')
