The original purpose of JS made sense.<p>The trouble is that&#x27;s it&#x27;s been grossly abused by web sites on two fronts. The first is bloat and the second is privacy. Web pages with multiple megabytes of data per page are just not on in my view but they&#x27;re commonplace and seemingly getting worse. The second is using JS as spyware. If you look at the table in my post it&#x27;s clear what I mean, this info should be off limits to remote servers.<p>I&#x27;ve long advocated that we need modified JS engines in browsers that would hand control back to users.  For instance, the parameters above could be singlely or collectively turned off or on in setings. Alternatively, the user could set one or more of these parameters to provide the server with spoofed info. If that became popular then web sites would discontinue the process as the data would be useless.')
