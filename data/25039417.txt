Basically, they decided to re-build Witchbrook on top of Wargroove&#x27;s engine.<p>That being said, I guess I should have put an asterisk on there; they aren&#x27;t using Rust <i>in game</i> anymore, but they are still (apparently, last we heard) using Rust for server-side components. Wargroove&#x27;s servers are implemented in Rust.')
