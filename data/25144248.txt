But we can&#x27;t just call that the beginning and end of it.<p>I read books on my phone. I&#x27;ve probably read hundreds of thousands of pages, I&#x27;ve got a library that is a very respectable size on my phone. Is reading them a sign of addiction to my phone? Or is it the same as reading paper? Am I just using my phone as a tool?<p>I don&#x27;t take pictures except to document things. I don&#x27;t have any of those social media accounts people use to share photos or videos of themselves or whatever. I see women (and men) on the beach (or elsewhere) who&#x27;s goal is to get a cute photo. I feel like they&#x27;re wasting such a wonderful experience on a narcissistic persuit.<p>But I spend hours on sites like this one talking to other people. Talking to people I don&#x27;t know, people I do know, people I only know online. Sometimes about stupid stuff, sometimes about interesting stuff. It&#x27;s not something I use for passive entertainment really very often. If I&#x27;m pondering life, making bonds, questioning my own beliefs, is that as simple as a social media addiction? Is it constructive?<p>I know I am addicted to my phone and the internet in general. And it has detrimental effects on my life. But it has been very intellectually constructive for me. I have expanded my vocabulary quite a lot, I have learned to articulate my thoughts very well. I have learned to write code and about quantum particles and I&#x27;ve read research papers. I&#x27;ve talked to some very interesting people, even some very important people. So is it all bad?<p>I think the trick is to not make it your life. Go outside, dig your hands in the soil, grow something. Immerse yourself in the moment where what is going into your senses is not curated by you or someone else. I do a decent job of not touching my phone when I&#x27;m out there. But I&#x27;d say I haven&#x27;t struck that balance quite yet, because I don&#x27;t go out there enough. I used to go out there every day and get dirty. I need to do that again.')
