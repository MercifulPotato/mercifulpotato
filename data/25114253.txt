In this way, any arbitrarily long distance can be treated as flat by chaining together the successive midpoints of X[1...N].<p>This is the theory of Non-Intuitive Cumulative Flatness (NICF) and is indeed rather ground breaking. The rugged persistence of flat-earthers over the years demonstrates that their claims <i>must</i> have some validity, and yet every last bit of empirical evidence refutes their viewpoint. NICF offers a unified theory of flat-curved earth geometry, much the same way that science has tried to bridge the gap between general relativity &amp; quantum physics, to bridge these two contradictory theories and thus, demonstrate the earth to be both curved &amp; flat.<p>Methods &amp; applications that may take advantage of both geometries are currently underway. Most notably, finding the edge of the flat geometry would allow launching of space vehicles under significantly lower escape velocities, at which point the vehicle could transition to the curve geometry.<p>Softbank is highly interested, and a &gt; $1billion funding round may be closing shortly after a successful MVP demonstration using a highly modded version of Kerbal Space Program.')
