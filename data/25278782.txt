Item(by='patrec', descendants=None, kids=[25280828], score=None, time=1606930142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25277600, text='Yes, the standard allows this, but that doesn&#x27;t mean inlining is straightforward, in the sense that the compiler can&#x27;t just magically figure out unaided whether to inline stuff or not and all is well as the GP wanted. Whether two functions were defined in the same file has basically zero bearing on the desirability of inlining, so the fact that recompiling a whole file rather than an individual function is not particuarly onerous doesn&#x27;t really help that much. Also, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but I don&#x27;t think anything that sbcl does if you pass :block-compile t goes beyond what would already be allowed by the standard as default (by contrast, CMUCL&#x27;s block compilation supported multiple files and thus essentially also whole-program optimization). The fact that it&#x27;s not the default (despite likely non-trivial performance benefits) probably indicates that a majority of users would find this behavior problematic as default, regardless of whether it is standard conformant.')
