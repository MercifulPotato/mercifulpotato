There’s a big difference between a company not selling you something versus the government censoring you.<p>The complicating issue is that we are ceding more and more control of our public spaces to private companies. So, on one hand, a place like Twitter should be able to ban whomever they want, while on the other hand, at what point does not having access to Twitter represent a de facto censorship of public speech? I don’t think we’re there yet (or really all that close), but we’re headed in that direction.')
