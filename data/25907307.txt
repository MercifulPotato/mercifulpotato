I guess different people review and interpret the rules differently so maybe this is unavoidable.<p>Google (from what I can tell) seems to take a very different approach and relies much more on automated enforcement. The process is on average much lower friction for the developer, but getting previously approved app listings removed at any time without warning is <i>not</i> a good experience.<p>Edit: I forgot to mention that you can&#x27;t actually edit the metadata while the app is suspended and re-submit it for review. The only two choices are to appeal and edit the description <i>after</i> the app is reinstated, or create a completely new app listing.')
