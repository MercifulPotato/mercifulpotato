I always have this feeling that if you classify yourself like &quot;oh yeah I&#x27;m this kind of person&quot; it&#x27;ll harm you in one way or another. Yes sometimes these kinds of stuff could be fun and all, but still.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just meaningless to classify. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, idk.')
