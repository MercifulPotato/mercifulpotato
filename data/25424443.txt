Ask the people who&#x27;ve tried to repackage Firefox without fully stripping the branding, and get prodded by Mozilla&#x27;s lawyers.<p>Here it&#x27;s a case of semantics, whether you&#x27;re talking about the open-source software or the full package including services from Mozilla and the Firefox branding. Firefox as a whole is certainly proprietary to Mozilla, even if the code is not.<p>I suspect the intent re: signal is similar, where the code is indeed open-source, but IIRC signal doesn&#x27;t network with non-official clients?<p>Probably best to avoid using the word &quot;proprietary&quot; because of the confusion&#x2F;connotations, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <i>entirely</i> wrong.')
