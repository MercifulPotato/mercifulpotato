You probably believe this to be a lie<p>That&#x27;s an opinion, not a lie. A lie would be saying &quot;pigs grow on trees&quot;, &quot;in a monarchy the king is chosen in an election every four years&quot; or &quot;the earth is flat&quot;, to put some examples.<p>&gt; So why do I believe it? Because it makes sense to me.<p>What is it then, people believe lies because it makes sense to them or because other people lie?')
