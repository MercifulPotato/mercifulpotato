They&#x27;re coming in, figuring out how to get the technology to work, paying for the infrastructure (or getting others to pay), and setting it up so that Toyota can come in and scoop up the market.<p>I think Tesla is in for a difficult future. They seem to not understand that the people that buy Camry are not the same that buy Mercedes. Playing the same brand to the luxury crowd and the cost-conscious crowd has never, to my knowledge, worked. People will probably point to Apple, but Apple isn&#x27;t luxury. It&#x27;s premium. You really have to compare Rolex or Patek to Apple Watch to see where the rubber meets the road. The Model 3 is about $10k over the price point they need to be, and rolling that out just about damn near killed Elon from reports I&#x27;ve read. As they target the cheaper market, their margins drop and then they risk losing the Mercedes crowd entirely. So there go their fat margins. I&#x27;d imagine their warranty costs also increase and will squeeze them as well.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine Panasonic, LG, etc. sitting around while Tesla whips them around on the battery tech front, either. Tesla is like a toddler trying to be a conglomerate. Elon is stretched so thin he&#x27;s going to have a mental breakdown.')
