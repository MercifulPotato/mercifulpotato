Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[24683637, 24683731], score=None, time=1601859433, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24683414, text='&gt; If someone is rich enough to rent things to others, by definition, they have more than they need.<p>This is not the case. There are a significant number of landlords for which renting out properties is their occupation. You have someone who owns a small apartment complex, lives in one of the units, rents out the others, and their primary job is to be the superintendent and caretaker of the property. The rents pay their salary and the property tax and insurance on the building. Without them they can&#x27;t pay their taxes or expenses and have nothing with which to buy food. Meanwhile the tenants are still living there and expecting the property to be maintained. In many cases the rent includes utilities, which the landlord can&#x27;t pay if they don&#x27;t receive rent to pay it with. And they&#x27;re not the 1%, they&#x27;re just a regular person whose full-time occupation is property maintenance.<p>There is no reason in putting the cost on such people, but also no fairness in waiving the rents of only those people who live in housing that really is owned by the 1%.<p>Which is why things like rent forgiveness and student loan forgiveness are intrinsically unfair and the better way to deal with those sorts of problems is stimulus checks. Anyone who needs the money gets it, meanwhile people who don&#x27;t need it as much aren&#x27;t punished for being more responsible and have the money to stimulate demand at a time when unemployment is higher than normal, and the money can come from taxes paid disproportionately by the people who actually do have more than they need rather than people we&#x27;re only assuming do (and some of them don&#x27;t).')
