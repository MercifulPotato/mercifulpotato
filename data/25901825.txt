Of course I was left out of oh-so-many groups and discussions in the past years, but I was <i>never</i> going to install or use that, I don&#x27;t trust Facebook regarding privacy the tiniest bit and I think they always lied regarding which data they use and how.<p>Now I suddenly have so many people appearing on Signal, my wife was asked by their friends: &quot;Hey, you weren&#x27;t on WhatsApp, but I am now on Signal, so would you consider talking there?&quot;.<p>I admit, I did not push anyone anywhere, not even my wife. I&#x27;m past being an &quot;influencer&quot; and having to deal with &quot;... but you told me to use this?!&quot; - particularly my wife.<p>But just referring to the &quot;network effect&quot; and continue doing something you are uncomfortable with is being complicit IMO. You can control what <i>you</i> do, and do the right thing.')
