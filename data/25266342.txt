It&#x27;s an efficient way to meet 40+ vetted, funded YC startups all at once.<p>We start the event with rapid pitches from founders -- like Demo Day, but for engineers instead of investors -- to give you a quick way to survey the companies. After the pitches, we open up an expo hall (again, all virtual) to give you a chance to meet founders and early employees 1-1, learn more about the domain and technology, and hear about open roles. You can see the companies here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;startup-career-expo-s20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;startup-career-expo-s2...</a><p>These startups are vetted by YC and have raised a healthy round of funding. A good number of the roles they are hiring for are in engineering and design, but there will also be non-tech roles as well.<p>We’re finding more people are joining YC startups this year, and for a variety of reasons: to have a bigger impact through their work, to learn how to start their own startup, to grow skills in ways that their current jobs won’t allow, and (yes) to seek out “the next big thing”.<p>If you might be considering something new -- or even if you’re just curious to know what’s out there -- we welcome you to join YC and our founders for an informative and efficient evening of networking, job hunting or just seeing if startups are for you.<p>Learn more and apply to attend:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;startup-career-expo-s20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;startup-career-expo-s2...</a>')
