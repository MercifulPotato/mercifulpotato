It&#x27;s Da Vinci level stuff. Humanist \n    It is totally opposite of what they build, such an amazing contrast and deeply thought out [1]\n  - One or two videos per year\n  - No twitter drama like a lot of SV companies (Hey, Elon)\n  - No excessive trying to get their word out. Their products speak for themselves\n  - No purple&#x2F;gradient bullshit and design trends\n  - Their job descriptions actually make sense of what they need from you\n  - Their CEO, Marc Raibert, exudes wisdom, calm and has a persona of composure (seriously, watch his interviews) [2]\n  - No AI hype\n</code></pre>\nLiterally the opposite of Silicon Valley. May be I&#x27;ve had too much coffee and making lofty generalizations, but this is what I see! I also see the DNA of East coast&#x2F;MIT&#x2F;Boston rigor vs Silicon Valley cowboys - thoughts? :-) I live and work in SV btw.<p>I can&#x27;t get over how amazing this video is. I hope it takes over the top spot on Youtube. It&#x27;s got everything - music&#x2F;tech&#x2F;memes. The people behind BD marketing are geniuses IMO, although building an explosively-cool tech that appeals to all humans helps a lot. Outstanding.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bostondynamics.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bostondynamics.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LiNSPRKHyvo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LiNSPRKHyvo</a>')
