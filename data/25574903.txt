It&#x27;s Da Vinci level stuff. Humanist. It is totally opposite of what they build.\n  - One or two videos per year\n  - No twitter drama like a lot of SV companies (Hey, Elon)\n  - No excessive production aspects\n  - No purple&#x2F;gradient bullshit we see in literally every SV company&#x27;s branding\n  - Their job descriptions actually make sense of what they need from you\n  - Their CEO exudes wisdom, calm and has a persona of composure (seriously, watch his interviews)\n</code></pre>\nLiterally the opposite of Silicon Valley. May be I&#x27;ve had too much coffee and making lofty generalizations, but this is what I see! I also see the DNA of East coast&#x2F;MIT rigor and Silicon Valley cowboys - thoughts? :-)')
