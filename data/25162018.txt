I also got interested to read about Erlang and the original Actor pattern there.  In your motivation doc I clicked the Erlang&#x2F;OTP link to the main Erlang page, but I kind of had the same problem there, of having a hard time finding some light reading introducing the motivation of Erlang.<p>Their documentation section doesn&#x27;t immediately yield anything that looks like quick reading to understand the motivation or design philosophy.  I could not figure out how to navigate <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;erlang.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;erlang.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;</a> to find introductory material.<p>Do you have any pointers to good reading that would introduce the Actor pattern in Erlang?')
