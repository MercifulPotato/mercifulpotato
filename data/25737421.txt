As such, many courts are throwing out cases brought by police about violating pandemic restrictions. Proceeding law changes about refusing tickets now, just feels like blatantly like: &quot;Oh, they are not accepting tickets based on unlawful regulations? Let&#x27;s make it harder to refuse ticket!&quot;')
