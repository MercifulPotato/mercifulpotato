Just saw a toddler yesterday doing random things and having so much fun in the puddles, it was reeeeally cute. Good memories.<p>What nobody tells you though is that annoyingness and cuteness go hand in hand. As soon as they stop being annoying, they also stop being cute. It&#x27;s hard to enjoy much of that cuteness because life&#x27;s generally hard, loud and exhausting with a toddler. But as soon as it starts getting better, you also realize how much you miss that will never come back.<p>As Paul Graham said so wisely: There are only 52 weekends you will ever have with your three year old. Life is short, use it. Or at the very least, try to :)')
