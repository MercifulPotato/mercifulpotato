It means there are more productive members of society with vast troves of experience and skill, all of whom no longer have the excuse of &quot;I&#x27;ll be dead by the time this becomes a problem&quot;. The solution to limited resources isn&#x27;t rationing, it&#x27;s to get more resources and make more efficient (not limited) use of them.<p>&gt; We are not prepared to live that long, either, emotionally or physically<p>That&#x27;s, like, your opinion man. Me, I&#x27;m incredibly excited to spend as long as it takes to see and learn everything I can in this universe. The idea of a time limit does more emotional harm to me than the idea of infinity.<p>&gt; The more we use technology and bioscience to alter our basic physiology and life history, the more trouble we will be in<p>This is just an appeal to nature. Plainly wrong, you may think you would be a happy hunter gatherer but I&#x27;d strongly recommend you try before you buy that one. Nature, for all its temporary beauty, sucks when there is no escape from it. We developed technology to separate ourselves from nature when it gets nasty. Don&#x27;t believe me? Drive out to the country at 2am, strip naked and try lying in a field for as long as you can. See how much sleep you get. Bonus points if you do it in winter.<p>I seriously hope biotech becomes the next darling of industry and research. We&#x27;re starting to hit the wall with electronics, there are still gains to be made but the low hanging fruit is gone and it&#x27;s going to take much longer between breakthrough advancements. Biotech is just getting started, with enough of a push we can grow by leaps and bounds in the next decades. I hope my children will grow up in a world free from the miseries of disease and death.')
