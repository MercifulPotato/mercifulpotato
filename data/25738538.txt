Well we&#x27;ll see. Everyone believed that CDP is big studio yet if you see on CP2077 credits most of graphics &#x2F; QA work was outsourced, 3-4 people were working on AI and only 1 on R&amp;D software. They managed to make game on their own engine and launch it on 5 platforms at the same time that&#x27;s impressive to me based on number of developers I saw in credits.<p>At the end it&#x27;s always people fault. I don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s all ok with CP2077 game but people were so much depressed at the end of 2020 that even if this game worked they would be angry cause everyone demanded different things, probably 90% of people who bought the game are happy cause the story is solid and you can go trough story without problems - all major main story related problems were fixed before Christmas. If you focus on dialogues and don&#x27;t try to destroy city like in GTA the game is great. I see that most of those who are angry wanted GTA in future and are now pissed that they can&#x27;t play it like GTA and they&#x27;re trying to make it GTA using various mods. You can just go and see what mods are most popular - those are mods that mimics GTA game. They&#x27;re probably even not target group of this game and shouldn&#x27;t play it but they&#x27;re like junkies and even if you tell them that they don&#x27;t have to play this game and they can refund they&#x27;re be angry about it cause they want to play this game how they like it and they want to play it like GTA. That&#x27;s insanity.')
