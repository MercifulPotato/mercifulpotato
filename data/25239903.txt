Eventually I stopped in a random suburb and knocked on a few doors until I found someone who was willing and able to tell me how to get somewhere I recognized. I was hopeless before Waze and similar apps became ubiquitous; I&#x27;ve always have to print out mapquest directions just to go to the store. For some reason, routing and directions can be very difficult for me.')
