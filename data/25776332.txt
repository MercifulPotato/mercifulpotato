When an AppImage is opened with AIL, it moves it to a configurable ~&#x2F;app directory and creates a &quot;start menu&quot; entry for it.<p>I&#x27;ve never though about it but I guess it also makes them executable, since I&#x27;ve never had to do that myself.<p>It doesn&#x27;t handle removing the AppImage, but you can always just delete the file from ~&#x2F;apps.')
