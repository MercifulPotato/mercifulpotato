The WaveNet stuff is really interesting, but I&#x27;m not a DSP&#x2F;ML expert. I could help you:<p>* Model a Dr. Z Maz 38 MkII, 5w Fender Tweed Champ, Ampeg SCR-DI preamp&#x2F;DI<p>* Provide raw samples of: Gibson Les Paul 1958 Reissue (R8), Fender Telecaster (1955 type partscaster), Fender Stratocaster (1962 &quot;thin skin&quot; reissue), Gibson 1963 SG Junior Reissue, Fender 1958 Precision Bass Reissue, Taylor 814ce acoustic guitar<p>* Get the code installed on my local, test whatever you need help testing, etc.<p>* Testing and feedback on the real-time plugin i.e. using a VST&#x2F;AU in Logic, testing latency, testing sound against in-room amp sound, etc.<p>I&#x27;d also be interested in figuring out how to get the real-time plugin you&#x27;re developing into a pedal enclosure. I have a friend who is a top notch silicon valley hardware&#x2F;power engineer, and we&#x27;ve been toying with the Strymon Iridium, Impulse Responses, analog pedal building, etc. It&#x27;d be interesting to use some guerrilla marketing, sell a few pedals on The Gear Page, and see what people think.<p>benstandefer (at) &lt;google&#x27;s email service&gt; (dot) com')
