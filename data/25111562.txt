The second they pop up in a real auction the police are involved and the whole chain goes down.  Their real value usually comes in as a bargaining chip if caught for some other crime.  The second way is if someone specific wants to have an item.  There is no real &#x27;market&#x27; for these type of stolen items.  The third way is to &#x27;ransom&#x27; them.
