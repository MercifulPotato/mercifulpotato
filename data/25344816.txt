Item(by='valenterry', descendants=None, kids=[25344866], score=None, time=1607434701, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344735, text='Well, Fargate is simpler in the way that I define CPU+RAM, give it an image, tell it how many of them to run in parallel and let it run. If something crashes it will be restarted. If I want to deploy I push a new image.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much it. The container cannot be accessed from the outside except for the defined interfaces like http, the containers cannot discover each other unless I use something else to coordinate between them. That is all restrictive, but it also makes things simple.<p>I still need to do health-check and such - so if I don&#x27;t really need long running containers, I can make it even simpler by using lambda. (well in theory, I don&#x27;t like lambda, but that&#x27;s because of the implementation only)')
