It seems to contradict your earlier assertions and despite that I&#x27;m not sure how it would be true on its own.<p>&gt; To claim otherwise is just the semantic game of &quot;oh, I don&#x27;t mean those rights&quot;.<p>Well, I don&#x27;t think its a <i>meaningless</i> semantic argument for people to discuss what specifically is referred to by &quot;rights.&quot; If you think people have a right to steal food out of other people&#x27;s homes then I can see why you would think the government was a necessary limitation on that &quot;right.&quot; But I think its a reasonable response to say &quot;there is no right to steal food from other people&quot; and then we can discuss what is and is not a right, which is much closer to a necessary conversation than a game (when conducted by sincere interlocutors).')
