I love the ESP32 (and derived boards&#x2F;chips), it is a breeze to develop codes with Arduino.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear more about the battery life of this device:<p>&gt; Combined with the e-ink, M5Paper can last ages on a single charge.<p>&quot;1 week&quot; is an age for an Android, but &quot;100 years&quot; is probably an age for a human. ;-)')
