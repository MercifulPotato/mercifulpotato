I could try to get enough business domain knowledge to put up an act like I was a mediocre junior trader or banker, or I could better spend that time to improve myself learning tech (and studying for interviews for that matter).<p>Plus if I were to leave the finance industry (which I&#x27;m desperately trying to do), none of that business domain knowledge would be portable, whereas most of my technical knowledge would be.<p>Just my two cents, but then again, I&#x27;m not looking at freelancing.')
