A mistake that I often see made is that people have 50 reasons why that person is wrong but usually 49 of them are fairly weak and could be debated. You are generally better off picking your one killer argument and just bolstering that. Otherwise you get into a position where they seem like they are winning because they knocked aside a bunch of your less meaty arguments.')
