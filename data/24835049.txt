Intel valuation wouldnâ€™t be where it is without... eh, what?<p>And this is where the skeleton in the closet is. For a major silicon vendor, it becomes more, and more scary to not simply get on the wrong side with chip manufacturer, but even just missing on the next best deal possible.<p>Companies that actually make all those chips don&#x27;t matter as much when you are a 3rd-4th-5th tier company in your niche, and they don&#x27;t care much about you.
