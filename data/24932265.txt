I have never had a job with benefits. Never had insurance. Like I said, I can find ways to pay half the rent here and there.<p>But based on the experience here, it seems like people found work out of college, were able to focus in field because their expenses were paid for by a company and were able to create a family. None of this is an option when I spend 12 hours + a day trying to find money doing various work I genuinely don&#x27;t care about.')
