The GPL doesn’t require “upstreaming” of anything — you merely have to release the source code you used; any use of that code by another person is that person’s responsibility.<p>More generally on Apple: they just treat open &#x2F; proprietary as another tactical tool.  When they were on the ropes (e.g. late 90s) they happily embraced open standards like mp3 and jpeg, yet also happily purchased a license to .rtf.  They quickly realized the ipod needed Windows support. Then as (and where) they became stronger they stoped caring.')
