I can understand it if they cannot afford it, but anyone who’s into technology and can afford should make sure they have the latest software updates. They should also educate others about the importance of timely updates.<p>If you buy an iPhone on launch, you get five or six years of software updates.<p>I can only pity the people using their Android phones way past any hopes for software updates and being vulnerable to issues (security, software and hardware). I’m referring to most of the Android phones that don’t see updates after a year and all Android phones that don’t see updates after three years from launch. Pressuring Google or OEMs to provide software updates for longer hadn’t worked well, and Google is still slow on improving it.')
