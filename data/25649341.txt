There was a glut of off lease Leafs on the market as early as 2017.  I picked up a 2015 Leaf with 15k miles on it for ~$14k off lease in 2017 before the Model 3 went into production.<p>Nissan started manufacturing Leafs in 2010 and it wasn&#x27;t until fall 2020 that they managed to build their 500,000th.  By comparison, the Model 3 went into production in 2017 and they built the 500,000th in March of 2020.<p>Tesla managed to build and sell more EVs in under than 3 years than Nissan did in 10.  Either Nissan was stifling production or there was no demand for the product.')
