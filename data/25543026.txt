Although it&#x27;s disappointing to see this lazy skepticism as the top and longest lived comment.<p>For a serious paper and a serious forum, I think a comment owes it to that seriousness and its readers to carefully investigate before displaying contempt.<p>Under Methods:<p><i>Photocatalytic reactions</i><p><i>Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in an overhead-irradiation-type glass vessel connected to a closed gas circulation system. Prior to each reaction, all air was evacuated from the reaction system and filled with Ar (about 1 kPa unless otherwise noted). The suspension was subsequently irradiated using a Xe lamp (300 W, full arc). Evolved gases accumulated in the closed gas circulation system were analysed by gas chromatography (GC-8A, Shimadzu Co., thermal conductivity detector, Ar carrier gas, molecular sieve 5 Ã… column). The STH efficiency was measured under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM1.5G, 9 cm2 illuminated area, solar simulator HAL-320, Asahi Spectra Co.). The STH efficiency was determined according to the following equation</i><p>We can clearly see it is 1 atmosphere, and reasonably assume it&#x27;s &quot;ambient temperature&quot; plus 300 W Xe lamp irradiation. And it mentions nothing about &quot;sunlight&quot; but we can get consider the light spectra from the lamp. Comments should in future refrain from being inaccurate and lazily put together like the above. I think this goes doubly so for revolutionary and energy type tech that can be radically transformative. Good comments should push brave new science into the light, not drag it down into the dark of existing confirmation bias.')
