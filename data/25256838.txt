What economic value do cryptocurrencies provide over our traditional banking system?<p>- being deflationary is not a feature, it&#x27;s a bug. An inflationary currency incentivises you to invest it, otherwise you lose real purchasing power. With a deflationary currency, you can just stuff it anywhere and see gains. You steal from tomorrow. As the material wealth of the world increases, our money supply should increase to match. AFAIK there isn&#x27;t any popular crypto that can easily adjust how many tokens are mined each year.<p>- almost every crypto&#x27;s transaction throughput is ~4 orders of magnitude below what Amex&#x2F;Mastercard&#x2F;Visa can process.<p>- most of the ease of using crypto is only because it bypasses AML&#x2F;KYC laws. Venmo and Zelle would be far more convenient otherwise.<p>I can&#x27;t see it as anything other than speculation.')
