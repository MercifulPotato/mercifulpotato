During the call, the committee stated the list of violations, and said &quot;that is what the reporters stated, and what we found&quot;. I asked why they didn&#x27;t take a statement from me before that finding, and they said &quot;we all watched the video, so we could see for ourselves the violation&quot;.<p>- The committee offered in their apology email to me to have a follow-up discussion, and I declined the offer.')
