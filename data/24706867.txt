Not sure I&#x27;ve ever seen such a compelling demo that started from nothing.<p>In general I think starting from nothing is the original sin of programming pedagogy. I think it&#x27;s easier to learn by example, imitation, and extension and then learn the deeper principles once you need them.<p>My wish is a game that would be compelling enough to get a few app store downloads but allows for live editing of the source. Say a soccer game where you can start by changing configuration options like the ball color, then maybe you can find where goals are added in and make yours count for more, eventually basic physics like changing acceleration.<p>Probably not for 6 year olds, but even at the college level I&#x27;m not sure about having students start by staring at an empty editor window.')
