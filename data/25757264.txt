So it seems like that&#x27;s flipped from what you&#x27;re suggesting?<p>The Color tests can even come back in 8 hours or so, if you&#x27;re not too far from a lab and the lab isn&#x27;t overloaded. Not as fast as 15 minutes, and certainly higher variance, but much more useful than 72 hours people normally assume.<p>Regarding false negative rate, Hawaii is accepting some of the rapid tests (like the aforementioned GoHealth test) for pre-travel screening, which is concerning.<p>[0] These are both without involving insurance at all. It&#x27;s possible, though, that the Color tests are partially subsidised by Google?')
