The ContentFilterExclusionList was itself a hack. It never should have existed.</i><p>It might or might not be a hack, but that&#x27;s orthogonal to the functionality or whether it uses a ContentFilterExclusionList.<p>The fact that it wasn&#x27;t there before, or that it is a misguided feature idea, doesn&#x27;t mean it was done as a quick and dirty implementation or that it&#x27;s hastily made feature done via cutting corners.<p>If you accept the need for your own apps to bypass user application filtering (eg. because you consider your traffic&#x2F;apps integral to the OS operation) then that&#x27;s the kind of thing you&#x27;d implement -- and you could do it with a team of 100, working for months with fine specs, to deliver the same thing.<p>There&#x27;s nothing inherently hacky about it.<p>&gt;<i>There was no problem with that until Apple decided to exempt itself from getting blocked.</i><p>That&#x27;s neither here nor there though, as to whether it was done as a hack - or, to get back to the point, as to whether they could just rip it off trivially.<p>People forget this is not just a single feature, but part of a change to how network filtering is done (not through a third party kernel extension anymore), accompanied with new APIs.')
