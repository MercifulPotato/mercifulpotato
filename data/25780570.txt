Neural networks are powering a LOT of the internet.<p>&gt; Siri&#x2F;Cortana&#x2F;Google Home&#x2F;Alexa, powered by DeepSpeech+language models<p>&gt; Google Search, powered by BERT<p>&gt; Tesla, powered by variants of YOLO<p>&gt; Facial recognition powered by MTCNN+FaceNet<p>&gt; AirBnB product search+recommendations<p>&gt; Amazon product recommendations<p>GANs are a bit artsy, but JFC they&#x27;re not even a decade old - we&#x27;ve gone from shitty MNIST clones to fully synthetic faces in the span of 5 years!<p>Predictions:\n1. I suspect we&#x27;re going to see DeepFakes in Hollywood - famous people might license their faces to movies that they might not have the time to star in<p>2. People are going to start building even more powerful versions of search, like combinations of CLIP<p>3. Neural networks still aren&#x27;t optimized for edge devices - we&#x27;re going to see a deluge of cheap drones with cutting edge computer vision by default')
