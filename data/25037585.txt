The $100 Brother printer does come with a &quot;starter&quot; cartridge but it prints 700 pages. So even if you threw the printer away after the starter cartridge ran out, you&#x27;d still be paying $0.17 per sheet as opposed to the $30 inkjet&#x27;s initial cost of $1.25 per sheet for the first cartridge.<p>If we&#x27;re talking refills then, I can buy an aftermarket toner cartridge for my laser printer for under $20 and that yields 2600 pages. ($0.008&#x2F;sheet). Black HP 67XL ink (240 pages) works out to $0.10&#x2F;sheet. The laser is an order of magnitude less in both scenarios.<p>The drum unit in mine did start going bad after 3-4 years. I bought a new drum on Amazon for $20, far less than what I originally paid for the printer. It has been going strong for a few years since.')
