But static analysis tools are still pretty dumb and sometimes cause extra work to no benefit.<p>Flagging a method for cyclomatic complexity when it uses a case statement that is blatantly obvious and simple to any human seeing it, for example.  Or just happening to notice a bunch of issues in file B when you commit file A but didn&#x27;t even touch file B.<p>Overall it&#x27;s good, I like it, but with the caveat that it can take some work to tweak and adjust to avoid waste like that.
