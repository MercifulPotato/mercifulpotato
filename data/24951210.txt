This is to say, they are explicitly enabling the government to track every single move of its citizens. Is that ok? Not to me. They should have resigned rather than play their part in increasing governmental control.<p>To put yourself in their shoes: they may argue that it’s not ok to “let” bad actors abuse and injure citizens. Many of the people who have been in these positions and talked about it publicly have talked about how they felt like <i>they</i> were doing the right thing.
