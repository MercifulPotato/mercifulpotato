Obviously not a comprehensive study but, have the testosterone levels of a trans woman [0] (she&#x27;s relatively normal, other than the fact she insists on debating strangers on the internet). That&#x27;s ~.4 nmol&#x2F;L (why sports and medicine use two different measures is also very confusing, unit conversion here [1].  Given the advantages testosterone gives in sports [3] I&#x27;d wager most women competing aren&#x27;t hovering around the minimum levels (which is where most trans women are going to be by virtue of how anti-androgens work).  Instead of unscientific blog spam, how about a study published by the National Collegiate Athletic Association [4].<p>Basically as the knowledge of the underlying science grows the idea of simple binary for fair sporting competition makes increasingly less sense, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if elite institutions started to drift more toward &quot;hormonal weight classes&quot;  (and so thinks these scientists [4])<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;z9DR2cD" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;z9DR2cD</a><p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;unitslab.com&#x2F;node&#x2F;136" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;unitslab.com&#x2F;node&#x2F;136</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.tw&#x2F;10.1210&#x2F;er.2018-00020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.tw&#x2F;10.1210&#x2F;er.2018-00020</a><p>[3] “[t]he available, albeit incomplete, evidence makes it highly likely that the sex difference in circulating testosterone of adults explains most, if not all, the sex differences in sporting performance.” <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.tw&#x2F;10.1210&#x2F;er.2018-00020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.tw&#x2F;10.1210&#x2F;er.2018-00020</a><p>[4]“[a]ny athletic advantages a transgender girl or woman\narguably may have as a result of her prior testosterone levels dissipate after about\none year of estrogen therapy.”\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncaa.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;NCLR_TransStudentAthlete%2B(2).pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncaa.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;NCLR_TransStudentAt...</a>')
