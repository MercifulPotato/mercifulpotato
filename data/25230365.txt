Partly this is a difference in philosophy I suspect; we should all try to help each other to become better, and Gmail’s pandering to users’ poor habits just enables them to avoid gaining understanding that would help them in the long run. Another reason is that the Gmail type of threading simply doesn’t work in practice, especially when the conversation has more than three participants. I know this because of the way people try to find a “better” way by moving away from email, when a good portion of their frustration is due to the difficulty in following conversations, specifically because they are using Gmail. They have no idea that email already offers them what they need, because they’ve never used an actual email client.')
