Item(by='mnehring', descendants=4, kids=[25193966, 25193745], score=1, time=1606177550, title='Ask HN: How do you appeal a Stripe decision not to open an account?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;m in a bit of a tricky spot. I&#x27;m a developer, and one aspect of my software is a web-store add-on. (So, I don&#x27;t run a web store, but my software is used in my clients&#x27; web stores.) Anyhow, I integrated with Stripe because it&#x27;s an easy and beautiful integration, and I personally bill my clients using Stripe, so I was already comfortable with it. Anyhow, my soon-to-be client attempts to sign up with Stripe, and they promptly decline to activate their account. They follow up with an email, and they very promptly get back a &quot;this decision is final&quot; message.\n(&quot;Thank you for reaching out about this. Unfortunately, we still won&#x27;t be able to accept payments for [redacted] moving forward.&quot;)<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;m 99.99% confident that their decision was made in error. The organization is a local franchise of a well-known nationwide non-profit organization, and is about as non-risky as they come. However, while Stripe has a lot in its favor, talking to humans doesn&#x27;t seem to be a point in its favor. So, after that long introduction, here&#x27;s the question:<p>Is there a secret path to get to a higher up at Stripe to get a real human to manually review a decision that was almost certainly made in error? I know lots of you have worked with Stripe, so perhaps some of you have found this path.')
