Specifically, there is no mention of eliminating selection bias.<p>Typically if people are currently fortunate and aren’t in need of social safety nets, these people are both more likely to be happier and, given the lower risk, they can afford to be politically agnostic.<p>Meanwhile, when people are in need of social safety nets&#x2F;political change in general, they are likely to be less happy with their current lives and also more politically opinionated.<p>So while the article’s data says: political agnosticism is correlated with well being, the article’s narrative incompletely&#x2F;incorrectly creates a causal link between being politically opinionated and a level of well being.')
