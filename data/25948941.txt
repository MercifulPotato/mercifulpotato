Not for being conservative, for being an asshole.</i><p>And that would be neither here nor there, cause your forums are not so massive as to shape public opinion and influence elections and news.<p>In smaller, disperse and diverse, discussion platforms, you would be entitled to think that he should be banned for &quot;being an asshole&quot; and even ban him from your forums, while others would be entitled to ban others that say the same or worse things from the opposite side of the political spectrum.<p>When one side, in a major public-opinion-influencing service can ban a whole side of the political spectrum though, and even the sitting president, that&#x27;s a problem.<p>It&#x27;s actually analogous to election influencing - same as if 9 out of 10 channels in TV only carried the views from one party and not the other(s).')
