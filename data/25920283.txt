I didn&#x27;t say incompetent, but rather lazy and lower quality.&quot;<p>The engineering might be perfectly fine if you take into account the deadlines, budgets and requirements from the clients&#x2F;managers.<p>If you pay someone to build a house on a short deadline with a small budget, then you&#x27;ll obviously get a crappy house. But the skill that went into building that house in such a short time, and on such a low budget, might be extremely high.<p>Good engineering doesn&#x27;t mean a perfect product. It just means you managed to deliver the best possible one out of the situation you were in. It&#x27;s up to the owner of the product to decide if it&#x27;s good enough.')
