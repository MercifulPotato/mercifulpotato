The reality is that there are hedge funds who profit on both sides of the trade. There were a few shorts who did lose a lot of money, but that is part of the risk of shorting stock and it&#x27;s kind of incredible that people think that those hedge funds believed that their trade was risk free.<p>I think now, the cat is out of the bag, and astroturfing a pump-and-dump on reddit&#x2F;twitter&#x2F;discord is going to be a pretty lucrative thing now for some entities, at least until there&#x27;s some kind of regulatory action against it. Comments like this: &quot;I&#x27;m trying to jump in but can you eli5 what a market order is please?&quot; get translated to &quot;Come eat my lunch please! I would like to give away my money.&quot;<p>They want to see the whole unfair system burn, which I totally get, but this is not how you make that happen.

They&#x27;ll be left holding the bag and wondering why <i>everyone else</i> on Wall Street got so rich off their backs.<p>If you&#x27;re reading this and you think you might be sticking it to the hedge funds by buying in: there are plenty -- PLENTY -- of hedge funds who are willing to sell you GME at $350 per share.')
