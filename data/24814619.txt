Item(by='flandry93', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602980528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24810806, text='&gt; &quot;People talk about &#x27;Eternal September&#x27; as if to imply ... that the culture of the internet rightly belonged to those people alone, and that everyone who joined afterwards were part of the web&#x27;s degradation and downfall&quot;.<p>Yes, that is exactly correct.  The people who <i>made</i> the web, and built a beautiful space were the &#x27;rightful owners&#x27;.  A few outsize capitalists then saw that they could extract value from this made world -- and make themselves rich -- by encouraging and enabling colonization of that once peaceable space.  It was a form of cultural theft and appropriation -- indirect through corporate marketing and lawyers.<p>If we follow the argument of &#x27;diversity everywhere&#x27;, no culture could be any culture anywhere because it would &quot;lack diversity&quot;.  One grey world is not a win.<p>The existing pre-93 culture was wholly supplanted and destroyed by the &quot;new and improved&quot; &quot;higher quality&quot; culture that replaced it.  Of course, that estimation of &#x27;better&#x27; and &#x27;higher&#x27; is evaluate from the mindset of the colonizers -- not at all from the perspective of whomever came before.<p>Moreover, its not just the corporate profiteering -- that just opened the door for all of the colonizers.  It is all of the self righteous fake &quot;representative&quot; identity virtue signaling that goes with it.  Capitalism and wall street corporate profits enabled an entire world of trolls -- who then use the claim of colonization on others to hide their own prior actions in kind.  And this is an improvement?')
