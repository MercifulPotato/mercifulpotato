My issue is that we currently have working nuclear technology. That we can build and deploy now. <i>Bullish</i> means we&#x27;re relying on future inventions. With the potential catastrophe we have ahead of us I don&#x27;t think it is a good idea to put all our eggs in one basket. It may not pan out. It may not pan out in the timeframe we need it to. Nuclear is a relatively cheap risk reduction strategy. Be bullish on battery, but have a backup because in the mean time we&#x27;re still using coal&#x2F;oil&#x2F;gas.')
