On the other hand, a study with a pleasant conclusion is taken as evidence for causation in a preferable direction.  E.g. a study showing positive correlation between atheism and IQ scores is considered evidence that atheists are that way because they are smarter than most people.<p>It is a very interesting correlation, but guess I cannot infer causation in this case ;)')
