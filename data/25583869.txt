What to do, with limited vaccine and multiple choices of how, and who to give it to.<p>People are already arguing about what maximises benefit.<p>Blair publicised a logical choice to give the maximum number of people one dose now, and give the second dose when more arrives. This invites the question if 80-90% coverage of fewer people is better or worse than 70% coverage of more people. He didn&#x27;t think of it btw, he just publicised it. If this is called &quot;the Blair choice&quot; it will be a crying shame.<p>There will be around 6 distinct vaccines soon. What if different vaccines give better response, than giving the same twice as a booster? (this is a possibility)<p>People are trying to maximise benefit to the individuals, and to the economy. So its two-outcome maximising with at least 4 and very probably more like 8 or 10 distinct choices of outcome.')
