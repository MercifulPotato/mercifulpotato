Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[24783372], score=None, time=1602710175, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24781696, text='Here&#x27;s what else is included:<p>Follow is a list of artists I follow. There does not appear to be a distinction between artists I purposefully followed and artists Spotify automatically followed on my behalf, but that could just be because I have never purposefully followed anyone.<p>Inferences is a list of strings such as &quot;2P_Nexcare_IRI &gt; Buyers Of Nexcare Brand Products Within Last 104W &gt; Verified_10July2020_US&quot;, &quot;3P_Reality TV Enthusiasts_UK&quot;, &quot;Cookie Audience NOT Matched to PPIDs&quot;, &quot;3P__Isotonic Beverage Category_Heavy Buyers_US&quot;, and a bunch of more like that. Almost certainly something to do with advertising (although I have a paid subscription, not an ad supported...and most of them reference products or even entire product categories that I have never once in my life bought or even showed any interest in).<p>Payments has my credit card information, with all but the last 4 digits of the card number masked.<p>SearchQueries has my searches from the last ~3 months, tagged by platform (&quot;DESKTOP&quot;, &quot;IPHONE_ARM64&quot;). I don&#x27;t think the IPHONE_ARM64 is actually my iPhone. I&#x27;m pretty sure most or all of those were from my iPad.<p>StreamingHistory0 appears to be every song I played through Spotify in the last year. For each it lists the end time in &quot;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM&quot; format, the number of milliseconds the song played, the track name, and the artist name.<p>Userdata is what you would expect. It has fields named userName, email, country, createdFromFacebook, facebookUid, birthdate, gender, postalCode, mobileNumber,, mobileOperator, mobileBrand, and creationTime. For me createdFromFacebook is set to false, facebookUid set to null, mobileOperator is &quot;None&quot; and the other mobile fields are null. I&#x27;m sure they could have probably deduced some of those, but have not, and I&#x27;ve never noticed them asking for that information either, so I&#x27;m curious how they ever get populated.<p>Finally, YourLibrary has information about your library. The JSON object has separate properties for tracks, albums, shows, episodes, bannedTracks, and other.<p>The album property corresponds to &quot;Albums&quot; in your library, and the tracks corresponds to &quot;Liked Songs&quot;. How the rest matches up, I don&#x27;t know. The library in the GUI has &quot;Made For You&quot;, &quot;Recently Played&quot;, &quot;Artists&quot;, and &quot;Podcosts&quot;. I don&#x27;t have anything in any of those, so don&#x27;t know how they map to properties in YourLibrary.<p>I have one album in the album section of my library, and that shows up under albums in the JSON. All the tracks of that album show up under the tracks section of the JSON.')
