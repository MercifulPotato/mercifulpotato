Cabling homes is not easy as it seems when you&#x27;re settled in. Also not every home is built the same way so, you may need to drill a lot of concrete walls.<p>Repeaters are no use with thick walls (I have quite a few). Powerline + access point combo takes a lot of place and is not cheap. Rewiring home is not always possible. Also, not all APs have power settings so you can&#x27;t optimize power the way you want (also, thick walls). So it&#x27;s a hard problem.<p>Throwing &quot;just re-wire it, eh?&quot; into the middle is not helping.')
