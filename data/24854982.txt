Something you interpreted as an argument by popularity.<p>I observe that <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;julialang.org&#x2F;learning&#x2F;classes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;julialang.org&#x2F;learning&#x2F;classes&#x2F;</a> lists only a single high school, and I didn&#x27;t see a single course meant as a general introductory programming course for non-programmers.<p>Here&#x27;s the IPCC talk (from 2000) I mentioned about &quot;Using Python in a High School Computer Science Program&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legacy.python.org&#x2F;workshops&#x2F;2000-01&#x2F;proceedings&#x2F;papers&#x2F;elkner&#x2F;pyYHS.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legacy.python.org&#x2F;workshops&#x2F;2000-01&#x2F;proceedings&#x2F;pape...</a><p>It references the &quot;Computer Programming for Everybody&quot; essay at\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;essays&#x2F;everybody&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;essays&#x2F;everybody&#x2F;</a> , which I argue shows the stronger emphasis on the Python developers for beginning programs, inherited from ABC.<p>I also mentioned Alice. &quot;Because Alice is targeted towards novice programmers, it is important that Python, more than languages such as Tcl or Scheme, can be mastered by new Alice programmers with little effort&quot; (quoting the 1995 paper at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~stage3&#x2F;publications&#x2F;95&#x2F;journals&#x2F;IEEEcomputer&#x2F;CGandA&#x2F;paper.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~stage3&#x2F;publications&#x2F;95&#x2F;journals&#x2F;IEEEc...</a> ). But that was at a university.<p>Python of course is much more established than Julia, which is why I linked to resources from when Python was only a year or two older than Julia is now.<p>That said, at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;community&#x2F;sigs&#x2F;current&#x2F;edu-sig&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;community&#x2F;sigs&#x2F;current&#x2F;edu-sig&#x2F;</a> you can find other teaching resources for high school teaching and for &quot;kids&quot; and &quot;young children&quot;. My local library here in Sweden has a book on programming for kids, which uses Python.<p>Is there a similar movement as CP4E within the Julia? Nothing from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;julialang.org&#x2F;learning&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;julialang.org&#x2F;learning&#x2F;</a> suggests that the needs of non-programmers, such as high school students, plays a strong role in its design.<p>Do you know of any such internal movement? Can you point me to any external resources which show Julia being used as a teaching language for non-programmers?')
