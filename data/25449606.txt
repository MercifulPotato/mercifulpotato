I added CAVE support for the molecular visualization program VMD and had a key to UIUC&#x27;s CAVE to test it out.<p>The CAVE approach projects images onto wall-sized screens (eg, via back-projection), and can be 1-wall up to 5- or 6- walls, if the floor&#x2F;ceiling is categorized as a &quot;wall&quot;.<p>This is massively expensive compared to the VR that&#x27;s widespread&#x2F;affordable these days.<p>But it&#x27;s also far more social, where multiple people can be present, though at least in the 1990s the head-tracker only followed one person. And they could easily see each other.<p>Handwaving, with the right synchronization on the glasses and high frame rates, I could imagine multiple head-trackers. Back then our frame rate was limited by the decay rate of the green phosphor in the projector. These days I suppose a wall of large displays, edge-to-edge, with very high frame rates interleaved for multiple users, might work. Again, I haven&#x27;t followed what&#x27;s going on in VR, but it might be a technology which addresses at least some of what you correctly point out.<p>Carolina Cruz-Neira, the developer of the CAVE (and at the time with the email address &quot;cavewoman&quot;), has some lectures on the social VR and her research, on YouTube. Don&#x27;t remember which ones specifically talk about it, and couldn&#x27;t find one in a quick look.')
