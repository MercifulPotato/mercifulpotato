Judges have thrown out ballots before.  Judges have even thrown out elections even after the candidate is sworn into office.<p>&gt; Perhaps it&#x27;s merely a partisan tactic.<p>Make no mistake about it, this is a hugely partisan issue.  The &quot;Left&quot; is convinced beyond doubt that Trump is trying to overturn the election.  The &quot;Right&quot; is convinced beyond doubt that the election was a fraud.<p>When the truth of a subject is determined largely by what party you associate with, it&#x27;s pretty clear to me that there aren&#x27;t any objective parties in this discussion.<p>I don&#x27;t vote (its against my code of ethics; see Voluntaryism) and I don&#x27;t associate with any party, so I believe I am about as objective as you can reasonably expect to find on this topic.<p>&gt; &quot;mountains of it!&quot; rather than specifics is hand-waving gish-galloping stuff.<p>I&#x27;m happy to provide evidence to anything I&#x27;ve claimed.<p>For an executive summary of the evidence available, the Texas lawsuit is a good starting point (first 36 pages).\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texasattorneygeneral.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;images&#x2F;admin&#x2F;2020&#x2F;Press&#x2F;SCOTUSFiling.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texasattorneygeneral.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;ima...</a><p>For Michigan specifically this document has an overview of affidavits (from Nov 10):\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.donaldjtrump.com&#x2F;public-files&#x2F;press_assets&#x2F;1.-11-10-20-trump-v.-benson-w.d.-mich.-complaint-final.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.donaldjtrump.com&#x2F;public-files&#x2F;press_assets&#x2F;1.-11...</a><p>Most of the evidence I have heard is from the many hours of testimony I have watched from the state legislature hearings (PA, MI, GA, AZ).
