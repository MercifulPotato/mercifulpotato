I do think the challenge of rural internet lies in the incredible amount of infrastructure costs with limited recovery.  This is the same challenge the electricity markets have (or any public infrastructure).  The other challenge in the US that most european countries don&#x27;t have (for anyone from Europe) is that the US has incredibly large land mass with sparse populations and challenging weather conditions (tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, etc.).<p>This is where something like starlink et. competitors can provide a much better cost per outcome benefit.  The challenge is how to bring the cost down for the benefit of rural areas on lower incomes.  As it stands right now its pretty expensive for lower-mid income demographic to swallow price wise.')
