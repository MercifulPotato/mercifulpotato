Now we are a team of 7 people (9 as of January 4) and have undergone our first successful pre-seed.<p>I have been asking myself for a while now if the archaic way of looking at link building in SEO still holds value in today’s context. While we think that DA is important and has its place in link building strategy, the real goldmine lies in relevance. A site with strong DA but irrelevant results can’t go far on just domain authority alone. Just Google &quot;SEO word count&quot; and see how we beat SEJ, Yoast etc. The secret here is &quot;CONTEXTUAL RELEVANCE&quot; and this can be yours as well.<p>&quot;The Tabtimize platform was born out of the need to simplify the dreaded link building process — one of the most challenging aspects of SEO and digital marketing. Our vision was to create an all-inclusive platform that would make the process smarter, more sustainable, and easy enough to make link building a pleasant experience!<p>Our mission depended on the ability to create a way to find contextually relevant link opportunities and a metric that could actually quantify relevance, something that hadn’t been possible until now. &quot;<p>Best of all comes here:<p>It is free to sign up and there is a free user plan which enables you to build contextually relevant links completely free of charge.<p>If you have a website and would like the opportunity to eradicate spam by applying relevancy to your websites, you can sign up for the waiting list and get 3 months free use of paid plan:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tabtimize.com&#x2F;link-community-waiting-list&#x2F;')
