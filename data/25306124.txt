Although, appl beat them out on chassis - alum frame is BEST - but the guts of S76 is top notch.<p>The only thing I am pissed at S76 is, is that they changed their vid interface for screens on the same laptop - so I couldnt replace a dead machine with a good machine based on their screen redesign<p>and they wanted $90 for a fn power receptacle....<p>Else, I support them they are like 60% apple evil')
