Anonymous officials who had seen the memo said that the &quot;C.I.A. and the National Counterterrorism Center had assessed with medium confidence—meaning credibly sourced and plausible, but falling short of near certainty&quot;—that the GRU had offered bounties.<p>It takes evidence to get to a medium confidence assessment, it is not purely &quot;speculative bullshit.&quot;')
