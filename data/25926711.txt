So, try flipping each bit, and see if any one of them results in a very large improvement. If there are no matches, try every combination of exactly two bits, then every combination of three, and so on.<p>There are almost 10²⁰ ways to flip 3 bits in 1 MB. This approach seems unfeasible if any more than 1 bit has been flipped.')
