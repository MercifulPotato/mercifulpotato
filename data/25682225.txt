It was a Settlement Call, lawyers on both side were present (and named) and all of that was privileged. The GA Sec of State should be in jail right now. He won&#x27;t be.</i><p>Calls between attorneys negotiating a settlement aren&#x27;t privileged. The &quot;confidentiality&quot; of settlement negotiations isn&#x27;t confidentiality in the normal sense; rather, it simply establishes that you can&#x27;t take material from settlement discussions and introduce it as evidence in a subsequent civil trial: it frees the parties to discuss things without having to worry about answering for every word they say in a subsequent trial.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever been involved in a civil conflict, you&#x27;ve noticed: every single piece of paper exchanged is marked &quot;confidential settlement communication&quot;. You can publish all of it if you want.<p>You don&#x27;t have to take my word for it (though: I&#x27;ve been in civil disputes, noticed this, and asked about it); legal experts on Twitter were dunking on pundits for thinking these conversations were confidential in the normal sense.')
