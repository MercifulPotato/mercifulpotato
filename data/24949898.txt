Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604133341, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24949804, text='&gt; It&#x27;s not arbitrary.<p>Take that up with the comment I replied to, because they specifically said to choose an arbitrary one.<p>&gt; If there is a grid of smaller streets running through a suburb of similar size, it alternates so every second street is a stop sign.<p>So on the positive side that&#x27;s fewer stops, on the negative side you still have a lot of stops and you have watch out for crossing full-speed traffic every other block.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that method is wrong, but it doesn&#x27;t sound like a significant improvement.<p>&gt; 4 way stops sound like bad design to me, it seems like it would leave room for an aggressive driver to take off when they&#x27;re not first in to an intersection, bullying their way through.<p>Someone can bully through any small intersection.<p>&gt; Roundabouts and standard intersections in Australia do not suffer from this, as in both cases there is a clear right of way. If an accident happens, it&#x27;s generally obvious who is at fault without the need for dash cam footage.<p>Why would it be obvious less often in a 4 way stop?  And since everybody stopped it should be extremely hard to have an accident without both parties being at fault.<p>And roundabouts do not have perfect clarity either.  If I&#x27;m about to enter a roundabout, and someone on the crossing street is about to enter in front of me at a slower speed, it can be ambiguous who actually gets into the roundabout first and who has to yield.<p>That&#x27;s a rare scenario, but so is confusion at a 4 way stop.  If someone enters first, they get to leave first.  If two people enter at the same time, the one on the right goes first.')
