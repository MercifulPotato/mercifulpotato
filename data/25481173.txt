I also think you can be non-transactional while still having boundaries. Not saying hi back is probably a boundary we’d disagree on.<p>I found it only feels wrong because I expected something. So the problem is as much in my expectation as their behavior and based in a faulty assumption that interactions are a zero sum game. I don’t always embody non-transactional compassionate behavior but having tried both approaches, once you can get past the expectations of what people can do for you, I find it a better way to live.')
