I see your point, stated like that.<p>I think that there&#x27;s a different argument, though, to explain the two-camp phenomenon.  One clue is the locations of the red v. blue voters, and another is in the shifting of certain demographics I highlighted in the comment you replied to above.  To recap, we noted that Trump&#x27;s support among EVERY group that are not white males has gone up, not down.  Among white males, Trump&#x27;s support dropped by 4 points, but among blacks and especially hispanics, it went up.<p>I think there&#x27;s a Left and a Right stance on cultural issues, and there&#x27;s a Left and a Right stance on economic issues.  Did you know that if you ask the question:    <i>Do you think racism is the most important issue facing America today?</i> .. that the answer Yes is more likely to be seen the higher the degree of the person?  So that&#x27;s a good example of a Cultural Left issue of the present.<p>Let&#x27;s take an Economic Left issue, minimum wage.  I&#x27;m going to cherry pick one from a right-wing state, Florida.  They voted to increase the minimum wage this week, which should come as a surprise.<p>Then you have the polling showing that Americans in large majority support  a government healthcare option.<p>So <i>clearly</i> there is a shift going on here where Democrats are representing Cultural Left issue but, aside from a few Progressives within them, are still Economic Right.  Trump had Economic Left talking points, even if he wasn&#x27;t honest about them.  That&#x27;s why he won those people over.  Much of the DNC are Cultural Left but Economic Center or Right, as evidence by Jeff Bezos happily putting BLM slogans on AWS console pages and dedicating much of the Washington Post to race and gender issues.<p>In summary:  upper class liberals favor the establishment DNC because of their focus on the Cultural Left issues, like gender and race, and less educated &#x2F; poorer and for sure rural cultural groups often favor a Trumpian set of politics. Should we even talk about the right-wing attitudes about hands-off Silicon Valley  and Wall St. among mainstream Democrats?   And how else would you explain the Republicans suddenly talking anti-Wall St. rhetoric (Tucker Carlson), opposing NAFTA (Trump [ stealing Bernie&#x27;s talking points ], and taking an economic Populist approach to tariffs and trade?')
