I found the experience rewarding so decided to continue, but not every day. I did them every fourth day for a few years and dropped down to every fifth in 2018. My spreadsheet says I&#x27;ve taken 538.<p>I coordinate them with my cardio days, since I find they go well with being hot and sweaty finishing rowing or running.<p>You know how lifting (or any exercise) develops more than just what you work -- things like discipline, resilience, grit, self-awareness, etc? Cold showers gives all that benefit but at zero cost in time or money and no risk of injury.<p>Also look up Joel Runyon&#x27;s TEDx talk, which inspired me to start.')
