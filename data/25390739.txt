He&#x27;s banking on the future and stealing their market cap. What people are missing is that every car company is a fast follower and Elon&#x27;s head start and subsequent lead is disappearing as Porsche (VW) and others are stealing the limelight and performance ranks. Similar to Apple, Elon is thinking in terms of profitability and long-term strategy and wants to focus on taking that over all else.')
