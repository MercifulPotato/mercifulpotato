This work is ongoing and improvements can be expected pending feedback from users.\n\n   &gt; Wider use of SIMD to increase execution speed of ufuncs. Much work has been done in introducing universal functions that will ease use of modern features across different hardware platforms. This work is ongoing.\n\n    &gt;Preliminary work in changing the dtype and casting implementations in order to provide an easier path to extending dtypes. This work is ongoing but enough has been done to allow experimentation and feedback.\n\n  &gt;  Extensive documentation improvements comprising some 185 PR merges. This work is ongoing and part of the larger project to improve NumPyâ€™s online presence and usefulness to new users.\n\n   &gt; Further cleanups related to removing Python 2.7. This improves code readability and removes technical debt.\n\n    &gt; Preliminary support for the upcoming Cython 3.0.\n</code></pre>\nType annotations seem the biggest deal to me. I&#x27;d say if you care a lot about SIMD and the performance issues, you should be thinking of moving to Julia: it&#x27;s still a valuable technical achievement.')
