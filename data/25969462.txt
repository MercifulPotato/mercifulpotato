There was no law of nature constraining the EU to start later, or compelling US and UK to start earlier.<p>Normally, it makes sense to do this. Negotiate price, avoid hassle of repeated procurement energy, wait until you have more certainty about trial results and manufacturing process.<p>This situation was a national disaster, not a normal procurement exercise. The EU should have committed earlier to a broader range of vaccines because the cost benefit was trillions of euros of human live and economic damage costs compared to billions of euro of potentially redundant vaccines.<p>That they didn&#x27;t do this, and now are scapegoating the manufacturers, is a &#x27;catastophe&#x27; from my perspective. Coordination and delays are explanations but not mitigations.')
