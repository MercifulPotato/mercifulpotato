I&#x27;m sure that would filter out all the small places in the country while also including places in the country used by the old money Brahmans. In either case, you still can&#x27;t compare house prices in Albany to house prices in NY, which these median measures happen to weight in, even if slightly. Exclude a thousand such places and the median shifts to the right.')
