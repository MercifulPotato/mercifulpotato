If this strain was more prevalent in these regions, you would also see it taking a larger share of the infections nationwide.<p>However, the precautionary principle has been the keystone of good handling in the pandemic, so they are right to apply precautionary measures before it&#x27;s too late. We will learn more about this strain in the next few weeks.')
