This is a tangent, but there are literally thousands of companies that won&#x27;t require you to solve these problems. The thing is, at Microsoft &amp; co. you don&#x27;t just do this in an interview. You do it at your job too. We do foundational work in many teams and we need to solve algorithmic problems practically every week. If you are unable to code yourself out of a DP problem or scared of NP completeness and approximation algorithms, then maybe find a different job instead of complaining about the interview process?')
