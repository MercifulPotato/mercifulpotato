This is just an example of systemic problems that can and should be solved by increased automation and removing humans from the process.<p>I don&#x27;t understand your comment.  You seem to be saying that we should increase the amount arbitrary, opaque decision making that happens in consumer credit reporting, by increasing automation.  Am I reading that correctly?<p>As for nothing being good about consumer credit reporting in the US, consider the old system what we have now replaced.  It was all done on handshakes and personal references.  That sounds really fair to poor people, doesn&#x27;t it?')
