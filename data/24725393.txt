I can&#x27;t think of a more backwards idea than holding a pity circus where people try to convince authorities that the evil vested upon their ancestors in particular means that they deserve reparations today.<p>Fortunately, you don&#x27;t need a pity circus to figure out who needs help <i>today</i> and going forward. IMO that&#x27;s not only a less incendiary angle from which to approach the problem, it&#x27;s much easier to correctly implement, much more productive, and much less prone to back-and-forth escalation.')
