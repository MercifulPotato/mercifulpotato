Item(by='liamwire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606457172, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25225811, text='&gt; How can you say it’s introduction is joyful?<p>Sure, if you want to sidestep the innumerable ways the automobile, or more accuracy the internal combustion engine, have completely revolutionised society, you could make an argument...<p>Except you can’t. Think about the increase in distance and speed at which goods and services can be rendered compared to prior modes of transportation. One simple example that comes to mind is the ambulance, in which that increase may well be the difference between life or death for an unknown but surely enormous population. A similar argument can be made\nfor logistic supply chains delivering medicine, food, sanity products, waste removal, all of which without, mortality would surge. Plague, famine, disease are some of largest killers in human history.<p>Please tell me again how the absolute gains measured in human lifetimes is anything other than joyful, outside of subjectivity which is an unresolvable debate.')
