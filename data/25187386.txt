Pretty much automated everything in my house. I walk around and the lights turn on with a time-appropriate brightness. They turn off when the room is empty again. I haven&#x27;t touched a light switch in months. Garden irrigation is automated based on outside temperature and rainfall from my weather station. I get instant picture notifications when someone walks up to my patio or front door, and HA fakes inhabitance by turning on a couple lights randomly inside. My bedroom lights slowly dim up starting 15 minutes before the next alarm on my phone if I&#x27;m in bed (great for the winters). I&#x27;m notified when I can get free cooling or heating by opening the upstairs windows (calculated based on temperature differentials and HVAC status). I can set my alarm and view the status of all doors&#x2F;windows&#x2F;motion&#x2F;etc. remotely. My thermostat loosens the desired temperature range when the home is empty, and tightens it back up when I return. Bathroom fans turn on when you&#x27;ve been on the toilet for more than a couple minutes, or when humidity spikes due to the shower being on.<p>There&#x27;s at least a couple hundred other little things I&#x27;ve written automations for, and it&#x27;s really nice to be able to do whatever YOU specifically want. (I even have an Android tablet mounted on the wall in my bedroom - great for setting things conveniently and it will bring up a camera stream when motion is detected in an area around the home.)<p>Sure the stuff requires some upkeep, but I actively enjoy that. I might have to replace a ZWave multisensor battery every year, or upgrade some configuration when a new version of HA comes out. But I always wanted a smart home I could tailor myself. Everything is local (well except Google Assistant, but that&#x27;s ancillary). HA is just fantastic, and so is the community. :)')
