A very important week in American history.<p>The day Censorship was made valid with hordes cheering them on. A very bad and sad precedent. This is going to backfire very, very badly. The Big Tech tested waters and realized they can behave like Supranational Powers and have support from the people. All it takes for Big Tech is for them to convince the popular masses on how to think. That is the last step to complete control. Elected Governments will be powerless against this kind of power. If they can do this to a sitting US President they can do it to anyone else and can influence elections and electorates in ways we have never imagined before.')
