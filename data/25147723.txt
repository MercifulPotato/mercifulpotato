Item(by='maccard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605777996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25143796, text='&gt; Im well aware of the differences between IntelliJ and LSP<p>Apologies I didn&#x27;t mean to imply you didn&#x27;t, I only meant to point out that LSP isn&#x27;t the only factor in choosing an editor. For some people,(e.g. me) lack of some of that tooling is important.<p>&gt;since LSP provides good enough completion, navigation, and static analysis<p>My experience using lsp with clangd as the server on a large project was that it flat out didn&#x27;t work. Try opening UE4 for example.<p>&gt; The rest of your list are non-issues for me,<p>That&#x27;s great for you, but others do use those tools regularly. It&#x27;s also a feature that those tools work out of the box, consistently, meaning that a coworker can (occasionally) drive by commit&#x2F;run&#x2F;compile on my computer.<p>&gt;  I have a hard time believing that language implementers won&#x27;t prioritize their implementation over IntelliJ.<p>Intellij&#x2F;VS are going to keep improving in that time. As much as I&#x27;d love for all of my tooling to be open, I don&#x27;t see that as realistic in the near future based on the current state of the tooling. I&#x27;d love to be wrong though!')
