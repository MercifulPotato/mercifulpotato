But sometimes that&#x27;s not good enough.  And it&#x27;s OK to admit that and bring in another technology when you need a stronger guarantee than that.<p>The example I was taught with was a booking system, where the inventory management system-of-record was separate from the search system.  Search does not need 100% up-to-date inventory.  A delay between the last item being booked and it being removed from the search results is acceptable.  In fact, it has to be acceptable, because it can happen anyway.  If someone books the last item after another hit the search button...  There&#x27;s nothing the system can do about that.<p>When actually committing a booking, however, then that must be atomically done within the inventory management system.<p>So, to bring it home, it&#x27;s OK for the search system to be eventually consistent against bookings, and read bookings off of an event stream to update its internal tracking.  However, the bookings themselves cannot be eventually consistent without risking a double-booking.')
