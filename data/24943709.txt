Within it there&#x27;s a constellation of concepts and techniques around deliberately altering your subjective experience.<p>For example, the first person &#x2F; third person difference is referred to as &quot;associated&quot; &#x2F; &quot;disassociated&quot; in the NLP jargon, and you can <i>change</i> which &quot;mode&quot; you use for a given memory and that will (typically) <i>change</i> the subjective effects of the memory.<p>You can use this to e.g., fall in(out) of love with someone.  Recall all the good times with that person in associated(disassociated) mode and all the bad times with that person in disassociated(associated) mode and it will (typically) have a profound effect on your feeling towards that person.<p>Neat, eh?<p>There&#x27;s a whole body of work around manipulation of time-coding.  Some people see e.g. the past to the left and the future to the right,while others have the past behind them and the future ahead of them.  Those are just two common styles of &quot;timeline&quot;.  Changing your time-coding can have profound effects on your psychology.<p>The real information revolution has only just begun and it doesn&#x27;t have a lot to do with tiny transistors, if you catch my drift.')
