Item(by='curtainsforus', descendants=None, kids=[25559382], score=None, time=1609106913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25552197, text='180000 dollars doesn&#x27;t seem lenient to me.<p>But really, I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s extremely lenient by some standard.  I care what policy will best dissuade antisocial behaviour with the <i>minimal</i> necessary fines imposed.<p>Clearly, in your view, a written warning from the FCC is obviously serious business, and if you got one you&#x27;d interpret it as such and immediately desist from whatever incited it.  As this guy and the people disagreeing with you show, this attitude isn&#x27;t universal.<p>Two warnings and then immediate financial execution just seems insane.  If the the first and second letters had come with 1000 and 10000 dollar fines attached, almost everyone would have stopped by the first, let alone the second.  There, no need to turn people into lifelong indentured servants.<p>(Of course, I imagine there&#x27;s an incentive to maximize the amount of fines you collect, so that explains why it wouldn&#x27;t happen that way.)')
