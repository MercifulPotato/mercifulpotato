Sometimes people do that to make the mods look bad, but I&#x27;m going to assume you didn&#x27;t do it for that reason. Please don&#x27;t do it again, or at least not without explaining to the reader that you did. That holds whether the other commenter is a mod or not. It&#x27;s just good manners.<p>Also, please stop posting unsubstantive comments and flamebait to HN (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25696652" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25696652</a>).
