Zen3 is going to very competitive, their interconnect on chip is great.<p>Sure, add a line for ARM.<p>What&#x27;s interesting to me, I feel like a lot of this started when intel wouldn&#x27;t do the chip for the iphone. All of a sudden you had this leading edge mfg pushing arm hard which drove volumes through the roof, and all the copycats (android etc) copied the chip selection, screen style etc as well.<p>I wonder how different the path might have been if intel had come up with something for apple.')
