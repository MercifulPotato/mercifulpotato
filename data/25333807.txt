The diffs are all based off the previous branch in the &quot;stack&quot; so they aren&#x27;t duplicated.<p>It&#x27;s really easy to mess up and merge the wrong PR first, and it&#x27;s a pain in the ass to rebase all the way back up if you make a change in Request 1. I&#x27;d love to know how other people are handling this.')
