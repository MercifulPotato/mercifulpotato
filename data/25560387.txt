Additionally, a lot of the smaller, quirky high density living in these cities is because they didnâ€™t have to comply with ADA at the time of construction.  If you start adding elevators and ramps and the space needed in passages and doorways for wheelchairs to turn around, you will end up with a much larger footprint.<p>Granted, ADA and other upgrades in quality of life are nowhere near the big problem of the cost of reducing lot and block sizes retroactively.  The design for cities made for cars and for pedestrians are fundamentally opposed, and cannot coexist.')
