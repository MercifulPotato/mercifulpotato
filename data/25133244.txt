So the average congress person was born in 1960. Our current crop of congress people were raised in the 60s, by WWII veterans. Even if you think society underwent changes and is far more gender equitable now than it was in 1960, you wouldn&#x27;t expect to see that start to take effect in top level leadership until much later. It&#x27;s the same reason why you wouldn&#x27;t expect to see a woman or a black person on the supreme court 15 years after women or blacks were allowed to become lawyers.')
