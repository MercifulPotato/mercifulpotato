Of course that compares very different things, and doesn&#x27;t mean that renting dedicated servers is always cheaper. The comparison gets much, much worse when significant amounts of traffic is involved. And scaling down isn&#x27;t so much more difficult than with AWS within certain limits.<p>Comparing managed services like databases is maybe more meaningful than just EC2, but also so much more difficult.')
