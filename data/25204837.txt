Item(by='jiggawatts', descendants=None, kids=[25212381, 25206010], score=None, time=1606265979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25202746, text='This is a disease of Mathematics in general.<p>Actual mathematics teaching, as seen in typical University classes typically introduces a new abstract definition, and then immediately follows that up with a number of &quot;worked examples&quot;, either in the lecture itself or a follow-up tutorial class.<p>However, the <i>reference material</i> will typically only have the abstract definitions, but at least there will be a sequence of them building up the formalities piece by piece. In principle, a gifted mathematician could follow the trail and get to the &quot;aha!&quot; moment without even having to do the homework problems.<p>Encyclopedias like Wikipedia or Mathworld tend to just mention the most abstract, &quot;end product&quot; of a long chain of mathematics. Terse formulas by themselves are utterly useless to anyone who hasn&#x27;t gone through the step-by-step learning process and already understands the topic completely.<p>It&#x27;s like a historian being given a handful of Egyptian hieroglyphic characters before finding the Rosetta Stone. It&#x27;s just squiggles and shapes!<p>An example I came across personally was the simplification of Maxwell&#x27;s Equations using Geometric Algebra. In GA, it is possible to write the equations of the EM fields incredibly tersely, down to as little as:<p><pre><code>    □²A = J\n</code></pre>\nThis is total gibberish to anyone who doesn&#x27;t already know volumes about Geometric Algebra. It literally states that: Square squared letter A is letter J. What!?<p>The 5 characters in that equation pack in an <i>awful</i> lot: The Geometric Product. Graded vector spaces. The four dimensional spacetime of special relativity. Vector calculus. Natural physical units. Etc...<p>Pasting that equation into an article can&#x27;t possibly cover all of that...')
