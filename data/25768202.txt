Here, the rasterizer is constructed to have the necessary property.<p>Note that if you had a perfect model of the physical process, and if it had no noise (e.g. no photon noise and no Johnson noise---impossible), and if the pixel intensities were given to infinite precision (as opposed to being discretized by the imager bit depth), then you could resolve arbitrarily small displacements of point light sources. I wonder if that points more to a continuity question than a differentiability question... but I felt compelled to make the connection in any case.<p>Returning back to your comment:\n&gt; case where discontinuous computations (polygon coverage at edges) are in fact meaningfully differentiable<p>It seems like the rasterizer ends up being a continuous computation, unless we disagree on what counts as the &quot;rasterizer&quot; (I&#x27;m including any anti-aliasing strategy, including one that underlyingly makes multiple calls to a discontinuous rasterizer.)<p>[1] Sound-Induced Motions of Individual Cochlear Hair Bundles\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC1304819&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC1304819&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Point_spread_function" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Point_spread_function</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=Eulerian%20Video%20magnification&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;qu...</a>')
