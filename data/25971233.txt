Item(by='Hamuko', descendants=None, kids=[25974602, 25972884], score=None, time=1612029399, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25971215, text='&gt;<i>so no waiting in line for 45 minutes every two years either</i><p>Pretty fucked up that you only check for air pollution and not actual road-worthiness.<p>Here all Teslas had an inspection failure rate after of 10.8% (61,000 km driven on average) in 2019 after three years of driving, which is quite bad. For comparison, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5-series both had 7.1% (108,000 km and 91,000 km driven on average). This suggests to me that Tesla owners should really spend more time queuing at the shop and at an inspection center.')
