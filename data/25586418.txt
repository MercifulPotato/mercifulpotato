(They say something along these lines in the discussion section, too.)\nAll the study says is that &quot;if you are a person that earns more than a threshold, you are typically not happier than a person who earns approximately the threshold salary&quot; (very stylised).\nThis is not the same as saying &quot;all else equal, if you&#x27;d earn more than the threshold salary, you would not be happier&quot;. So, in this kind of thought-experiment, where you get additional money that is free from, e.g., the typical downsides associated with it (e.g, more work, longer hours, more responsibility, or other things like that), you would not expect this to be applicable.\nHence, if you&#x27;re a person who is in a position where they can simply generate more income through, e.g., licensing deals, it does not seem unlikely that more income will actually make them happier.')
