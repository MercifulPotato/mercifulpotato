Apparently this is not an opinion that can be allowed on HN - it needs to be quashed.<p>(If anyone is inclined to read more, this is a good article: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lewrockwell.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;gary-d-barnett&#x2F;the-states-planned-covid-hell-is-coming-and-death-is-coming-with-it&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lewrockwell.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;gary-d-barnett&#x2F;the-state...</a>)<p>Back to the comment.<p>Yeah, thanks for your &#x27;concern&#x27;, but as you feel empowered to cast aspersions on my mental health, can I ask you to please take a look in the mirror?  Do you do that to people a lot, when people disagree with you?  At the least, it is a pretty juvenile tactic.  And you think I have a mental health issue?  Ok.  But then, you probably believe that people who argue against what the government and media say are mentally unwell, because? ... the government and media say so.  If you think for a second, you will see how circular that reasoning is, and should even be a little embarrassed that you uncritically accept what you are told.<p>As I see it, you seem to have bought the idea a re-branded flu is going to kill us all.  Have you seen or have any reason to believe that the virus is a real thing in your life?  Have you seen people dying?  Is there anything to indicate to you that this is real except for what you have seen on TV?  Did you believe that Independence Day was real too?<p>Appealing to your reason now, do you think that wearing a mask will help you breathe better and enable you to avoid illness?  That staying away from loved ones, is the way to show you care?  That staying at home is the way to optimal mental and physical health?  That putting something direct into you bloodstream, bypassing all your body&#x27;s defences, where you have no idea of the ingredients, is a good idea?  If so, why?  Is it because you have been taught by Big Brother (government, military, corporations) that this is &#x27;good&#x27;?  Do you trust Big Brother over yourself and your own reasoning?')
