Thank you, GitHub.<p>I hope this is a good demonstration of a hands-off approach at Microsoft in regard to company culture.<p>I realize you likely still collect some analytics for yourself and that this change does nothing to alleviate that.  EG, first party javascript.  But it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s divorced from 3rd parties.<p>Presumably Microsoft has access to those metrics, though? I wonder how deeply that gets parsed in conjunction with everything else they collect.<p>If only you could export some of that culture back to your corporate overlord.  I&#x27;d love if MS Teams stopped exploding it&#x27;s RAM usage until it eventually has to be killed if it&#x27;s unable to get an OK response from its analytics endpoint.<p>And I&#x27;d love to turn off analytics in Windows altogether.  Even getting to the minimal analytic configuration is an exercise in futility spread out across a million different settings, some of which decide to reset themselves in obfuscated ways sometimes.  eg, some think updates reset them, either directly or by doing things like changing default programs to ones which require analytics (eg Office).  Or a change to one setting requires additional changes elsewhere to be effective.')
