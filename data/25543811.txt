It&#x27;s actually very disturbing to me just how much of an echo chamber it has become.<p>Not only are slightly conservative ideas met with vitriol -- even the most ass-backwards, ridiculous ideas are showered in praise if they tow the liberal ideological line.<p>I suspect what we&#x27;re seeing is a huge dumbing down of the platform by people who don&#x27;t use it to think or be challenged.
