Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=[24995645], score=None, time=1604546212, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24994734, text='&gt; new&#x2F;modified proteins in resulting male mosquitoes that their immune systems donâ€™t recognize<p>What have I missed about the immune system interacting with mosquitoes?  The primary immune response I&#x27;m aware of that an organism would have with its food would be a food allergy.  Are you worried that the genes would jump from a human-biting mosquito species to a bird-biting species and the males would somehow mutate to also bite?  Mosquitoes don&#x27;t infect the animals they bite, so I don&#x27;t think our allergic immune responses to their bites are beneficial in any way.<p>Also, ever since a wilderness survival course in a Wisconsin forest in the mid 1990s exposed me to tons of mosquito bites, my immune response to female mosquito saliva is very suppressed to non-existent.  (I no longer swell up or feel itchy when bitten.  I presume I still have some immune response that could be measured by some blood test, but it&#x27;s nothing I can notice, even if I look closely at a spot where I&#x27;ve seen a mosquito bite me.)  Is there something I need to worry about my reduced immune response to mosquitoes?')
