Everything (that I tried) worked perfectly, except that the trackpad was jumpy. Eventually got fed up with the imprecision and put Win10 back on it (I still run Mint on a Yoga S730 and have Ubuntu under WSL2 on the L14).<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try again at some point as it is probably a simple fix; I just couldn&#x27;t spare the time to investigate. I&#x27;m assuming as this is a fairly new machine, when I try again in a few months it may work better.')
