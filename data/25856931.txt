For instance, there are interesting relationships between the possibility of closed timelike curves, the complexity of NP problems, and quantum computing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;democritus&#x2F;lec19.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;democritus&#x2F;lec19.html</a>\nSome highlights: &quot;closed timelike curve computers can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time&quot;, and &quot; if closed timelike curves existed, then quantum computers would be no more powerful than classical ones&quot;')
