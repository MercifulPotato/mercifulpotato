Discord has one of the most confusing UIs I&#x27;ve used for a while. My first exposure to Discord was when somebody told me to join their Discord server - I was like &quot;where do I put in the address?&quot;. Slack calls them &quot;workspaces&quot; which is less confusing. The channel interface is also quite confusing, as you say - joining a voice channel is really weird.<p>Still, the voice quality is way way ahead of anything else like Zoom or WhatsApp. I think that&#x27;s probably more important than anything else.')
