My accountant with 20 years experience makes less than 3k PLN&#x2F;month. 10k&#x2F;month here is very <i>very</i> good money, our prime minister only makes about 15k&#x2F;month and our president makes 17k&#x2F;month in comparison. 10k might be a little bit tighter in Warsaw but live literally anywhere else and you will be paid more than 99% of people around you.')
