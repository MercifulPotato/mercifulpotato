I don&#x27;t live in the dream land, and I try to double check reality best I can.<p>To this day all I have from all this is head scratching and we have no proof of anything aside from that the Pentagon -for whatever reason- has confirmed that the cockpit videos were genuinely released by them.  You can request them yourself from the Pentagon, directly.<p>I am convinced that the man is a good officer and a competent pilot. That is all.  Occam&#x27;s razor: things outlined in that report are true -or - the man is a true patriot, participating in a disinformation campaign design to bankrupt the Chinese or Russians in attempting to recreate some of the very expensive things outlined in the larger picture described here.<p>But I keep peeled to anything related to this story because the implication behind the claims are potentially world-changing.')
