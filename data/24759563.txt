After removing their shells, grind the acorns into a flour, then cover with water.   Each day for a week, drain off the water and add fresh water.   At the end of the week, the water should be clear.   Dry the acorn flour in the sun.<p>You can use the flour to make dotorimuk (acorn jelly): add to water, boil until it thickens, pour into dish, let it cool.')
