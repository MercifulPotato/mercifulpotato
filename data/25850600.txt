They were your senior support staff or were operations; some companies combined this into a formal role called &quot;Support&quot; or &quot;Service&quot; &quot;Operations.&quot;<p>But then we as an industry decided that operations is bad[0] and if you write the code then you can obviously test the code, deploy the code, maintain the code, and support the code.  Then every Hip And Cool Start-Up adopted the model of &quot;sysadmins and support staff are bad because we&#x27;ve had bad experiences in the past so we will also have our devs talk directly to customers until they get tired of doing that and we just replace it with a contact form encumbered by CAPTCHA and a no-reply e-mail address.&quot;<p>As someone who has greatly enjoyed, been very good, and very well paid (so my employers agreed that I was good at it), at support and operations roles only to see them disappear into the inky void of Everyone Codes All Of The Time, I am both biased and frustrated.<p>0 - Because money, I suspect.')
