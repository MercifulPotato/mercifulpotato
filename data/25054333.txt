Item(by='fairity', descendants=None, kids=[25054597], score=None, time=1605056435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25053957, text='&gt; Why is it that we find it appropriate to shame her and not a founder&#x2F;ceo who does effectively the same thing?<p>In the case of Halloween candy, the owner of the candy is offering each person up to a few pieces of candy for free.  If you take more than a few pieces, you are stealing from the candy owner.  Stealing is bad because we believe in the right to private property. Stealing is, in fact, illegal.  Of course, our legal system isn&#x27;t set up to enforce punishment for small actions, so shame is a useful alternative form of punishment.<p>&gt; Why can we not apply these same rules of decency to business?<p>In the case of employment, each employee is offering the business owner his&#x2F;her time in exchange for a salary and equity.  The expectations are crystal clear to both parties.  When the business owner sells the company, taking his fair share of the purchase price (as determined by his equity stake) is NOT stealing.  Nor, is it breaking any norms or expectations.<p>&gt; By spreading the fruits of successful innovation more broadly you put the people who enabled that innovation in a position to use that experience to innovate further<p>I actually agree with this specific point for an isolated case.  That is, in isolation, spreading the purchase price for a huge acquisition evenly across the employee base would probably lead to greater innovation.<p>However, this only makes sense in isolation.  If you make it common practice to share acquisition price more evenly among employees, you destroy the financial incentive that drives much of entrepreneurship.<p>Startups are very risky, and without a huge payout for success at the end, the expected values just don&#x27;t work out anymore.  Smart engineers will be much better off applying for a traditional FANG job.  In fact, this is already the case!  What you&#x27;re proposing would just make the math even worse.  Remember, for every success case like this, there are 4 or more founders who failed.  There better be a sweet reward at the end of the tunnel to keep them motivated to keep trying!<p>Furthermore, for small acquisitions like this, even if you were to split his 3.7M payday across his 20 employees, each person gets $18.5K.  Hardly an amount that would spur innovation.')
