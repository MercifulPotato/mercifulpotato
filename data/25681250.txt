You don&#x27;t even know me. I am guilty, however, of writing poorly.<p>I said that it was a meme, and that the evidence in video footage does not unambiguously substantiate the meme. I didn&#x27;t deny the <i>possibility</i> of the police being complicit. A few confusing videos of a few officers acting in ways that I don&#x27;t understand in stressful situations (in a police department with over 2000), or the speculation of (so-called) experts that it might have been, just is insufficient for me to accuse that police department of participating in a coup.<p>In fact, I am urgently concerned that there was a conspiracy by the police department to commit insurrection. I am desperately afraid that it was a coordinated coup. Trump&#x27;s reticence to provide National Guard support, and the fact that Pence actually gave the order, is very troubling. But I&#x27;m not gonna believe catchy easy narratives that push all the buttons. That&#x27;s how millions of Trumpers got to believing that the election was stolen in the first place.')
