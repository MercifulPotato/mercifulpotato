You ought to relax, take pride in the job well done, and not worry about the credit. </i><p><i>This would be wise advice, if only the situation were like thatâ€”if the job were done and it were time to relax. If only that were true! But challenges abound, and this is no time to take the future for granted. Our community&#x27;s strength rests on commitment to freedom and cooperation.
