You can sell AGPL&#x27;d software.<p>But doesn&#x27;t SSPL allow you to offer ElasticSearch-as-a-Service as long as you contribute the source code that makes it work? Many have commented on how that requirement is a no-go for AWS however they are not a priori forbidden by the license from doing so.')
