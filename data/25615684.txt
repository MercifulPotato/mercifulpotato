That&#x27;s why most successful OSM-based consumer applications serve a few niches incredibly well. This is not counting the dozens of companies offering OSM-based base maps for use in other, mostly non-map-related uses (such as a store locator or data visualization tool).<p>OSM has the advantage of time, no need to make money, and a vibrant community around it. Google has to make money directly or indirectly via Google Maps to justify continued investment; OSM simply has to exist, and the longer it exists, the better the data will become. As the ecosystem around OSM improves (and continues building positive feedback loops), I strongly suspect we will see a successful consumer-targeted app using OSM data, and it will be much better than the many (good) apps right now, simply because another 5-10 years of accumulated data improvements outstrip the competition&#x27;s willingness to continue investing.<p>Caveat: I cofounded an OSM base map provider. I&#x27;m biased. :-)')
