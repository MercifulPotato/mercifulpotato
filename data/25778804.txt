I consider myself moderately successful (I run a small business that I managed to build from scratch through trial and error after studying the &quot;hot&quot; fields and working in the industry). I am happy with my life and I&#x27;m trying to pass my mindset to my kids to make sure they can find what works for them.<p>From what I can see, I am the only example of this in their life. The mainstream media talks about how we are privileged and should step back, not want anything, and let others have it. The role models of prosperity are Instragram celebrities and pop singers, that have a hard cap on their numbers by definition. Nobody takes the long road with rewards further down seriously, and this is saddening. Because the people I know that followed the instant gratification route years ago are not happy at all right now.<p>And the trouble is that once you are the only person with this mindset in your neighborhood, and are wealthier than others, people with pitchforks will come for you. It won&#x27;t help that you made your fortune through hard work if your neighbors think it&#x27;s unfair. There have been historic precedents. Kulaks in early Soviet Union [0] is a very good example. Mccloskeys case from last year is another one.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dekulakization" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dekulakization</a>')
