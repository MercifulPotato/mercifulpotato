I think it&#x27;s likely that he has Asperger&#x27;s based solely on comparing his actions and words with those of my friends who&#x27;ve been diagnosed with Aspergers&#x27;, but I don&#x27;t actually know that he does.<p>With that out of the way, I haven&#x27;t heard of anyone harassing him <i>for having Asperger&#x27;s</i>. However, I think it&#x27;s possible that he has it and that it has led him to saying things in untactful ways, and it&#x27;s those things he&#x27;s said that irk people. I can empathize with people who wouldn&#x27;t want someone who says those things to represent an organization that they work with, regardless of what caused the person to say them.')
