If it were more deadly like Ebola, people would be taking it far more seriously and it would burn itself out quicker. If it were less deadly, akin to the flu, we wouldn&#x27;t have too many deaths regardless. It seems to sit right in the sweet spot of just deadly enough to cause mass casualties while being benign enough that a large portion of people don&#x27;t take it seriously, and thus contribute to it&#x27;s uncontrollable spread. This will easily end up killing more Americans than the 1918 flu by the end of next year.')
