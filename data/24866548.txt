Or leave for industry&#x2F;NGOs&#x2F;public sector&#x2F;politics&#x2F;entrepreneurship if that&#x27;s not what you want?<p>I&#x27;d think that the vast majority of people who enter grad school now don&#x27;t do that with the intention do &quot;climb up the academic career ladder&quot;, and if that is true, it doesn&#x27;t need to be a problem at all.<p>There seems to be this assumption that it&#x27;s desirable for everyone to always be progressing upwards in the institutional hierarchy.<p>I don&#x27;t think all these people are as delusional as you imply.')
