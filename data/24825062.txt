You <i>are</i> paying for the experience of making it yourself.<p>(And this is before we get into relative wood pricing between countries; it took me a long time to understand why America had all those wood-framed and paneled houses while they&#x27;re virtually absent in the UK, and of course it&#x27;s because the local old forests were depleted in previous centuries. To the point where there was a whole pre-20th century peasant architecture of stone houses with only a single piece of serious lumber in: the roof beam.)')
