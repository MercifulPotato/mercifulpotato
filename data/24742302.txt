Item(by='eigenvector', descendants=None, kids=[24743817], score=None, time=1602368661, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740613, text='Anecdotally, Canada &amp; US Amazon used to be like you described when they first started becoming the &quot;everything&quot; store but things have really declined lately.<p>6 or 7 years ago there was a much higher proportion of items actually sold by Amazon. Now it&#x27;s a morass of third-party sellers with inaccurate listings to the point that even just finding an item is quite a choice. I recently gave up trying to buy kitchen knives because most listings had no OEM part number, a vague description and photo and people arguing in the Q&amp;A section about basic features like whether it had a serrated edge or not.<p>Amazon has become a dumping ground for people who buy things on Alibaba, at liquidation or even just at Costco and try to resell for a markup. Even a search for basic consumer products like a box of cereal will have the top results be these kinds of sellers. For instance, I just searched for &quot;ichiban noodles&quot; (a popular international brand of instant noodles that can be found for &lt;$1&#x2F;each in any grocery store in Canada). The top result is a pack of 8 for $27!<p>Yes, Amazon still replaces or refunds almost anything that you have an issue with, but I&#x27;d rather just get the thing I wanted the first time.<p>A perfect of example of this is a picture frame I bought from Amazon (or rather, third party seller fulfilled by Amazon). It arrived damaged because it was thrown into a too-large box with no padding. I notified Amazon and they sent another one. It arrived identically packaged and also damaged. Then I asked for a refund. At this point, almost a month had passed and I still didn&#x27;t have a picture frame, despite a huge amount of resources having been consumed by Amazon.<p>No store that actually has to bear the cost of returns themselves would do that, but Amazon made out like kings on the transaction: they got a cut of the original purchase, their FBA fees, then got to charge the seller for disposal of a broken item - twice!')
