But this is moving the goalpost. The question was not whether one could stop working without having to make changes to their lifestyle. The question was whether one could stop working without literally starving to death. In most developed countries, the answer is yes. No one really starves to death due to poverty in developed nations anymore.<p>I am not too familiar with the situation with the poverty in the US. Do people there still die from poverty-induced starvation in the 21st century?')
