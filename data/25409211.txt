Item(by='ggggtez', descendants=None, kids=[25410583], score=None, time=1607886886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25408893, text='&gt; It&#x27;s hard to argue that tariffs on goods from China don&#x27;t make it less attractive to buy goods from China.<p>Disagree. I think this is small minded. So you add a tariff on chinese goods. If they are not the cheapest, then you buy from elsewhere... which still isn&#x27;t the USA.<p>And then China does the same thing: retaliating with tariffs, and then buying goods from elsewhere, which isn&#x27;t the USA either.<p>So in this game, tariffs probably hurt businesses in <i>both</i> countries.<p>And, anecdotally: I still buy products from china. More today than 4 years ago. The products for sale on Amazon are often just chinese imports that have been marked up or re-branded. I think it&#x27;s the exception, rather than the rule, that tariffs did anything positive for someone.')
