They don&#x27;t even know what they think until they speak. So often, you&#x27;ll let people speak and they become aware of some internal contradictions or maybe they shock themselves... they hear what they have to say and it&#x27;s being revealed to themselves. That is often enough to change them. But even if it isn&#x27;t... you want that out in the air so that people can hear it. Do you want to drive people that hate underground? We know what happens psychologically when you do that - anything you drive underground thrives. It partly thrives because it isn&#x27;t allowed to express itself and then it festers and turns into hatred that far exceeds the original. The idea that you make society safe by not letting horrible people say terrible things is not a good proposition - you want those people out in the open where they can say what they have to say. First of all, so they can see what they&#x27;re like. Second of all so they can see how people respond, because you don&#x27;t even know what you should think, in some sense, until you watch how people respond.&quot;<p>-Jordan Peterson [1]<p>The recent Digital Censorship Campaign(s) are attempts to manicure the modern social landscape, in order to identify &amp; quell dissent impeding the more favorable cohesion that would define a progressive society.<p>Consider that the recent commander-in-chief curriculum vitae includes &quot;reality TV&quot; - this qualifies as an acting shaman we can deploy (kingmaker initiative) as part of a four year plan to draw corresponding minds out of the expansive woodwork (given permission to imitate what they are strategically being fed on their handheld screens). Behind closed doors, this operative enjoys symphonies and philosophical musings, but on camera the real work is being done. The resulting &quot;following&quot; is what we are all meant to see - the ones Among Us willing to betray cordial&#x2F;calm&#x2F;civilized mannerisms in favor of the Will of an Absolute Demigod (direct contradiction to hive-mind democracy &amp; consensus).<p>We do not seek to reciprocate the harm enacted towards us.
