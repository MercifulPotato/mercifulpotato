Of course, I had to get all that info from thedonald.win because almost no-one else is talking about this. Coincidentally, I also think  thedonald.win is only hours away from having their domain name taken from under them. This is crazy, crazy stuff.<p>If it matters I&#x27;m not an American citizen, have never set foot in the US (even though it&#x27;s a country I admire in many ways, just right now I&#x27;m reading a selection of Anti-Federalist papers in order to try and understand it better), have grown up as a kid in Ceausescu&#x27;s one-party state Romania and I have to tell you that this doesn&#x27;t look good.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BrandonStraka&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347592064322719744" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BrandonStraka&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347592064322719744</a>')
