If Black American culture is taken a &quot;second class&quot;, and it often is, that is because of the continuation of white supremacy.<p>Edit: And blanket statements on the attitudes of African Americans generally are unfortunate. What is visible as the supposed attitude of group X is by no means the universal or even predominant attitude. Your post is interesting for describing some ironic contrasts but problematic for trying to universalize them.')
