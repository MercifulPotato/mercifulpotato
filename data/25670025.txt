I just can&#x27;t see it any other way, with Facebook&#x27;s blatant disregard for anything but its own greedy interests.<p>If Facebook keeps pushing their &quot;luck&quot; like this, it should simply have all its assets on EU soil frozen. If eventually rules a criminal organization, confiscated too. It would be very sad and unfortunate for any EU citizens working for the company, who no doubt have no say in Facebook&#x27;s criminal enterprise. But the current status quo is becoming completely unacceptable.<p>History has plenty of lessons, about criminal organizations rising to (hard to defeat levels of) power. In many cases more than anything because both societies and governments&#x2F;authorities failed to respond appropriately in time, when they still had a fair chance containing those (with far less effort).<p>All that is even without opening the can of worms that is the access US government agencies have to all of Facebook&#x27;s data.')
