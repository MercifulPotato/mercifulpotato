I switch between Go and Java. Go is the language I want my coworkers to use. I&#x27;d rather read &quot;bad&quot; Go code than &quot;bad&quot; Java code all day long. Bad Java can be truly excruciating to read and review, particularly due to the poor choice of abstractions. Whereas, Go mostly gets out of the way and may be written poorly but is straightforwardly written poorly.<p>Still, there&#x27;s a certain sense of aesthetic beauty that I just can&#x27;t derive from Go, and why I kind of hate working in it. There&#x27;s lots of things about Java and OO that I don&#x27;t love, but reading a perfectly factored Java code base can be just beautiful. Mostly due to good choice of interfaces.<p>Now, those code bases might be rare and not worth the lift of a million bad abstractions. I&#x27;d probably agree at this point, but still, I find it odd that most Go code bases just feel dirty and thrown together to me. Hacking stuff together in a mostly procedural language with good deployment story is probably the right way to write for-profit code, but I&#x27;m not sure I love it.')
