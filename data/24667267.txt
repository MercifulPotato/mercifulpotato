Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601674706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24667196, text='Yeah, that&#x27;s basically how it works. But the local non-profit organization doing that work and getting grants and the like is where I applied for a job, wasn&#x27;t hired and then got crapped all over for about two years by the guy they did hire. It was completely unnecessary to make me his enemy because I was happy to help as a volunteer.<p>Since I am not going to get that job, I am trying to figure out how to do this on my own and make enough money at it to make it worth my while, knowing that the guy who got the job I applied for is likely to continue stealing anything I publish on the internet that he can use to pretend to do his job.<p>I have set up a reddit site called r&#x2F;CoastalWA. This area is making national news as a relative safe haven in the face of things like climate change, but it&#x27;s all small towns and unincorporated communities. So these are places that don&#x27;t have a lot of funds to spend and anyone really talented tends to get a better paying job in a bigger city elsewhere. (The town I lived in interviewed a city manager candidate, offered them the job and they went elsewhere for more money.)<p>I have a background in doing volunteer work and my target market is people without a lot of resources, but I think it is important work. And any business has some stuff they give away for free -- even the multi-billion dollar business Y Combinator, which provides HN for free.<p>I kind of want to do what Y Combinator has done, only for small town and unincorporated communities and for mostly small businesses and micro businesses. So I can&#x27;t use a VC model like they are using.<p>But if no one does this work, then outsiders with money will just come in here, buy up cheap land and piss all over everything.<p>I don&#x27;t want to set up a non-profit. I would rather tun this as a sole proprietor and give away a lot for free on my website plus offer paid services and try to get it crowd funded by people willing and able to give a few bucks a month to a Patreon or whatever, but unable to pay the big salaries for a full-time local planner or the big fees for someone doing significant work on a contract basis.<p>I am still working out the details in my mind.<p>Thank you for engaging me! It is always good to have something to chew on or reply to. It helps me think!')
