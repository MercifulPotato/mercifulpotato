Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603212701, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24839406, text='&gt; The question absolutely is whether Apple can be trusted.<p>This is a false dichotomy. I choose to use a Mac, but I also choose not to let my Mac phone home to Cupertino unless I allow it. Why can&#x27;t I have that choice? Why does it have to be all or nothing? I&#x27;m <i>only</i> interested in the Mac, I have zero interest in Apple &quot;services&quot;. It&#x27;s a fine computing device, but I see no reason why the device has to continue to talk to Apple after I purchase it, except to download software updates â€” which I manually trigger.<p>It&#x27;s not about trust, it&#x27;s about choice.<p>EDIT: Now if Apple provided a way to easily disable all of those &quot;services&quot; that phone home, there would be a lot fewer complaints about this issue. But they don&#x27;t.')
