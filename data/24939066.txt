It&#x27;s fine as a full-stack framework, and rather nice for quickly building out a back-end API, but not really compelling if you&#x27;re only using the front-end side of things IMO.<p>That said, I would argue that Ruby is a very similar but nicer scripting language than Python (particularly for general utility &#x2F; glue scripts), so if you enjoy scripting in Python you would probably find Ruby easy to pick up and potentially a nice compliment to what you already know.')
