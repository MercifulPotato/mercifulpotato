Item(by='TheOperator', descendants=None, kids=[25652412], score=None, time=1609795319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25623965, text='I believe you&#x27;re bias towards centrism and the belief that the truth is somewhere in the middle, the cited people are wrong, and their perception of this site having a socialist lean is precisely what demonstrates their own bias.  Believing that other people disagree with me proves we must both be wrong is ridiculous, you can in fact be wrong along with the people you quoted, rather than the sole voice of reason in an irrational site.<p>I made that statement because I saw the thread the other day about the same topic and all the top posts were people who think any store owner should have a right to remove problematic references to medical drugs.  Including many posts about how the person in question should just give in without protest.  Because of strong tyranny of the majority effects intrinsic to systems like Hacker News, once an update put the view that the person should &quot;just give in&quot; in a bad light, the slim majority of posters stopped posting and the slim minority of posters who were critical of apple thereafter posted with confidence.  The reason you see so many people with differing views is that the community actually has a great diversity in its views, but still has slight biases, which are amplified by the site format, not the fact that everybody who notices these slight biases are bias themselves.')
