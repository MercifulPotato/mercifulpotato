A derailleur will not be 1.5% energy loss across all gears. And I&#x27;ve not seen a chart for an internal hub that had 15% energy loss across all gears.<p>If you actually take a look at your derailleur system, you&#x27;ll notice that a) the chain is not straight in all but a few settings, b) it has a somewhat complicated arm with an extra sprocket to keep the chain tight. And it is harder to protect it with a guard, so you end up with more dirt in the system if you use it every day.<p>But yes, internal hubs are heavier, generally somewhat less efficient, and better protected against the elements.')
