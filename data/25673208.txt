Item(by='YZF', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610037427, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25668702, text='No.  I&#x27;m just a guy on the Internet.  I&#x27;m not American.  You&#x27;re asking me to spend time.  You presented some evidence.  I spent time.  I&#x27;m not convinced.  Why would I sink more time into this?  Maybe next time before you ask random people on the Internet to go spend time to understand your position you can spend the time yourself to make a more compelling argument and not just copy-paste random stuff from Google.<p>Why is this a question of &quot;view&quot;?  Isn&#x27;t the picture pretty clear?  I don&#x27;t really have a view here other than &quot;someone is wrong on the Internet&quot; ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;386&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;386&#x2F;</a> ).  And that someone just happens to be you ;) (oops, condescending again).  My political views don&#x27;t really align with much of what&#x27;s going on in the US on both major parties.<p>If President X won by 1 vote, and you didn&#x27;t vote for President Y (oops, ignore that&#x27;s not how &quot;democracy&quot; works in the US, doesn&#x27;t matter how many people vote for X), then I&#x27;m sorry but your not voting is what made X president.  You can spin that anyway you want but it seems like a pretty universal fact.  Can US presidents be recalled?<p>Anyhow, I will agree with one point I think you&#x27;re making, democracy in the USA is really screwed up.  Keep in mind there&#x27;s other ways of participating in the democratic process, you can run to office yourself or get involved in the campaign of someone who resonates with you.<p>&quot;condescendingly phrase&quot; - I&#x27;m sorry.  I probably am being condescending.  It&#x27;s age and my annoyance and disappointment with the USA.  Really, what the heck is wrong with you people?  Try and tune that out and listen to the core of my position.  I.e. there&#x27;s no credible evidence that the result of the elections is due to some massive fraud or conspiracy.<p>EDIT: I also want to add that I&#x27;m not shutting you out.  I&#x27;m just asking for some sort of evidence that I can go look at and is going to be compelling&#x2F;convincing and pointing out that asking someone to watch a one hour video (I watched a portion, randomly, and it had nothing) or to follow some random links (I followed one, randomly, and found nothing) isn&#x27;t really the way to go about asking someone form an opinion or change an opinion.  I don&#x27;t think (in my biased opinion) that this is a situation where I&#x27;m clearly holding a wrong view, there&#x27;s a mountain of good evidence to that extent, and I&#x27;m just ignoring it and sticking with my views.  But hey, maybe I&#x27;m wrong.<p>EDIT2: I should know better than arguing with random people on the Internet.  But like I said, this is actually important stuff that impact everyone on this planet.  If you guys can&#x27;t get your act together, who can?<p>EDIT3: Let&#x27;s use my edit window fully.  So you&#x27;re saying the election was not stolen except there&#x27;s no way Biden really received all these votes?  Or am I misreading your original commentary?  So it was stolen?  Or it wasn&#x27;t stolen?<p>Did Obama also start a war?  I honestly can&#x27;t keep track any more.')
