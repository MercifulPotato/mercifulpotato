After creating a bunch of code screencasts, I&#x27;ve found most of my editing time is spent manually cutting out chunks of silence, and it&#x27;s always felt like a job the computer should be doing.<p>So I&#x27;m making a native Mac app to do it for me. It&#x27;s in private beta right now, and feedback has been good so far!<p>I&#x27;m hoping to hoping to get it launched in the next few weeks. Aiming for a minimal useful feature set initially â€“ recording the screen, removing silence, and exporting (either an edited video, or the timeline of cuts, to enable editing in Resolve&#x2F;Premiere&#x2F;ScreenFlow), and I&#x27;ll build up from there.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getrecut.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getrecut.com</a>')
