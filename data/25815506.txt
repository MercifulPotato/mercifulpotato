You can&#x27;t have &quot;one way&quot; loyalty; that&#x27;s devotion, or allegiance, or even servitude. That means for a person to be loyal to a business the business would also need to be loyal in return. Unfortunately that never stands the test of time; as soon as anything bad happens where the owners have to choose between the employee and something bad (making a loss, going bankrupt, favoring some other employee) the business owners will inevitably pick what&#x27;s best for the business.<p>So no, employees shouldn&#x27;t be loyal, because the reciprocity of a loyal relation is rarely there. That doesn&#x27;t mean the employees should be &amp;$%Â£s though.')
