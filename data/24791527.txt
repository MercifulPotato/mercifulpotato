It only cares about the next quarter, or until the buyout comes.  Everyone knows the phrase &quot;exit strategy,&quot; but nobody knows the phrase &quot;quality and service.&quot;<p>In my experience, 1%† of the people in the SV bubble are doing it to make a quality product.  They&#x27;re just there to make a quick buck.<p>(† Less than 1% in the Seattle bubble)')
