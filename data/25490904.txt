I thought it was an enlightening experience because it showed me that the core principles behind regular languages are fairly simple, although you could spend years optimizing and improving your implementation. How do you deal with unicode? How do you modify your implementation to know how many characters you can skip if you don&#x27;t have a match in order to avoid testing every single position in a file?<p>It demystified the concept of a regex engine for me while at the same time making me realize how impressive the advanced, ultra optimized engines we use and take for granted are.')
