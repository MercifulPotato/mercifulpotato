Hold on before you downvote folks and count the number of &#x27;native&#x27; applications that were written since year 2010.<p>Most consumer applications are now webapps or electron apps. From accounting software to music players, they are not native.<p>If someone botheres to make a desktop app, you either have proffeshionals tools or resource intensive applications like Adobe Photoshop, Blender3D, 3Dmax, IntelliJ IDE&#x27;s and Games. None of them look native either!<p>Almost noone bothers to develop platform spesific apps, and native applications are dying. If we don&#x27;t stop squabbling about native look and feel, we will get no native applications at all.')
