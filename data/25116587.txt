If you log in with john.q.doe@gmail.com but originally had registered your gmail as johnqdoe, then your login automatically changes to the non-dot form.<p>2. If you have already registered via email on john.q.doe@gmail.com, then you cannot login-with-Google in the above case, as both accounts are separate and distinct in the host system.<p>3. If you have two accounts under your school and work account, but log-in-with-Facebook, and Facebook has both your emails, it gets confused.<p>4. There are cases where you simply cannot log in due to the network of conflicts across the identity services.<p>...and yet this is also awesome because you get to convert a registered user ASAP in 95% of the cases.')
