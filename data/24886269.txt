For any individual study you have to at the minimum pay attention to sample size&#x2F;population, what kind of study it was, and often looking at the methods&#x2F;study design as well. There will often be caveats or additional wrinkles.  For example:<p>Shiroma, Eric J., Howard D. Sesso, M. V. Moorthy, Julie E. Buring, and I‐Min Lee. “Do Moderate‐Intensity and Vigorous‐Intensity Physical Activities Reduce Mortality Rates to the Same Extent?” Journal of the American Heart Association 3, no. 5 (September 16, 2014). <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1161&#x2F;JAHA.114.000802" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1161&#x2F;JAHA.114.000802</a>.<p>&quot;Among men, but not women, additional modest reductions in all-cause mortality rates are associated with a greater proportion of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity performed at a vigorous intensity.&quot;<p>Fisher, Gordon, Andrew W. Brown, Michelle M. Bohan Brown, Amy Alcorn, Corey Noles, Leah Winwood, Holly Resuehr, Brandon George, Madeline M. Jeansonne, and David B. Allison. “High Intensity Interval- vs Moderate Intensity- Training for Improving Cardiometabolic Health in Overweight or Obese Males: A Randomized Controlled Trial.” PLoS ONE 10, no. 10 (October 21, 2015). <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1371&#x2F;journal.pone.0138853" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1371&#x2F;journal.pone.0138853</a>.<p>&quot;While both exercise groups led to similar improvements for most cardiometabolic risk factors assessed, MIT led to a greater improvement in overall cardiovascular fitness.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d also say that while it&#x27;s tempting to just skim through the abstract and the conclusion, oftentimes, the Discussion is where the real meat is, and in cases of controversy, careful attention needs to be paid to the authors, the raw data (sadly, especially in the nutrition space, there is often discordance between the observations published, statistical massaging, and the conclusions drawn...) and followup commentary.<p>For the HIIT study you referenced, I did find this commentary, which was pretty interesting (it&#x27;s worth noting that I don&#x27;t consider this topic area to be particularly controversial&#x2F;heated - differences seem modest, and honestly, the biggest thing seems to actually be getting <i>any</i> physical activity, vs none for most people...):<p>Coswig, Victor S., Paulo Gentil, João P.
