There is no reason to have DOS instead of BASIC other than it has fewer features to be implemented.<p>For all the bashing BASIC gets for favoring unstructured programming, you could do a lot in it as a first gear programming language. Think of the amount of bash scripts that shuffle strings around and ask if you would not rather program in e.g. python if it gave immediate access to files.')
