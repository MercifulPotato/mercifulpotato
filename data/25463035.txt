Item(by='ALittleLight', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608257555, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25462617, text='I had thought about adding a &quot;top ten likes&quot; list, but decided against it because people might try to like their own website to get it highly ranked, and it would be very easy to programmatically like a website an arbitrary number of times. I think showing a list of bad websites has a similar problem, e.g. there is a communist website in there and some kind of polyamorous Christian-swingers forum, if someone had ideological problems with a website like this they could try to flag it.<p>Rather than sharing feedback, which might create bad incentives, I&#x27;ll just add it to my review page, where I review and approve submissions. I&#x27;ll look and see if anything is getting reported and then choose to remove or leave it.')
