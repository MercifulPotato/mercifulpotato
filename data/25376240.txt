For those using cPanel on CentOS, this will be a logical choice especially if they&#x27;re already using CloudLinux (many are). Plus they plan it possible to convert CentOS 8 to their new RHEL fork, which perhaps Rocky Linux plans on doing too.<p>Given the installation base of cPanel, whichever fork they decide to officially support will probably win out. And I&#x27;ll be dollars to donuts that they&#x27;ll pick CloudLinux&#x27;s fork, since they already support CloudLinux.')
