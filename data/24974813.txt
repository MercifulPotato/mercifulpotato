In fact, the construction industry is the slowest in the country between finishing work and getting paid for it. Siteline is building a fast and foolproof experience enabling millions of people to pay and get paid with ease. While it’s still early, you can take a peek at what we’re up to at siteline.com. Bottom line, we’re on a journey to solve a big problem for an industry that’s integral to society. There’s a huge opportunity to get in at the ground floor of advancing the industry.<p>We are looking for a senior UX&#x2F;frontend engineer to join our strong founding team. The team is small, tight-knit, and has a very high degree of trust. We believe that the best products are created by designers and engineers working hand-in-hand to inspire each other, and have tried to create a culture that allows for that close collaboration as much as possible.<p>We have early customers and are funded by top-tier seed stage investors including First Round, Brick &amp; Mortar (#1 early-stage construction tech fund), and Designer Fund.<p>If interested, please reach out to me directly joel@siteline.com.')
