You’ve had 1 sale which is good, that shows it is something at least someone wants. But consider this: if you’re spending 1 day on building something, the barrier to someone else building it is very low.<p>Since this is HN, I’m assuming this is some sort of software.  Building software is complicated and there is a reason most tools out there have lots of engineers working full time on it. You’re not going to retire off of a quick 24 hour build session. Nor even by building hundreds of little one day tools.<p>This practice could be good to find a market where there is clearly a need, but building a quality product, not a quick one, is where you’ll derive the most success.<p>Sure, sales and marketing can help you profit off of lower quality apps (not a judgment of your skill, but 24 hours isn’t enough time to build a quality app that has any level of complexity), but it will only get you so far.')
