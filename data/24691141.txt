If an amateur carpenter is trying to hammer screws into wood, you hand him a screw driver, not try to invent some sort of hammer with a twisting mechanism that turns screws when you wack them.  Use the right tool for the job, and use it like it&#x27;s meant to be used.  If the workers involved don&#x27;t understand the right tool, then either train them or hire new workers who do.')
