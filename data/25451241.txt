Without the guarantee of binary compatibility, any CentOS Stream update may break your locally installed applications.<p>And I only recall CentOS significantly trailing RHEL at the major version updates (e.g. 6 and 7).  Other updates seem pretty timely, and the major version lag doesn&#x27;t leave me vulnerable.<p>I can see this being useful for developers who are building something that needs to be compatible with the next major release of RHEL, but I&#x27;m not sure who else it will be useful for.')
