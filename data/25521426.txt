Item(by='MauranKilom', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608753138, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25519718, text='One important thing I want to note for chronic &quot;interview preppers&quot;:<p>The interviewer wants to get to know <i>you</i>, not the <i>interview you</i>! They want to understand what it would be like to work with you and how you tackle new problems. It is therefore of very little use to them if you just have boilerplate answers to throw back at behavioral questions and&#x2F;or if you already know the answer to every technical problem off-hand. Assuming your job will involve creative problem solving struggle, displaying some of that in the interview is a bonus (although it&#x27;s of course up to the interviewer to tailor the problems accordingly). You probably won&#x27;t be rejected for doing <i>too well</i> on the technical part, but don&#x27;t hide your personality and technical aptitude behind walls of preparation.<p>&gt; &quot;Remember, never let them see you sweat&quot; Vince told me. But when the stakes are low and youâ€™re having fun, who sweats?<p>This <i>can</i> backfire. It&#x27;s great if you enjoy tackling the interview problems, and sincerity is great, but indifference is not a good look.<p>&gt; And as an interviewer, I can attest: sincere interest is always a good sign.<p>Fully agreed.')
