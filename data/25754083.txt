I also feel personally guilty for not having been as well-informed as I should have been. I&#x27;m just glad I experienced a tell-tale symptom (loss of smell&#x2F;taste) and was able to act on it before boarding a plane.<p>Another interesting aspect of this is that prior to experiencing loss of smell&#x2F;taste, I was more or less told by urgent care staff that I didn&#x27;t have COVID, and they were pretty resistant to testing me -- hence I only got rapid tests. Yet I actually was right in the midst of an active case.')
