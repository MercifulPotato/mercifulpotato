I have been deeply dissatisfied with just about every system. I found Google Play music to be okay.<p>My best luck these days is what I would call a &quot;brute force&quot; search through record labels, last.fm similar artists, bandcamp pages for genres, sputnik listings for particular genres, etc.<p>It&#x27;s very hit or miss, but I feel like it leads to me to my occasional lightning strikes, which are what I <i>really</i> want. These discoveries are quite different from the guesses put forward my recommendation engines, which seem to smooth out the interesting edges and signatures of personality and gradually draws toward a lowest common denominator, with no lightning strikes.')
