In my sophomore year, I had to take an introductory compiler course where we created a compiler for the WLP4 language almost from scratch. WLP4 is a subset of C++. I worked on this side-project not only to better understand the LLVM framework but also to brush up my compiler theory knowledge. I learnt about the Earley parsing algorithm while working on this project and I have used the same inside the project. It is still a WIP since I want to add tests as well as debug information support. I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts and feedback!')
