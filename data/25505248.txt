Now even the 22&quot; inch LG ultrafine that used to be 4069 x 2304 is bigger at 24&quot; and a worse 3,840 x 2,160. The only good option for mac is the 27 ultrafine 5k.<p>27 4k a bad size &amp; resolution for the current computer market. Windows scaling looks like crap, and MacOS has to do more resource intensive 1.5 scaling (as opposed to native or pixel doubling mode) to look okay on these.<p>M1 might make this a mute point going forward, but the fact is at 27 inches, 5k is the only monitor that will look as good as the screen on your laptop while actually giving you more real estate.')
