But when I buy a pitchfork, I do care about the source of the handle&#x27;s wood because I do not want to contribute to deforestation. I also look at the repairability. For example, would any standard handle fit? And can I attach one myself? And the &quot;usability&quot; of the handle, and the fork as a whole, is another factor that is important to me. Often, just from handling them, you do get a good feel if the pitchfork makers actually seem to care about their users and know what they are doing or not.')
