I of course do want transparency there.<p>I also value utterly unfiltered sources. But, I do not need or want <i>every</i> source to be unfiltered. Then everything becomes a firehose of utter garbage.<p>I think there is room for both. But it just makes zero sense to me to essentially <i>force</i> primarily user-driven platforms like Twitter to amplify&#x2F;aggregate content from literally everybody. If they don&#x27;t want to amplify the NYPost&#x27;s stories, that should be their choice. And then I can choose not to read Twitter if I don&#x27;t like that. I completely fail to see the problem.<p><pre><code>    I agree with you that it&#x27;s just another media outlet\n    with a slant, but the government needs to start \n    treating them like it. \n</code></pre>\nWhat, specifically, do you want done here? Should it apply to Hacker News as well -- should HN no longer be able to curate its content?')
