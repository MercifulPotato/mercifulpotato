JS is huge today, not least because it&#x27;s the only game in town on what is currently the most popular easily accessible platform. However, I&#x27;ve never seen anything to suggest a huge difference between the number of programmers who know C++ and the number who know Python, for example. Both are very popular languages with at least a few million developers who know them. At that scale there&#x27;s no reliable way to get an exact count and the difference doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway.')
