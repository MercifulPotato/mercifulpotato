I don&#x27;t know why HTML would be to blame, as I&#x27;ve used web browsers on low power devices before and they can be very snappy.<p>One thing I noticed was that when attempting to switch between e.g. &#x27;Offers&#x27;, &#x27;New&#x27; and &#x27;Highlighted&#x27; or whatever the headings are, there&#x27;s a large lag &#x2F; hangup. It certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re working on keeping it fluid and snappy. That might not be a priority, but I&#x27;m certainly put off browsing and buying when it&#x27;s unpleasant to do so.<p>To be fair, it&#x27;s worse on other consoles IME, and if I keep my browsing light, stay at the top of lists and don&#x27;t get too impatient, it&#x27;s okay.')
