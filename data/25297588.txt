I’ve already been granted a visa that required me to prove that I have expertise that isn’t easily available on the US job market. The process cost at least $10k. That’s not an open border.<p>Now that I’m applying to stay, the Justice Department is suing because my employer doesn’t advertise my job as a vacancy on their website. What sense does this make?<p>Trump famously asked why the US doesn’t get more immigrants “from somewhere like Norway rather than shithole countries.” I’m from Finland and have employment in the country already. Yet, if we go by your implication that my L1-PERM path shouldn’t be allowed, there’s no legal path for me to stay here, right?<p>I guess your brand of nativism simply doesn’t want anyone in the country. That will be America’s loss.')
