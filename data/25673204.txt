It is just technically inaccurate. I wouldn&#x27;t even say &quot;insurrection&quot;.  This was basically a low-grade riot at a symbolically significant location. Everyone should be prosecuted, including perhaps the people responsible for the atrocious police preparation and response. Even if the mob had managed to physically control the building there was no way that would have resulted in any actual change in the proceedings.<p>I&#x27;m not going to defend Trump on this either, but it is a mistake to think that Trump is the <i>source</i> of the discontent. He has taken advantage of the discontent but he isn&#x27;t the source.')
