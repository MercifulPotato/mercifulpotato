Adobe software lets you screw yourself with this, it’ll import fine, not warn you but then your exports will have seemingly random weirdness like flashes of green for single frames that’ll make you think your hardware is failing.<p>I do handle this pretty well. I have a &quot;properties&quot; pane, and for media, if you click the &quot;media&quot; icon, I will show info for each video, which includes the frame rate.<p>I will convert that frame rate into your project&#x27;s frame rate, by a simple convert X FPS to Y FPS algorithm. You&#x27;ll never see any flashes of green.<p>&gt; Use as much power of my gpus as you can, if I have a high end nvidia gpu I want to see it acting like a hot knife through butter.<p>Agreed 200% - you&#x27;ll see your GPU sweating, trust me ;)<p>&gt; When I drag footage in a timeline update the display, Premier shockingly doesn’t do this.<p>I do this, and if I understand correctly what you mean, I give you a bonus feature: instant preview all the time, while you hover the mouse through the timeline (like Final Cut).<p>And as an extra bonus, something not even Final Cut has, I will give you specific preview, based on where you are in the timeline - if you&#x27;re hovering a specific video track, I&#x27;ll preview that only, otherwise, I&#x27;ll preview all the video tracks + applied effects.<p>&gt; Reload footage button, another thing Adobe Premier doesn’t have.<p>Not sure what you mean - when should this be applied?')
