Everyone else had a white badge (sometimes with a colored marker for certain kinds of access).<p>&quot;Red badges&quot; were routinely made fun of and hazed. A pretty high percentage would end up getting hired full-time and the hazing would stop, so it wasn&#x27;t exactly &quot;personal&quot;, but it was definitely kind of weird.<p>(I have no clue what a red badge indicates at Amazon, though.)')
