This causes (short-term) availability. Assume this channel can get compromised at any time. Ie. clearweb.<p>Two, at the same time, a more censorship resistant solution such as Tor or IPFS. Ie. darkweb.<p>At the very least you should research the second option beforehand. I&#x27;d say though, if you already include the address in say your GitHub, then this allows caching beforehand hence a smoother transition.<p>I saw this recently applied in alt-right movement. People getting banned from Twitter and Facebook already mentioning their contact info on darkweb beforehand cause they saw it coming.')
