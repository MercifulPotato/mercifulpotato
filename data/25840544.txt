They just move their projects somewhere else, update the URLs provided online, and go on with their lives as if nothing happened. And we all know that GitHub without projects and without developers is nothing but a shiny empty box. I wish you guys enjoy your shiny empty box soon - maybe ask one of those lawyers to contribute some code to it.')
