Item(by='Mediterraneo10', descendants=None, kids=[24706538], score=None, time=1602061507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24706330, text='&gt; I just received a seven day suspension from Twitter for calling Q followers retarded.<p>It could be due to some filter feeling that it is inappropriate to use “retarded” as an insult, because it is disrespectful to people with actual mental disabilities.<p>I am around forty, but twice in the last couple of years a person half my age has taken great offense to me using the term “mentally retarded” to describe people who are actually, well, mentally retarded. So, I suspect that the euphemism treadmill is gradually consigning “retarded” to obsolete vocabulary in any context, and those who continue to use it may be seen as horrible people.')
