I&#x27;ll provide a contra-example anecdote:<p>Me and two other chaps formed a start up in 2000 - bog standard IT services&#x2F;consultancy.  Still trundling along, we won&#x27;t set the world on fire but doing OK.<p>One of our employees is Polish, in Poland.  We pay him the same as everyone else.  OK he&#x27;s actually now self-employed for tax purposes and Brexit but his rate is the same as our other techies.  He was working remote six months before anyone had heard of SARS-CoV-2.<p>When we started out our first two employees were enticed away with twice their previous pay.  lol.  Travel shops don&#x27;t pay much here in the UK.  They stayed for 10 and 15 years.<p>One month in 20 years we had a cash flow problem.  We like to keep a decent float in the bank rather than drive fast cars.  I do like to sleep at night.  The Directors didn&#x27;t get paid that month but all staff were paid.  The next few months we caught up OK.  Anyone who&#x27;s run a small business will know that&#x27;s not bad going for cash flow.  I should point out that we have never, ever had an overdraft.  We do have a mortgage but that costs less than the rent we used to pay for less than half the size of building.<p>I could go on (sorry).  Not all startups strive for the stars.  A famous French bloke once memorably described Britain as a nation of shopkeepers (ie boring as fuck):  I take that as a compliment.')
