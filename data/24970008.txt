I don&#x27;t find that cops care much about auto theft either. the main reason cars don&#x27;t get stolen too often is because the VIN is associated with an owner and a license plate. police don&#x27;t have to actively pursue car thieves to make it not worthwhile. I don&#x27;t think any such system exists for bicycles, and I&#x27;m not sure it would be desirable anyway. &quot;ownership&quot; of a bicycle and other items of similar value can usually be transferred with an exchange of cash and a firm handshake, which seems about right to me.')
