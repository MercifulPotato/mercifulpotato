I&#x27;ve always defended private property rights to the utmost. The difficulty is that the government is now so heavily involved in the military-industrial complex and now something like a military-social complex and regulating as well as benefiting in massive ways from private industry. In some ways, the mega corporations are becoming blurred extensions of government and start to do the dirty work of government. I think this has become a way for the government to get around restrictions and Constitutional principles by simply using private corporations to infringe on rights which they heavily influence. This is becoming a major issue for preserving rights, since some rights are becoming meaningless in private when you can&#x27;t go outside or associate or even start a competitor because of the regulation landscape. Other rights are infringed &quot;just enough&quot; to discourage competition, then the large players get cajoled into doing what is desired.<p>But to correct that, my preferred solution would be to eliminate corporations entirely. Eliminate the power structures that allow such massive accumulation of wealth and power and the legal protections that let people think they are not personally responsible. The legal framework would need to adjust, but I think society would find itself massively improved when personal responsibility and rights were restored.')
