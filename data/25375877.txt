Item(by='commandlinefan', descendants=None, kids=[25375981], score=None, time=1607620593, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25375587, text='When I went to school to study computer science in the 90&#x27;s, it seemed like most of my classmates were similar to myself: grew up tinkering with computers and had &quot;taught themselves&quot; (that is, read books and worked examples without being told to by a college professor) programming pretty effectively before setting foot on a college campus.  I have no doubt that if I had never bothered with college at all, I could have done nearly the same work in the same positions that I&#x27;ve held since graduation.<p>In fact, every once in a while on here you&#x27;ll see somebody post a sort of ironic list of the things that they <i>don&#x27;t</i> teach you in a CS curriculum: databases, networks, version control, debugging, command-line terminal usage, web security, usability... in short, all the things that you actually need to know in order to be a proficient software developer.<p>Still, nearly everything (computer related) that I learned in my CS degree was stuff that I never would have come across on my own, like calculus, linear algebra, statistics, complexity theory, numerical analysis.  It sort of &quot;ties together&quot; the practical stuff, but you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to know any of it to be effective.  I&#x27;m glad I did it because it&#x27;s neat stuff and a different perspective.  In a way, the nice thing about having a degree is knowing that you don&#x27;t know what you might be overlooking in not having one.<p>That said... why not just go and get one now?  You&#x27;ll feel a little weird being 10 years older than everybody else and it&#x27;ll look weird at first putting &quot;15 years experience, graduated last year&quot; on your resume, but you&#x27;re nearly guaranteed a perfect GPA at this point.  In a few years, you&#x27;ll have the &quot;checkmark&quot; you need and you&#x27;ll know what you were (or weren&#x27;t) missing.')
