There would then be increasing pressure on banks to cut them off. What good is a payment processor, Mr. Anderson... if you are unable to open a bank account?<p>&gt; If that’s not hate speech, I don’t know what is, and it should be shut down, permanently.<p>Except mere hate speech is still legal in the USA; CSEM is not.
