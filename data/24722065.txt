There are features and technologies with varying names across brands and processors that essentially do the same thing: run at the maximum clock that the current thermal situation will support.<p>From my personal experience, my Threadripper 3970X will happily maintain ~4.4GHz all-core (rated for 4.5GHz max single-core) so long as I can keep the temperature in or below the 70s, with no overclocking.[0] There are power limits as well, but rated performance numbers are within the power limits. Overclocking can put you past the marked power limits, and certainly needs ample cooling.<p>[0] Granted, I need to pump cold air into the case to maintain the temperature, but that&#x27;s a limitation of my current thermal solution. At some point I&#x27;ll probably upgrade to an excessive water cooling solution (:')
