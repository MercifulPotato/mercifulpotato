My brother did the SAT as well. We had excellent scores. We both dropped out of college with near perfect GPAs. Today I&#x27;m a successful self-taught software engineer now starting a SaaS business. My brother is a famous sci fi author. He makes even more than I do. I think homeschooling let us learn whatever we wanted to learn without fear, and find our own path in life. Where I think it hurt was we didn&#x27;t do any group social activities and lived in remote places. So socially we had a lot to learn. I don&#x27;t think that was a permanent disadvantage, but it was not a necessary drawback of homeschooling. I would recommend sports and other after school activities to add the social dimension into homeschooling.')
