Dropbox are not closing the office (they will likely downsize) so folks who want can still go in if they live nearby. I&#x27;m sure most companies would keep some office space available. Also, I&#x27;m sure most fully remote companies would pay their employees for home office expenses, which includes co-working space if an employee prefers that. (most people don&#x27;t have an extra room available for office). By co-working space I mean a dedicated space where you can leave your laptop, monitor, etc. It&#x27;s not like going to an actual office where your co-workers are, but the big advantage is the commute. Co-working spaces are everywhere so you can pick one close to you.')
