If you aren&#x27;t a btrfs developer, it is difficult to know what exactly you want to do and how to accomplish it.<p>ZFS on the other hand has just two commands for common administration tasks: zpool and zfs. zpool controls pool-level operations, mainly ones that deal with the storage layer; zfs controls the logical file systems and volumes that are contained within a pool. The zpool and zfs commands have been meticulously crafted to not expose much of the underlying software architecture and focus only on what administrators want, and all of it is clearly documented.<p>There are actually a few other commands that come with ZFS if you really want or need to deal with low-level and difficult details, commands like zdb, zinject, zstreamdump. You almost never need any of them.')
