I can only assume the author doesn&#x27;t know about the Kafka transactions feature?<p>To be specific, Kafka&#x27;s transaction machinery offers read-committed isolation, and you get read-uncommitted by default if you don&#x27;t opt-in to use that transaction machinery (the docs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kafka.apache.org&#x2F;0110&#x2F;javadoc&#x2F;index.html?org&#x2F;apache&#x2F;kafka&#x2F;clients&#x2F;consumer&#x2F;KafkaConsumer.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kafka.apache.org&#x2F;0110&#x2F;javadoc&#x2F;index.html?org&#x2F;apache&#x2F;...</a>). Depending on your workload, read-committed might be sufficient for correctness, in which case you can absolutely use Kafka as your database.<p>Of course, proving that your application is sound with just read-committed isolation is can be challenging, not to mention testing that your application continues to be sound as new features are added.<p>Because of that, in general I think that the underlying point of this article is probably correct, in that you probably shouldn&#x27;t use Kafka as your database -- but for certain applications &#x2F; use-cases it&#x27;s a completely valid system design choice.<p>More generally this is an area that many applications get wrong by using the wrong isolation levels, because most frameworks encourage incorrect implementations by their unsafe defaults; e.g. see the classic &quot;Feral concurrency control&quot; paper <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bailis.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;feral-sigmod2015.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bailis.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;feral-sigmod2015.pdf</a>. So I think the general message of &quot;don&#x27;t use Kafka as your DB unless you know enough about consistency to convince yourself that read-committed isolation is and will always be sufficient for your usecase&quot; would be more appropriate (though it&#x27;s certainly a less snappy title).')
