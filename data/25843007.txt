The worst case for GPL software is that you&#x27;re not complying with the license and you&#x27;re liable for statutory damages for copyright infringement. Not coincidentally that&#x27;s also the worst case for every other license, including BSD&#x2F;MIT, commercial proprietary licenses, and everything in between.<p>You&#x27;re sadly right that many big enterprises purport to believe there&#x27;s some special extra risk unique to the GPL, but you&#x27;re wrong to say it&#x27;s a &quot;very real legal risk&quot;; there&#x27;s no reasonable basis for believing that at all.')
