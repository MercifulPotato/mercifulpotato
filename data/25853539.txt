The invasion of Tibet (everyone seems to have forgotten \nabout this)<p>Tibet is strategically important to the Chinese.<p>It&#x27;s a major water source and the origin of the Mekong, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers. Allowing Tibet to remain independent would mean that India could occupy Tibet, use it as a base for invasion, and cut off China&#x27;s water supply. There were skirmishes along the Tibet-Indian border earlier this year; it&#x27;s not a theoretical threat. Any great power would use force under these circumstances.')
