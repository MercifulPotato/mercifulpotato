As with many things, it depends mostly on the people writing the code and their process, rather than what programming language they are using.<p>I never inherited a Clojure-codebase that has been written during long duration, but I have digged around in a fair amount of Clojure-codebases that are open source, both user focused and libraries. Same with JavaScript. And I can say, as someone with more JS experience than Clojure, that the Clojure projects tend to be a lot easier to understand than the JS ones, probably not because of the language, but because of the habits that the language &quot;forces&quot; you into.')
