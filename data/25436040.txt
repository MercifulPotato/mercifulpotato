The number of people that play gacha games is small conjugated to the number of people that smoke, drink, gamble etc. Chances are that you&#x27;d likely see the reverse - doing those things could increase your likelihood of playing gacha games (or well, spending money on them - it&#x27;s entirely possible to play most of these games as virtually free).')
