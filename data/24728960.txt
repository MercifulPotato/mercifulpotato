I use my Airpods Pro on my laptop all the time, for calls and music and watching videos with others in the room, the noise cancelling is really good and I don&#x27;t have to drain my phone battery as much. I really like the Magic Mouse, which is Bluetooth as well, and I have a keyboard with 3 Bluetooth IDs that I can switch back and forth between my phone, gaming PC and laptop with a single keypress, and I use that a lot and would use it even more if it could handle five devices instead of three. Apart from that, I have a stationary bluetooth speaker I often stream music to from my laptop to conserve my phone battery, and, finally, one of my electronics projects that I never seem to get around to finishing is a lipo-powered glove-shaped bluetooth midi controller.<p>Macbooks do retain their 3.5mm jacks, but I hate that I have to be mindful of the cable (i.e. can&#x27;t move around the room), and good wired headphones tend to be bulkier. I don&#x27;t really mind a 10-15 minutes charging break every couple of hours, and sound quality and noise cancelling are really good for my standards.')
