I have definitely seen people told not to talk about what you might call controversial because it is political.<p>Don&#x27;t talk about your abortion and how it made your life better or worse.<p>Don&#x27;t talk about your birth control.<p>Don&#x27;t talk about how you were explicitly told by an authority figure you were not worthy of a job because of your sex&#x2F;gender.<p>Easy for me to imagine someone being told not to talk about their gay marriage under similar circumstances.<p>I think commonly used phrases are &quot;its not for polite company&quot;, &quot;keep politics out of it&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t bring your politics here&quot;, etc.<p>It is obviously selective enforcement of the rules, but that is a common and unfortunately often effective shield.<p>Luckily I have heard&#x2F;see less of the above over the last 10 years than the 10 years before that.')
