As I wrote above, we knew we could not finish the min. contract amount based on prior usage which the rep said the roll-over is great for our use case and would be fine for us to continue using them for the next year they would just issue new paperwork (I should have pushed harder on clarifying all the ins and outs of roll-over and get it into the contract). The contract is only 1 page and the only roll over clause is vague and so yes I guess they can basically decide to change what new contract polices they have internally and the customer would be subject to that whim, which from the rep it sounds they have because newer customers than us on a different policy (not sure how&#x2F;when they decided to create these customer buckets) where contract can only roll-over by paying the same amount each year or more.<p>&quot;Rollover of Capacity. If Customer purchases additional capacity under a separate order form before the end of the Subscription Term hereunder, any unconsumed Capacity will roll over into the immediately succeeding subscription term of such order form. Otherwise, purchased Capacity expires and becomes void automatically\nat the end of the Subscription Term.&quot;')
