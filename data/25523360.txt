So the machine would boot to BASIC, and then you would call something like this (Commodore 64) from the BASIC prompt:<p>LOAD &quot;FILE&quot;,8<p>Computers with MS-DOS and CPM were different in that you would load a proper shell and launch basic from there. I seem to recall (I was 9 years old at the time) the original IBM PC having a less capable BASIC that could use a cassette tape for storage built in that would boot if you did not have a floppy drive or disk in the boot drive when the machine started.')
