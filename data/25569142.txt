Why should we consider the market the core institution of a society, the concept underlying any form of relationship?<p>&quot;Free&quot; markets the way libertarians tend to imagine them do not exist, and for very good reason - they would lead to a hasty collapse of society. You can&#x27;t for example sell yourself into slavery, you can&#x27;t be hired to work more than a certain number of hours per week, or if you&#x27;re younger than a certain age etc. There are countless restrictions on what a contractual relationship can look like between a worker and a corporation - things are definitely not &quot;free&quot;.')
