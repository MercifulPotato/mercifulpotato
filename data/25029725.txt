You have no reason to expect a person like yourself to be able to control the amount of capital assets that Google represents. Your access to the means of production is dependent on your ability to buy into them and stock allows you to do that in small increments. If it weren&#x27;t for stock you still wouldn&#x27;t have control over anything like Google.')
