I have to track the provider version, the Terraform version, my module version, and any sub-module versions, long-term. Each internal team has to jump through hoop after hoop just to run <i>terraform apply</i> reliably.<p>I&#x27;ve never yet had to rewrite a shell script that used a new version of AWS CLI. It&#x27;s very possible that that&#x27;s only because I&#x27;ve not been using it enough. But even that would be just one level of complexity to manage, rather than four.<p>And in fact, even within a single provider, interfaces aren&#x27;t generic at all.<p>You have to write every single resource of every single provider to be specific to its definition. It would be the same amount of work if you were writing a shell script with curl to plug into each API call. I know, because it was actually faster for me to write a Bash implementation of NewRelic&#x27;s APIs than to figure out its ridiculous Terraform provider and resources with no documentation.<p>The only benefit of Terraform is that I don&#x27;t have to write the API implementation [for most providers]')
