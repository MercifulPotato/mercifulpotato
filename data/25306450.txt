It&#x27;s not like the role of every university in the world is quantifiable or that we have some central authority figure who could say one way or another. Plenty of people because clearly there is a push from both universities and from the industry to craft courses that are oriented more towards work than academia. Plenty of people, because enough students seek out courses which guarantee employment, not research, that this is a shifting focus for many places of study. If you have someone you suggest we should ask or whose opinion you would respect, then name them.')
