There are huge swaths of people that barely like to read content, let alone write.<p>My stepfather was an idiot, a drunkard, a gambling addict, a drug addict, easily conned by direct marketing and ponzi schemes, with not a large number of friends, and poorly educated.<p>He read, as far as I have been able to figure out, 1 book in his life and he read that book 75% of the way finished (It was some sort of crime book - pretty thick though so about the 600-800 pages length)<p>But when the internet came around he got himself an online identity and was out on forums of people who shared his interests all the time posting his views on things.<p>There are really not very many people out there less capable than my stepfather, percentage wise. I do not believe there are huge swathes of people that he beat.<p>&gt;Look at how many youtube videos dominate search results with hundreds of thousands of views for “how to” X when X is trivially described in a few lines of text.<p>given that youtube is owned by the Google, not sure what to take from that other than they put results from one of their properties at the top for purposes of their own.<p>although I often take a how to X video over text because even though the X is trivially described there are a lot of extra things you can find out from the video really quick - for example if you search for how to do X in Y<p>and you read a tutorial, it can be that the tutorial is slightly off from your version of Y, and you spend time trying to figure out if it is the tutorial that is wrong, if you have misunderstood their trivial few lines of text because the text might not be clearly written and so on and so forth, but when you look at the video if it shows a menu entry being clicked on that just does not exist then you know they have something different than you do and if you can&#x27;t immediately figure out what your system change has been try to go find some other solution.<p>It is the extra information that a video gives that can make the video useful. As to which to choose is dependent on a lot of things.')
