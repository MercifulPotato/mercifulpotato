Like make for each student his own schedule of exams, spread them evenly over the year, add some stochastic unpredictable in advance factor to that schedule.<p>The most of tests could be taken online when we trust students to be honest. That tests are mostly for them, to have feedback from a system on their performance, and for the system as a kind of telemetry, also a feedback to see how good education courses work. But a few tests per student could be conducted offline, the system might want to make them more rigorous and to cover more topics than usual.<p>It seems to me that the system is afraid of changing and tries to buy a solution of a problem instead of devising it. How to measure academic performance is the area of expertise of an academic organization, so why to outsource solution to an external software company with no expertise in academic measurements?<p>I wrote it and got an idea that it is an ideological shift in a collective unconscious. Software engineer is a magician, an artisan of unsolved problems. Each new problem should be delegated to her with a trunk full of bucks, and a magical solution will come back shortly. So maybe we should think instead of removing &#x27;magic&#x27; component from the description? How to make people think of software as of technology, not as of magic?')
