In the early days I used to be proud wearing Facebook swag. Later it bacame more and more an issue. People started making comments on feature X or policy Y they didn&#x27;t like. I eventually didn&#x27;t wear any swag in public, this is when I&#x27;ve realized I need to leave the company.<p>Facebook is still a great place to work but the brand is so damaged that it&#x27;s hard to see how they gain consumer trust again.\nAs a consumer company it means any new product (libra, unified family of apps etc..) will fail because of that.')
