Once I reached the destination station I tried to hook it into the parking thingy, but it didn’t lock. Luckily I noticed.<p>However, the bike computer didn’t think it was rented anymore, so it didn’t let me attempt to lock it again.<p>I had to spend half an hour on the phone with their support, until they redirected me to somebody who could login to the parking thingy remotely and manually control it.<p>Cherry on top: I found out later that their tech support phone number is taxed. The call cost me something like 5x the ride cost.<p>That’s when I decided to buy a bike and be done with these crappy services.')
