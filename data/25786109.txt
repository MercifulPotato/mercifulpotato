Looking on some other sites you can see London to NYC is 70ms, but that’s also 5,500km which is far behind the 1,000km mentioned.  Ex: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wondernetwork.com&#x2F;pings&#x2F;London" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wondernetwork.com&#x2F;pings&#x2F;London</a><p>70ms &#x2F;5.5 = 12.7 ms seconds round trip.  The speed of sound is only 1,125 ft&#x2F;s, and half that for round trips so 1,000km over fiber is the equivalent of ~7.14 feet apart in the same room plus whatever latency your personal computer and software adds.')
