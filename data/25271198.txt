There needs to be some kind of feedback loop to suppress the tyrannical bureaucratizing tendency of the modern state. It is obvious that our own society does not have any such feedback loop.<p>However, the answer is not some kind of local unaccountable justice system where a judge basically rules based either on the will of the crowd or his own personal interests, and then calls it &quot;community reconciliation&quot; or some such bullshit. It&#x27;s like the person who wrote the article literally never contemplated the reason for written law to exist in the first place.<p>&gt; The unpleasant truth is that if you live in a community whose members are not good people, you won&#x27;t have good outcomes, no matter what kind of system you design.<p>I think this is also basically undeniably true. But across all of history, I really don&#x27;t know of any politcal system that had a noticable positive effect on the moral quality of the individual humans it ruled over. So this just leaves me with a sense of metahistorical pessimism.')
