But I&#x27;m with you. But bad actors (in the form of petty theft, exploitation, confidence tricks, etc) are a fact of life. Failing to account for them, just as failing to account for hurricanes if you live in hurricane alley, is completely on you. You can reduce that down to a blanket &quot;but you&#x27;re just victim shaming!&quot; if you&#x27;d like, but it doesn&#x27;t make it any less true.')
