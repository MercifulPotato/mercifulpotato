I kind of agonized over the decision - $350 was a lot of money for a keyboard, and I couldn&#x27;t be sure it would help until I had used it for a while.<p>It turns out it helped me a lot. I wanted to be able to explain how it helped, so that someone on the fence like I was would have an example of what types of problems it might address. I thought the best way to do it was visually.<p>Only problem was, I didn&#x27;t have any web app experience. I taught myself React and with guidance from some friends I made something I&#x27;m really happy with. I went from no experience whatsoever in React, Next.JS, or Tailwind, and having never made a UI I&#x27;ve liked, to this.<p>(It is true that you can now use Oryx (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ergodox-ez.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;oryx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ergodox-ez.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;oryx</a>) to tour a keyboard layout as well, but that wasn&#x27;t true when I started. When it did get announced, I was far enough along that I wanted to finish it. Also, I am now editing my configuration by hand, not keeping it in Oryx anyway.)<p>(By the way, I&#x27;m not affiliated in any way with ZSA, the company that makes this board, and you can get open source ones from other places if you want.)')
