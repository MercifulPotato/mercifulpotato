They want the users to trust the engineers to guide them. Well, if everyone is saying “Signal is end to end encrypted and no one can read your chat” OWS might be able to help a lot of people by clarifying that while messages sent over the wire are encrypted, a compromised phone could still mean compromised conversations. This is painfully obvious to you or I, but regular people I speak to have no idea about things like this. Non technical folks I speak to still don’t understand the most basic opsec.')
