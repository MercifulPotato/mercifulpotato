Item(by='wtallis', descendants=None, kids=[25698934], score=None, time=1610180919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25698231, text='&gt; How would we know that the fraud that would be prevented with voter ID is insignificant?<p>The fraud made possible by not requiring voters to show ID is the possibility that someone could impersonate a registered voter and cast their ballot. There are natural limiting factors on how much this form of fraud can be scaled up. Any one person impersonating other registered voters can probably get away with at most casting one ballot per voting location, lest they be recognized as a repeat visitor. Each person voting fraudulently needs to pick a specific registered voter to impersonate at each location, and memorize basic information about this voter (eg. name and address), and physically travel to each voting location. And if any of the marks picked to impersonate end up trying to vote for themselves, the attempted duplicate voter will be detected. So each participant in such a fraud scheme is good for optimistically a dozen fraudulent in-person votes over the course of any one election day, and if committed at scale with a large number of people, the risk of detection quickly becomes very high. The real-world rate of detection of this kind of fraud is extremely low, so we can be confident that this impractical form of fraud is in fact seldom attempted.<p>&gt;  It seems we have no real election auditing in our country, which frankly should be something that&#x27;s done automatically at least on a spot-check basis.<p>I don&#x27;t think this statement is about voter ID.<p>&gt; One large category of fraud that it would prevent would be illegal immigrant voting. In my state you can register by having someone that is already registered vouch for you. That&#x27;s it. No other identification needed.<p>The Voter ID proposals that have been so controversial in the US in recent years (since ~2006) are not about showing ID to register to vote. They&#x27;re about showing ID on election day, even if you&#x27;re already legally registered and have been voting without trouble for decades. If you are saying &quot;voter ID&quot; but you mean to talk about tighter controls on the voter registration process rather than on the process of voting on election day, then you should use different terminology rather than using a term that has a different meaning in current common usage.<p>But aside from that terminology issue: requiring people to show ID when registering to vote ahead of the election is not the only practical way to prevent illegal immigrants from voting. Even if a prospective voter does not show current government issued photo ID when registering to vote, they still have to provide identifying information as part of the registration process. This can be audited before election day.')
