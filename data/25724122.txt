Stripe and Twitter are clearly the latter. AWS and Visa feel like the former, though they are legally the latter.<p>Twitter and Stripe are acting in coordination - literally conspiring - with every other big tech company to take a specific action. When they do that they&#x27;re acting as an illegal cartel and must be prosecuted accordingly. This is the kind of coordinated cartel behavior that banana republics and third world countries have that behave exactly like these companies are and do so out in the open (and always with the political support of the group with the most power, to target their foes). We&#x27;re supposed to have anti-trust laws to deal with conspiring mega corporations.')
