I&#x27;m currently at the beginning of chapter 5 (of 8).<p>That quote is definitely ridiculous. He may have been referring to just chapter 2, in which the &quot;whole language&quot; is outlined. But later chapters also take time, there even is an exercise about writing an assembler in AWK as well as implementing multiple algorithms.<p>Some stuff was already somewhat familiar to me from studying&#x2F;practicing C earlier this year.<p>Overall a 10&#x2F;10 book so far, but takes time and patience for sure!')
