Compliance with the AWS acceptable usage policy. AWS says that Parler didn&#x27;t comply with the AUP. All the facts won&#x27;t come out unless this lawsuit goes to trial and that seems unlikely. Parler&#x27;s CEO doesn&#x27;t seem to think moderation is important so it&#x27;s easy to believe that they didn&#x27;t put a lot of effort in it. It&#x27;s also possible that they can&#x27;t afford to comply with the AUP but that isn&#x27;t Amazon&#x27;s problem.<p>2. Cancel culture. It was only a matter of time before AWS started getting bad PR for having Parler as a client. Petitions for dropping them were already circulating internally and externally. It&#x27;s easy to say that you shouldn&#x27;t drop clients in response to pressure but there is a point at which doing so is a rational decision.<p>3. Liability. Parler was allegedly used for planning illegal activities. If another significant attack occurs then a class-action lawsuit will pursue both Parler and AWS for contributing to the attack - this happened with the September 11th attack. The costs of defending or settling this lawsuit could easily run into the millions.')
