With screens it was Retina. They funded the development and actually owned the manufacturing equipment and leased it to the manufacturing subcontractors.<p>Also in 2008 they secured exclusive access to a then new laser cutting technology that they used to etch detail cuts in the unibody enclosures of their MacBooks, and then iPads.
