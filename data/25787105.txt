Here are three excerpts:<p>&gt; United States v. Nicholas Rodean (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 1:21-mj-28)\n&gt; Media coverage of these events showed one of the rioters who entered the Capitol building dressed in a red hat that appeared to have the word “Trump” on it, carrying a large red flag reading “Trump is My President,” and wearing an apparent badge from the individual’s place of employment. The individual appears to be a Caucasian male with a beard. The screenshots below of photographs posted on media sites show this individual in the halls of Congress. In the first image below, the individual is on the far right.<p>Rodean is currently in custody awaiting trial.<p>&gt; United States v. Richard Barnett (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, no case number present yet)\n&gt; On the same date, BARNETT spoke to media outlets in a video recording. In the recording, BARNETT is wearing the same hat and plaid jacket as worn inside of the Speaker’s office except that BARNETT appears to have removed his shirt. BARNETT is asked by a person off camera how BARNETT obtained an envelope he is holding, which was addressed to The Honorable Billy Long 2453 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, D.C. 20515 with a return address of Office of the Speaker U.S. House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 and a digital signature of Nancy Pelosi. BARNETT states “I did not steal it. I bled on it because they were macing me and I couldn’t fucking see so I figured I am in her office. I got blood on her office. I put a quarter on her desk even though she ain’t fucking worth it. And I left her a note on her desk that says “Nancy, Bigo was here, you Bitch.”<p>Barnett is currently in custody awaiting trial.<p>&gt; United States v. Jacob Anthony Chansley (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, 1:21-mj-18)\n&gt; Several media outlets subsequently identified this individual as Jacob Anthony CHANSLEY, a.k.a. Jake Angeli. Your affiant has confirmed this identification of CHANSLEY. First, the photographs of CHANSLEY in the U.S. Capitol display unique attire and extensive tattoos covering his arms and the left side of his torso. Your affiant has viewed pictures posted to the Facebook account for Jake Angeli on December 13, 2020, in which CHANSLEY bears these same distinctive attire and tattoos. In addition, CHANSLEY has a YouTube channel under the name Jacob Chansley, on which a video posted of CHANSLEY from 2019 shows CHANSLEY with sleeve tattoos on the lower half of his arms consistent with the sleeve tattoos CHANSLEY displays in photographs taken in the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Finally, CHANSLEY has also been identified by law enforcement through open source data bases, including his Arizona DMV driver’s license photo, as the person depicted inside the Capitol and on the Senate dais on January 6, 2021.<p>Chansley is currently in custody awaiting trial.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;tommybeer&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;fbi-no-evidence-antifa-involved-in-capitol-chaos&#x2F;?sh=1d6229836379" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;tommybeer&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;fbi-no-evi...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lawfareblog.com&#x2F;compiling-criminal-charges-following-capitol-riot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lawfareblog.com&#x2F;compiling-criminal-charges-follo...</a>')
