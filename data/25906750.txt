You&#x27;d need a ship that can survive crossing the pacific and also enough rations of food to survive the trip.<p>In this case they also used some desalination tech to survive those 14 months, per the article.<p>Edit: More details:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.historylink.org&#x2F;File&#x2F;9065" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.historylink.org&#x2F;File&#x2F;9065</a><p>&gt; The crew had an adequate food supply (rice from the cargo, supplemented with fish and an occasional seagull). They could collect rainwater for drinking. They probably had on board a device called a ranbiki, <i>normally used to brew sake</i>, which they could have used to desalinate water from the sea. They also could have distilled saltwater simply by boiling it. But they had no source of vitamin C. By the time the ship washed ashore near Cape Flattery on a wintery day in 1834, there were only three survivors. Most of their crewmates had died of scurvy.<p>(That essay seems to have a lot of other interesting details, by the way.)')
