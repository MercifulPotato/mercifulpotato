Item(by='mathogre', descendants=None, kids=[25553837], score=None, time=1609098541, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25552557, text='On BVLOS, FAA Advisory Circular 107-2 ยง5.7 actually covers the allowance for brief moments when a drone is out of VLOS.  It&#x27;s one thing for a drone to be behind a tree for a few seconds, and another when a drone is so far away one cannot possibly see it.<p>As regards FPV and even the very good remote viewing in the Mavic Mini, regular general aviation regulations essentially nullify either of those capabilities as being inadequate.  ยง14CFR91.113(b) states, &quot;vigilance shall be maintained by each person operating an aircraft so as to see and avoid other aircraft.&quot;  That means in addition to looking forward, you need to regularly look above, below, left, right, and to the extent practicable behind.<p>On night time flight over a huge empty field, yup, I get it.  The regulations make no sense for this.<p>I could begin a long discussion over the regulatory process in the US, but I won&#x27;t.  I will say however that it behooves drone operators to be aware of and to become involved in the regulatory process.  Whether you like the process and the products of that process or not, it isn&#x27;t going away.  The regulations exist, the FAA appears at some level to actually be interested in educating rather than punishing, but they have the power to do what they think is necessary to maintain order and safety.')
