Target is local councils and regional parliament, where sessions are usually recorded but without transcripts. If xx% accuracy is enough to identify keywords, manual edition is still required to not distort precise meaning.<p>Nothing special in the interface, but two features seems interesting:\n1. Be able to collaborate in real-time. Maybe using Etherpad API to merge multiple editions.\n2. Easily validate text and label speakers so as to generate new training data.<p>Pointers to similar existing solutions would be very appreciated.')
