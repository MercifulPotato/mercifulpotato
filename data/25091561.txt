Also, none of the centrally planned, soviet style economies had any feature of socialism - they were capitalist societies, where all of the power was concentrated in the hands of those who controlled capital. Sure, workers were paid lip service, but their power and control over their work was in fact even less than in the European or American capitalist countries. They were just as much socialist countries as they were democratic - in that it was simply a title they assigned to themselves, void of any meaning whatsoever.<p>The main difference between an actual socialist market-based economy and the capitalist market-based economy that we have today would be that essentially all enterprises competing on the market would be co-ops, where workers democratically decide how the company is run and get to share the profits (and losses), instead of getting a pre-determined (sometimes negotiated) wage.')
