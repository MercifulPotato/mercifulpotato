Here is what I found:<p>Same hello-world console app from C# runs alright with AOT. The F# does not as it relies on heavier reflection stuffs (at least thats what it seems like). The F# version did compile but just crashed on run.<p>The suspect appears to be the way to console print seems to call a different non AOT function.<p>The interesting part was I did write some bindings calling for a console print via CFFI that did then allow me to compile the F# app and run fine.')
