The battle for this ended about four years ago (there will be hold outs like Mauritius, and Nauru but they are now very small in number...beneficial ownership disclosure is now accepted).<p>And btw, this will make no difference for most foreigners doing evil things (the ever-present &quot;Russian&quot;). Russia doesn&#x27;t participate in information-sharing, money laundering today is largely a problem of govts choosing not to participate in information-sharing (and I think the implication is that this is anti-corruption, this globalist approach to corruption does nothing, it will help no-one).')
