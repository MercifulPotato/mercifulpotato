Apple is making the use of many security functions black or white: either you allow complete control by Apple, or you have little to no protection at all. Instead they could easily allow the user to customize, and make a selection that works <i>for them</i> (which was the standard in older versions of OSX - pre-Big Sur [1]). The above defending of a giant faceless corporation, by @filleduchaos, is what is mind-boggling.<p>This feature obviously helps protect <i>some</i> users (non tech-literate ones), but for many it means completely turning off many useful security features (&#x27;opting out&#x27; by turning off SIP) with a lack of any sort of granular control&#x2F;customization, on a device they supposedly own. It&#x27;s a shame this new capitalist encroachment on user privacy is met with such understanding.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25078034" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25078034</a>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sneak.berlin&#x2F;20201112&#x2F;your-computer-isnt-yours&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sneak.berlin&#x2F;20201112&#x2F;your-computer-isnt-yours&#x2F;</a>')
