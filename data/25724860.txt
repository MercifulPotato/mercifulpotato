But it has evolutionary disadvantages, too. If food scarcity has been a challenge across evolutionary scales (which seems reasonable), then the utility function might prioritize scarce resources for the reproductively fit.<p>That&#x27;s typically how it has been prioritized, if food scarcity was an issue.<p>&gt; My point is that it&#x27;s challenging to make a watertight argument that &quot;we should do X, because evolution suggests that we should.&quot;<p>Sure, but most of the time I would bet dollars to donuts that environmental variables we evolved in will be better for us than new ones, just like in well-aged software time-tested inputs are more likely to work than new stuff you&#x27;ve never tried before.')
