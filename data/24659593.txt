Amazing.&quot; Well, not all open source software is using git, and even some that is, doesn&#x27;t use GitHub. Also, how do they see if you qualify, really? (Do you need a GitHub account? The linked document doesn&#x27;t seem to say that, or if it does, it isn&#x27;t very clear.) (Anyways, I wouldn&#x27;t want to submit a pull request merely for the purpose of the shirt. I would ignore that when making such a thing. If I get a shirt too (and I do not already have enough shirts, although I think I do have enough shirts), then that is a bonus, I suppose.) (I do not use git myself. I think I have never received any patches to my software, except maybe one, but I do not really remember if it is or not. I have, however, merged in other people&#x27;s changes when I found them, although these aren&#x27;t requests. Actually, other people have sometimes merged in some of my changes too despite not being a pull request, too. How will that ever count?) Hopefully, it can be explained better.')
