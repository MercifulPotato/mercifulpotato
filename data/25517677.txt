China did a much better job here even if you think their figures aren&#x27;t exact, (most likely true, but so is the case in places like Florida etc.)<p>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re somehow uniquely more corrupt that here in the West, they&#x27;re however much younger, (convenient how we disregard our meddling there for centuries), they&#x27;re trying to match the West in as short timespan as possible and of course they&#x27;re going to line up their pockets along the way, as almost everyone with enough power and access does when given the chance, sadly. But they&#x27;ve also massively expanded the middle class and lifted people from poverty.<p>Remember the U.S. had slavery and yes it is appropriate to compare that since the U.S. had the same government then than it does now, China didn&#x27;t.<p>As China grows in strength and prosperity so do its laws become more worker friendly as it transitions from a factory for the world to a more knowledge based economy. In other words it follows a fairly standard development trajectory, just on a much shorter timeframe so the abuses are more visible and less spread out, unlike in the West. Plus there&#x27;s more technology to document it all.')
