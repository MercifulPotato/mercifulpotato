Item(by='wott', descendants=None, kids=[25897030], score=None, time=1611525157, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25895823, text='As usual in this type of threads, I don&#x27;t quite understand what Americans mean by &#x27;walkability&#x27;.<p>When I was in high-school, I spent 2 weeks in the USA, on Long Island. I could walk for an hour and not walk across a pedestrian. There were often no sidewalk (when there were, I wasn&#x27;t sure I could use them, as to my foreign eyes, being detached from the road, they where running though properties :-D ), but what&#x27;s the problem with that? There was almost zero traffic, since the areas are low-density residential; much less than on my country roads. I could reach the ocean, I could reach playgrounds&#x2F;playfields, I could reach one street with shops, I could reach... the high-school. No transit was needed. But I was alone in the streets&#x2F;on the roads. I didn&#x27;t understand why the older kid (16?) of the house was already driving a big car to go to high-school...<p>When I look at Google Maps, a huge proportion of those suburbs areas seem to be within a mile of a either a shop street or a supermarket, and often some playfield too (we don&#x27;t have that many over here). The grid pattern makes access easier. So I am puzzled. It seems very &#x27;walkable&#x27; to me. Of course accessing those supermarkets by foot or cycle ranges from unpleasant to maddening because access was generally only planned for cars. But that&#x27;s much more easily fixable than redesigning the whole zones.<p>Now if you work 15 miles away, that&#x27;s something else, but does this come into &#x27;walkability&#x27; concept? No density is going to fix that: even in a big dense city, your job, or your next job (and even more your partner&#x27;s!) is almost always going to end up on the other end of the city after some time. Walkability cannot help there, so I reckon jobs location shouldn&#x27;t weight on the concept much.<p>I lived abroad in a pretty US-sprawl-like place. A huge majority of detached houses, a few rowhouses, a handful of short flats buildings, with supermarkets in place of the town centre. Basically no small shops, but a few bars between the supermarkets. I was living on one side of the town, and I was walking (winter) or cycling (summer) everyday to my workplace on the other side of the town, 2 rivers and 1.5 miles away. I would shop on the way back home. Easy, simple, practical. No transit is needed. For me it is walkable. But it seems it isn&#x27;t, for many people I read here, because they would declare similar areas in the US as non-walkable.<p>I now live in a municipality, where density is 8 inhabitants &#x2F; kmÂ² (20-25 inhabitants &#x2F; sq mile). But most people live within half-a-mile of the village centre. It has enough small shops for your daily or weekly needs; if you wish, there&#x27;s a bigger shop&#x2F;small supermarket in the next village, 2 miles away. There&#x27;s a guy who is over 80 years old and who lives at the farthest point in the municipality, 1 mile away. He comes shopping almost everyday, by foot, on the road that passes in front of my house. So for him I guess it is walkable. But what if we ask all the 40-something who live 4 times <i>closer</i>, but who prefer to take their car, and drive 2 times 10 miles to go a big supermarket. They&#x27;ll swear they need their car, for those countrysides are not walkable! Heck, my neighbour works in the centre, that is one quarter miles away (5 mn walk, 1 mn bicycle) and takes her car to go to work.')
