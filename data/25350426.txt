When I issued Ctrl-D on the interactive TeX prompt to bail out, it failed to issue a newline, leaving the operating system prompt juxtaposed to the right of the TeX prompt.<p>According to ISO C, &quot;[w]hether the last line [of a text stream] requires a terminating new-line character is implementation-defined&quot;, so terminating the program without the last character written to stdout (a text stream) being a newline is not maximally portable.<p>That&#x27;s a peculiar and possibly unique situation in the standard: whether or not a requirement exists is implementation-defined. Logically, that is as good as it being required, since any implementation can make it required. Those not making it required are just supplying a documented extension in place of undefined behavior.')
