The point of the ad is to show you how their technology makes robots dance. But, clearly their real product isn&#x27;t just dancing robots. They put a lot of work into making this functionality, and all that work is just for marketing!<p>To me, a real spartan approach to marketing is spending very little money on marketing, and just focusing on your product. That seems like the opposite of what Boston Dynamic is doing, because they put so much work specifically into creating these PR&#x2F;marketing videos. Many of their robot models don&#x27;t seem to exist for actual products, they just exist for marketing.')
