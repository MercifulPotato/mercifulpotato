However it also seems like for whatever reason, discussions on those stories seem to attract as many knee-jerk Apple defenders as Apple critics, while stories bashing Amazon or Facebook or Google tend to involve everyone agreeing more or less that they&#x27;re bad or at least not as good as they used to be.<p>Maybe partly this might even be because Apple&#x27;s focus is selling actual products you can hold and keep in your home (and not become monetized by) as opposed to being an abstract software program or service. It&#x27;s easier to be surprised and delighted by real products.')
