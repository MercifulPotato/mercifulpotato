Certainly some individuals in these countries are much better off than they were before. The economies of these countries may be doing better, but this growth has increasingly come at the expense of a vast number of individuals lower down the pole. The youth of China moved to the city from farming towns and villages, and now work to enrich the CEOs and executives of Foxconn. Children in Bangladesh and India are spending twelve hours a day making shoes for Nike. The well off in these countries are much more well-off than they were before, but the poor are potentially in a worse&#x2F;more inescapable position than they started.<p>&gt; Singapore is perhaps the closest to a free market place on earth, and is also one of the richest and safest.<p>Singapore is a heavily authoritarian country in which the state directly controls large sectors of the market[1] and daily life.<p>Some quotes from the source that illustrate the extent to which the Singaporean government is directly involved in shaping and controlling the country&#x27;s markets:<p>&gt; State monopolies provide all utilities, telephone and postal services, port and airport services, industrial estates, and radio and television. Government ministries provide a large part of medical and health services, all sanitation services, and all education for the population from primary to tertiary level. The state Housing and Development Board houses nearly three-quarters of the population in public housing estates.<p>In the non-social sector they own and operate:\n&gt; Singapore Airlines, ...A state trading company, a state shipping company, two state join-venture shipyards, ...The Development Bank of Singapore<p>The government also owns &quot;about 75% of all land in the country&quot;.<p>The rest of the paper goes into detail explaining how the government routinely intervenes with subsidies and tax policy in order to force the market into whatever shape it deems fit. So I think the fact that people view Singapore at anything close to a free market is more a testament to just how effective the propaganda that has been pushing free market economic thought has been.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.se&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;2644389?seq=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.se&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;2644389?seq=...</a>')
