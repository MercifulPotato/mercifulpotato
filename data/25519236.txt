It certainly does cause some neuronal death, which we&#x27;ve already established with other opioids, also using the ATF4 mechanism. The tumor in this paper is a brain tumor.<p>AKA, drug belonging to [drug class] that kills [neuronal tissue] will also kill [bad neuronal tissue] through same mechanism as [general drug class].<p>The key question is &quot;if putting a shit-ton of opioids (which already cross into the brain) in cancer patients doesn&#x27;t already meaningfully treat this condition, why do we imagine that delivering the same class of drug past the blood-brain barrier suddenly will?&quot;<p>Having worked in a breast cancer lab once upon a time, I can tell you: because run-of-the-mill cell biology doesn&#x27;t get grant funding if you don&#x27;t attach &quot;early cancer diagnostics&quot; or &quot;potential cancer treatment&quot; to the grant application.')
