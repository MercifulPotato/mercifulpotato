Item(by='africanboy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609712209, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25623214, text='&gt; If you are relying on xpenology to store important data you are a fucking idiot.<p>Well, may a lightning strike me if this isn&#x27;t a textbook example of red herring!<p>I feel I owe you a response, having written the original comment.<p>First of all, you are not bringing any proof to the table, except your opinions.<p>You may be right, you may be not, but mentioning &quot;important data&quot; in the context of &quot;the perfect media server&quot; makes me think that you arguments are not very convincing after all.<p>What&#x27;s so important in a media server?<p>Everyone of us who sets up a media server already owns the entire library, in digital or analog format, of media content that is going to be played from the server, so there is no problem if something gets lost, we can rebuild it, we have the technology, we can make it better than it was. Right? Right!<p>It would be ironic if we were arguing about how much GPL code there is in Synology DSM to use it to watch or listen to content downloaded illegally, wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>Anyway, even though it is illegal (I own hundreds of DVDs, but I am not allowed to rip them and play them from my computer), I do it anyway.<p>Lets not forget about 09-F9-11-02-9D-74-E3-??-D8-41-56-C5-63-56-88-C0<p>Having said that.<p>The Synology record on GPL violations is abysmal (just search for &quot;Synology&quot; on trac.ffmpeg.org or serviio forum or samba.org mailing list archive, if you don&#x27;t believe me) I think using a bootloader to install the base Synology system (most of DSM is under the GPL, unfortunately for them that&#x27;s how that license works) _only on x86_ (Synology runs on many other platforms) and then install Jellyfin or Plex (if Jellyfin doesn&#x27;t work) and never use the Synology proprietary software again is fair use. It&#x27;s a Linux distribution after all, there is nothing inherently illegal in running it.<p>I know about FreeNAS, but as a media server is too much work and some things do not work (Jellyfin for example) or are not as simple to set up.<p>iXsystems and Synology make money from selling HW.<p>In your example XPenology is a bootloader that lets you install Darwin on non Apple X86 HW or a better example would be iOS jailbreaking, which has been considered &quot;not illegal&quot; and never been tested in court (because Apple knows that losing that battle would be very bad for them).<p>p.s.: Anyway, using a NAS without setting up proper replication and backups to store &quot;very important data&quot; it&#x27;s equally idiotic.<p>p.p.s.: you could ask, so why don&#x27;t simply install Linux? And you would be right. IMO in the context of &quot;the perfect media server&quot; for people that do not know how to setup a Linux media server, but have a spare Dell Optiplex, it&#x27;s a viable alternative and the risk are basically zero or, to be completely honest, less than watching TV show and movies illegally.')
