I tried copy-pasting the text on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thejh.net&#x2F;misc&#x2F;website-terminal-copy-paste" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thejh.net&#x2F;misc&#x2F;website-terminal-copy-paste</a> to Alacritty, and the newlines were replaced with semicolons. However, pasting newlines worked within vim in insert mode. It happens with or without bracketed paste mode on (using the &quot;enable-bracketed-paste&quot; option in ~&#x2F;.inputrc). Same thing with Konsole.<p>&gt; &gt; A few terminals, despite having Bracketed Paste Mode, are vulnerable to escape injection. That&#x27;s when the end-paste escape sequence is included in the paste content, and the terminal lets it pass through, causing the shell to think the paste ended.<p>I&#x27;m glad you mentioned this!<p>&gt; With support for Bracketed Paste Mode, all that needs to be stripped from the pasted content is the end-paste escape sequence.<p>Alacritty strips the control sequence that ends bracketed paste; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alacritty&#x2F;alacritty&#x2F;issues&#x2F;800" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alacritty&#x2F;alacritty&#x2F;issues&#x2F;800</a>.')
