You start cutting down the trees to produce furniture and sell them. Generally the cost of oxygen production is not priced in, and down the line, someone will pay for it. Either individuals getting sick, universal health care, environmental efforts in replanting, regulation on land maintenance, etc, etc.<p>I suppose you will argue that each individual will need to save a buffer for every network effect for every purchase decision they ever make that doesn&#x27;t price in externalities, in pure capitalist spirit. But I hope my point hits that there has never existed such a system, or if it did, it died out pretty quickly, and left no trace in history.<p>We can and should all have opinions on health regulation, environmental taxes, etc regarding what their effect ultimately becomes, but everything from societal mental health to environmental effects will always leave a bill, and someone <i>will</i> pay for it. The only thing we can discuss is if it should be everyone for themselves, our great great grandchildren, taxes, or corporations selling crap too cheap (or in OPs case for free).')
