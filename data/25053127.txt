No one thinks about threads when programming async&#x2F;await code despite in any await keyword a thread change can happen.<p>Both solve the same problem with the same technique (under the hood it is all the same). One language had the benefit of late birth (go), the other suffers with its friends through a library&#x2F;language migration (C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, ...). async&#x2F;await is effectively the modernization of structural programming to benefit from modern concurrency.')
