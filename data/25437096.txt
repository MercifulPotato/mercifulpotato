You are advocating a regressive policy that hampers growth, and it&#x27;s easy to figure this out with economic thinking.<p>&gt; wrong. property taxes are diverted to the state&#x27;s public education program through a complicated set of formulas called LCFF.[1]<p>That doesn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m wrong. It just shows the formula by which the state props up each local government.<p>&gt; how? how will increasing taxes on older properties that are still housing original buyers and havent been resold.. &#x27;encourage development&#x27; without UNHOUSING existing people with fixed incomes who are already living there.<p>You&#x27;re making at least three mistakes. The first is that you assume all property is residential. The second is that you assume that all property is developed. Due to Prop 13, there are several undeveloped lots with keep out signs in my neighborhood of million dollar houses. The third is that you assume that apartments can&#x27;t be redeveloped to house more people. Prop 13 increases the cost of doing so to not only the fixed cost of redeveloping the property but the ongoing cost of significantly higher taxes.<p>&gt; you are asking that prop 13 punish older houseowners so they will be forced to give up their residences to fund the younger citizenry.<p>You&#x27;re falling for a marketing trick the proponents of the initiative intended for rubes. The correct way to keep the few old people in their homes is via tax exemptions, as I&#x27;ve already explained. It is not to give incumbent landowners a huge competitive advantage over new landowners, leading to de facto serfdom.<p>&gt; you want to increase the burden of taxation on NON EARNERS with non income producing fixed assets.<p>Who said that? These landlords are producing massive unearned profits. The rents go up with demand, but their costs stay low. Removing prop 13 would bring their profits in line with newer landlords.<p>&gt; those who have children should be taxed because the children consume resources and need to be educated. the peers of parents should share the burden. not the generation that has already done it&#x27;s part and is getting ready to retire.<p>This is economically nonsensical. Who is going to pay the taxes to take care of the elderly if not the children? The state has every incentive to make these children as productive as possible, which means educating them.')
