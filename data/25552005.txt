That is, have a host-specific local cache of the metadata from the main backup server, so that a snapshot backup can be made locally (say to an attached thumb drive or SD card), then have a process that sync&#x27;s that up periodically when a stable network connection is available?<p>If this is a strong enough use case then I have a couple ideas on how to implement it (I&#x27;ll throw it in the wishlist).  Otherwise, currently if you have an interrupted backup the next one will still re-use the files already on the server, even if it is part of a partial backup.')
