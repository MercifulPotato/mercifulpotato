Brave&#x27;s mistake was showing them on fully-qualified domain names (that wasn&#x27;t our intention, and was fixed within 48 hours).<p>Affiliate links aren&#x27;t uncommon; definitely not worth trying to keep a secret. Open Firefox (or Opera, Vivaldi, etc.) and do a search for &quot;hacker news&quot; from the address bar. Every one of these browsers adds its identifier to the resulting query. By contrast, Brave offered a search suggestion with a [visible] affiliate code attached.')
