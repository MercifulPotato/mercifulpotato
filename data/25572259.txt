Item(by='bartwr', descendants=None, kids=[25579343], score=None, time=1609263209, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25568748, text='You are right that &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; engines have tooling and features rich enough that even a single person can make a pretty and fun game.<p>But I disagree with the higher level idea - that this means that things become simple. It&#x27;s the other way around - they became <i>so complex</i> that a few person studio cannot write a new, general engine (see how many people programmed Doom or Quake which were state of the art back then!).\nAt Unity there are a few thousands of just programmers working on the engine (yes!). This is not FAANG size, but I don&#x27;t know if there is a team at FAANG that has a few thousands of engineers working on a single product.\nYou need a team of this size to make a multi-platform, universal engine that is still not good enough to make AAA or open-world games.<p>Also my personal experience at my last games job (I left games) was the complete opposite of what you suggest as &quot;engines being commodities&quot; (at least this is at odds with you writing that they are working on AAA engines- sounds like they might be &quot;using&quot; engines and not writing in-house ones?).\nAt Sony Santa Monica we had a team of ~30 programmers, out of which ~8 graphics people (just for a single platform and a single game) and I was constantly frustrated with how impossible it was just to catch up on all necessary state of the art techniques with a team of that size.<p>There are people much smarter than me who spend for example a half of a year on something as obscure as &quot;multiscattering rough diffuse BRDF&quot; - and a larger engine has hundreds of &quot;features&quot; like this.')
