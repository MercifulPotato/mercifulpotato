If you have a wealthy network that&#x27;s not techy, there&#x27;s probably interest.<p>- Crypto-art (NFTs etc, budding community)<p>- Mining. This is profitable if you have access to free&#x2F;cheap power<p>- Build technology that actually leverages blockchain -- streaming micropayment-based business models, truth estimation via prediction markets, distributed computing (Filecoin&#x2F;RNDR&#x2F;Codius&#x2F;GNT), idea X where crowdsourcing is key to success. I agree that most of this stuff can be built with a centralized model, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t money to be made going the crypto route. In some cases the crypto aspect might be the <i>interesting</i> thing that builds your top of funnel and makes users actually use it. After all, real crypto enthusiasts are wanting for valid use cases.')
