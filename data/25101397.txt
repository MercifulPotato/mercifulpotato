She wants several types of lighting in the stable part which should be switchable from several locations. Switching a light source from 2 locations can be done easily, 3 is doable but more than that requires a separate switching circuit with momentary switches and a contactor to do the actual switching. It is here where a system like this, especially a wireless one can help by making it possible to have switches anywhere you want them without having to pull loads of cabling (which by regulation has to be mounted on the walls instead of in them in agricultural buildings). For now I&#x27;ve settled on 2 switching locations for most of the lighting so as to avoid any &quot;smart&quot; solutions, should she insist on having to be able to switch the &quot;mood light&quot; in the stable from the observation window in the office on the 2nd floor I&#x27;ll have to go that way with all the problems that come with &quot;smart&quot; electronics on the countryside - power failures, lightning, etc.')
