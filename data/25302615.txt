I have never seen the parks so full of people in December - every bench is occupied. Every bench.<p>In my neck of the woods, many people have largely lived their lives on park benches, doing everything they can to have connections with other people in as normal a way as possible. People &quot;socially distance&quot; as much as they can, sitting as far apart from one another as possible, and talk. Usually with masks on.<p>In Brooklyn, NY, this is possibly the best way to remain sane without risking being a victim of the huge increase in random senseless crimes, and without risking being a perceived nuisance to the public.<p>It&#x27;s sad to see it, because it&#x27;s so obvious what trouble people are going through to get this all done. To see people bundled up in winter coats, barely able to move, so they can bare the near-freezing temperatures - just to socialize - really shows how hideous these lockdowns are and how much they threaten the human spirit.')
