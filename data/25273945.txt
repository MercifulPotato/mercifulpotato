Just look at the regular stuff like the tooling for a new case - we have lots of that, and that stuff is expensive. Mouses, keyboard, displays - nothing stood still. It&#x27;s normal and a positive thing that the field became more stable after a while, like that all the alternative processor architectures vanished. Until now of course.<p>&gt; <i>Apple can add what they want - and leave out what they don&#x27;t need. Not just in the CPU but ANYWHERE in the system now.</i><p>Yeah. The &quot;courage&quot; headphone jack company can now make even more decisions I will disagree with and create unupgradeable systems that are unrepairable. Can&#x27;t even change the ram in those things, pure throwaway garbage. Apple is the very last company I want to be in a decision making position over my desktop system. This is not a positive development.<p>And yes, they have thunderbolt, but you can&#x27;t run GPUs with those ports. How useful.<p>&gt; <i>Otherwise why bother with Apple Silicon? If you can&#x27;t have such a stark difference that detractors will just look silly, then why bother?</i><p>Money. And being able to release new systems when they are able to, not when Intel gets something out of the door for once. Which is a plus on its own, they won&#x27;t and do not need to be radically different.')
