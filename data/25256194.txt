Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606756707, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25253929, text='I went for a walk to the town centre during this current &quot;lockdown&quot;, and it felt the same as any other year.<p>Lots of people, festive atmosphere, most shops appeared to be open, coffee shops were open, cafes were open.<p>The difference was coffee shops and cafes were only doing takeaways and outdoor service.  But it&#x27;s hard to see that from a distance, especially the ones lit and processing orders at the usual counters inside.  As a result, people were eating and drinking outside, and it made the seated areas on the streets seem busier than normal.<p>The pubs were closed, that was the most noticeable thing.<p>Clothes shops were closed, except M&amp;S which is 80% clothes was open, presumably on the excuse that at the back they sell food.  I noticed quite a few other large shops open that seemed &quot;non-essential&quot; to me, but who am I to judge what&#x27;s essential.<p>My landlord&#x27;s property agent was open, which surprised me when they asked me to take a letter there.  I asked about that, and they said they are alternating who is in the office each day so there&#x27;s only half the staff.  I&#x27;m not convinced they are essential, especially when they seemed to be able to work from home just fine earlier in the year, but it&#x27;s up to them.<p>Walking down the street while keeping 2m from other people was difficult even on pedestrianised streets (no vehicles) because of so many people.  I didn&#x27;t see much mask wearing outside - less than in the summer.<p>It made me quite uncomfortable to be honest; I haven&#x27;t been out since.<p>I know that it&#x27;s more severe in other regions of the UK.  But where I live, Oxford, it seemed quite lax.  Our case rate here is below average for the country despite a very large number of students.<p>They must be doing <i>something</i> right, as the figures have started dropping clearly on the charts over the last week.  I hope it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re being smarter about what to restrict now.  Maybe they&#x27;re actually getting better at this.')
