My response was that they are all horse-riding cultures that live on plains&#x2F;steppes and raid settled peoples. Further, I submit that this lack of acknowledgement of this fact on the author&#x27;s part defacto demonstrates cherry-picking. Your response <i>could</i> be that you disagree that this is evidence of cherry-picking, but instead you... recap the article.<p>All this is beside the point. I acknowledge that the Dothraki are not historically accurate. That is the <i>motte</i>. The <i>bailey</i> is that the Dothraki are demeaning stereotypes. That is my original point against which you argue. I grant the <i>motte</i>. It&#x27;s the <i>bailey</i> that has yet to be demonstrated.')
