The squeezers were not prosecuted in 2008 when they held onto VW even though it briefly became the most valuable stock in the world. Seeing an opportunity to advantage oneself of a bad short position is just trading, nothing fancier than that.<p>The Falcone case is much more complicated because it was a single person buying the entirety of the market. Much weirder mechanics at play. Squeezes are always carried out through the self-interest of uncoordinated parties, be they retail investors or firms.')
