And if we use nuclear for that, it significantly reduces the amount of storage we need for renewables.<p>The bottom half of the demand is the easy half, why would you use your most expensive power for the easy stuff?<p>&gt; Also, nuclear combines well with thermal storage because you don&#x27;t incur double conversion losses. If you store heat from the reactor during the day when solar is generating, use it during the peak demand in the evening when it isn&#x27;t, and then run directly from the reactor overnight, you don&#x27;t really need any other storage.<p>In other words, you&#x27;re running your nuclear at a 50% duty cycle, doubling it&#x27;s price.   I don&#x27;t think there is much appetite for power that costs over $200 per MWh.')
