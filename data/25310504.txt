Trump&#x27;s unexpectedly broad support has to do more with the fact that he&#x27;s willing to stand up against a far-left influence that has been spiraling out of control and taking the near-left and center with it, all the while facing little critique or checks from other politicians. This is a deeper topic than I can articulate in a single HN comment, but my point is that the quick takes that portray Trump voters in such negative terms feel good to us but are not fair because people have deeper, and often legitimate reasons to support him despite all of his drawbacks.<p>I also think we should remember that progressive activists are only 8% of the country (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hiddentribes.us&#x2F;profiles&#x2F;#progressive-activists" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hiddentribes.us&#x2F;profiles&#x2F;#progressive-activists</a>) but they are forcing their views on everyone else, through aggressive&#x2F;uncivil&#x2F;authoritarian tactics and due to the physical location of influential media&#x2F;tech companies. These mainstream platforms are marching to the tune of this 8% (an extreme) rather than the broad center in my opinion.')
