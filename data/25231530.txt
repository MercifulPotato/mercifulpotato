I am currently on a J1-Fulbright (with 2 year home requirement), and was planning to apply for an O-1 in future (once I have a few years to resolve and obtain funding for a startup idea). I&#x27;ve been told by Fulbright that it would be damaging to future applications if I am denied a 2 year waiver. Is this true, and is it likely that a waiver will be granted with the new administration? Is it too late if I intend to graduate in June 2021?<p>Thanks for your help in advance!')
