There seems to be a difference. <i>If I understood correctly:</i><p>- BPD stems from a real distorted self image and manifests itself to protect one from abandonment or being left behind.<p>- TIV uses victimhood psychology to appear weak (or it already feels weak) but, can use this allure to slowly and surely feed itself. More importantly, TID lacks the <i>wild</i> or <i>fierce</i> side of BPD and narcissism. The process is slower and less painful until it ends. The pain is felt when the process is almost over, and the victim is ejected when it&#x27;s completely powerless.<p>Even writing this brings memories back. On the bright side, experiencing these kinds of people once or twice is a very maturing experience (with an expense of course).')
