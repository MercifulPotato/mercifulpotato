Item(by='save_ferris', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604931492, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25031319, text='&gt; I can&#x27;t imagine any system where there aren&#x27;t &quot;safe&quot; areas that politicians essentially ignore.<p>Of course, when you&#x27;re campaigning for the support of millions of people in a large country, some areas will be prioritized over others. The problem that swing states create, which we&#x27;ve seen play out on multiple occasions in the US, is that a candidate can win the popular vote by a margin of millions and still ultimately lose the election. It doesn&#x27;t seem logical that a democratic system exists where the majority winner can still lose the race because of how particular states are weighed in terms of electoral power. With gerrymandering factored in, the system is further skewed to require an even lower vote threshold for a particular party to retain a majority in congress versus another. Compounded, these modifications begin to fundamentally undermine the democratic system, which further discourages voter turnout and participation in the system entirely.')
