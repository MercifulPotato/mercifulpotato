They then whitelist in some kinds of apps that allow scripting, but that won’t compete with the App Store.<p>The WebView exception [edit: that used to exist] is from an older version of the agreement, but it helps indicate what they mean: “3.3.2 An Application may not download or install executable code. Interpreted code may only be used in an Application if all scripts, code and interpreters are packaged in the Application and not downloaded. The only exception to the foregoing is scripts and code downloaded and run by Apple’s built-in WebKit framework, provided that such scripts and code do not change the primary purpose of the Application by providing features or functionality that are inconsistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application as submitted to the App Store.”<p>If scripting were allowed, how would you or Apple ensure iSH doesn’t break any of the other 2.5.x clauses.')
