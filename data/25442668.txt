I think a side effect of the realization that Bitcoin had no real underlying fundamentals that can explain the price, and therefore it’s difficult to think of an upper limit for the price using traditional metrics.<p>This leads to weird rationalizations where people compare losing their $1000 investment to the “what it” scenario of Bitcoin going to $500k or $1 million, in which case $1000 suddenly feels negligible. Of course, Bitcoin going to a million dollars per coin doesn’t make any sense, but the “what if” and FOMO are strong drivers for some people.')
