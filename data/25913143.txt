More specifically, it would be nice if establishment media and political figures didn&#x27;t respond to this distrust with castigation.<p>Distrusting government would still make sense for me personally. It would be idyllic if people looked towards decentralization, localism and private solutions. Trust in their local institutions or community, while drastically reducing the purview of the federal government. That&#x27;s just my personal preference. I&#x27;m not sure it is applicable in the widespread, pragmatic sense.<p>Some kind of political figure reaching across the aisle, recognizing the concerns of those who feel disenfranchised looks like the pragmatic solution that isn&#x27;t happening. Instead I see actions and accusations that are predictably creating more division.')
