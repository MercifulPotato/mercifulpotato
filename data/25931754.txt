The model changes from &quot;expensive building with attendants on every corner&quot; to &quot;a (120v&#x2F;slow charging) plug at most parking spots&quot;. This is <i>already</i> the norm in northern communities where you need to plug in ICE cars if you want them to start in the morning.<p>In apartments&#x2F;flats you are usually parking in a dedicated parking lot, that can be easily renovated to have spots with a plug. Street parking in front of small houses will likely gain parking meter like devices with extension cords.')
