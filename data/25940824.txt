Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=[25941130], score=None, time=1611835470, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25934270, text='This is a pattern that I have seen quite regularly in recent times, mostly via Next.js, I think:<p><pre><code>  &lt;link rel=preload href=FOO.js as=script&gt;\n  &lt;script async src=FOO.js&gt;&lt;&#x2F;script&gt;\n</code></pre>\nThat is, a preload, followed <i>immediately</i> by using it (rather than using it much later in the document, as was the original intent of preload links).<p>(On this submission, servers.json receives this treatment. While talking of servers.json, two things are odd about it: although served as JSON, itâ€™s actually JavaScript, and a random cache busting parameter is added to its query string, rather than the server just instructing the client not to cache it.)<p>I cannot imagine any way in which this makes sense: the preload line should be 100% superfluous (and thus mildly counterproductive). Is there some utterly bizarre reason why this <i>does</i> actually help things, or is it just simple cargo culting of a corrupted idea as I presume?')
