Maybe IE11 would hiccup on a particularly large page with 1,000s of DOM nodes, but all of the evergreen browsers are ridiculously performant with CSS. I&#x27;m not saying you should write queries like that, but if you must (for readability or technical reasons), it likely won&#x27;t harm your site&#x27;s performance.')
