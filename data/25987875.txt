I told my children that I&#x27;m going to take them to McDonald&#x27;s tomorrow evening. They see this promise as 100% good, as real as if they were actually holding the burger. The only difference from their point of view, is that if they were holding a physical burger now, by tomorrow evening it would be cold and bad to eat. The ones I have promised them are real burgers which are deliverable tomorrow evening, at the time we&#x27;re going to want to eat them. So I&#x27;ve created two additional burgers owned by my children, in addition to all the physical burgers that currently exist, which are owned by either McDonald&#x27;s, if they haven&#x27;t been sold yet, or by customers if they have.<p>Does this mean that I&#x27;ve found an infinite supply of free burgers and should go into competition with McDonald&#x27;s? No. Because I&#x27;m going to have to buy the burgers <i>from</i> McDonald&#x27;s to supply to my children. They own two new paper burgers, but I&#x27;m <i>short</i> two burgers. So the net total world supply of burgers is unchanged.')
