I personally find the whole Hunder Biden episode to be a lot more damning than that and I am not ready to say Joe Biden deserves to be held responsible for it.<p>It is also worth noting there is no &quot;OCCRP&quot; award against Lula, former Brazil&#x27;s president, who was in fact tried, charged, and imprisioned through a lengthy and fair judicial process - that really makes you question the true motives of this award. Are speculations more important than the due process of the law?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;veja.abril.com.br&#x2F;brasil&#x2F;preso-do-pcc-o-pt-tinha-dialogo-com-nois-cabuloso&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;veja.abril.com.br&#x2F;brasil&#x2F;preso-do-pcc-o-pt-tinha-dia...</a>')
