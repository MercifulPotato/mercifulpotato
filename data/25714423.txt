If perceived as bad, the national lawmaker will point to these nasty EU bureaucrats.  After years of this, the local population will perceive any EU law as bad.<p>A second fun one is unpopular politicians being dumped in EU seats.  They vote pro something unpopular, let their local equivalent implement the national law, then blame them for it. Hence extremist politicians make EU law as nasty as possible, just to get some ammonution at home.')
