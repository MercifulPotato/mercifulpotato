Simply <i>knowing</i> BB(n) is enough to solve the halting problem for a TM with n states.  It doesn&#x27;t matter whether it is precomputed and stored in a lookup table, or computed on the fly, or revealed to you by God.  If you know BB(n) by any means, you can solve the halting problem for a TM with n states.  Therefore you cannot know BB(n) beyond a certain n.')
