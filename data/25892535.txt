Item(by='flohofwoe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611500395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25891287, text='&gt; UTF-8 as a fixed encoding only works if you manage to write mappers from and to alternative character set for practically any language outside US English.<p>Huh? I&#x27;m using UTF-8 exclusively for string data since around 20 years in C and C++ and never had to deal with language specifics (also true for non-European languages, we need to deal with various East Asian languages, and Arabic for instance). You need to convert from and to operating system specific encodings when talking to OS APIs (like UTF-16 on Windows), but that&#x27;s it (and this is not language specific, code pages are an &quot;8-bit pseudo-ASCII&quot; thing that&#x27;s irrelevant when working with UTF encodings.')
