The intent seems pretty clearly &quot;censorship of stuff that violates 1990s era morality is OK&quot;. Extrapolating to that to arbitrary censorship of ordinary political views isn&#x27;t what Congress meant with this clause, and presumably adjusting Section 230 to tighten or simply remove &quot;otherwise objectionable&quot; would mean they could no longer do moderation for political reasons without losing that protection.')
