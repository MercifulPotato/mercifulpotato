Because I don&#x27;t agree with that.<p>Given a specific task and 100 programmers equally skilled in both languages, they will accomplish the task faster in one. There will be a clear and statistically significant answer if one were to do a controlled study. It could be that the result is that they are nearly equal, but that would be a surprising outcome.<p>So when you say my opinion is the equal of yours, you&#x27;re just saying you have no idea which is closer to the objective truth so you can&#x27;t compare them. But fundamentally they are not equal and one opinion will be right and one will be wrong (in this case because it&#x27;s a boolean outcome).<p>It is my opinion, it is subjective, but I also am willing to bet it&#x27;s right. And there is a right and wrong answer here regardless of our ability to know it for sure.')
