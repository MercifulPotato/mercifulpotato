The enduring popular meme also gives it some intrinsic value that other Cryptos don&#x27;t have.<p>I&#x27;d like the coin to take off as an actual currency, and of the coins I&#x27;ve looked at, I think it has the most potential for adoption in that respect.<p>But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s got the ecosystem to support that right now. A metamask-style doge wallet would do wonders for this.<p>Also, knowing little to nothing about the backend (or other crypto backends, tbh), other than that it&#x27;s derived from Bitcoin - I have concerns about scalability wrt transaction settlement times, power consumption, and ease-of-entry with self-hosted wallets.')
