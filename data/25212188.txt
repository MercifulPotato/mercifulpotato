Amazon and Netflix have basically normalized PIP culture at larger places, where the strategy is basically hire like crazy and then find a reason to pip anyone you don&#x27;t like. The most recent startup I was at was absurdly trigger happy, gleefully firing anyone that wasn&#x27;t able to read the minds of &quot;leadership&quot; or in anyways challenged the status quo (even if they were supposed hired to do just that).<p>It used to be my experience that anyone who was let go within a year was obviously a bad hire to anyone at the company. Now I see constant confusion among employees about why some of their favorite coworkers are being let go. Maybe I&#x27;m just unlucky in places I&#x27;ve been recently, or very lucky about places I&#x27;ve been before, but it certainly looks like a strange shift in the environment.')
