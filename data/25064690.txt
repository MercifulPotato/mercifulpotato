I assume most of the stuff from the AE CS6 PDF applies to AE CC as well.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.adobe.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;blogs.dir&#x2F;48&#x2F;files&#x2F;2012&#x2F;06&#x2F;After-Effects-CS6-Scripting-Guide.pdf?file=2012&#x2F;06&#x2F;After-Effects-CS6-Scripting-Guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.adobe.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;blogs.dir&#x2F;48&#x2F;files&#x2F;2012&#x2F;0...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aenhancers.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aenhancers.com</a><p>From the PDF:<p>&gt; When you use Adobe After Effects, you create projects, compositions, and render queue items along with all of the elements that they contain: footage, images, solids, layers, masks, effects, and properties. Each of these items, in scripting terms, is an object. This guide describes the ExtendScript objects that have been defined for After Effects projects.<p>I think it might be worthwhile to look into whether scripting might be used in order to randomize effects and effect parameters. My immediate guess would be that yes it would be possible. I didn&#x27;t look into it closely, and if it turns out to be a dead end then I apologise for that but anyways I figured I might mention this in case it might be useful to you. Also, of course since I didn&#x27;t look into it closely I can not make any guesses as to how much work it would take to get the type of functionality that you want.')
