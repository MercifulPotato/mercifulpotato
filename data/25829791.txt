If so, why do that, why not just run a VM using virtual box, for example, with OSX inside OSX. Does the lower resource Linux host make it so you can run more VMs (or better specs)?<p>I&#x27;m definitely interested in building a bunch of development images as VMs. The setup of Apple development (signing and notarizing) is so opaque that I&#x27;m always terrified our CI will get broken with some small upgrade that I want to save stable images frequently, and this seems perfect for that.')
