Circumstances that make you think things through ahead of time compel you to learn things and gain skills that you would not otherwise learn and gain.<p>The other way around is true, too, of course.<p>But the intensely-interactive style of programming-by-teaching is the less common approach. In pretty much every thread I&#x27;ve been part of about the topic there have been commentators who&#x27;ve said they just weren&#x27;t even aware of it as an option, who had no idea that full-featured repl-driven environments had ever existed or were a possibility.<p>What are the odds that such an obscure approach to programming has already attracted all the programmers who would benefit from it? Long odds, I&#x27;m guessing.<p>So my guess is that it&#x27;s worthwhile to point out the option for the sake of people who would benefit from it but don&#x27;t know they have the option.<p>For my benefit too, of course. I want more people to know about it, because that increases the chances that demand will rise. Rising demand increases the chances of greater investment in those kinds of tools, and reduces the chances of their extinction.')
