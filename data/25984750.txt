Of course there will be condtradictory information coming in because the media has completely failed to provide a source of credible information. I&#x27;m not throwing out misinformation, but merely pointing out information that the OP missed and is available in reputable sources. There is A LOT of video evidence that points to BJP stooges inciting violence. The guy who hoisted the flag on Red Fort, Deep Siddhu is a known BJP supporter. Times of India , Indian Express, The Wire have all reported on this. Heck even Aj Tak had video where the BJP stooges are throwing stones at the protestors while an entire police battalion stands behind them doing nothing.')
