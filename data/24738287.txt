His second example is arguing for value-equality instead of reference-equality as a saner default.  He created two &quot;value-ish&quot; Customer objects and used them to motivate his argument.<p>So when he writes:<p>&gt;&gt; Why not make the objects equal by default, and make reference equality testing the special case?<p>this refers in particular to these value objects.<p>I completely agree with you that InputStream should not have equals defined.  A sane language would not conflate values with classes, and InputStream is not a value.<p>So perhaps it could be better-written as:<p>If defined, equality should test by value, rather than by reference.')
