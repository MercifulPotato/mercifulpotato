I had a great discussion with one of our collaborators about where we thought the alpha-Gal came from that is so antigenic.<p>Our rough hypothesis was that this is a microbiome related problem, and there’s now some kind of bacteria (or something else!) resident to ticks that produces this sugar. My bet is that the little beastie that produces this epitope has adapted to produce alpha-Gal to avoid detection by the immune system in other mammalian hosts. The tick is simply a delivery mechanism for the alpha-gal producing organism.<p>Here’s the thing though - I don’t quite get why we don’t know what is going on yet. We (probably) have genomes for the ticks, and we can guess (sort of ok) what sugars they can make. We can also do microbiomes to figure out which possible beasties are found in the saliva. I must be missing something big so as to explain why we’re not much closer to answers?')
