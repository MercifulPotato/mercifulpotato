Did u learn them, or u&#x27;ve been trying to make your own? I have profile on VK (medium or any other shitty social dump) and just copy and paste links i&#x27;m interested in - really helpful. But make your own site. Man, to be honest, developers are not kittens. Real developer is a man: he is a bit sad, confused and tired. If u want to pick up girls with your profile maybe it&#x27;ll be cool. But for real, you look like pussy, trash talking, and trying ti make sense of any of your actions. And i don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re really good at. At all? Are u kidding?<p>Sry for my english)')
