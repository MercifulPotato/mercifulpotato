And heavily in the last 3 months.<p>I&#x27;m up to speed now, but I still feel I&#x27;m missing an opinion.<p>e.g. I have naturally been drawn to &quot;maximally infer&quot; types, whilst I see other developers would rather re-create&#x2F;co-locate a type with its function&#x2F;component.<p>Does anyone have a repo where they think the TS is near-perfect? Or even better, a deeply opinionated Style Guide?')
