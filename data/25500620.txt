This post comes across as defensive.<p>Seems like you got some valuable feedback--you may not agree with it, but then take it with a grain of salt.<p>The 2nd reviewer self identifies as being your target customer, and provides her feedback, which is discounted because she&#x27;s asking for more physical inputs, and an improved Alexa app.<p>As a creator, you let yourself be vulnerable releasing something for others to use and criticize. It&#x27;s not easy to hear that criticism, but it&#x27;s part of the process.')
