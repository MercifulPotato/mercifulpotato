They just want something for free and get irate when they get called out for it.<p>The trick with support requests &#x2F; issues is they can be opened by anyone. You can tell the customers apart from everyone else easily, but is the person filing an issue looking to contribute in turn, or are they a leech wanting free support? A well written bug report is also a love note, after all. I still don’t have a good metric; but I’m definitely drawn to some filed issues more than others.')
