There&#x27;s a lot of speculation and insinuation that all the security lapses started with the purchase of a refurbished MacBook, but there&#x27;s zero evidence other than some coincidental timing. The author clearly wasn&#x27;t using many security precautions prior to being compromised. They had many interconnected accounts; reused passwords; limited use of 2FA; phone&#x2F;SMS-based 2FA in the few places they had it; no separate password for Chrome browser sync&#x27;s DB; no secure password management app; and kept the keys to their crypto accounts in the cloud. The list of compounded failures is long. There&#x27;s no reason to think this has anything to do with Apple at all.<p>They haven&#x27;t learned any lesson, either. Their advice after this? Turn your laptop off when you&#x27;re not using it (useless) and use Google Voice for 2FA. This is worse than useless; this is actively bad advice and you should not follow it.<p>The average user should install 1Password and use a TOTP application. Anyone can learn to do that, and it&#x27;s really all you need. More advanced users, those with particularly extreme security needs, and pedantic nerds can use YubiKeys, hardware wallets, self-hosted password vaults, PGP-encrypted backup codes, and other measures that are worth considering, but aren&#x27;t as approachable for everyone.')
