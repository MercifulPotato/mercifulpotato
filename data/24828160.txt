Item(by='reggieband', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603126207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24826676, text='You said: &quot;so many, if not most, forms of one to many real time communication would have to be discontinued&quot;<p>I take your statement: &quot;would have to be discontinued&quot; as equivalent to impossible. If you&#x27;d like to walk back that statement we can continue to discuss.<p>I have given examples of: Small teams of individuals (e.g. one Twitch streamer + a mod team) broadcasting to tens of thousands of people in real-time including call-in type segments. This happens today and I considered how this would continue if we repeal section 230 (including comparisons to existing public real-time radio call-in segments). I have given examples of medium sized teams presenting classes of 150+ individuals, each of whom can &quot;raise their hand&quot; and be selected by a moderator to take control of the stream to provide their own insights to the group in real time. I considered how this would be possible without Section 230. If neither of those forms of &quot;one to many real time communications&quot; fit your imagination then please be more specific and we can continue.<p>However, in all of this I still have not heard to my own satisfaction a description of a realistic loss we would have if Section 230 were to be revoked.')
