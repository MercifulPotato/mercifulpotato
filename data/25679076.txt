I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Yes, it literally does.<p>Both Democrat and Republican Parties have consistently agreed that it does, via the constitution and law-setting, even where it is against the best interests of most people.<p>You can&#x27;t make this argument against Democrats, unless you are making it against the Republicans in 2017-2019. Neither of the two political parties are as yet a permanent minority.<p>If that does happen, such that the Democrats start to consistently get 2&#x2F;3 of the vote or 2&#x2F;3 of each chamber (which doesn&#x27;t look likely), then the dominating Democrats will likely split into two parties.<p>The choice of electoral system entrenches a two-party state; but, it doesn&#x27;t say that one of those two parties necessarily has to be the Republicans.')
