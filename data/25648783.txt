But this is an internationally operating company, which means it has to also follow whatever law might apply to whatever market they operate on.<p>GitHub, as any other US company, has a choice&#x2F;freedom to stop offering services to customers outside the US market, if the particulars of providing those services causes them to violate laws in at least one of the jurisdictions.<p>Of course, US companies should be rightfully pissed, if the US government puts them in a situation where they can not (legally) operate abroad. But that&#x27;s something they should take up with US lawmakers.<p>At the end of they day, they are still (most likely) operating illegally on a foreign market, even if they are unlikely ever to be substantially punished for that. The thing is, the US has a rather questionable track record of coming to the rescue, whenever a US companies get into trouble for (illegally) doing business abroad. Ironically, whenever another country does that (e.g. China) the US immediately have a long list of choice words an allegations at the ready. Long story short: pure hypocrisy.')
