Digital content producers use it in the hopes it&#x27;ll deter piracy, but the truth, as clearly shown by GOG.com, is that DRM is pointless. If your software and content are reasonably priced and worthwhile in some way, people will buy it.<p>I recently looked into what it takes to play 4K Blu-ray UHD discs natively, and its fucking laughable. A specific Intel-only CPU, only certain motherboards, certain monitors that support certain specs... OR you could just download an .mkv from some torrent website that plays flawlessly...<p>Which are people more likely to do? Instead of potentially adding 1.5 billion Windows users to the pool of available 4K UHD Blu-ray customers, they made it so fucking annoying that it practically guarantees piracy. Nice job breaking it, Hero.')
