In some states petty shoplifting might even be an infraction (more like a traffic ticket or a fine for littering) rather than a misdemeanor.<p>It certainly doesn&#x27;t seem to be commensurate (or cost-effective) to send someone to jail (much less prison) for stealing $20 worth of merchandise (or passing a counterfeit $20 bill for that matter.)<p>Not to mention that piracy (or illegal copying) isn&#x27;t theft - it&#x27;s copyright infringement. (Though that might actually be worse since the penalty could be $150K in statutory damages.)')
