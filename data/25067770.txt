I&#x27;ve caught teachers from established institutions in mistakes hundreds of times in my life, and often just as defensive. And I&#x27;ve found &quot;random blogs&quot; on the internet that explain things far clearer than the school recommended book.<p>Absolutely! And I&#x27;ve had medical doctors make lots of mistakes, while random blogs on the Internet have been right. Buuuut, you know.<p>&gt; The only thing that is important is the quality of the resource, not where it came from.<p>Right. And the blog author we&#x27;re discussing is flat out refusing to accept that his material has basic mistakes. That&#x27;s a gigantic red flag. Again: it&#x27;s not about being wrong. It&#x27;s about refusing to accept that he&#x27;s wrong.')
