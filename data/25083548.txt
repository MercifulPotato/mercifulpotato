We hear a lot of talk about software being either an art, or a science, but really it&#x27;s a systems discipline. Using the tools of systems science on software makes a lot of sense in my eyes, but as far as I&#x27;m aware nobody has put together a decent description of what this looks like - I just do it off intuition I&#x27;ve built over time, as I suspect most programmers do.')
