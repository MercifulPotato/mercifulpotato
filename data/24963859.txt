Turns out for some use cases WiFi in it&#x27;s standard config is a big part of the &quot;getting below a few hundred milliseconds latency&quot; problem. (Note: trying for low latency on 1080p video is making life harder for yourself too. If you don&#x27;t _need_ 2 megapixel frames, go smaller. 720 or 600 lines might be fine. Drone FPV often uses 525 line analog video.)<p>I&#x27;ve got a setup I built based on this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;befinitiv.wordpress.com&#x2F;wifibroadcast-analog-like-transmission-of-live-video-data&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;befinitiv.wordpress.com&#x2F;wifibroadcast-analog-like-tr...</a> that&#x27;s well below 100ms if latency. It&#x27;s still not as good as analog video for fast drones though.<p>These days most drone people just blow money on the new-ish DJI digital video stuff (which works on non-DJI drones). It&#x27;s pretty spectacular, but it&#x27;s over a grand (in AUD) worth of gear so for now I&#x27;m sticking with my old analog video gear.')
