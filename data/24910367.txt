Item(by='rndgermandude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603823662, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900481, text='&gt;Many payment processors don&#x27;t want to deal with adult&#x2F;sex content not because they&#x27;re puritans, but because it&#x27;s associated with high rates of fraud.<p>They always claim that, and yet they make billions from it, also by extorting huge premiums (something like 1K upfront + 30%-40% of the revenue as fees and a minimum of fees you have to pay regardless even if your revenue is below that).<p>But I wasn&#x27;t even talking about people selling adult content. I was talking about people appearing in adult content, aka &quot;porn stars&quot;. Even if you&#x27;re solely a contract porn star working for studios instead of selling your own content directly, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find personal banking once you&#x27;re discovered to have a job like this (in the US).')
