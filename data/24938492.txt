I let the US health care system walk us into a nursing home situation.  Some of the health care workers there went to the wall to do what they could, some had no business being health care providers.<p>I&#x27;ll never forgive myself for the how it turned out.  I don&#x27;t think I would have done anything substantially different.  She did not go gently, it was unpleasant at times and she fought us more than she fought to get better.  She lived for 6 months in the nursing home.  Maybe I could have stretched it out a few years if I had quit my job, moved into her home and taken care of her myself, but she never would have been self sufficient again.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I would not have &quot;made it&quot; though that experience though, not sure how else to say it.<p>I would absolutely personally take care of my wife in our home if she fell ill, and I&#x27;m saying that knowing a lot more about the end of life than I used to, how difficult and long it can be.  I do not want my children to do this for me.')
