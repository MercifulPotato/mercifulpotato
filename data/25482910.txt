Parts were clogged with mud and another section blocked with a wall of tumbleweed at the time. I had to cross the Columbia River on I-5 at 4:30am to avoid traffic as there is no shoulder on part of the bridge. Despite its incompleteness, the trail is amazing and is a treasure. Improvements keep coming and the Beverly Bridge over the Columbia is scheduled to be finished in 2021, as is are the bridges at Renslow and Takoa. Progress is being made.<p>We owe it to future generations to help make this happened. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.railstotrails.org&#x2F;greatamericanrailtrail&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.railstotrails.org&#x2F;greatamericanrailtrail&#x2F;</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;palousetocascadestrail.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;palousetocascadestrail.org&#x2F;</a>')
