Because the value of the app store is only created via continued practices of anti-competitive behaviour.</i><p>Also, because Apple created the most valuable mobile software market in the world, by creating the iPhone, continuing to release top-notch phones year after year, and by creating the App Store itself.<p>It remains true that iPhone users buy software at a rate that totally dwarfs Android. This could be traced to a number of reasons, but I wouldn&#x27;t dismiss the App Store monopoly as one of them.<p>You can describe this as anti-competitive, just keep in mind that you&#x27;re assuming your own conclusion. You could make the same argument for Apple&#x27;s refusal to license their OSes for hardware they don&#x27;t manufacture, I would be similarly unimpressed.<p>As a user, I would like a stress-free way to sideload apps which don&#x27;t meet Apple&#x27;s standards for inclusion on the App Store. Don&#x27;t see why Apple would want to give away their competitive advantage by letting other stores sell software for their phones, but I could imagine them making side-loading less onerous, that would be nice.')
