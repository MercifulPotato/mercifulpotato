But the best part is how he did it: caller ID spoof + social engineering. IMO exploiting the authoritarian nature&#x2F;culture was really clever.  Every time Kudryavtsev demurs about revealing more details, Navalny (as Ustinov) calls him by his full name.  To me, it sounds like he&#x27;s threatening him or reminding him of their relative position in the hierarchy.  Each time, Kudryavtsev continues to spill the beans and give up co-conspirators.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;21&#x2F;world&#x2F;europe&#x2F;russia-navalny-poisoning-putin.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;21&#x2F;world&#x2F;europe&#x2F;russia-naval...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ibqiet6Bg38" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ibqiet6Bg38</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gwvA49ZXnf8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gwvA49ZXnf8</a>')
