Electric stoves and water heaters are hilariously inefficient and still pale in comparison to electric furnaces.  As an environmental measure this is almost as dumb as Dubai deciding to use monumentally sized heat pumps to chill their beaches...  But seriously, this will just result in orders of magnitude of more electricity usage and waste.<p>Thank goodness I will never live in SF.')
