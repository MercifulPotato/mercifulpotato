Unlikely? Why?  Of course they&#x27;d bid the most &#x2F; the quickest: from their perspective you were offering a <i>killer</i> deal.<p>:)<p>There are platform specific stupidities, last I saw it their mobile interface almost hides the listing details... and on a lot of listings the details are worthless and not really worth looking at.  But I think experiences like yours, which I&#x27;ve also had, are just the natural result of taking the most eager buyers out of a lot of candidates.')
