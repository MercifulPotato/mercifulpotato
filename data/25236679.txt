For example this question:<p>&gt; A company currently uses Amazon EBS and Amazon RDS for storage purposes. The company intends to use a pilot light approach for disaster recovery in a different AWS Region. The company has an RTO of 6 hours and an RPO of 24 hours.<p>&gt; Which solution would achieve the requirements with MINIMAL cost?<p>You have 4 multiple choice questions, however only one uses the &quot;Use EBS and RDS cross-region snapshot copy capability&quot; while the other uses generic server jobs. It is therefore obvious which choice is the right one without even knowing anything about AWS, all you need to know is that they want you to pick the most specific option they have instead of implementing your own services.')
