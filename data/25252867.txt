Apple has innovated a whole lot more with the non-modular Macs and iPads than any generic x86 vendor has managed in years and years.<p>Modularity means software has to be designed for the lowest common denominator. And that in turn means that there is nothing to gain by innovating in hardware, because the software won&#x27;t support it anyway.<p>Somebody who controls every part of both hardware and software can innovate much more freely than you can in a modular market. x86 PCs have been stagnant for decades now.')
