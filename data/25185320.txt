QoL in Western countries will be lower, and higher in the rest of the world.<p>I often think of a documentary I saw about Somali refugees who came to America in the early 2000s (sadly I can&#x27;t find it anymore.) They ended up moving back to Africa because they hated life in America. Working two terrible minimum wage jobs just to pay rent and food. They made no friends and had no free time or money.<p>They were happier living in a UN funded refugee camp spending time with friends and family.<p>I think the only way Western countries have any chance of reducing the falling QoL is space exploration, but I don&#x27;t think their is enough energy and motivation.')
