But as soon as your research specifically includes the sponsor, then it&#x27;s perfectly fair for the sponsor to add more information.<p>It&#x27;s not censorship, in that case, it&#x27;s frankly the opposite.<p>The &#x27;miscommunication&#x27; here is a kind of naive thinking by researchers who probably have never had normal jobs, who have never worn a &#x27;company hat&#x27; and may not have any internalized understanding for communications.<p>For many researchers - money comes from magical taxpayer funds, and the &#x27;Uni Model&#x27; is the only model they understand and some might think that&#x27;s how the world ought to be.<p>If Google was giving people cancer due to the tar in their products, the researchers were discovering this - and Google was trying to suppress this, then you&#x27;d have a serious problem.<p>This is not Marlborough&#x2F;Cargill&#x2F;Exxon, it&#x27;s Google and it&#x27;s an entirely different situation.<p>The &#x27;hammers&#x27; used by the social justice fronts from the 1960s just don&#x27;t work anymore, because we have made progress and nothing is obvious.')
