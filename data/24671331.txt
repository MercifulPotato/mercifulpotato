For purposes of this reply, Jordan Peterson will be the exemplar for a self described Rationalists and new atheists (whatever they call themselves) and misc intellectual dark web characters.<p>My primary criticism is lack of novelty. I&#x27;ve heard it all before. Tell me something new.<p>A positive example of this, for contrast, is how Ezra Klein is able to have constructive conversations with people he disagrees with. Most recently David French. So I&#x27;ve learned stuff from people I would have never given the time of day. Which reflects poorly on me, I know. But I&#x27;m trying to change.<p>My second criticism is my befuddlement. I just can&#x27;t figure out what most of the celebrity pundits are saying. I&#x27;ve given Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, and many others more of my time and attention than I care to admit. Because I want to know what others find compelling about their ideas. And mostly I&#x27;m just not getting it.<p>My best immediate, aggregious example of this is Eric Weinstein&#x27;s interview of James O&#x27;Keefe. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LN-eGN8VSpA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LN-eGN8VSpA</a><p>Going in, I thought &quot;Ok, I utterly oppose anything and everything O&#x27;Keefe has said and done. He&#x27;s just a troll in the mold of Lee Atwater. But Eric sounds smart. I&#x27;d like to hear O&#x27;Keefe describe what he does in his own words.&quot; I&#x27;m a masochist, I know.<p>Whatever Eric&#x27;s criticism of O&#x27;Keefe is, I couldn&#x27;t understand it. I actually listened twice. Because these are smart people, right? Surely I&#x27;m missing something.<p>Alas, Eric&#x27;s not even wrong. His notions, assumptions, basis for &quot;journalism&quot; are so far off base as to not being worth criticism.<p>Frankly, it just felt like mental masterbation. Like high school seniors debating &quot;What is Art, really?&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt0100142" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt0100142</a><p>Like a lot of smart people, Eric assumes his obvious competency in areas outside of his own expertise. He&#x27;s not just willfully ignorant (incurious) of journalism as a profession and it&#x27;s tortured history, he actively rejects it. So he&#x27;s doing a drunken sailor&#x27;s walk thru a problem domain that has already been thoroughly beaten to death by many others with far more intention.<p>So I learned nothing.<p>The end result is I now regard Eric as another boring dilettante and don&#x27;t take him seriously. He&#x27;s apparently got some heterodox theories about physics, cosmology, or whatever, that might prove interesting. But I&#x27;ll let people smarter than me chew on those.<p>--<p>The thing I most enjoy, savor from Lex&#x27;s podcast is the novelty, the unexpected learning. I&#x27;ve read Emperor&#x27;s New Mind and I&#x27;ve read the back and forth about Penrose&#x27;s theories. So I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything. But having Penrose himself relate the backstory and his own learning since that book was published made me smile.<p>Another episode that delighted me was Corecursive&#x27;s interview of DHH. I really dislike Ruby, right? My study group worked thru a Ruby book, back when RoR was the new hotness. It&#x27;s not quite the bight on humanity like PHP or JavaScript, but it&#x27;s pretty bad. Though I was aware of DHH, I didn&#x27;t know anything about him. I thought, &quot;Well, I like Adam Gordon Bell and if he thinks DHH is work talking to, I&#x27;ll at least listen for a bit&quot;. And I just fucking loved DHH. I want to be DHH. I regret not paying attention to him for all these years. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;corecursive.com&#x2F;045-david-heinemeier-hansson-software-contrarian&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;corecursive.com&#x2F;045-david-heinemeier-hansson-softwar...</a>')
