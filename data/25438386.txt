I&#x27;d had a couple of embarrassing interviews when I first started, and it spooked me.<p>When I finally got serious about changing careers, it just came down to a numbers game. Recruiters are the gatekeepers to most jobs, and they don&#x27;t speak GitHub. I got lucky to apply to a job that had someone who knew JavaScript looking at the resume. They sent me a coding challenge which I later learned I was the only candidate to really complete. I wrote my first JavaScript tests for that challenge.<p>Ultimately I think my long runway allowed me to hit the ground running. That first job was at a small shop where I got to handle a lot of diverse tasks, including backend work (I mainly do front end). I would have stayed there much longer, but they paid the very low end of the salary range and I have two children to think about. My 16 months there bought me a much better paying, albeit less satisfying position.<p>I think bootcamps used to be better than they are. They won&#x27;t teach you anything you can&#x27;t learn on your own, and you arent going to be a dev in 3 months anyway. It takes a long time to really grok it, and I spend a lot of time on personal development.')
