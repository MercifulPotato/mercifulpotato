That is people, who did not leave, staying and fighting.<p>&gt; I don’t think you managed to explain how the people that leave are to blame for the problems<p>I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re to blame for all of the problems. What I am saying is that people of comfort, which is a group that people who can leave are among, have historically benefited tremendously from the exploitative system that makes our country &quot;bad.&quot; Now that its ruined here they simply want to run off, commonly to another colonial power, to live it up there.<p>That is not a fetishisation with fighting, that is a sober observation that the masses are being oppressed and that if they want that to change they will need to confront their oppressors.')
