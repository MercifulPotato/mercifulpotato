The person who originally wrote the Aviation SE question was claiming to be the original photographer and saying he couldn&#x27;t remember if the plane was taking off or landing... But, if the internet had access to the whole sequence of images, surely he did as well? So why was he asking? Was it just a puzzle?<p>EDIT: From a different comment, it&#x27;s clear that the photographer later found the whole series of pictures AFTER asking the question, and posted them online. So the photographer was confused, but later found the rest of his photos, which definitively show the plane LANDING. Case closed.')
