That the site may want more of my computer time to run their obfuscated code is really not as important to me as understanding how much of my processing time they are using. If they use very little, chance are they don&#x27;t know much about me. The more they use, the more they probably know.<p>Given most sites can render just fine without JavaScript, the easiest thing to do, if you care about these things, is install a plugin that disables JavaScript on all sites or just the ones you find abuse this right.<p>If there was a plugin that did this based on some type of community consensus (don&#x27;t run on this site vs. have to run on this site to see anything at all), I would surely use it.')
