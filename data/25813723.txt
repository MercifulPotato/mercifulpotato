I&#x27;d messed something up, out of their scope to fix (they could have just said nothing wrong with X). Instead some AWS engineer with my permission jumped in and got application side to fix things up and walk me through the configs etc.<p>What!! So I paid $50 for one month for support, and got a full on support expert who&#x27;d bill (at least in my world) $250+&#x2F;hr. Honestly, the support cost was maybe even LOWER, and I&#x27;d just signed up for support to submit my ticket.<p>Google does not care. You GSuite calendar is not accessible on google home devices etc etc despite TONS of requests from paying customers. That same calendar integrates easily with ALEXA from amazon. Huh? Someone is paying attention, and it&#x27;s not google.<p>I do like project based permission &#x2F; approach in GCP. I like a lot of other things there too. But I&#x27;ve had stuff running for years on AWS without issue - so the trust with AWS keeping things going mostly is there.')
