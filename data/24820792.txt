Which they link to, so I&#x27;m not saying anything new here.<p>But because of the two degrees of separation, it seems to have lost something. I suggest &quot;Sweden is tightening it&#x27;s light-lockdown strategy ... &quot; as a more accurate description.<p>I say this because I was confused. It&#x27;s titled &quot;no-lockdown strategy&quot;, but as the article points out, the end result of these new changes is not lockdown, so it would still be a &quot;no-lockdown strategy&quot; - using the Business Insider&#x27;s definition.<p>However, Sweden has had restrictions. Public events with 50 or more people were cancelled, many schools went to distance learning, and more. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se&#x2F;the-public-health-agency-of-sweden&#x2F;communicable-disease-control&#x2F;covid-19&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se&#x2F;the-public-health-agency...</a> for the FAQ in English, listing many of the restrictions.<p>For example, the BI article says:<p>&gt; It will give local authorities the power to strongly recommend people to avoid busy public places like shopping centers, museums, gyms, concerts, and sports matches. Swedes may also be asked to avoid public transport and contact with the elderly and vulnerable.<p>But we (I live in Sweden) have that already. School sports venues, for example, hosted games without audiences. The signs at the bus stops and train stations ask to avoid non-essential public transport. Places cap the number of people allowed.<p>The source article in The Telegraph is more accurate with &quot;It&#x27;s more of a lockdown situation - but a local lockdown&quot; as it acknowledges that there has been a lockdown, defined as a restriction in allowed activities.')
