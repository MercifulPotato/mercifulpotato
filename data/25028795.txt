It is difficult to make progress when rhetoric pretends that the other side does not have reasoned arguments, but is instead based on toxic masculinity&#x2F;sexism&#x2F;paternalism while the other side pretends that those who get abortions are just loose immoral women.<p>I see no end of this, and that is why I choose to think about actually constructive policies: e.g. free, prevalent, effective birth control for both men and women.')
