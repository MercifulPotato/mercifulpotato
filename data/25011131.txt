You can get situations where an identical position is paying a 30% difference, only some of it due to negotiation.<p>The result is the developers &quot;calibrate&quot; themselves, many work less and less until they feel the situation is &quot;fair.&quot; Many are working on their next startup, doing gigs, consulting, etc.<p>I find the technology industry to be a total mess as compared to management consulting (where I began my career.) There was some strangeness, but usually everything was in generally consistent bands. In comparison, my friends in big law describe a completely orderly situation.')
