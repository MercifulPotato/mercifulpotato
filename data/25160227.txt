This sense of the term is controversial, having divergent definitions both in popular culture and academia, and has also been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study.[1][2]:348â€“56 It is usually considered pejorative.&quot;<p>I am sure the Catholic church would object to being called a cult in the English speaking world, do realise that a different set of laws might apply to a cult as against a religion.')
