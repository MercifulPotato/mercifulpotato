Before that, the standard money system (at least in Europe &amp; Islamic territories) for the previous 2000 years was the combination of Gold and Silver with a fixed exchange rate. It ended up not being well suited to the beginning industrial civilization and was replaced by Gold+paper money around 1870. And then, when industrialized countries grew in number and in development, gold+paper was progressively abandoned in favor of paper-only money (the US were the last, but pretty much everybody had abandoned it after WWI and WWII).<p>The industrial civilization itself is also an historical anomaly, and if it ends, maybe gold (or gold + silver) will come back. But in that event, I&#x27;m not optimistic about bitcoin&#x27;s chances of survivalâ€¦')
