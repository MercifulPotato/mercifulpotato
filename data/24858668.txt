I just question that its influence necessarily was that of establishing democracy.<p>As for after 1848, I don&#x27;t think that Europe was much more democratic than before 1789 (except for France, and the second republic was kind of DOA anyway). More states did have a constitution (in comparison to 1789, not necessarily to before 1848), so there was maybe a little bit more protection against absolute tyranny, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that there was much effective parliamentary participation.<p>Although I will admit that the idea of liberalism was definitely in the air and maybe it wouldn&#x27;t have been without the French Revolution, but that&#x27;s hard to say (as said, the USA were always more of a poster child because their republic actually lasted).<p>I&#x27;m not sure if the revolutionary wars demonstrated the power of republicanism as much as they demonstrated the power of nationalism to someone like Bismarck, and nationalism is definitely something that was heavily influenced by the French Revolution.')
