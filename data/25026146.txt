One of the reasons we were successful with smallpox is there wasn&#x27;t an animal reservoir.  One virus + no animal reservoirs + good vaccine = can be successful.  Multiple known viruses and strains with multiple reservoirs and no good vaccines means this will not happen.<p>More to the point, this isn&#x27;t really what the paper was looking at all.  The actual (OA) publication[1] identified common and conserved areas which could potentially be used to study and target viruses throughout out the family.  This might help with human SARS-CoV2 therapeutics, but it&#x27;s main benefit is showing how molecular analyses will help fight future coronaviruses.<p>It does not ask or answer whether we can &quot;engineer a universal vaccine against the entire viral family&quot; nor did it &quot;[draw] up a scientific recipe to potentially end coronaviruses once and for all.&quot;<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;science.abe9403" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;scie...</a>')
