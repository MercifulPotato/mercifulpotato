The problem was that I would mis-ship items sometimes in a warehouse. I figured out that I couldn&#x27;t reliably read some of the product labels, so I went to go get an eye exam. Apparently I had 20&#x2F;100 vision in one eye due to astigmatism. Getting glasses meant that I quit fucking up, so they dropped the PIP and moved me into another part of the company.<p>I guess I&#x27;m the poster child for having vision insurance as a company benefit.')
