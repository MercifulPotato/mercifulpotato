Pricing that is difficult but I don’t think it should be disregarded.<p>What if I don&#x27;t want to use their &quot;software stack&quot;? Frankly, as developer, I&#x27;d rather spend my time developing than learning Apple specific ecosystem. Heck, React Native and Flutter do me just fine. Develop once and run everywhere.<p>In the end what does that $99&#x2F;year license get me? A fancy certificate to publish on their only app store?')
