I tend to use notepad and make notes along the way, so I can flesh it out into something reproducible later. If the idea doesn&#x27;t work, at least I have a text file of my process and thinking during that time.<p>If it does work, I find being able to scaffold your projects quickly is key. Build a script that creates a common set of folders and a new git repository. Things like (notes, source, libraries, docs, archives etc). From here, you can just add things to your git repository as you develop&#x2F;test&#x2F;build your idea. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a project that involves code, as you can manage any files from a git repository. They key is having that scaffolding.')
