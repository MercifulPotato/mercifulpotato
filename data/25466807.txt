Now on Facebook my ads are 50% HIV&#x2F;AIDS medications.<p>I bought a soundbar at Best Buy, so the other 50% of the ads are bizarre Best Buy soundbars, primarily the <i>exactly model I already bought</i>. To make it doubly detrimental for Best Buy, I occasionally click the ad to see if the price has changed.<p>The myth about the useful, relevant ads seems like it doesn&#x27;t share a lot with reality. While my example is an anecdote, can anyone seriously saying that ads have actually been useful or relevant? When I&#x27;m not blocking them they seem to overwhelmingly be things I&#x27;ve already bought and services I already use.<p>The ad industry seems to be overwhelmingly a lie that we&#x27;ve all bought into. The personalized ad industry seems like a grotesque abuse under a promise that it never actually delivers.')
