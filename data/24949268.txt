And it&#x27;s not entirely the fault of engineers... or so I like to think, to excuse myself :P<p>What worries me a lot is that I find myself being one of those people, not being able to fully help my situation.<p>It&#x27;s just... too much. It seems like every few months a new thing pops up and everyone suddenly wants to adopt it. And even if you try and resist it because <i>it&#x27;s not necessary</i>, someone from above (e.g. CTO) will decide that the whole org has to adopt that and now you&#x27;re screwed.<p>In a typical backend application you have to deal with:<p>- Application framework<p>- Testing framework<p>- Logging framework<p>- Metrics framework<p>- Tracing<p>- Visualization tool(s) for the three things above<p>- CI<p>Which is already quite a bit, but obviously manageable and you could get pretty knowledgeable on all of that <i>if they stay static</i>.<p>But hey, now your org has to expose every service on gRPC. Ok, one more thing to tack onto your app...<p>Now everyone has to expose GraphQL endpoints too!<p>Oh and next month we&#x27;re migrating to a new metrics solution. Because. Great, let&#x27;s throw away all the knowledge built on the old one and scramble to migrate to the new things we don&#x27;t have time to learn fully.<p>Alright, now let&#x27;s start writing new services in this new language.<p>And now everyone has to throw events on this new message bus thing that some team over there built using Kafka!<p>Finally, let&#x27;s move everything off of AWS managed services and onto Kubernetes! Yay!<p>All of that can easily happen within the span of 2-3 years. And in the meantime you have to deal with on-call rotations, customer issues, implementing new features... and if you&#x27;re a senior dev you&#x27;re also busy mentoring folks, going to meetings with other teams, etc etc.<p>You know what I&#x27;m talking about, right? Over time, I feel like it&#x27;s becoming impossible to achieve mastery of anything. There are way too many things to learn to be able to make sense of the whole, and no time to do deep dives on all of them. And then there&#x27;s all the <i>new</i> stuff that keeps being adopted.<p>And then things blow up and they&#x27;re freaking mysterious and when you finally find out what it was, you realize you&#x27;d only have been able to catch that problem beforehand if you&#x27;d read the freaking source code for some library you adopted.<p>It&#x27;s madness. It&#x27;s pure hell.<p>Boy I miss working on low level code.<p>End rant.')
