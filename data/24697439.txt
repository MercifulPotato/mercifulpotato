Item(by='jacobr1', descendants=None, kids=[24698742], score=None, time=1601990982, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24697000, text='Right, most T1 support is using a template or script anyway. If I was building a better chat-support system, I&#x27;d create some sort of score that predicted the likelihood a generated answer was relevant to the question asked. If the score was low enough, present the question to a human instead. The redirection to a human could even be transparent to the user. And once the human answered the question, they wouldn&#x27;t need to update a knowledgebase or a template, it could just be learned by the system. This could enable a lot of efficiency, and I don&#x27;t think it would hurt the level of support a user is receiving, even if only because the current human-based support is so often just the human choosing which canned-response to use anyway. Replacing T2 or T3 support is not imminent.')
