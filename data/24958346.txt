Why are you so opposed to it?<p>&gt; How about looking at emissions per square kilometer as a target<p>So, Canada (Population 38 million) should get to pollute three times more, in absolute values than India (Population 1.35 billion), because it has three times the land area?<p>&gt; Country borders mean nothing to the planet in ecological terms.<p>Country borders don&#x27;t mean anything to the planet, but they mean everything to how we must solve this problem.<p>People need energy to live.<p>The world has a limited carbon budget.<p>Distributing it equally, per capita is the least you can do to be fair about it. (In order to actually be fair about it, you must also count historic emissions, which means that the western world has long blown its share of that budget.)')
