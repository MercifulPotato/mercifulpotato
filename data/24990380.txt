Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604506871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24983712, text='Maybe things have progressed in the intervening years, but I found dune&#x2F;jbuilder to be complicated and poorly documented. I&#x27;ve forgotten many of the issues I had with it, but IIRC there were a couple of different configuration formats (S-expressions and something else?) and the examples online never worked out of the box.<p>As for foundational libraries, I agree that there were too many choices, but IMO fragmentation in the standard library is a bad thing (you need to know how to interop between them as you integrate third party libraries that use different standard libraries). Never mind the confusion that creates for newbies.<p>Moreover, for newbies, getting editor integration working well, understanding the unfamiliar (to put it nicely) syntax, and a myriad of other challenges without good documentation are other significant obstacles.<p>These are pretty significant downsides, and as much as I like the upside of a nice type system, I don&#x27;t need it to build a product, but I <i>need</i> good tooling and a good ecosystem and a healthy supply of developers. I can ship a product with Go or Python (languages with impoverished type systems)--there might be more bugs but finding and fixing bugs is manageable--but OCaml presents <i>significant</i> challenges.')
