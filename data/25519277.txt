It&#x27;s just a Zen 2 IO die backported to GlobalFoundries 14nm. Presumably they were able to remove the unnecessary parts (memory controller) while backporting, but maybe they&#x27;re reusing excess chips if they chose late in the process to move the IO die to 12nm. I&#x27;d guess there&#x27;s some inefficiency from being a clever hack and not exactly designed for purpose.<p>Additionally, the X570 chipset supports a <i>lot</i> of peripherals:<p>- 16x PCIe 4.0 lanes + 4x lanes to the CPU\n - 12 SATA 3 ports (some PHYs are shared with PCIe lanes so you can&#x27;t have all of both)\n - 8 USB 3.0 10Gbps (I&#x27;m not going to google the &quot;official&quot; nomenclature, ugh)\n - 4 USB 2.0\n - Other things like SuperIO and SMBus which don&#x27;t use much power<p>Far more peripherals than M1. (Probably, it seems there&#x27;s still no detailed specs about the thing anywhere).<p>Then there&#x27;s the process advantage, 14nm GF to 5nm TSMC is a huge difference for all the logic involved. The advantage is dampened somewhat for IO because a significant portion of the power is used to drive the signals out of the chip, which is not affected by process changes. Apple&#x27;s PCIe 4.0 PHYs may be more efficient considering X570 is a first generation PCIe 4.0 design.<p>Also, the power consumption of X570 is not that bad for what it is, 7-10W [0]. AMD must be a stickler about the 15W TDP because the fan seems unnecessary. This article is basically the worst case scenario: small heatsink on a cramped ITX motherboard in a passive case with no airflow. Maybe BCLK overclocking would run the fan? Or a dust clogged no-airflow case in a hot climate running all the peripherals at full bore?<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexus.net&#x2F;media&#x2F;uploaded&#x2F;2019&#x2F;7&#x2F;b3affde4-8a75-4475-b186-fbc3bbeaca65.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexus.net&#x2F;media&#x2F;uploaded&#x2F;2019&#x2F;7&#x2F;b3affde4-8a75-4475-b...</a>')
