Is the memory model essentially a middle ground between GC-based and manual memory management?:<p>&gt; Scope-based memory management (destructors are injected after the scope) - generally reduces RAM usage of the programs and improves performance.<p>How does Nim handle references? How similar is this to Rust&#x27;s lifetimes GC-ed instead of manually managed?<p>Is this essentially like Rust, with the main difference that lifetimes (references) are handled via reference counting?<p>&gt; Shared heap - different threads have access to the same memory and you donâ€™t need to copy variables to pass them between threads - you can instead move them<p>I think this is the same as Rust thread move semantics?')
