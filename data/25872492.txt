I basically had to do a rewrite of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ServiceStack&#x2F;Gistlyn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ServiceStack&#x2F;Gistlyn</a> which did something similar but was tied to .NET Framework and used App Domains which aren&#x27;t available in the x-plat .NET 5.0 so as part of the redesign &amp; rewrite to use separate processes it was easy to extend to add support for multiple other languages.<p>&gt; Certainly motivated me to click through to learn more about ServiceStack&#x27;s products<p>Awesome!')
