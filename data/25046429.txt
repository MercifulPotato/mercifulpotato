We are taught a lot of things about Americans which turn out not to be true, that you learn history via movies is one of these things that gets said now and again.<p>I was chatting to someone the other day and asked if she&#x27;d been to America. No, she said, I can&#x27;t stand Americans.<p>Do you know any Americans, I asked. Of course she didn&#x27;t but she has been to Canada and asked if I had.<p>No, said I, I can&#x27;t stand Canadians.
