If they are posting on HN asking for help, saying &quot;I&#x27;m just able to do it naturally, why don&#x27;t you try that?&quot; isn&#x27;t really helpful.<p>We&#x27;ve built a society where being distracted by mindless consumption is by far the easiest path through life.  Some people need help getting out of that swamp, and the way to help is not to say, &quot;don&#x27;t bother&quot;.')
