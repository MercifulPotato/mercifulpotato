Local delivery and drayage routes have ample time to charge.<p>Honestly one of the bigger issues is upgrading the electrical service at the depots to support the chargers. I worked on a prototype EV truck, and they had to software-limit the charger when first installed, because running flat-out it could draw more power than the entire rest of the prototype facility. They had to get the utility out to drop a new transformer before they could unleash the charger&#x27;s full power.<p>The power you buy in a few gallons of diesel fuel is simply staggering.')
