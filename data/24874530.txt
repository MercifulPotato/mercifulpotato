It&#x27;s just too far, too expensive and too uncomfortable.<p>There is definitely motivation. <i>Some</i> people want to colonise Mars. Not everybody, but likely enough people to make it happen. Elon Musk wants to make it happen, and while there is no guarantee he&#x27;ll get his wish, I think he has a decent chance of succeeding.<p>And establishing a permanent base on the Moon probably falls into a similar category. Moon has certain attractions over Mars – e.g. much more feasible target for space tourism, as a near-Earth testbed for developing technologies that may then be deployed to more distant parts of the solar system.<p>If the US (or a US-led multinational consortium excluding China) establishes a permanent base on the Moon and on Mars, that would increase the likelihood that China would do it too, in order to prove themselves equal to the US. (In principle other countries might feel the same urge, but China is possibly the only country who feels that urge strongly enough, and has sufficient resources, to actually pull it off; the US policy of excluding China from space ventures also gives China a motivation that does not apply to many other countries with which the US is willing to cooperate.)<p>Whether there is a &quot;need&quot; – the boundary between &quot;wants&quot; and &quot;needs&quot; is a value judgement. People who want to colonise Mars likely have different values from people like you who don&#x27;t see it as worthwhile.')
