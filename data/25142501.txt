It&#x27;s just reconciliating virtual dom trees that are explicitly built by my code. Vue hooks into all data objects, to react to mutation. Vue includes a whole templating language, that have control structures in addition to JSX features (v-if, v-for, ...). Vue is supposed to be used in .vue files, that are a unique way to organize code, and is going to require special support for your editor, linters, and other tools.<p>&gt; The html&#x2F;css and JS are separate while in React everything is in JS.<p>My HTML is at the bottom of my my JSX file, in the render() method I keep at the bottom. My CSS is in CSS files. In Vue, the correct way seems to be using the &lt;template&gt; and &lt;style&gt; sections of the .vue file. Is that more separate?<p>I have nothing against Vue per se, and opinionated frameworks have their merits, but do Vue developers agree with the author&#x27;s stance?')
