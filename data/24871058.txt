If they were vague, he would exploit any ambiguity in the instructions against them - like &quot;rub the knife on the bread&quot; before it had any peanut butter on it :)<p>The military knows how to do this - and has a strong reason to. If your documentation cannot survive the death or resignation of the man, team or department that wrote it, you can&#x27;t build generational knowledge. Look up the mil spec for chocolate cake (skips my mind where it is in my library) for example.')
