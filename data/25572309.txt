Item(by='subsubzero', descendants=None, kids=[25572477], score=None, time=1609263426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25571202, text='I agree with all these points, but I think one point not being made is alot of pay in the trades is alot higher than some people think(in higher paying metro areas). Alot of people in my Wife&#x27;s family are either electricians, or building engineers&#x2F;heavy machine owner&#x2F;operators. And they all are doing fine. Here are some examples of rough pay(all are unions jobs and dues are due):<p>- Owner&#x2F;operator of heavy construction equipment typically makes $175 an hour or more(maintenance costs are high and work dispatch takes a cut also) yearly salary was usually ~ $150k<p>- Electricians make between $47-55 an hour, this does not include overtime as my Wife&#x27;s cousin made 40-50% more due to OT.<p>- Building engineers pay varies, but a good amount pay $80-90k+.<p>All salaries are SF bay area, almost everyone mentioned owns their own home. Ages range from low 60&#x27;s to early 40&#x27;s. One important point that differs from the Simpsons is that every person mentioned(all are married) the spouse works and also makes a similar salary(no one has more than 2 kids also). So a Simpsons existence is very hard to emulate, but the &quot;trades&quot; pay more than alot of people expect.')
