And those are unstable minute by minute. To report the weather, you need a moving weather map.<p>By contrast climate is &quot;simple&quot; in that it can have fewer variables. The most basic climate model is literally zero-dimensional: it treats the earth as a homogeneous gas mixture and that&#x27;s it. It can be reported in a single variable, the temperature.<p>The zero-dimensional model won&#x27;t tell you all of the things that happen: some places get more rain, some less, some even get cooler. There are more complicated models that do that, and to make specific policy recommendations you need those. But there is a crucial discussion that comes from that single number: yes, the world is getting warmer, because of humans turning carbon in the ground into CO2 in the atmosphere, and it&#x27;s bad enough that action needs to be taken.<p>The model is still unstable, but much more tightly constrained, to within a fraction of a degree C per year. That&#x27;s because the atmosphere is so large, and the sheer mass of it means it has to change slowly, but predictably. Over very long scales (tens of thousands of years) additional factors create more instability, but they&#x27;re not pressing problems the way highly predictable century-scale changes are.')
