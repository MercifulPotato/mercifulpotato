Some issues may arise for devices with sensors like cameras that could be abused.<p>I have 3 robot vacuums (one is technically a mop). Two are internet connected, one is not. The two internet connected ones are kept up-to-date and get new capabilities from time to time. And one of these is also accessible from the local network too. This is great. At least I know that, should the company decide to support the product, I&#x27;ll retain some of the capabilities.<p>Which is something that happened to my Pebble. The community did step in and provide some missing functionality, but it wasn&#x27;t a seamless transition.<p>The biggest issue is the amount of e-waste we are creating by having - otherwise perfectly functional devices - being thrown away because their command and control servers were shutdown.<p>There should be some mandate that companies are required to support the internet connected product for X number of years, just like cars. If they go out of business they should be required to release the control software.')
