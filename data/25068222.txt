Nice and shy, might not know what to say in a first date, can seem a bit boring at first, and also just doesn&#x27;t have a big social circle to meet other people.<p>I feel online dating gave them a chance to meet some other people, pre-meet prior to first date, and than go on a first date, which they&#x27;d otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have been able too. Either from never meeting the person in the first place, never asking to go out on a date, or messing up that date.<p>That&#x27;s all my personal analysis though, like I have no data here appart from a few people I know and my interpretation.')
