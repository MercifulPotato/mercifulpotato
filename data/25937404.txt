Since most users who aren&#x27;t paying are also not making great games, Unity&#x27;s name and reputation is now attached to solely those bad games.<p>Similarly with the generated images, adding a watermark to (some of the) free ones will mean that the images you have your name on are the ones that are being generated by users who aren&#x27;t paying; either because they&#x27;re not making enough to justify it, or they&#x27;re making bad content that you don&#x27;t really want to be the main thing with your name on it out there.')
