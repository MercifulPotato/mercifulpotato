The law should not take into account ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender(sex), nor any other of the innumerable inborn qualities that make you and I who we are - distinct and diverse by no fault of our own. Neither should hate speech be illegal, just for being directed at some(any really) grouping or peoples. Direct calls for violence against persons, yes, calls for lynching, fire in a theatre yes possibly.<p>Of course, I am a hypocrite. I would be in favour of these types of laws as mentioned in the article if they were for protecting the groups to which I belong; that those who criticize in unkind words, hatefully, men of my own ethnicity be silenced. Who does not want to see their opponents dragged away in handcuffs, their name blasted in media as a hate criminal, life ruined?<p>But I would rather see absolute free speech, guaranteed by law and general social acceptance.<p>One set of rules for thee, and another for me.')
