I, personally, hate driving in any place that&#x27;s &quot;downtown&quot; by any measure. It&#x27;s stressful, slow, the streets are never laid out in a sane way, etc. Kansas City, MO has a streetcar that runs north-south through a lot of the downtown area so that I can park in what city-dwellers assure me is &quot;not downtown&quot; right next to the northmost stop, then ride the streetcar to all of the attractions that are in the main night life district.<p>It definitely takes ~10-15 mins longer than if I just drove, but goodness it&#x27;s just so much more enjoyable. I get to sit and look around at the city I&#x27;m in instead of focusing on driving.<p>I&#x27;ve dragged quite a few friends and family along and most people don&#x27;t like it because:\n1. it takes longer (have to wait for transport to arrive, it makes stops you don&#x27;t need)\n2. &quot;iffy people&quot; are on the streetcar<p>I laugh a bit at #2 because compared to almost any other non-car transport in the US I&#x27;ve ever seen, the occupants of the streetcar are just comically gentrified. Yeah there&#x27;s one guy who&#x27;s probably homeless, but everyone else is clearly out for a business dinner or a bunch of yuppies all dressed up to take the family out to dinner, and so on.<p>Thanks for bearing through me with this anecdote. But I hope it demonstrates two issues:\n1. americans will put up with a lot if it makes their trip any amount shorter\n2. americans vastly prefer to be annoyed and in control, versus less annoyed but not in control. e.g. they prefer car traffic where they&#x27;re &quot;in control&quot; (can honk&#x2F;drive aggressively?) vs waiting for public transport to arrive or waiting at stops they don&#x27;t need\n3. americans associate public transport with lower classes, the poor and homeless.<p>It&#x27;ll take a lot of work to flip these around.')
