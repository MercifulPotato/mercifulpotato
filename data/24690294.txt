Over a half a dozen times in the last 20 years, rich people needed trillions of free dollars or the world ends. I don&#x27;t blame them. We only have ourselves to blame. Too violent, too apathetic, just can&#x27;t do the job. Stupid, evil, lazy all leads to the same place. If you can&#x27;t get through the existing market yourself you don&#x27;t get to tell other people what to do.<p>Puts history in a different light. Power looses, throws a fit and crashes markets and starts wars, making life miserable for everyone until they are back in power. The only way out of is a vaccine.
