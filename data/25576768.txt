Lots of disagreement on what type of donut: Some say a coffee roll, while others dispute coffee rolls as properly belonging to the &quot;donut&quot; category. Most have settled on the traditional shape of round w&#x2F; a hole, though a small number have claimed that&#x27;s a misinterpretation, and in fact it&#x27;s the inverse of that, it&#x27;s the middle part of the donut. This is the munchkin faction.')
