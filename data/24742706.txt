My first job out of college was in embedded systems, and I&#x27;ve spent most of my career there.  I never had to figure out how to switch into it.<p>I&#x27;m sure there must be some leet-code-ish thing that gives embedded puzzles, about writing to hardware registers, and bit flipping, and race conditions between threads.  But I don&#x27;t know where it is, so I can&#x27;t point you to anything.<p>If you want to get better at C++, you might start with Stroustrup&#x27;s <i>Tour</i>.  For C, I don&#x27;t know what to say.  You might also consider Rust, though I don&#x27;t know if it has much traction in embedded yet.')
