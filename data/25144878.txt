Regulation requires certifications that cost upwards of $100K first time, $10K with each release, just in fees.</i><p>Seems to me like this could be overcome by licencing but not in the general sense but more in a you need accreditation, join this other pool of people utilizing the system and buy an accreditation licence. Seems like there would still be a value proposition there.<p>As for the 3rd party seems that could be hit or miss again if it is money, build those out as modules that cover the licence fees the third party is looking to recoup. Maybe with a little bone in it for the open source developers as well.')
