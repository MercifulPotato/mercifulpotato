It comes off the truck and goes onto the shelves. The backroom  is too small (compared to the size of the store) to have spares of everything on pallets that are moved to the shelves as needed. This is by design - spares in the backroom are excess inventory  which needs to be paid for.  I&#x27;m sure there exceptions for a few things that sell in large numbers and take up a lot of space (bulk packs of toilet paper for example, keep them on a high shelf and move a few down as needed), but for the most part WalMart is against inventory.<p>WalMart already knows how much of something they have because they get everything scanned at the register.  Sure there is a hour delay between it leaving the shelf and it being subtracted from inventory, but they need more than an hours worth on inventory on the shelf anyway because it takes time to load a truck with whatever they need more of. Shoplifting is a problem that mucks with this (I could actually see this being a useful help to that problem, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is useful enough)')
