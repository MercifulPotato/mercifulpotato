Ofc forum with _huge_ community will move fast too, but often things are divided into subforums, so it at least attempts to prevent that<p>So, when it comes to an actual, long arguing instead of upvotes wars then forums are still unparalleled.<p>Also having mentally stable moderators that have strong merits and community that understands fallacies helps a lot.')
