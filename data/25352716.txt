Thanks for the follow up.<p>Yeah, I&#x27;d happily pay for a privacy preserving mapping app as well. While building this, I felt the need for such a service, and as I pondered it, I felt overwhelmed by the effort to bring such a thing to market. It would also need a significant amount of notoriety to get people to contribute by updating business and city information. The other challenge is that Google Maps is just SO GOOD! I realize it&#x27;s not great for privacy reasons, but it&#x27;s simply so easy to use and useful. That&#x27;s a high threshold of quality and functionality for a new entrant in the mapping space to achieve. That&#x27;s not even taking into consideration that this new entrant would be charging for something that Google gives away for free, and has had years to perfect. We can see an example of this struggle with Apple Maps.<p>&gt; <i>send someone a link that gives them time-bounded access to a subset of location information (most commonly live information about current location).</i><p>You might be happy to know that that functionality is already present in the app. :-) Simply click the floating action button at the bottom right of the main screen of the app, and a timed sharing dialog will appear. Toggle the switch to turn it on, and your location will be broadcasted to a drop box that can only be accessed by the key encoded in a URL that you can copy or share to any app (Signal or otherwise). You can adjust the expiration time of the link based as well. It&#x27;s particularly useful if you&#x27;re running late to a meeting and you&#x27;re stuck in traffic, and you want to let the person you&#x27;re meeting know where you are in real time.')
