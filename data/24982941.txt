Even github built actions might be under an individual’s account. So it takes quite a bit of effort to check out an action to see if it’s safe or dangerous.<p>And I worry about actions a little more because they do things like copy files, deploy systems, and other things where I wouldn’t want rogue code interjecting malware.<p>Currently I require all actions to be hosted in the org so devs have forked actions into our org. That at least makes a developer vouch for a particular version and makes it harder for an update to that action to break something.<p>I think they need an equivalent of “gold actions” endorsed by GitHub. Or a vetted repo like pypi or cran or something else that actually has some controls around versions and changes.')
