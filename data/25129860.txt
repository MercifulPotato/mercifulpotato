I will&#x2F;have passed these shares on to my children each now having a framed physical share on their bedroom wall as I did as a child.<p>For me, these shares have as much sentimental value as actual value. I would never part with them but I guess I will see what my kids want to do with them when they are older. If this past 10 year trajectory were to hold, they will be able to attend college debt free thanks to Uncle Walt. It is a great lesson in the value of reinvesting dividends in long term stock. That, and I guess a bit of magic.')
