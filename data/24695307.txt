I don&#x27;t know anything about how medicine is practiced elsewhere, but it seems &#x27;western&#x27; medicine is rapidly approaching a horizon where a single doctor is woefully inadequate to handle treatment of anything even remotely approximating chronic illness in a single patient.<p>I saw this far to closely and personally for a little over two years.  I went to a very dark place for some time but ultimately decided that the healthiest attitude for me to take was that doctors are simply overwhelmed with information and overpowered with the risk of career ending litigation.  I pray that I never have to go down that road again, but if I do there&#x27;s going to be an extremely frank conversation up front and the doctors will have a choice if they want to ride shotgun or not.')
