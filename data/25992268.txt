A well-heeled, very well-connected ex-Saudi intelligence officer and nephew of an Iran-Contra arms dealer was assassinated by a dictator after founding an anti-regime organization overseas and being funded by unknown sources. When you say it like that, it sounds a little different than the usual narrative of the Washington Post columnist murdered for his column - if anything, I would like to know why western media is hiring foreign intelligence officers.')
