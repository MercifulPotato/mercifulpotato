I have code to control lights via a browser application and finally will be able to release this!<p>Also NFC support is huge - I can imagine all kinds of neat activation features for a website.   Imagine sending a flyer in the mail with an NFC chip built in and then having a webpage verify based on this...  Lot of really neat IOT apps that can be created with this feature...<p>BLE is amazing and I really wish we had the query permissions API... since that would allow for heart monitors and other permeant native app like experiences...')
