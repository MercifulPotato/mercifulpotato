The smaller antennas of the DSN can communicate with the relay satellites as well.<p>Furthermore, the locations of the stations aren&#x27;t determined by the hemispheres. Everything DSN is used for is far enough away from Earth that it doesn&#x27;t matter if the antenna is in the northern or southern hemisphere. The reason for the spread-out stations is the rotation of the Earth, which for half of the day puts the Earth in between the station and the satellite.')
