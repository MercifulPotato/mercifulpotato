Trump was suspended when he incited a mob to march to the capitol and &quot;fight&quot; to &quot;stop&quot; a joint session of congress, who then invaded and sacked the seat of government of the United States.<p>Later, <i>after</i> all this, he posted (for the very first time ever!) that he&#x27;d accept the results of the election.  So... that&#x27;s good.  But it&#x27;s not why he was banned.')
