Pornhub had videos of teenagers getting raped for months and never took them down until they got back-lashed by social media for it. Is Pornhub still up? Yup. Has anyone been punished for hosting this stuff? Nope. The only way to bring down companies like these without waiting for a grand societal paradigm-shift is to act outside the law unfortunately, because people don&#x27;t care enough, that&#x27;s just the sad reality.<p>I&#x27;m willing to bet that most of the people that are criticizing you for wanting to date an 18 yo have probably pumped and dumped many girls in their lives themselves. They probably consume porn as well and might have accidentally fapped to rape footage, who knows.<p>I think you&#x27;re by no means a saint, but they&#x27;re certainly not better than you. And expressions such as &quot;thauts illigul&quot; don&#x27;t really say anything about the moral value of your actions.')
