Even if the &quot;all-way&quot; addendum was displayed below every stop sign without fail, the semantics of those two stop signs are so different as to warrant a different color and shape; if you mistake a &quot;stop[just you]&quot; for a &quot;stop[all way]&quot; then it&#x27;s a really dangerous situation. It&#x27;s easy to fail to spot the difference with a quick glance.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to see statistics on how many people die at these intersections, I suspect this is one of the needlessly dangerous aspects of driving in cities.')
