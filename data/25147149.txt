So you&#x27;re reading this text that you almost need a translation of that itself is a dated translation.<p>This isn&#x27;t the fault of Standard Ebooks, but it&#x27;s an elephant in the room of public domain texts in general. In many ways I&#x27;d rather see effort put into crowdsourced or volunteer modern translation than into improved copyediting.<p>It&#x27;s especially problematic if you consider that the original text in the foreign language isn&#x27;t available as well, as you&#x27;re noting.')
