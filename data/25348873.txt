Malware commonly used IRC for this until that started getting blocked on most networks, but imagine how easy it would be to miss, say, a bot which connects on 443 to a major hosting provider, like half the apps you run, searches Google.com, Twitter, etc., or hits an ad network for a keyword selected by the attacker.<p>In every case, once they get the server(s) to connect to you lose all further visibility unless you’re blocking 443 and forcing traffic through an inspection proxy.')
