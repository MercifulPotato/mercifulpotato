The bible story about Adam &amp; Eve is somewhat significant to highlight the cause of eating the forbidden fruit resulting in the effect of original sin but fails to highlight God being the cause for such a forbidden fruit existing in the first place; or one could even argue God being the cause for giving them free will.<p>Anyway from the foregoing, it makes sense scientists can benefit from looking at historical events, stories, and traditions for improving perception. I don&#x27;t know why people get shamed or embarrassed about reading things like magic or alchemy as an example. Science likely benefits from creativity and what&#x27;s more creative than imagination or unrealistic topics.<p>Another source related to the topic: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpost.com&#x2F;israel-news&#x2F;newtons-temple-596350" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpost.com&#x2F;israel-news&#x2F;newtons-temple-596350</a><p>&quot;My Dear Yahuda,\nNewton’s writings on biblical subjects seem to me especially interesting because they provide deep insight into the characteristic intellectual features and working methods of this important man. The divine origin of the Bible is for Newton absolutely certain, a conviction that stands in curious contrast to the critical skepticism that characterizes his attitude toward the churches. From this confidence stems the firm conviction that the seemingly obscure parts of the Bible must contain important revelations, to illuminate which one need only decipher its symbolic language. Newton seeks this decipherment, or interpretation, by means of his sharp systematic thinking grounded on the careful use of all the sources at his disposal.\nWhile the formative development of Newton’s lasting physics works must remain shrouded in darkness, because Newton apparently destroyed his preparatory works, we do have in this domain of his works on the Bible drafts and their repeated modification; these mostly unpublished writings therefore allow a highly interesting insight into the mental workshop of this unique thinker.<p>- Einstein.
