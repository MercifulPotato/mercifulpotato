Her job was to anticipate how people might react to her, and to use that skill to show her clients in the best light.<p>It&#x27;s not too much of a stretch for any of us to think &quot;would I get fired if my manager saw this tweet in a bad light?&quot; and then NOT TWEET if you thought &quot;yes&quot;.  There&#x27;s only so much you can blame ThE mOB for.')
