Because the answer is going to be pretty different about how to get into, say, systems engineering or project management.<p>If you are good enough at software engineering to do a generic software engineering job, then I suggest applying to one of those in the standard way. It is much easier to get into all of those areas once you have some software engineering experience.<p>If you are not good enough to get a different job right now that would satisfy you, then I suggest talking to your current employer about moving your responsibilities in a different direction.')
