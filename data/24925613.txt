If we dropped to zero emissions overnight, we&#x27;ve likely already put so much carbon into the atmosphere that we need active removal measures to draw it back down quickly and reduce the consequences.<p>On the other hand, if we develop kick-ass capture solutions tomorrow but keep emitting at our current rate (or increased), the two will compete head-to-head and unless the capture method vastly outweighs the emissions, we&#x27;re still on an increasing or (at best) steady-state situation with carbon in the atmosphere, neither of which give good outcomes.<p>If you made a massive advancement in either field you would perhaps be able to forego the other. But on the more probable path of gradual progress, tackling both is best.<p>I&#x27;m talking about all forms of carbon capture here BTW, not just direct. My personal opinion is that valid methods of re-sequestering atmospheric CO2 already exist and could be applied. However since there&#x27;s money to be made in hawking tech-based solutions these are quietly sidelined in favour of new and sexy and (to the salesmen) profitable.')
