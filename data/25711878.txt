There are no reasons why one should not produce a good design in a any language. In the end it&#x27;s a &quot;people problem&quot; most of the time.<p>&gt; Personally I don’t find go easy to read: the noise of the “mechanics” of the implementation gets in the way of the intent behind the code in my opinion<p>I&#x27;d add another dimension: reading go is slower than reading Rust, but it&#x27;s easy. Rust may be faster to read, but you can hit some very rough patch and serious head scratchers.<p>It&#x27;s all a trade-off at the end of the day.')
