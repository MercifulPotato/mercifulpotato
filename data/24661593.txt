I mean, privacy is good, sure, I agree with that much.  But it&#x27;s trying to pin too much on one concept.  For example, this is a big part of the thesis:<p>&gt; A clear example of the loss of privacy is the rise of violent rethoric.<p>And I think that&#x27;s pretty clearly disproved by the fact that violent rhetoric is almost always deployed in closed, &quot;private&quot; communities.  The more closed, the more violent (c.f. stormfront, 8chan, the occasional private facebook group) and the more public, the more moderated and reasonable[1] (c.f. here, or reddit, or twitter).<p>I can see an argument that the lack of privacy exacerbates differences.  But it also cloisters extremism.  And the essay needs to at least acknowledge that.<p>[1] Or at least &quot;nonviolently unreasonable&quot;.')
