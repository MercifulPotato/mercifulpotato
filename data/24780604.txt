They did not say something that is untrue. They said &quot;starting at $699&quot;, which is technically true. They should have been more forthcoming, and said &quot;when bought for carriers...&quot; (which they did in small print), the absence of which was solidly misleading. But they did not &quot;fib&quot; or &quot;lie&quot;, both of which mean an untrue statement.<p>The problem that U.S. media has been having is that President Trump probably does not know the real answer to most of the untruths he says... he seems to say them without knowing the truth either way, and does not seem to care. Pretending to know something probably counts as a lie (it certainly should from the President of the U.S.A.), but the mainstream media has been uncertain of how to treat that. But it is an obviously different situation than with Apple telling people the prices they themselves set.')
