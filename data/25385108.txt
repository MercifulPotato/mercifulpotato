Most muggings will be crimes of opportunity.<p>I used to live in a very dodgy part of Spain near Gibraltar. I was never mugged or beaten up. I&#x27;ve been told by people &quot;You look like you can handle yourself&quot;. Some of work collegues which were skinner, more fresh faced got robbed, beaten and in one case had what they believe to be a gun pulled on them. I never had any problems. I don&#x27;t look like an easy target due to my appearence and size, those guys unfortunately do due to their size and appearence.')
