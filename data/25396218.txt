Amazon doesn&#x27;t charge extra for that (last I looked anyway), so that&#x27;s a potential advantage.<p>IPv6 penetration is growing, but Akamai reports that even the most IPv6 networks only go to ~ 92% IPv6. So if you want to have full reach, you need IPv4, but you don&#x27;t really need IPv6 (although, you may want it, some of the CGNAT systems that users are behind are pretty bad, avoiding that is nice)')
