I&#x27;ve never seen it say any other number.</i><p>I’m uploading a couple of 50–100m videos each week, and a lot of the time it stops off briefly at 95%, 99% or both before reaching 100%. (Also, “100% processed” comes before “finished processing” or “SD processed, processing HD”.) I’ve never seen it go back down, only ever upwards.')
