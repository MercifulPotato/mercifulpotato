They banned investigators from outside the country and tried to cover everything up. Experts knew they&#x27;d lied previously about SARS, but rather than assuming the worst they more or less assumed it probably wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal.<p>* The FDA <i>completely</i> dropped the ball on testing kits and it took an incredibly long time to resolve the issue. Its unclear that people in power even realized this. Back in January and February when we were hearing about a case here, a case there there was almost certainly rampant community transmission and death occurring.<p>* CDC leaders were very slow to consider that the virus might transmit through the air. This led to the early advice being misguided (6ft of distancing and washing your hands protects you) and just flat out wrong (wearing a mask does nothing).<p>* Inside the executive branch, people who gave bad news were forced out and people who gave good news got promoted. Predictably this made things much, much worse.')
