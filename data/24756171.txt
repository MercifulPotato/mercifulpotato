If they are facing an opponent like that then call in the FBI, who generally have much better training, or ATF (no idea about their training).<p>I disagree with this. The police should have automatic weapons so they are able to overpower criminals and protect themselves in dangerous situations. I want my police department to be effective and safe. It is also important that they have non-lethal equipment to de-escalate situations safely when possible.<p>As for APCs - if it is available as a surplus piece of equipment, why shouldn&#x27;t they have it? It isn&#x27;t something they use everyday. There aren&#x27;t police departments using heavy gas guzzling APCs for daily patrol. They use it for rare situations like riots and shootouts.<p>Your statement about the FBI and ATF doesn&#x27;t make sense to me and makes me think you aren&#x27;t aware of what those agencies actually do.')
