Isn’t inflation very close to zero?<p>Others say they are sick of talking about BTC price and would rather focus on its utility.  This makes sense, but for the same reason above it cannot happen since on a basket of goods basis BTC is deflationary.  Your options if you hold it are to buy something with it today or to hold onto it for a short period of time and buy 2 things with it later.<p>If BTC is actually viable as a currency, shouldn’t the goal be to get it to some kind of CPI stability?')
