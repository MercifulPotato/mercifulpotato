I learned programming mostly on my own, and by studying the for the interview, I learned so much about software engineering. In the end, that process of learning for the interview is very similar to the processing of learning on your day to day job and solve problems. Some of the answers to those problems might be quite obvious to a seasoned engineer or someone with a solid CS background, but I felt that being able to solve those problems puts me on par with those with more experience and CS background. I am currently at FANNG and doing as well as the other people on the team. If the interview process is all about the past experience, I would not stand a chance to get to where I am today.')
