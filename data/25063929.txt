One of them is strong quotas. We plan on having it in the near future (we are also running a service, EteSync, using Etebase) though I think it&#x27;s not an issue that should prevent you from getting started. :)<p>As for migrations: that&#x27;s a tough one, and we indeed don&#x27;t have an easy-to-use mechanism yet. I mentioned it in another comment: the API at the moment is powerful and used in production, but it&#x27;s still missing some goodies to make the developer experience even better.<p>As for including every migration in your application bundle: yeah, well until you consider an old version EOL. It&#x27;s the same challenge Microsoft has with Office, and every app has with their local storage.')
