Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604919976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25033286, text='&gt; Is that really true any more? The supply chains are incredibly fast now and I can&#x27;t imagine there&#x27;s enough time for this process to take place - even tomatoes from southern Spain are probably on shelves in a few days.<p>It is, even within relatively close main EU nations we had significant losses (~30% of gross weight) between organic&#x2F;Biodynaimc suppliers from Italy to Germany where I did my first year of apprenticeship. My first job was to sort through the waste pumpkins and potatoes that arrived on a daily basis for 2 weeks in September in large crates for storage and distribution to the farm&#x27;s stores&#x2F;CSA&#x2F;Farmers Market outlets.<p>It&#x27;s funny because that farms soil was so rich that the seeds scattered around from wasted pumpkins in the compost pile were vining well into December. I found a few decent sized pumpkins (albeit green) when we had to turn the compost pile later in the Winter.<p>But suffice it to say, it&#x27;s insane how much food gets lost due to transport!<p>&gt; An increasing number of tomato imports are coming from the mega greenhouses where they are harvested red and can be packed on site.<p>Perhaps to hyper-local Markets that&#x27;s the case, but having spent time in Supply Chain for large Auto-manufactures batch shipping is still the norm for such low-margin commodities and delays have only compounded further since COVID. Also, Holland is (or until recently as COVID may have changed that) the largest exporter of it&#x27;s Green-house produce and biggest importer of Organic and Biodynamic produce in the EU. In short, for many in NL: they&#x27;re not consuming their own supply.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve been trying for a few years. It&#x27;s been fun and the varieties are way more interesting, but I&#x27;m not in danger of flooding the market.<p>I&#x27;m ashamed to say I haven&#x27;t had a proper tomato this year, and this is coming from a former farmer and chef.')
