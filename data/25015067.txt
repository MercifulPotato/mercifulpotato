You just need to do it a bit differently (same as REST, and if you follow REST 100%, good luck with n*m calls when you want to join two resources that you don&#x27;t know from the start):<p>GET clients [client 1, client 2]<p>for each client<p><pre><code>  GET business (id = client.id)\n</code></pre>\nNow think you can join with business, jobs, invoices, employees, etc etc, and tell me how to do this in rest without basically recreating a query language?')
