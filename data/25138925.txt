Your argument here is implicitly agreeing with my point number one.  There <i>are</i> terms that would be considered too offensive and so the conversation is about where the line falls.  We can&#x27;t just say &quot;let&#x27;s not ever talk about whether a term is offensive&quot; because there are some that we really wouldn&#x27;t want to use, and so we should be talking about what terms are too offensive and why.<p>2.  This is the conversation what what&#x27;s too offensive and why.  &quot;Master&#x2F;slave&quot; only has technical meaning because we&#x27;ve been using it that way for awhile.  But master&#x2F;slave was originally picked <i>because</i> of its meaning in the historical context of slavery.  The terminology itself has no inherent technical meaning.  So, to me at least, that is not a great argument for why we shouldn&#x27;t change it now.  But at least this part of the discussion is two people talking about the same premise and not arguing past each other.')
