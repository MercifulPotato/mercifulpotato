The key for me is looking at the behavior as a routine and pattern and replace it with a better routine and pattern. You need something to avoid the morning thought trap. The best way I’ve found to counter it is to have an immediate morning routine. For example: I set my running’s shoes and clothes out and the first the I do when my alarm goes off is put them on and go for a run. I’ve done the same thing with meditation as the first part of my day. The key is to pick an activity with minimal activity energy and to setup some visual cues of that activity near your bed. Don’t allow yourself to get pulled into you mind and brain. Eventually your new habit can replace the old one  It’s not easy to transition but achievable with persistence and time. It starts out very hard to turn off that pattern.  It eventually becomes natural to start your day a different way.<p>I’ll be honest, right now my routine is in rough shape after a bout of depression, but I’m at about 3-4 days a week and slowly building it up. This is a problem that comes and goes for me and focusing on a steady routine always helps.<p>I also recommend some meditation practice. On my worse days my mind is a mess of thoughts and dreams in the morning and I can’t make sense of the world much less the running shoes next to my bed. The way I get myself out of that is to bringing back my attention to my breath and body as mindfulness. Eventually I have enough awareness I can start to curl my body and prop myself up for a few minutes while I continue to collect myself.')
