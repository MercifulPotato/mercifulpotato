Probably these scores wouldn’t overlap at all – if they did, it would mean there’s some human who’s more like a rabbit than some rabbit is, which would be pretty surprising. But even if this were true, it wouldn’t change the fundamental finding that humans and rabbits are pretty different. Or to put it some other way, there’s a fundamental hidden generator producing differences between humans and rabbits (in this case, the species difference).</i><p>The problem with this model is that it doesn&#x27;t permit itself to look backwards in time too long.<p>If we were to also consider the organisms that have existed down to the common ancestor of rabbits and humans, it would prove quite a bit more difficult.')
