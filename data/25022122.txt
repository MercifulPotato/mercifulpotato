Google doesn&#x27;t really care. That is the ONLY major difference. If you&#x27;re mindful of what apps are asking for what permissions, you aren&#x27;t gaining much from Apple&#x27;s garden.<p>If you&#x27;re going 1:1 on the apps that run on both android and iOS, you&#x27;ll soon see that there&#x27;s very little difference.<p>One more area where iOS is better is security. Your iPhone is basically a paperweight if it&#x27;s stolen and the thief doesn&#x27;t know your password. But that&#x27;s another story.')
