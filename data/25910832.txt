Laches is, the courts don&#x27;t like being used as a machine for your lawsuit to hold the public hostage.  You don&#x27;t get to see grounds for suing, do nothing, then once the results of the lawsuit will do maximum damage to the public, <i>then</i> sue.  The courts are not interested in letting you use them for, essentially, blackmail.<p>If you knew months before the election that the rules were being changed, why not file a lawsuit then?  Why wait until <i>after</i> the election, when you&#x27;ve got the deadline of the Electoral College vote, and your lawsuit is going to literally disenfranchise <i>every voter in the state</i>?<p>Laches isn&#x27;t a punt.  It&#x27;s sanity in the face of insane lawsuits trying to game the court system.')
