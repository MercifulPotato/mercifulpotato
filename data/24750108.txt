It hasn’t affected me too badly, but I definitely miss Spotify connect and CarPlay has been spotty.<p>I’m fully making the switch as protest of business practices, not because Tidal is already better. I hope Tidal gets there but if they don’t I’ll have to reevaluate eventually. I hope Spotify just apologizes for being shitty so I can go back to them.')
