It would be actually nice to have large menus on <i>huge</i> screens but they should waste little space on a small laptop.<p>Oddly they “sort of” had this in very early scaling experiments, back in the days before Retina where Quartz Debug could scale to many sizes (1.5x, etc.).  When those modes were enabled, the menu bar and menus had nicely scaled-up sizes and fonts.  Not sure why they never enabled that.')
