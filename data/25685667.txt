If I need something, I will buy it unless I don&#x27;t have cash for it. The concept of buying stuff just because I still have some spare cash in some bucket but I stop once bucket is empty feels so strange to me, some sort of forced self-check on compulsive buyers. If that&#x27;s the case, I would rather look for solution in the root cause of such behavior rather than symptoms.<p>Maybe the motivation for some ordinary folks (that don&#x27;t really need structured accounting, then it might be great) is different than mine. Or if I would be on a really tight budget combined with having to juggle tons of various mandatory expenses (household, kids, whatnot).')
