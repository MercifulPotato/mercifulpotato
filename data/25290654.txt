One issue I have with them is that they take an aggressive approach to censorship and deplatforming, encoding their political biases into their offerings instead of taking a hands-off pro-free-speech approach. There are many examples of them banning users or organizations who are not aligned with their progressive world view. Stripe is basically PayPal 2.0, and their censorship actions remind me of PayPal and the credit card processors blocking donations to WikiLeaks.')
