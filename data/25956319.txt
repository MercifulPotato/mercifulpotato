The only way I could figure out how to get the resulting files off the Atari was to transmit them over a modem to an IBM-compatible. I did so by running a BBS program on a Windows machine in one room of my parents&#x27; house and transmitting the files from the Atari in another room over the phone lines.<p>I was shocked when I opened the files in Windows and they were totally correct. And this was before anyone had Internet access, so I must have gotten the BMP spec from Microsoft&#x27;s DevNet discs or something.<p>Amazing what we accomplished without the Internet.')
