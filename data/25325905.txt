During my undergrad years I was very interested in interpretations of quantum mechanics. I was swayed by Bohmian interpretation and decided to try to &quot;convert&quot; problems and solutions of a standard QM-101 course into that Bohmian language. The first several chapters went well, but I got stuck on particle indistinguishably - I couldn&#x27;t find any adequate explanation as to how to get, say, fermions with Bohm trajectories. Almost 20 years have passed since - I&#x27;ve been returning to discussions of Bohmian interpretation here and there - but no one so far have given me what I&#x27;m looking for. The indistinguishably question is just getting ignored or brushed off as insignificant (yeah Pauli exclusion principle is &quot;insignificant&quot;).')
