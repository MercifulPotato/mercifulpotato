I’m amazed that I got a software update for my iPhone 6S last year. And it worked pretty well. So well that when I upgraded and the trade in value was $100, rather than the $200 I had expected, it gave me pause and I decided the device was still worth $100 to me, and kept it. My daughter sometimes watches Cocomelon or does Khan Academy Kids with it, on the original battery.<p>What exactly is Italy expecting from Apple here? The device doesn’t stop working, or anything like that.')
