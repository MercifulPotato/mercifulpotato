Depending on the context, I would go as far as to say that doing so could potentially border on being an immoral disservice to your company, clients, shareholders and team.<p>Time is the most valuable and scarce of resources. Managers are responsible for executing on their mission (within the legal boundaries of the law and value system of the organization they serve). I have a lot of things on my plate and am responsible for the livelihoods of over 100 people. I want everyone to be successful and we certainly wouldn’t knowingly hire someone we didn’t think would be. If the day comes where it’s clear a person doesn’t get the job, want the job or have the capacity for the job (to borrow from Traction), it’s time to go and go quickly preferably. I would include in this people that would take an inordinate amount of my and the teams time or resources to get there.<p>There are presumably others who get&#x2F;want&#x2F;have those things and it’s my duty to serve THEM in an effort to further the mission I was hired to do.<p>Neither of us are right &#x2F; wrong of course. We just have different styles.')
