Awfully slow on my mid-2014 MacBookPro though, especially the variable-view-panel redrawing takes very long (1..2 seconds). But definitely a promising new start compared to the older source-map debugging solution.<p>Hopefully this will also lead to a &#x27;seamless debugging experience&#x27; inside VSCode. It would be pretty awesome to have (for instance) a HTML panel with a WebGL canvas in one VSCode tab while stepping through the C&#x2F;C++ code in another tab. With a bit of tinkering this would also make a nice shadertoy-style live-coding environment.')
