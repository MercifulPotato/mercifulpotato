Even the damn title of the series and aesthetics are exactly the same.<p>Also the idea of dropping one episode every week. Imagine being invested in some story and only receiving 8-10 min of it every week. That&#x27;s twice as short as any TV show out there, not to mention Netflix releasing entire seasons at once.<p>Also preventing users from taking screenshots, which is just stupid. It just helps if people share your content to other people.')
