Item(by='akshay-', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1602148718, title='Ask HN:What do you think of currently available Fixed asset management software?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='* Fixed Asset Management Software&#x2F;Enterprise Asset Management Software - To manage business assets like devices, furniture, machinery, licenses, ticketing etc.<p>I feel they are clunky, difficult to setup &amp; use. Need like 1-2 months of time, heavy user training, customization is difficult, costly. They either serve IT teams or Finance teams and hardly both&#x2F;all teams that manage these assets. No digitization of related processes and Mobile apps are funny as well.<p>I think there is a scope for a cloud based, affordable, easy to use software (similar to freshdesk for sales). What do you guys think?<p>If there are some good ones, please point me. Thank you!')
