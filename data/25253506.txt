I&#x27;ve recently did some updates on my own shitty static site generator: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;santiagodevelopment.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;santiagodevelopment.com</a><p>In my case, I stuck with markdown and still used frontmatter to add metadata to posts.  Since I&#x27;m using asp.net core, I can use the markdown library Markdig which supports frontmatter, but I can also just fallback to the name of the markdown file (regex out the date and title), since I don&#x27;t need much information from metadata.  Adding middleware to asp.net core is fairly easy as well, so I can simply create some simple middleware to create static files as requests come through.<p>The only annoying case I had was how to manage syncing between git or gitlab (I created post retrieval clients for both) and already generated static files.  I have a fairly forced method at the moment, where almost every generated file is wiped when a new git commit shows up, but I get to find those solutions myself since it&#x27;s mine (!).<p>Definitely agree with the sentiments here.  Although, I feel that the fact there&#x27;s already working products out there makes it less incentivized to do projects like this.  The new programmers I know seem to be more interested in doing something new or creating software you can&#x27;t just get from some SaaS.  I guess when I created my first website I didn&#x27;t have that worry, there was no squarespace or whatever else, so there was the double benefit of creating something both simple and new.')
