Item(by='philsnow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605127006, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25062194, text='&gt; (only a &#x27;&gt;98% accuracy&#x27; note). So let&#x27;s talk about this a little bit: is &quot;accuracy&quot; what we want? Probably not---I don&#x27;t care if I get accidentally notified, but I care very much if I don&#x27;t get notified when the baby is crying<p>Presumably this is 98% accuracy per sample or something, not per session of crying.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to leave my kid completely unanswered 1&#x2F;50th of the time if he actually needed me, but I think with the model as trained, regular crying would eventually get noticed and that&#x27;s fine with me.<p>Somewhere else on the thread though somebody else called out the real downside of this model:  it overfits on regular crying.  Kids make all kinds of noises.  Mine made a completely different, eldritch noise one time when he noticed a spider, for instance.')
