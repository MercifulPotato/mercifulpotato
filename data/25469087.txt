Now imagine you are a recent graduate from residency or medical school, and you have a comorbidity or risk factor for severe covid. Unless you have some outside funding source to pay your debt, you have no choice not to work, likely in a hospital that has little incentive to keep you safe.<p>Even ignoring tuition, there is a massive opportunity cost to training a doctor, and these are the folks we&#x27;re relying on to keep us healthy for decades into the future. Situation&#x27;s pretty shit. Least we could do is lock down until every healthcare worker has been vaccinated.')
