It&#x27;s just wrong from an administrative policy perspective. CUI doesn&#x27;t automatically entail&#x2F;require encryption. Most people don&#x27;t even bother to encrypt their emails in Outlook even when chock-full of CUI documents, or worse, high-impact PII&#x2F;PHI.<p>If politicians want encrypted comms they&#x27;ll probably have a &#x2F;&#x2F;SECRET Blackberry or iPhone.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NIPRNet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NIPRNet</a>')
