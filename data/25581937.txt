Item(by='shakow', descendants=None, kids=[25587968, 25589665], score=None, time=1609338440, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25580637, text='Hyades (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyades.info&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hyades.info&#x2F;</a>)<p>I wanted a not-too-intrusive Github notification system that would give me a broad  overview of what happened in my starred repos (<i>i.e.</i> repos for which I&#x27;m only a consumer), as some kind of ‶real-time″ changelog. Indeed, I star quite a lot of <i>e.g.</i> emacs packages and other small utilities, which don&#x27;t have a strict release schedule&#x2F;changelog cycle, so it&#x27;s easy to miss a new feature.<p>So I developed a service that would send me a weekly newsletter of ‶what happened″ (issues, releases), and I decided to make it public, as I assumed I was most probably not the only person with such a need. I never planned on making actual money out of it, but I thought it could recoup hosting costs, which it didn&#x27;t.<p>But on the other hand, I learned quite a bit while doing it, so it&#x27;s probably still a net win.')
