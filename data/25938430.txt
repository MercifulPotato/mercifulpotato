I don’t think we need to dismantle the credential system.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m 57 years old. I&#x27;ve never, ever met anyone who isn&#x27;t a libertarian nerd (I have friends ...) that checks to see what medical school a physician attended.<p>This why we have to be careful about generalizing from our own experience conclusively :)<p>&gt;  If they are &quot;checking&quot; at something approximating that level, they do so via clinical affiliation (e.g. &quot;anyone at the Mayo has to be great&quot;).<p>There’s how things are, and how things should be. People <i>ought</i> to take more responsibility for their healthcare and that includes who provides it.<p>&gt; Not really. The &quot;watchers&quot; in our current system are government agencies, not private (potentially for-profit, or at least for-big-salary) corporations. The incentives align in significantly different ways.<p>Perhaps you haven’t noticed but the watchers in government agencies and the for-profit, big salary corporations they are supposed to be watching <i>are the same people.</i> its called “regulatory capture” and “revolving door”.')
