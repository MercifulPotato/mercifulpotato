I&#x27;d argue that Big Media, Inc. is deeply complicit\nin the rise of Donald Trump.  He was the goose that laid the golden egg.\nAdditionally, the media mergers of the 80s and 90s gave us right-wing talk radio on\nthe AM band, sewing the spores of hate from which the vile toadstool\nof Trumpism bloomed.<p>Big Tech, Inc., with its algorithms that promote radical right-wing content,\nalso seems suspect.<p>To me the solution to all of these problems is to break up conglomerates\nand monopolies.  Let&#x27;s have more decentralization and more &quot;small is beautiful&quot;\ntech, like the chat system presented here.  Let a million flowers blossom,\nsmothering the aforementioned toadstool.\n(Wandering off to look at installing Cabal).')
