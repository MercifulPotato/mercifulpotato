Created a language plug-in for a custom language, and I loved the dev environment.  Shout out to the Mono community! (And thank you!)<p>Unfortunately, today, I can&#x27;t figure out how to build that stack from source, even Gentoo&#x27;s dotnet overlay can&#x27;t seem to build it. Oh well.  I&#x27;d appreciate any pointers.')
