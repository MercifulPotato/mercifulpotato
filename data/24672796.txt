Product marketing is hard ;)<p>Basically, we abstract away the complexity of networking security for application developers. Let&#x27;s say you are building an application that has 2 parts: A weather sensor in a field and a InfluxDB instance in AWS. The application logic is simple. Every 60 secs send a reading to the DB. Most developers could write that logic. However if you want to end-to-end encrypt it across multiple network hops, you need to go find a networking security team with expertise in cryptography. That&#x27;s hard. OR you simply add some Ockam code to each endpoint and voila you have e2e channels.<p>To put it another way. Stripe lets an app dev process payments without understanding payment networks. Ockam lets you secure edge to cloud applications without understanding network security.')
