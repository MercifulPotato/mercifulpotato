Except that your claims aren&#x27;t an apt comparison because your comparison is logically flawed.  Instagram paying some users for their content isn&#x27;t the same as Instagram paying people to advocate a certain political agenda.  And having a moderation system in place isn&#x27;t the same as having a moderation system in place that is designed to ensure only a certain political viewpoint is discussed.  And you&#x27;ve made no claims about Instagram enforcing only one political viewpoint.<p>I was just pointing out that your statements, if true, still don&#x27;t support your conclusion as they don&#x27;t provide an apt comparison to the claims about Parler.')
