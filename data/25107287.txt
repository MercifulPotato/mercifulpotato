Latency will never be less than the laws of physics and modem FEC dictate, but jitter will be <i>very</i> low.<p>If you saw a lot of jitter it was because you were in an oversubscribed, contended tdma network. What was your terminal hardware, what modems were you using and what was the rf chain and modem setup at the far end (not in Afghanistan)?<p>Latency on terrestrial ptp microwave also does not vary. Ducting and diffraction and temperature inversions on long 6GHz links affects rsl and modulation, not latency.<p>In the case of starlink, each satellite is functioning as a bent pipe relay between cpe and starlink earth station. Latency will vary a ms or two based on satellite position during a pass overhead, but no more than that. The rest of the latency is the same as from any terrestrial internet customer in the same geographic location as the earth station. For instance one of the beta test earth stations is in north bend, wa, colocated with a level3 long haul dwdm site.<p>People in WA have been posting tests with latencies of 25-26ms to speed test servers in downtown Seattle. That&#x27;s actually really, really good, considering that latency to your default gateway on a residential cable docsis3 coaxial connection can easily be 16ms on a terrestrial connection. North bend is a few ms from seattle, the brewster starlink teleport site several ms more.<p>In the case of starlink they are competing against 32:1 or worse oversubscribed geostationary consumer grade vsat services like viasat and Hughesnet. Starlink is far superior tech.')
