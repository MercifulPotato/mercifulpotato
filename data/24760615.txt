Yes.<p>It wasn&#x27;t a waste of time because it served as a valuable mental exercise that helped me improve my discernment.<p>Discernment is the precise thing I need to avoid being taken in by false ideologies or beliefs. I can&#x27;t obtain discernment by excluding everything that doesn&#x27;t already fit my preconceived notions or the carefully crafted consensus of echo chambers.<p>Maybe while researching something I discover that there is some truth to it or that there are valid reasons why people believe what they do. Perhaps the final conclusion is not supported by evidence, but some of the evidence supporting it is in-fact very compelling. Then, I can come to my own conclusion and be better informed without subscribing to the theory (in whole or in part).')
