I had something called &quot;transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF)&quot; several years ago.  It seemed to reduce some of my symptoms somewhat at first, but mostly regressed after several months, and never actually stopped my nighttime breathing problems&#x2F;throat closing up.<p>So I have been thinking I should try this thing called LINX. But I am really not sure if that one is better than a partial Nissen fundoplication of some sort.  Interested to hear your opinion on it.')
