Parents-from-hell exist but at least when I was growing up, discipline was expected, teachers were given the benefit of doubt instead of always siding with the kids, kids actually used to be somewhat scared of teachers and the principal (I mean sure they would make fun of them behind their back but at least there was some amount of deference to authority) and the overall environment kept kids in line.<p>The kind of bullying that passes for normal in American schools would never fly. I mean it doesn&#x27;t fly in American workplaces either. It&#x27;s the kind of bullshit we only tolerate in schools for some reason.')
