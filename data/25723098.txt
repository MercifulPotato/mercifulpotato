Breaking the law.<p>Companies providing a service should not care what it is used for. If society has a problem with what people are using services for, it should pass laws, and the companies should comply with the requirements of the law.<p>I don&#x27;t know why we are allowing massive companies with unchecked power to make decisions about what is acceptable behaviour on social networks. Since when did they make the laws?<p>We have a process for this, and it is for democratically elected representatives accountable to their voters to write laws.<p>Just because you agree with the decisions made by these companies today doesn&#x27;t mean this is the right process. They&#x27;re unelected and unaccountable. It&#x27;s an insult to democracy that we&#x27;re allowing them to control people&#x27;s behaviour, even if you agree with them.')
