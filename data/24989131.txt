Whether this is the result of a basically broken system of legislature, or of allowing the laws be drafted by the people they are supposed to protect against, or a combination of both, or something else entirely, I&#x27;m not qualified to say.<p>But I can say this: when I hear of some political ambition to make something better with a new law, I don&#x27;t expect it to go well.')
