Item(by='lcall', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605978405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25169621, text='A few things I have done or are in progress:  Changing my preferred technology stack from debian(linux)&#x2F;java&#x2F;scala to openbsd&#x2F;rust, and adding sqlite to my postgresql use.  I&#x27;m becoming (I think) a better husband &amp; person generally than I used to be (life is about learning, in part).<p>And a big, very hard one: learning to live (and be a better person) happily and with (a new kind of) balance with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome -- big enforced lifestyle changes there.  (Very hopefully I will learn all the lessons I should--if not it would be a major lost opportunity.)  My doctor (world-class specialist) says they see a lot of suicides in the field (though to be clear, that is not a plan, threat, nor persistent thought of mine).  Life is challenging and good, and I am grateful for very many things.<p>Edits: My learning style seems generally like sheer persistence, with specifics depending on the subject, often finding the basic&#x2F;intro materials and working them into my daily&#x2F;weekly routine somewhere, maybe a few relaxing intro videos or articles on a subject while resting.<p>Also Esperanto, and improving my limited Russian, with some Soviet movies with English subtitles, and reading the side-by-side text of the Book of Mormon in Russ. &amp; English (it has the Russ. accents marked, to reduce the need to look up words--there is no rule for emphasis like there is in Spanish or Esperanto); the AnkiDroid app helps a lot.  I learned to ride a unicycle after 40, not to a high level, but it was still a thrill--every time I could just get on and go down the street was a rush.  A talented nephew ignored my &quot;experienced&quot; advice and learned unicycling much faster and better than I, on a 26-inch wheel even.  (As you&#x27;d guess, there are some people on youtube with amazing skills, like &quot;mountain unicycling&quot; or freewheeling (no pedals) fast downhill.)<p>For education: If someone is seeking economical, high-quality, online university education (from start to Master&#x27;s), BYU Pathway Worldwide and&#x2F;or Western Governors University are impressive options, even if one needs to, for example, learn English and&#x2F;or study skills in an inexpensive intro program.  I and others have commented more about them in prior discussions, w&#x2F; more info in wikipedia.<p>And there are so many more things to learn in the future.  I&#x27;d <i>love</i> to have some good musical improvisation &amp; sightreading skills; wow.')
