Item(by='johnfn', descendants=None, kids=[25241205, 25241292, 25241122, 25241467, 25241202], score=None, time=1606601771, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25240417, text='I&#x27;ve started using Godot recently, and I absolutely love it!<p>I&#x27;ve written a lot of words - some of them even here on HN - about my frustrations around Unity, most specifically slow compile times and a poorly-thought-out and hobbled API that always seems to be 20% broken in frustrating ways. Godot fixes so many of the frustrations that I previously had with Unity, and it&#x27;s such a breath of fresh air!<p>The APIs are generally well thought out and a pleasure to deal with. 2D always felt second-class in Unity - in Godot it&#x27;s a clear first class citizen (I mean, just see OP). Things generally just make sense, and there&#x27;s a lot of bells and whistles that I&#x27;ve found personally really useful.<p>The compile times are virtually instantaneous if you use GDScript - you can even hot load in new changes into a running game (although since it compiles so fast, I rarely even need to do that!) - and that is SUCH an important thing for game development that I can&#x27;t even explain how great it is.<p>Also, the UI of the editor is just SNAPPY! Man do I love how fast everything feels in the editor. I hate to keep railing on Unity, but every time you edit a C# file at all in Unity, Unity has to do a reload of assets and it takes 5-10 seconds for the editor to be usable again. Compare this with Godot, which loads new assets virtually instantaneously, and practically never lags for any time at all. It&#x27;s amazing. I can never go back.<p>It is a bit rough around the edges - it&#x27;s only being developed by a small open source team rather than the hundreds of paid developers over at places like Unity and Unreal - but it&#x27;s really a joy to use.<p>P.S. The only real problem I found with Godot is that GDScript needs a better typesystem, so I started working on a hobby project to compile TypeScript into GDScript[1]. It&#x27;s a massive WIP right now but if that sounds like fun to you, I could really use some help.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;johnfn&#x2F;ts2gd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;johnfn&#x2F;ts2gd</a>')
