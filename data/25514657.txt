From the surrounding discussion I surmised that the original post made some sort of negative-sounding sweeping generalization about Indians, or at least phrased it in a bad way.<p>I&#x27;m not here to talk about the original post though. I&#x27;m specifically objecting to the &quot;X isn&#x27;t a race hur dur&quot; meme because it derails discussion of the issue at hand without being constructive.<p>Neither of the things you mentioned about Americans or Colombians are negative or positive stereotypes - I see them as neutral. So those questions aren&#x27;t bigoted by themselves, IMO. But there are ways to phrase those questions that would make you sound bigoted against Americans or Colombians. (No I don&#x27;t care to try to give an example).')
