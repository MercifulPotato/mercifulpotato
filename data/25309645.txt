These are extreme outliers. Of course they had to start with every advantage and have everything go just right and <i>also</i> work their asses off. You&#x27;re talking about a 1 in a billion chance to get to that level.<p>It&#x27;s like looking at an Olympic gold medal winner and saying &quot;Oh yeah, well <i>of course</i> they broke the world record in the 100-meter dash. They were born with genetic predisposition for the  sport and they had the best coaches and their parents got up at 4am to drive them to practice and...&quot; Well, yeah. But a lot of people might have those advantages and not achieve anything with them.<p>Sure, Zuckerberg went to some fancy prep school. So did all of his classmates. None of them started Facebook. There&#x27;s lots of other Congressmen who have kids. None of them are Warren Buffet.<p>But claiming that being &quot;self-made&quot; is something that doesn&#x27;t exist because the extremest outliers had unusual circumstances (this is surprising for some reason?) ignores all the people who make more modest success largely by their hard work and ingenuity.')
