It gives a lot more detail on the study, including linking to their protocol [2].<p>It’s unfortunate, but the different vaccine trials all have different demographics and different measures of efficacy. IIRC, the Moderna “95%” is not “only 5% developed COVID” but rather “95% didn’t end up showing any symptoms” while AstraZeneca was doing weekly testing (again this is from memory). With so many people being asymptomatic, the difference between “95%” and “66%” is in the details (which is definitely why Johnson and Johnson also highlight their 72% in the US, and 85% against hospitalization&#x2F;death).<p>tl;dr: each vaccine group made reasonable, independent choices for their effectiveness metrics, but they’re not the same metric.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jnj.com&#x2F;johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jnj.com&#x2F;johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-ja...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jnj.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;covid-19-phase-3-study-clinical-protocol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jnj.com&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;covid-19-phase-3-study-clini...</a>')
