Item(by='lsllc', descendants=None, kids=[24739022, 24737330], score=None, time=1602305744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735766, text='RISC OS is written mostly in ARM assembly, but it&#x27;s a pretty complete (if dated) OS.  I think it would be interesting to convert the sources to LLVM-IR and then abstract the hardware specific parts giving you a cross platform version of RISC-OS.  Yeah, it&#x27;d be a lot of work ... but I think it&#x27;d be very cool.<p>Why?<p>25 years ago there were dozens of OS&#x27;s: AIX, Ultrix&#x2F;OSF-1&#x2F;Tru64, HP&#x2F;UX, DG&#x2F;UX, SCO (yuck), MS-DOS, Dynix&#x2F;PTX, Solaris&#x2F;SunOS, Windows, MSDOS, Mac, VMS, RISC-OS, Amiga, BeOS etc. etc.  Now we&#x27;re down to a handful of OSs with a large amount of computing now converging on Intel&#x2F;Linux -- FWIW, I have nothing against Linux, I&#x27;ve used it since the early Slackware &#x2F; pre 1.0 kernel days.<p>But I do believe competition is a good thing and the current trend for OS (and processor) convergence is worrying to me.  I&#x27;d like to see more innovation and diversity in this space.')
