With my very minimal university statistics knowledge I would say that they are 95% sure that the efficacy lies between -13.1% and 100.0% for age &gt;=75. And that means: We simply do not know (probably due to lack of data in this cohort). Where am I making an error?<p>Thank you in advance!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;system&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;attachment_data&#x2F;file&#x2F;941452&#x2F;Information_for_healthcare_professionals.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;...</a>')
