Exactly. Couldn&#x27;t have said it better myself.<p>Stepping on a soapbox, I think a certain kind of economics thinking should be introduced to students at a reasonably young age, no later than secondary education, that thinking being &quot;Incentive Analysis&quot; where students are taught to think through where various people&#x27;s and groups&#x27; incentives are, and why it matters. If nothing else, it should clear up fuzzy cliche-based thinking which can be misleading even though it has a kernel of truth: &quot;If you aren&#x27;t paying, you&#x27;re the product&quot; is wrong in some very important ways, starting with the fact that if you <i>are</i> paying, you might <i>still</i> be the product.
