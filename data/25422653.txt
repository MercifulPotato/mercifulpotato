When you start more long term projects, such as colonization, things are different.<p>Say you want to colonize something that is 30 years away using the cheap but slow network. What you do is 30 years before you want to start the colony you start sending regular loads of supplies via the slow cheap network.<p>Once those are near starting to arrive at the destination, you send your colonists the expensive but fast way.<p>You can also do this to speed up exploration. Suppose we know we are going to want to send a manned exploration mission to someplace eventually, but we&#x27;ve got other more important targets to occupy us for the next few decades.<p>Send fuel and other supplies to that place by the cheap and slow method. Then when it finally comes time to send a round trip manned mission, you only need to include enough fuel and other supplies for a one way trip. They can use the fuel and supplies that were sent the slow way for their return trip.<p>This way your exploration rockets only need to carry half the mass of fuel and supplies that they would otherwise need. This will allow higher acceleration and thus shorter travel time.')
