Users have wildly differing levels of technical experience, so you may end up with plenty of feedback that you then have to spend hours understanding, sorting, de-duplicating and following up on.<p>Not to mention the fact that, bluntly, users who aren&#x27;t being paid as &quot;experts&quot; just may not be that willing to shit all over your product.  I have encountered more than one case of a limited subset of screen reader users reporting a positive experience with a component which broke every rule in the book, and caused very real problems for users outside of that core group.')
