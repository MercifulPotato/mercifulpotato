Nobody notices, and even if they do you will likely not get anything out of it. Do your job, but don&#x27;t kill yourself over it. Work-life balance is king.<p>This has been my experience as well. Nowadays I work hard only while most of the following are true:\n- I&#x27;m making top dollar (good salary + equity value is high)\n- Work is interesting (something new to learn, or challenging, or both)\n- My home life is not going great (there are ups and downs, and working hard during the downs is a pretty decent way of coping)<p>I absolutely <i>do not</i> work hard if any one of the following is true:\n- Project Manager is applying pressure.\n- People who do not deliver value have been promoted over me.\n- Manager&#x2F;Technical leadership has repeatedly ignored my advice and leanded the team in hot water (cutting corners to make arbitrary timelines, only to incur high support costs or maintenance costs later)\n- Performance Management is not occurring at the company (underperformers are not thrown out, or, worse, promoted).\n- Company is not doing well (equity value is down).\n- Salary has not kept pace with market (i.e., nothing more than 3-4% raises per year).\n- There is an over-reliance on junior people and they start calling the shots, thereby making my hard-won experience useless to the team.')
