OO programmation is hard to unlearn and add basically no value for system&#x2F;network projects. Yes C can give you bad habits, especially if you&#x27;re not rigorous, but people trying to add inheritance and classes everywhere are a disease. I remember most JS code pre-ECMA6, it was cancerous, that when my OO hatred started.')
