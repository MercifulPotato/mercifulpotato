Note that even on platforms that do allow competing app stores, market leaders can command similar percentages (e.g. Steam on Windows). This is why.<p>If Apple opened up the platform, developers wouldn&#x27;t be paying 5% to Uncle Bob&#x27;s Discount App Store instead of 30% to Apple, selling just as many units, and pocketing the difference as profit.
