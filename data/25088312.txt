They didn&#x27;t caveat it with &quot;fanless laptops&quot; or &quot;laptops with 20hr of battery life&quot;, it&#x27;s just supposedly faster than all but 2% of laptops you can buy today.<p>Exactly. It&#x27;s a meaningless number.<p>They also conspicuously avoid posting any GHz information of any kind. My assumption is that it&#x27;s a fine laptop, but a bullshit performance claim.')
