Item(by='BozeWolf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601969803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24692091, text='This is how i understood it (from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-0563&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-0563&#x2F;</a>). Correct me if im wrong please.<p>One of the reasons was that `list[int]` could not be done, as that would refer to a list index. Same as you would do\n`my_var = [1,2,3]`\n`my_var[0]`<p>Therefore it was possible to use just `int` as a type.<p>From python 3.9 (unless you used from __future__ import annotations in 3.7+) type hints are not parsed &quot;as python&quot;, at function definition time, but more or less as text. \nIn 3.9 `list[int]` does not want an item from object `list` at index &#x27;int&#x27; when using it as a type annotation.<p>The typing library did not have these issues because the `types` altered the way the objects worked. Probably (didnt check it!) by overriding __getitem__ and the likes.')
