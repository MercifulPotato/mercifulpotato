If the pull time took 39.9min (and thus build took 0.1min = 6sec) then a 99% decrease in pull time would result in 99% decrease of total time and you would get 30sec total time in the end. (Rounding to 0 decimal places).<p>Not that any of this is important for the article to be interesting. In a previous job we had to fight long pull times and we quickly created a git repo for CI that would sit on a machine next to the CI server and would periodically pull from GitHub to avoid the CI to do pulls over Internet.')
