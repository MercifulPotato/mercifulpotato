Today, only 0.25% of the world knows how to write code, meaning the amount of software being created is limited to that subset of the population. No-code tools potentially will raise that percentage to 25% or even higher, meaning 2 orders of magnitude more people are potentially starting new software projects â€“ however small initially.<p>Inevitably, those projects will need more functionality than visual or declarative abstractions currently allow, which raises demand for code-based developers. Code will <i>always</i> outpace higher-order tools in flexibility and power, and coders will always be in demand.<p>Think of it like what happened with spreadsheets... initially there was a lot of fear that moving e.g. financial modeling workflows from e.g. Pascal, etc to visual spreadsheets might make developers less relevant. But that&#x27;s the opposite of what happened.<p>Sure, there might be some developers who <i>only</i> do very basic tasks like converting a PSD file to HTML&#x2F;CSS, but that started fading out as a highly sought out skill even before Webflow was prevalent. But there will always be a need for devs, and there&#x27;s a massive shortage of them in the world still, so I&#x27;m honestly a lot less worried about this.')
