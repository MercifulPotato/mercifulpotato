I still pay them (inc interns), but everyone I’ve known who was great at programming did some amount of it for free somewhere along the way (because they can and they like it), whether it was open source, programming contests, or just checking out some new tech on their own and never shipping the code anywhere.<p>Even though every line you’ll ever write for me will be paid, the fact that you did something worthwhile for free is a positive signal to me. You don’t have to show that specific signal to be hired, but if you do, I’m not going to ignore it.')
