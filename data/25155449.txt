After that your bill would skyrocket to &gt;$1000 in the increased networking fees and you dont even want to know how much unmetered 1+Gbps will get you. This will vary of course because short of being a hosting or tech company of size its not worth the cost, paperwork, biometrics, and time it takes.<p>So you go for a reseller which there are many stellar ones but they&#x27;ll either utilize a program with the datacenter akin to an reseller affiliate program with them being the 3rd party support or do it all themselves. If they do the reseller affiliate program they cant really offer anything outside of theie markups on the existing offerings by the datacenter. If they do it all themselves then it becomes much more expensive for the upfront costs.<p>What you want is a VPS and a CDN which provides a better experience and what every streaming platform uses. Not that expensive either!')
