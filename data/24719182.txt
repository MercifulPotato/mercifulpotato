Our entire company has moved to F#&#x2F;CLR&#x2F;.NET Core at the beginning of 2020 and we could not be happier. It started in 2019 as a hobby project, I just wanted to create a simple (not in par in terms of features) replacement for Google Analytics to track how users use our website and also create an ETL pipeline for it using AWS Lambda. This is how I got into it more in depth. The more I worked with it I started to like it even more. When the time came to select the stack for our next project we had Rust and F# as the two options and F# won because most devs were already familiar with C# and we did not like few things about Rust (especially the string handling) while we could not find any particular issue with F#. Now, 100.000 lines of code later, it was a pretty good decision.<p>As far as Clojure goes, I usually use it for the JVM world, if I get a project and there are no other devs. Unfortunately it is almost impossible to convince Java devs to use Clojure and there are some limitations (Java interop for example) that makes it hard to sell. I am not even sure what would I do in your situation.')
