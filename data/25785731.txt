I think there have been a few more similar cases of contract bugs, some even involving client devs, and any suggestion of a new fork has met with strong opposition from all ends of the community.<p>Another thing I think is useful for a blockchain is to have multiple independent clients...  It helps prevent devs from having outsize voice in discussion (though the users and the node runners are always the final vote).<p>I think working out the meta structure of how to work these social level contracts is definitely something the whole cryptocurrency industry needs to work on.')
