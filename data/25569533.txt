While it is very normal for parents to be defensive, I found the comment a bit unnecessarily aggressive without an immenent threat (heck, we&#x27;re on some comment section on the internet here, not a dome in hunger games battling for survival).<p>But then again, I have not had children of my own, so I can&#x27;t relate to the need to defend my offspring.<p>And from friends I know that parenting is really hard with lots of sleepless nights.
