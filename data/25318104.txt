It also requires built in or standard library support for whatever convenience types and functions are needed to make using real C APIs pleasant and as safe as possible. Support for exporting functions and passing function pointers the other way is great too if it can be done.<p>Go with CGo is okay from a usability perspective but performance is poor. I haven&#x27;t looked much at Rust&#x27;s implementation so I can&#x27;t comment. I&#x27;ve also heard Python is not bad.')
