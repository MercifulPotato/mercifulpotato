I just assumed Darcs development had stopped. Where can I read about this new Darcs 3 theory?<p>I think the next VCS needs to offer a value proposition other than just &quot;better than Git&quot;, though. The easiest way to accomplish this would be to piggyback on something popular.<p>For example, if Microsoft started offering a new VCS system built into Visual Studio Code that were enabled for free by default and had awesome built-in integration (VSCode&#x27;s current VCS integration is nearly useless, IMHO), then I think it could reasonably compete with Git, though it might require competing with Github. (Of course, Microsoft could do this with Github.)<p>Even with this, I don&#x27;t think a better Darcs would suffice. For example, one thing that Git handles poorly is large files, and it doesn&#x27;t do well with large repos, either. I think we&#x27;d need something like Darcs paired with awesome scalability (Perforce-style central server with partial client-side checkouts) combined with support for arbitrarily large files.')
