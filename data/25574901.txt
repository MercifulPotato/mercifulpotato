It&#x27;s also about understanding. When you get a hearing test, they aren&#x27;t just testing frequencies. They&#x27;ll also ask you to repeat back words that are said to you. There IS treatment for this, and you may actually benefit from a hearing aid or some other device that would help.<p>Your insurance should cover a hearing test! Just get it! It&#x27;s pretty painless and kind of fun. Worst case scenario? They tell you your hearing is fine and you&#x27;re back where you started.<p>Good luck!')
