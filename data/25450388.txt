Peloton obviously deserves a lot of credit for popularizing the idea, but the hardware required to do similar things outdates Peloton.<p>e.g. Pretty much any Concept2 rower you see in a gym or home that has been made in the last couple decades has a monitor that can provide realtime data to a computer via USB.  I have one of these in my home that is older than Peloton but still connects to a computer just fine.  If you actually have a Concept2 rower so old that it doesn&#x27;t have USB, you can always upgrade the monitor (Concept2 sells upgrades).<p>The hardware has been under our noses for a long time, but it seems like we&#x27;re only just now starting to make decent software to make use of it, although I&#x27;d say rowers are still a bit behind at present.  It does seem like an under-served market.')
