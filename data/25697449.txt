Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[25697775], score=None, time=1610169521, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25695945, text='&gt; the measures they put in place to reduce the spread of the coronavirus were an absolutely unprecedented obstruction of the ability of observers to watch the process.<p>The mask isn&#x27;t supposed to over the eyes, only the mouth and nose. Do you have any concrete examples of &quot;unprecedented obstruction&quot; and their effects? Or evidence that it didn&#x27;t affect both sides equally? These are just random insinuations.<p>Also there&#x27;s a bit of karmic justice here, because if Trump had taken the pandemic more seriously in the first place maybe there wouldn&#x27;t have been all these restrictions. Or maybe he deliberately sabotaged the response so he could blame the restrictions for affecting the result later. (See? It&#x27;s so easy to make up accusations).<p>&gt; An election observer should be able to see everything every election worker does as closely as the election worker sees it.<p>Do observers generally get closer than 6ft to workers? Even under normal circumstances that&#x27;s considered personal space.<p>Also this would require a conspiracy among <i>hundreds</i> if not thousands of election workers to have any effect. Without a single person blowing the whistle.<p>&gt; How could anyone have known he was going to lose,<p>The polls had him losing WI by a far larger margin so that was a hint. The WI race being so close, and the history of the Republican party&#x27;s treachery in that state is more an indicator of a failed Trump steal. I don&#x27;t believe that is the case either - it&#x27;s more likely that it was bad polling.<p>&gt; Can you answer the actual question I asked?<p>You haven&#x27;t presented any facts - only vague accusations. What is there to answer? You&#x27;re a concern troll. I&#x27;m done responding to you.')
