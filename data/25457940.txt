Item(by='matthewdgreen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608226931, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25457526, text='&gt; Is there any chance evidence to suggest that they hired Timnit merely as a PR show, rather than because they actually wanted a good product?<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that the ethical AI team is empty PR. What I&#x27;m saying is that the obvious corporate justification for an (expensive!) AI ethics team is to reassure regulators and customers that Google&#x27;s AI techniques will follow best ethical practices. Obviously the best way for Google to achieve that goal is to hire a bunch of really strong researchers, and then incorporate their recommendations into Google&#x27;s products. And of course, to have those researchers publish their findings so that the world can see that a standard is being followed.<p>But the flipside can also be true, and damaging the credibility of your ethical AI team comes at a cost. It would not surprise me if some observers have come to negative conclusions about the independence of Google&#x27;s researchers, which means those people are more likely to mistrust Google&#x27;s products in the future. The irony is that even if Google has the very best intentions, they might now find it harder to convince people of this. This does meaningful harm to Google, and nothing Google&#x27;s gotten out of this mess has been worth that cost.')
