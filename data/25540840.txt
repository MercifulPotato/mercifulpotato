They&#x27;ve been unreasonably hostile to basically everybody that has wanted to work with them over the years. No volume price breaks, no prototype-quantity orders (at any price), no partnering with other manufacturers, no shared development projects, absolutely no sharing of the proprietary driving waveforms to groups that want to use a different controller, etc.<p>Many, many embedded, tablet, even IoT projects that started out wanting to use an eInk display for power reasons had to settle for other technologies because the company just wasn&#x27;t interested in exploring new leads that weren&#x27;t one of their existing eBook partners. I can understand having priorities, but you&#x27;re not supposed to be able to sit on a patent hoard this large while behaving this badly (FRAND requirements, etc.).')
