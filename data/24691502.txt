Seems like uptime could be more like 99.7% and dropping.<p>But, how do out count downtime of a distributed system?  We probably need a new way of discussing availability.<p>An outage to part of your system might only impact one or a group of users, but to those users you could have been 100% down, effectively, even as other users were not impacted at all.<p>So maybe a series of user&#x2F;%age counts?  &quot;This quarter 90% of our users&#x2F;use cases had 100% availability&quot;, for example.  With the gold standard being 100&#x2F;100.  Maybe numbers for 99, 90, and 50% of users&#x2F;use cases?  IOW: &quot;1% of our users had 95% availability, 10% of users had 99.9, and 50% of users had 100%.&quot;')
