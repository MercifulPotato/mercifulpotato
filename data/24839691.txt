I discovered this while trying Parallels Lite from the App Store. I was used to being prompted for every connection attempt VirtualBox was making but I was not getting any when using Parallels. I contacted Little Snitch&#x27;s support and they acknowledged the issue but said that there&#x27;s not much they can do because Little Snitch works on &quot;application level&quot; and Parallels uses bridged mode of networking that Little Snitch is unable to intercept. Note that the Lite version of Parallels doesn&#x27;t require any kernel extensions (even on older macOS releases).<p>If an application is running as root, you are similarly able to use the lower level APIs and completely &quot;bypass&quot; Little Snitch. I cannot find a good alternative source for this other than the Security and Privacy Guide [0]:<p><i>It is worth noting that these firewalls can be bypassed by programs running as root or through OS vulnerabilities (pdf), but they are still worth having - just don&#x27;t expect absolute protection.</i><p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;drduh&#x2F;macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide#third-party-firewalls" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;drduh&#x2F;macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide#th...</a>')
