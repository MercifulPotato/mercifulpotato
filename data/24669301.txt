It appears to be drawn biologically from the genetic male sex and &#x27;male brain&#x27; vs. genetic female sex and &#x27;female brain&#x27;. Natural variations exist in all things, but if you look at what&#x27;s most common, with biological sex differences (whch feed cultural &#x27;stereotypes&#x27;), they still are what they are.<p>See Robert Green&#x27;s book &quot;The Laws of Human Nature&quot; (2018) for his take on the following. It&#x27;s very insightful. (Chapter entitled, &quot;The Law of Gender Rigidity&quot;)<p>&#x27;Masculine thinking&#x27; prefers to categorise and bifurcate. (Dualism.) I&#x27;m a guy and I consider myself having a &#x27;super&#x27; &#x27;male&#x27; brain in some aspects even more than the average. I find it very hard to multi-task, and I easily hyperfocus.<p>Male thinking solves problems by breaking things down and focusing on one part of the picture at a time. It&#x27;s about specialisation.<p>Female thinking treats things more as a whole, with everything connected. It solves problems by looking at the whole picture at once. It&#x27;s about multi-tasking.<p>I now see that &#x27;male thinking&#x27; (as opposed to males), such as &#x27;specialisation&#x27;, dominates modern capitalism and public policy, and often to detriment. Most females at top levels in business at this time in our culture would appear to mostly have this success because they are &#x27;atypically&#x27; strong in &#x27;masculine thinking&#x27;.<p>Personally, I think such leadership needs more female <i>thinking</i>. I&#x27;m slowly trying to understand it more, as my own starting point. Modern diversity policies that change what&#x27;s on the outside (how many penises are around the table) don&#x27;t actually solve the <i>real</i> problems. We&#x27;re still picking what&#x27;s taking place on the inside. We need diversity of things far deeper - to embrace and celebrate true &#x27;feminine thinking&#x27; - not just what&#x27;s on the surface.<p>So anyway, this could help explain why female sexuality is seen to be more &#x27;fluid&#x27;, on average, than among males. It&#x27;s not so much how people actually are, as how people see themselves, because of how they tend to be wired. And this is not even factoring in that there is greater cultural stigma around a male being bi vs. a female being bi.<p>I am a male, and 100% bi.')
