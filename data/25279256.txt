Plus, I think the app is fun to play with.<p>Hope this thought experiment helps reflect about the whole idea of randomness in life, and maybe help spark a few interesting conversations with friends! It&#x27;d be great to hear your feedback.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rameerez&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334104302361702400" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rameerez&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334104302361702400</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rameerez&#x2F;luck" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rameerez&#x2F;luck</a>')
