I own a couple of items on the list now (Le Creuset Dutch Oven, and Kitchenaid Mixer) and I can attest to their durability.<p>I think your idea of cost per month is good for things you use often. One thing I&#x27;ve been thinking about lately as I&#x27;ve undertaken a medium-sized kitchen renovation is the cost of ownership of tools. Since I&#x27;m not a professional I can&#x27;t take a cost per month approach since I may not use the tool for many months at a time.<p>Instead I&#x27;ve been thinking about two things:<p>1. How many hours of operation can I get out of this tool? If I amortize those hours over my lifetime, will I ever have to buy the tool again? In this case a mid-range tool may be an A+ for me, but a B- for a professional.<p>2. What is the lifetime of a battery-powered version of the tool? I&#x27;m avoiding battery-powered tools (with a few exceptions, I&#x27;m looking at you power drill) because I&#x27;m concerned the batteries will fail before the tool does.<p>My ideal situation is that I buy these items once and never need to replace them. As an amateur, I should be able to do that without buying the most expensive tool. As a professional, I probably already have preferences and a strong opinion anyway.')
