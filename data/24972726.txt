The rates here are about what I would expect for take-home pay. I.e. they take home (pre-tax) closer to $70&#x2F;hr than $30&#x2F;hr. One thing not made clear in the article is if the hourly rates they quote are pre or post benefits. When I budget out projects, my spreadsheets have two columns, hourly wage, and hourly + benefits. Depending on the particular union, the benefits can be as high as 60%. So the real cost to me, the PM, is $70+$42 = $112&#x2F;hour straight time.')
