Item(by='drdeadringer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607093206, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300781, text='&gt; I think of web scraping as nothing less than automation of human work.<p>I did this with Python regarding market prices for ETFs, Stocks, and Mutual Funds.<p>I wrote Python scripts, one of which was to web-scrape current market values, investment distribution, &amp;c for ETFs, stocks, and Mutual Funds for whic I was invested in. I then would have to manually port that into a spreadsheet for &quot;my own special graphs&quot; and such.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are places online which would do this for me if I logged in, entered in all of my information and more, and provide that all for me ... but this story should sound familiar. And due to personal reasons, I&#x27;ve been lagging behind for far too long.<p>My Point: This information is publicly available and and it serves my purposes. There&#x27;s no reason why I should not be able to do this. Yes, it&#x27;s my fault for not using the information [and yes, the information dies with me], but the point is that I automated the gathering of that information for my own self -- and &quot;everyone&quot; else on the planet has that same information.<p>I never felt like I was illegal doing this. I&#x27;m happy to know if there is a &quot;save&quot; way to do this type of aggregate situation otherwise.')
