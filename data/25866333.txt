Item(by='jlgaddis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611272925, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25858510, text='Take a look at Oracle&#x27;s &quot;CentOS to Oracle Linux&quot; (and other similar) scripts to see how they work and what they do (sorry, I don&#x27;t have a link handy as I&#x27;m on a mobile device at the moment).<p>If memory serves, the process consists of, basically, installing the &lt;distro&gt;-release package for the &quot;new&quot; distro (which includes the files in the &#x2F;etc&#x2F;yum.repos.d&#x2F; (or whatever) directory that defines the package repositories), enabling the repositories it just added, disabling the &quot;old&quot; distribution&#x27;s repositories, then running a &quot;yum update&quot; to replace the &quot;old&quot; distributions packages (including the kernel) with the (nearly identical) ones from the &quot;new&quot; distribution. After all that is done, you reboot the host so that the new kernel is loaded and that&#x27;s pretty much it.<p>Mostly out of curiosity, I tried out Oracle&#x27;s &quot;centos2ol.sh&quot; (or something like that) script ~8 years ago on a new CentOS 6 VM I had set up for just that purpose and it was as easy as they claim that it is. I don&#x27;t recall encountering any issues and I suspect that, by now, they&#x27;ve ran into most of the potential issues and have devised ways to resolve them automatically.<p>Note that while CentOS 8 <i>is</i> a clone of RHEL 8, the CentOS packages are rebuilt versions of the RHEL ones. Most of them are built from the <i>exact same source code</i> but some packages do have minor changes made to them before they are rebuilt (for trademarks, etc.).')
