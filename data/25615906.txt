An irresponsible one potentially causes harm by assuming every single hit is a major finding that should turn into a bounty payout.<p>I already tried to clarify that I was talking about the general concept of good lint rules, not about people emailing for bounty payouts. We&#x27;re in agreement that emails about bounty payouts for non-issues is stupid.')
