Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25549554], score=None, time=1609052875, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25545099, text='&gt;  The lack of background music and pace is really interesting to me. Compared to a typical &quot;how it&#x27;s made&quot; video [1] (which I feel has a similar level of detail), this video feels significantly more digestible. Those moments of silence feel totally alien and out of place in today&#x27;s style, but I think contributes positively to my ability to understand and process the information.<p>I think that&#x27;s because the older movie is an actual <i>educational</i> movie, while the video you linked is really pseudo-educational <i>entertainment</i>.  An educational video has the goal of leaving the viewer with actual understanding of something, while the pseudo-educational video only cares to vaguely tickle the viewer&#x27;s curiosity, and is fine to leave them nearly as ignorant as when they started. While the two movies may have a &quot;similar level of detail,&quot; the educational video focuses on fully explaining a specific problem and solution, while the pseudo-educational video only vaguely skims through the high-level steps of some manufacturing process and barely even explains what the product is for.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engineerguy.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engineerguy.com&#x2F;</a> makes educational videos similar to this 1937 movie on a lot of similar topics.')
