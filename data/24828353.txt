The Belgian and European under 23 champion had gone in as a pre-race favourite but did not feature at the front. She was eventually forced off her bike on the final lap when she was struck by mechanical problems and ended up walking with her bike.<p>&gt; Van den Driessche’s bike was taken for inspection along with several other bikes after the race. It quickly became apparent that something was wrong with her bike and news of the discovery quickly spread; however it is only this Sunday morning that they revealed their discovery. It gives Van den Driessche the dubious honour of being the first rider to be discovered to be using a motor. Incidentally, Van den Driessche’s brother Niels is currently suspended for doping.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cyclingnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;uci-confirms-motorised-doping-uncovered-at-cyclo-cross-world-championships&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cyclingnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;uci-confirms-motorised-dopi...</a>')
