The law requires the termination to fall into a specific 5-year window, with advance notice in writing (and it must be multiple years in advance), served specifically to the person whose rights are being terminated.<p>The sheer logistics of trying to terminate a license granted to the world are therefore pretty difficult, but you could imagine termination targeting just a handful of lucrative targets. (Even then, when does a generally-available license &quot;start&quot;? When it&#x27;s first offered? When the specific user first accesses the work? Is the timeframe &quot;refreshed&quot; every day the license is still on offer? This provision really wasn&#x27;t written with these kinds of licenses in mind.)')
