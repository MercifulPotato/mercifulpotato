So, they’ll have to wait a while anyway. Most of us are not like... wait years for effects to emerge. More like 6-12 months after initial rollout.<p>I’m one of those people. I’m fine with still being remote and wearing a mask when in stores or whatever. I’m not going to go to any dances anytime soon even if I had the shot anyway. Effectiveness isn’t 100% after all.
