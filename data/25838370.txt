Item(by='Pfhreak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611087723, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837870, text='&gt; Isn&#x27;t the east precinct a government building?<p>Yes, but your framing isn&#x27;t genuine. Some protestors did wander into an abandoned building. I&#x27;m not sure whether any of them were armed. That&#x27;s a far cry from &quot;Armed protestors took over a government building.&quot;<p>&gt; Raz the Warlord of CHAZ giving out assault rifles:<p>Again, your framing is clearly flamebait. I obviously don&#x27;t deny that Raz was there, and that there appears to be a video of him giving a long gun to someone. (Singular.)<p>But calling Raz &quot;the Warlord of CHAZ&quot; is needlessly biased and inflammatory. Just say Raz Simone, or if you feel you need to clarify, add some factual clarification.<p>&gt; How many people were shot within the protest zone by occupants of CHAZ versus police over that time?<p>Again, your framing lacks nuance.<p>The first shooting in the protests was by someone <i>driving into a crowd</i> who claimed to have a brother who worked in the east precinct.<p>The second shooting does not have a clear connection to the protest occupants. The Police chose not to help the shooting victim (and the reason for the shooting is unknown). This may have been protest related violence. It may have been non-protest related violence. It&#x27;s unclear if the victim would have survived if the Police had made any effort.<p>The third shooting (which occurred outside of the zone) appears to be racially motivated, and according to the victim was allegedly at the hands of a white supremacist. It&#x27;s unclear if this is related to the second shooting.<p>The fourth and fifth shooting (which occurred outside of the zone) have no details beyond someone getting shot in the arm.<p>The sixth and seventh shootings were of two teens who had reportedly driven an SUV through the crowds overnight, including through the park. Details are hazy, and it&#x27;s not clear whether this was an act of self defense or something else.<p>So, on my counting there were seven shootings:<p>2 appear to be against protestors or racially motivated.<p>3 have no clear details that link them to the protest, and 2 of which did not take place in the zone<p>2 are allegedly in self defense, though the veracity of those claims is TBD.')
