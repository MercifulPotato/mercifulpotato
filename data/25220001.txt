Java had been heavily used in finance for longer than .NET, so there&#x27;s experience, and lots of existing code.  Java&#x27;s GC is faster (even if it&#x27;s not being used in the context of HFT).  But probably the most important thing is that .NET on <i>Linux</i> is very new (banks are very conservative, small companies, not so much).<p>.NET on Windows for HFT is a non-starter.  In comparison to Linux, you have practically zero control over the OS;  you need to turn off unnecessary processes, pin processes to cores, exclude processes from cores and so on.<p>Having said all that, I do know of at least one hedge fund in London that is mostly C#-based (though I have no idea whether their &#x27;deep&#x27; trading code is C# though).')
