So SN8 could already have reached space. (With the assumption that the nose could have taken the pressure of going supersonic relatively low.)<p>Similar calculations state that a Starship with full tanks and 6 or 7 engines might just be able to make it into orbit on it&#x27;s own, assuming it doesn&#x27;t have any payload or heatshield.<p>Since that&#x27;s useless and wastes the ship, they will never do it. But it still boggles the mind that they are using a craft that is almost a SSTO ship ... as a second stage, on top of a massive first stage. The Raptor engines are freakishly good, near the top in both efficiency and thrust.')
