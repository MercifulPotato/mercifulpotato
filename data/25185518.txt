Mass, evil incarceration of entire populations without any evidence they work, such that millions of people have had to go without vital life saving cancer screenings, they&#x27;ve been losing their jobs, there have been suicides, etc. Incredibly cruel policies. So surely every corporation is going to be totally anti-lockdown, right?<p>Oh, what&#x27;s that? There are tradeoffs, you disagree, etc.<p>Well, yeah. And that&#x27;s why institutions of any kind shouldn&#x27;t adopt such vague, naive, poorly thought out slogans. Even defining &quot;acts of cruelty&quot; is hard. Look at this thread. Some leftist immediately dragged it into the standard tirade against US immigration control. Why is the cruelty there being inflicted by those who enforce the laws rather than the parents who take their children on an adventure of illegal immigration, knowing full well what the consequences may be? You can slice it both ways, depending on perspective.<p>That&#x27;s why smart firms stay out of these debates, unless they were specifically founded to take a position on one of them. But it seems Valley tech firms are increasingly not so smart. That&#x27;s OK, it&#x27;ll be good to have a free competitive edge over them.')
