The point was to set up the aliens to have a gross approximation of outcome determination that is both accurate and wrong.<p>The aliens could have decided to use home vs. away teams as their &quot;coin flip&quot; and stopped investigating once they found out that home teams win a bit more, for example, and the &quot;crazy&quot; alien in the parable could suggest that examining only the first play of the game is a better answer.  The &quot;crazy&quot; alien would be told to stop because the first play isn&#x27;t more predictive, but the fact that the alien is looking at gameplay is more &quot;right&quot;.')
