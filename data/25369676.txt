It is important in any environment for people to be clear how to operate within it, and if any of that is depends on intuition and interpretation, that amounts to a bigger loophole than any carefully examined technicality. The distinction then becomes not what loopholes to exploit but who gets to exploit them. With a &quot;letter of the law&quot; approach it takes a way the ability for arbiters to selectively interpret rules and puts the onus on the engineers of the system to be more careful and thoughtful in creating the environment.<p>If I can create a Ricardian compiler that can deterministically interpret human language and apply it to machine behavior, maybe the solution is to raise the standards we expect of those that craft our laws. &quot;Spirit of the law&quot; seems to be a cop out excusing sloppy lawmaking and leaving the door open for selective enforcement.')
