While I really like slack in general, no one likes it when things fall through the cracks or important people miss out.<p>It actually bothered me enough that I quit my job and made Kitemaker (YC W21) which automatically watches slack conversations for mentions of work items and links them together. This linkage lets people working on something that there are discussions going on about it in Slack. You have your persistent place for writing things down (in Kitemaker) and can still use Slack. We have lots of plans for making it even more frictionless. Also works with Discord.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitemaker.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitemaker.co</a>')
