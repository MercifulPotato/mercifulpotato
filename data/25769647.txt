These recent and relatively comprehensive GIS studies have conclusively proven that ~400 camps has existed _ever_, in varying states of construction and decommission in the past 3 years, i.e not all were operating concurrently. It&#x27;s always interesting that Zenz estimates gets repeated in the same studies that simultaneously debunk them. I&#x27;m sure being funded by parties with anti-China interests has nothing to do with the manufacturing narrative process. For example Zenz was alleging up to 1M was interned in 2018. Choice quote from latest Buzzfeed piece by Killing regarding situation in 2018:<p>&gt;&quot;The business owner had heard rumors that the internment camps were not for education, as the government claimed, but mass detention. “We had heard that mass detention had occurred, that people were disappearing into these schools. We didn’t know much but we knew that it wasn’t a good place,” she said.&quot;<p>So 1&#x2F;12th of an ethnicity is being rounded up and somehow it&#x27;s still relegated to &quot;rumor&quot;. Zenz claim around this time is 1&#x2F;6th. That&#x27;s about incarceration rate of black youth in US. 1&#x2F;6 of your social circle gets round up, and it is not rumor territory. The entire allegation chain has been a coordinated clowns show. At the end of the day, XJ is less a human rights issue than a matter of manufactured consent for anti-China foreign policy. The latter would be less effective if XJ internment doesn&#x27;t even eclipse US prison industrial complex. CCP is capable of interning millions, but so far the evidence points to the contrary.')
