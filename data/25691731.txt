A specific subreddit? A specific post? A specific user? A specific post by a specific user at a specific time? Obviously Reddit isn&#x27;t going to be banned, but is the mere existence of moderation enough? Or is it the <i>outcome</i> of the moderation, aka, certain content never being present, that is what&#x27;s desired?<p>I&#x27;m curious how nuanced these things are for Apple and other companies. Is there some sort of algorithm that says: if this app has a news feed, if X% of items in the newsfeed in a 24hr period are objectionable then it will be banned? Or perhaps Y number of days that fulfill the previous criteria before it is banned?')
