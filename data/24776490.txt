The first really fossil-fuelled economy. (You can see evidence of it flying over, marshy areas where this was strip-mined, I mean strips the size you could load onto a barge &amp; deliver to town.)<p>Edit -- I can&#x27;t find a great source, but [1] has some figures, putting peat somewhere over 100x as much energy as wind, 17thC.<p>But of course heat energy and mechanical energy were two separate categories then, before steam engines, so it&#x27;s not easy to compare. He tries to estimate equivalent land areas required to either grow wood (for heat) or feed horses (mechanical) and seem to reach comparable figures. (Which together are a bit less than the figure for horse-area saved by sailing, instead of carts. For which NL was also ideal, of course.)<p>I guess the more interesting, and harder, question is the degree to which each of these enabled economic progress. Sawing wood for ships, vs. baking pottery &amp; bricks. Certainly the easy peat more or less ran out, about the same time that the UK got serious about coal.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peatandculture.org&#x2F;documenten&#x2F;Zeeuw.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peatandculture.org&#x2F;documenten&#x2F;Zeeuw.pdf</a>')
