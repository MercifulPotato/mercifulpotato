Our method starts with near-instantaneous labeling of enveloped viruses via cation-mediated binding of short fluorescent DNAs to the surface of virus particles; we subsequently surface-immobilise labelled particles, collect diffraction-limited images containing thousands of labelled particles, and finally use image analysis and machine-learning to identify different viruses in biological and clinical samples [...]. Our approach exploits the fact that distinct virus types and strains have differences in surface chemistry, size, and shape, which in turn affects the fluorophore distribution over the surface of different viruses.&quot;<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.10.13.20212035v2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.10.13.20212035v...</a>')
