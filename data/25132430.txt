Just one that&#x27;s much milder (without the red alert, fear-mongering, etc.) and still lets people use the site for a while.<p>&gt; Why not provide those milder warnings BEFORE the current expiration date?<p>I indeed almost suggested this, but the problem is the site owner hasn&#x27;t done anything wrong in that case, so the warning would be an actual false alarm.')
