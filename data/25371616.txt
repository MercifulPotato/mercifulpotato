There&#x27;s a colossal difference between &quot;being forced to watch&quot; propaganda and being exposed to it.<p>I&#x27;m not forced to open phishing emails but sometimes I do by accident or carelessness. I&#x27;m also not forced to open links someone close or not happen to send my way. I&#x27;m not forced to read weird facts-denying delusional rants on social media but sometimes I stumble upon it while scrolling around a main page.<p>Given the unlimited torrent of propaganda and manipulated content that we are exposed constantly and is designed precisely to control you to serve the manipulator&#x27;s goals, what should we do?<p>Hell, just open a tab with any of the facts-denying extremist media channels that currently plague the US. Do you believe they are preaching to fishes, or that there are people exposed and manipulated by it?')
