The first, obvious step would be simply to <i>compare</i> the actual hires (workers) with the available pool... almost nobody actually does that. People keep claiming that e.g. Google is sexist because they hire so few women, without regard to the fact that their worker pool has about the same distribution as their hiring pool (CS graduates). The UK passed a law requiring companies to disclose average salaries by sex etc. with no regard on the actual job &#x2F; education level &#x2F; level of employment.<p>We can&#x27;t even begin to talk about solutions if all the media &#x2F; researchers &#x2F; activists keep pushing misleading statistics.')
