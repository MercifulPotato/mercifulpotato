But they will also be able to compete with the Play Store and iOS App Store with their own store.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;legal-content&#x2F;EN&#x2F;TXT&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;?uri=CELEX:52020PC0842&amp;from=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;legal-content&#x2F;EN&#x2F;TXT&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;?uri=CEL...</a>')
