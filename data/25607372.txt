This was after tuning the kernel to make it as small as possible and removing everything I didn&#x27;t need, disabling all superfluous init services, etc.<p>It&#x27;s quite possible that it did use more than 17 MB temporarily before going back down, but I would expect that it&#x27;s probably doable in 32 MB + swap.<p>Configuring a minimal Linux system with Gentoo or Linux From Scratch is a great way to learn how things work (especially learning from mistakes like disabling ATA&#x2F;IDE in the kernel and having to figure out why it no longer boots :p).')
