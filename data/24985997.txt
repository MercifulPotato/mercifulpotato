[...]<p>I agree with you here, there&#x27;s no substance to this kind of thought process. It&#x27;s too generic and, ultimately, self-validating since one can&#x27;t ensure what one does is leadership worthy since there isn&#x27;t a final definition for what that means.<p>---<p>Some have already mentioned it but the quote seems to make an unfortunate use of the word &quot;right&quot; which leaves a lot of room for interpretation. That might even be the reason people find it appealing.')
