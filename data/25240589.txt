So going dark or light mode for the entire desktop was as trivial as choosing it from a drop-down menu. Or you could have it pink or green or a horrible mishmash of colour that made you go crosseyed. You could even change font sizes so if you had trouble seeing, like maybe you had cataracts, you could have huge letters on highly contrasting background.')
