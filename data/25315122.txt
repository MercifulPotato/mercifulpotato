Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607181431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25315093, text='I&#x27;m sceptical because information is not knowledge, and &quot;absorbing 10x more information&quot; is a misguided, bulimic goal in itself.<p>Plus it means absorbing knowledge in a more hasty, flimsy, way, while also giving false self-ideas of understanding.<p>If someone wants the cliff notes, or a bullet list, they should read the notes &#x2F; a bullet list. As a practical advice for the 10x thing, those things do exist (websites who summarize all kinds of books and cliff notes versions of books, e.g.: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fourminutebooks.com&#x2F;summaries&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fourminutebooks.com&#x2F;summaries&#x2F;</a>).<p>They shouldn&#x27;t skim a book 10x faster and then go on as if they&#x27;ve actually read it. That can somewhat be done with books full of filler (e.g. most self-help books). It&#x27;s a non starter on literature (misses the whole point, which is not the &quot;plot&quot;), and on serious non-fiction.')
