Why should I need&#x2F;buy one?<p>RaspberryPI is a relatively good &quot;PC&quot; for cheap, uses little power and is fast enough for most usecases at home.<p>RaspberryPi zero is a bit slower, but a lot smaller.... and harder to buy.<p>Neither of them have any good alternatives on the market (yes i know many other similar boards exist, but software support is really shitty for those &quot;alternative&quot; boards, especially after a few years).<p>Why PI Pico? What killer feature does it have, compared to esp32 (which has wifi), arduino (which as a  gajillion libraries and support), or some other microcontroller (bbc micro, STM,...)?<p>EDIT: not trying to shit on their effort, but genuinely looking for an answer to &quot;why this, and not something else (arduino, esp,...)?&quot;')
