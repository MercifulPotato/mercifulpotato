Item(by='zmmmmm', descendants=None, kids=[25664016, 25663832, 25666583], score=None, time=1609973395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25658216, text='&gt; Clean, understandable, and navigable code and design<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see &quot;navigable&quot; in here - I&#x27;ve struggled to articulate in the past this problem and I think this nails it. We often see simplicity come at the cost of &quot;navigability&quot;. All the configuration by convention frameworks have this problem particularly heavily. I&#x27;m often at a complete loss to trace the mechanics of what is happening in things like vue-cli, Rails &#x2F; Grails, gradle, and many other dynamic frameworks.<p>They achieve remarkable simplicity, yet I often end up hating them and swearing at them because I can&#x27;t exercise my understanding of fundamentals to reason about them and rationalise what they are doing. &quot;The database connection must be getting established somewhere - it should be traceable back from the point where the connection is used in some way&quot; - well, no you may have to understand most of the entire underpinnings of the framework before you will achieve that understanding.<p>I think this &quot;navigability&quot; idea really fills that gap well. Things should be simple, but they should always stay navigable based on fundamental knowledge.')
