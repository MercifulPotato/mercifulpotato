The total carbon emissions include not just the fuel used by the rocket but the fuels used to create those fuels before the flight.  Liquid oxygen is not carbon-free as creating liquid oxygen requires lots and lots of energy.  So too methane which is heavily refined&#x2F;compressed&#x2F;cooled, processes that take more energy, create more emissions, than burning the fuel itself during flight.  The fuel for a 747 is not nearly as energy&#x2F;carbon-intensive to create.')
