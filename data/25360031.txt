I was underperforming and I&#x27;m also naturally very self-critical. So in reviews etc I&#x27;d be very open about my weaknesses and the need to improve.<p>In corporate culture there is <i>nothing</i> to gain from self-awareness. You&#x27;ve just handed your manager an invitation to use you as a scapegoat (see @czep&#x27;s comment), to leave you out of pay rises and give you crappy tasks.<p>There&#x27;s everything to gain from being permanently confident and upbeat about your abilities. Then your manager may A) be fooled by the act and think you&#x27;re a great performer or B) figure out that you&#x27;re struggling - but then you&#x27;re in no worse a position than you would&#x27;ve been by being downbeat in the first place.')
