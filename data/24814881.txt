Moving faster and faster and the &quot;bubbles&quot; are falling behind more and more. This effect is even more evident when moving at the same speed in straight lines vs moving in circular motion. Which tells me there is a performance drop.<p>This does not happen at all in ZBrush. Do try it, it has this effect implemented for decades. I remember playing with it in 2003 on a P3 350 MHz &#x2F; Win 2k as OS. There was absolutely no &quot;loss&quot; of mouse movements nor &quot;bubbles&quot; skipped as it is the case here.<p>Q.E.D.')
