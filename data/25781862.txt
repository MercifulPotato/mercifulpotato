Even if I do have a good idea of what is unacceptable to me, I need someone external to screen for that. If the point is to avoid personally facing the content that I find unacceptable, it&#x27;s impossible for me to adequately perform this screening on my own behalf.<p>I can instruct or employ someone (or something) to do this, but then ultimately they will make the decision for me. It&#x27;s only plausible to do this at scale, unless I&#x27;m wealthy enough to employ my own personal cup-bearer who accepts the harm. So, it makes sense to band together with other users with similar requirements.<p>Your claim seems to be that delegating these decisions is a bad thing that should be avoided, but it is an essential and inevitable part of this service - I <i>have to</i> delegate that decision to someone else, or I won&#x27;t get that service.<p>This is not to mention legal restrictions on content in different jurisdictions, which define a minimum standard of moderation and responsibility, that may include additional risk wherever they are not fully defined.')
