There are plenty of smart, capable, hardworking programmers who enjoy their jobs and aren&#x27;t just taking the easy-street, but have enough else going on in their lives that they don&#x27;t want to spend their free time writing code. I say this as someone who <i>does</i> write lots of code outside of work: it is not fair to gate people based on the number of side-projects they have. It&#x27;s not even a reasonable indicator of job performance.')
