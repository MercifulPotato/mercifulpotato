Currently CUPS is a rather poor user experience, setting up a printer is non-trivial for the average user and often enough requires digging into CUPS internals.<p>It&#x27;s configured either via an ancient and partially broken printer applet (and with broken I mean I have a reproducible crash when trying to view my printer queue before the current print has begun printing on that printer, reported somewhere in 2015 but never fixed) or via the web interface, which is broken in different, exciting ways. Sometimes printing breaks, my browser for example cannot print, it always just prints an error message (which is not logged, it&#x27;s only printed, there is no way to tell something went wrong by looking at CUPS), so all prints have to be done by another utility.<p>The code for CUPS isn&#x27;t finished, it&#x27;s a mess. The printing experience on Linux could best be described as &quot;piss poor&quot; if you&#x27;re being nice about it. The best thing about CUPS one could say is &quot;most of the time it&#x27;ll have you printer do something that resembles printing your document&quot;.')
