Each product would be the equivalent of a film.<p>The studio brings together the necessary talent and sets them loose on a well-defined project (with a deadline, a scope, and a budget).<p>The best studios, under this model, know that the most important thing for their success is finding the right top talent. (In films, that would be your writer, director, and starring cast. In tech, the typical hacker+designer+marketer trio of project leads would probably be the closest equivalent.)<p>When viewed in this light, I think the studio approach makes an awful lot of sense. It&#x27;s similar to VCs and incubators, yet different in a crucial way.<p>A studio looks primarily for talent, and trusts that when they have the right people, the right ideas and execution will follow.<p>The VC model, as best as I can tell as a distant observer, is focused first on identifying the winning ideas, and then securing the right team as a secondary item.<p>Both approaches care about both the idea and the talent. It&#x27;s an order of priority thing. Are you banking on your ability to spot winning ideas or winning talent? Studios spot talent and then evaluate ideas. VCs spot ideas and then evaluate the talent.')
