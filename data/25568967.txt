One child doesn&#x27;t have a choice, the other does. Now, which one do you exclude from public life? I&#x27;d say the one that did not take necessary steps to protect themselves and others by <i>choice</i>. Personal freedom ends where others freedom begins, it also comes with great responsibility. All these &quot;my freedom&quot; people are simply spoiled, scared egoists in my opinion.<p>EDIT: In case of children, it is obviously the parents choice. Which goes back to the responsibility part.')
