But if comp is just a reflection of the value added to the organization, and the total comp is a reflection of the entire value added by the staff, then why does it make sense for the poor &amp; the wealthy staff to both pay low effective tax rates, but the middle to pay high effective tax rates?<p>In any case, high comp for executives would not be such an issue if money didn&#x27;t translate so fluidly to political power. If wild success just meant cushy living, you might not see so much blowback, but when profits translate to power which translates to using that power to shield your profits, then claims about a rigged game are not so crazy.')
