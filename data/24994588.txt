I 100% understand the infringement (or at least encroachment) on your right to enjoy the outdoors and believe it is very rude to expose someone to obnoxious smoke. But judging the &quot;destroying your lungs&quot; aspect is nobody&#x27;s business but the person doing it. You may not have meant it this way, but I have seen a lot of people who do.<p>Edit - also, marijuana smoke is hazardous, just like tobacco smoke. Why would it be more benign?')
