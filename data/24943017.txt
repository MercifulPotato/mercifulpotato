Actix was great to use and has enough middleware that I feel comfortable using it.<p>I don&#x27;t see any reason outside of desire though to use rust and actix, python and flask are basically the same thing but easier to write. Luckily I like the language and it is fun so for now I&#x27;ll continue using it.<p>It could be rust will be better once you have business logic where the borrow checker could really shine, just making a simple crud is too much glue work such that any programming language would work.')
