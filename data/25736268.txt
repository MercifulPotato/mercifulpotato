You make a lot of super vague arguments with no specifics, and while it&#x27;s nice to agree with children&#x27;s fables like the boy who cried wolf, unless we agree on facts that happened, it&#x27;s kind of a rhetorical argument with no real bearing in reality.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve got to say, &quot;cancelling&quot; anyone who&#x27;s ever wrong from being an &quot;expert&quot; in the public sphere sounds like a really poor idea. Everyone is wrong sometimes and that&#x27;s a crazy standard which would have tons of its own perverse incentives, probably even worse than the ones scientific journals and the like have now. Do you want scientists on the record terrified of saying anything besides the most vague and unfalsifiable statements? It&#x27;s an untenable situation if you bring it to its logical conclusion. I do agree with you that there ought to be more consequences for scientists willingly spreading bad science though, beyond what there is now--but the solution won&#x27;t be simple.<p>Given the vagueness of your post I&#x27;m not sure why you have the perspective that scientists produced a &quot;non-stop wave of bullshit&quot;. From my perspective, I saw a bunch of demagogues and populists cynically manipulating a major demographic for personal gain while sidelining and ignoring the broader scientific advice and recommendations in the country the entire time, while over 350000 people died.')
