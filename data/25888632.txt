Only learn the new concepts (technical and UX, if there are any) and if there is no noticeable benefit do continue using old framework.<p>In many cases new frameworks do not bring improvements to a degree that switching is worth it. They often do either obfuscate it or don&#x27;t realize it themself, but most new frameworks do not invent any new concepts, they just dress existing (often old) concepts in new clothes. Which sometimes _can_ be a major improvement of UX but very often are not.')
