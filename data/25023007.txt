To echo the sibling poster, per-state sentiment is not normally distributed. For example, we know Trump is more popular among white men than other demographics. This means that if we were to create a random variable that reflected the sentiment of white men throughout the US, we would (probably though I&#x27;d have to dig deeper into the data) presume to see a higher median vote count in this demographic. However, we cannot say that Trump&#x27;s popularity in Massachusetts is independent from his popularity in New York, because his popularity in the white male demographic is the dependent variable between both random variables.')
