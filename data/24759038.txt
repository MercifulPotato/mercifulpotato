They would see hundreds of files from many websites and if only one of those uses one of the three files yours does, it&#x27;s impossible to tell for sure without a file that isn&#x27;t used <i>anywhere</i> else on the Web.\nYour site uses A+B+C, site 2 uses A+D+E, site 3 uses B+F, site 4 uses C. The cache contents is A+B+C+D+E+F+... did the user visit your site? \nIt&#x27;s like trying to get individual pictures out of a single piece of film that was exposed multiple times - you can make some guesses and rule some possibilities out, but nothing other than that will be conclusive.')
