If you have any recommendations for long-term public data archival they would be greatly appreciated.  OSF recently instituted a 50 GB cap which rules out publishing many types of raw data, and subscription options (AWS, Dropbox, etc.) will lead to link rot when the uploading author changes jobs or retires, or the project&#x27;s money runs out.  Sure, publishing summary spreadsheets is a good first step, but there should be a public place for video and other large data files.  IPFS was previously suggested but the data still needs to be hosted somewhere.  Maybe YouTube is the best option, despite transcoding?')
