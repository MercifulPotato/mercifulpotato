Based on fairy tales, where a little girl tries to save her grandfather. Expect Evil Witches<p>- All the adventure games from Humongous Entertainment: Pajama sam, Spy Fox and Freddi Fish. Those are children point and click games created by Secret of Monkey Island&#x27;s creator Ron Gilbert.<p>- Broken Age<p>- Machinarium and Chuchel. In general all games from Amanita Design are just cute and fun to play<p>- The Book of Unwritten Tales (1 &amp; 2 + the critter chronicles), I think this would be more appropriate for 10-12 years old but this is a great homage to fantasy books<p>I&#x27;d recommend you visit <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adventuregamers.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adventuregamers.com&#x2F;</a>, they have great reviews of point and click games')
