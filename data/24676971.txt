Item(by='sho', descendants=None, kids=[24677832], score=None, time=1601793876, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24676645, text='&gt; China can be more efficient than all democratic countries<p>Not <i>all</i> democratic countries. I live in Thailand, which is at least technically a democracy, and the virus has been completely extinguished here. The crackdown was harsh - a month of curfew! - but it worked, and the public was largely on board. Life is back to normal here, with the addition of masks, for which there is 100% compliance - I just don&#x27;t understand how the US acts against its own interests in that regard. The virus has been crushed. And it&#x27;s the same in Singapore, after a couple of hiccups. Hell, Thailand is re-opening to tourism!<p>China isn&#x27;t 100% autocracy, anyway. There&#x27;s a very very large gap between China and, say, North Korea, or even Soviet Russia. You can definitely make the case though that the &quot;pure democracy free for all&quot; model like the USA, with its totally unrestricted (and possibly harmful in the age of social media) free speech, has certainly lost if not prestige, then at least the status of the model of governance other countries should aspire to. I would say the USA&#x27;s handling of COVID19 has been a big wake-up call to pretty much every other democracy of what can happen when &quot;freedom&quot; goes too far.')
