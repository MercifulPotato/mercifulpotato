The nation is nearly split into 50:50 anyways in the last few decades and it&#x27;s getting more and more divided. Both sides will be happy, and we can compete in parallel and see which system will win. This way, at least, those leftism will not fight for liberal agenda with money from other hard working people&#x27;s pocket. Please leave them alone, they&#x27;re already taxed enough and did their share for your dreaming welfare society.')
