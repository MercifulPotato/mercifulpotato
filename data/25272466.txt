S3. RDS (with or without Aurora). ECS and ECR. It takes and manages a lot of complexity for you.<p>(DigitalOcean, to its credit, has offerings in those spaces -- they have an object store, they have hosted databases, they have a container service. And I use DigitalOcean for some personal products. But you can actually run a Postgres DB on AWS Aurora Serverless for cheaper than you can run one on DigitalOcean, depending on your workload. It&#x27;s not obvious that DigitalOcean is a better choice there.)')
