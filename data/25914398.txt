Item(by='tvb', descendants=None, kids=[25914631], score=None, time=1611658264, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25914159, text='Look for any vintage caesium clock made by National, Varian, Hewlett-Packard &#x2F; Agilent &#x2F; Symmetricom &#x2F; Microsemi &#x2F; Microchip, FEI, FTS &#x2F; Austron &#x2F; DATUM, Oscilloquartz, and maybe others. None of them are a restricted item because of a &quot;radio-isotope&quot;. Again, cesium 133 is not a radioactive isotope. Atomic timekeeping is based on ultra-precise quantum mechanics, not random nuclear radioactive delay.<p>Just take your time. Some of us look for months and even years before we find one worth the eBay risk.<p>There is one fact to consider. I have heard that the 5071A clock is still ITAR classified. It&#x27;s not because of &quot;atomic&quot; or &quot;cesium&quot;, but because the internal design is so advanced that the US decided it was essentially like a military weapon.<p>If in doubt look for vintage models like 5060, 5061, 5062, or 4050, 4060, 4065 instead of the still current model 5071.')
