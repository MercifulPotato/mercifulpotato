Item(by='r4tn4l', descendants=None, kids=[25766969], score=None, time=1610561558, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25762715, text='I didn&#x27;t read all comments, just searched for &quot;delete&quot; and &quot;remove&quot; without success. My question is, if I can delete a record. I find that quite important, since I just created one called &quot;bla&quot; with nonsense, and then internally panicked slightly. If I try it tomorrow, I will just recycle my record for something useful, so a workaround exists. But I still think, deletion is somewhat crucial.<p>Apart from that, some other things I stumbled over:\n- The icon is hard to see on my background, because it contains (too thin) black lines and transparent pixels. Give me some contrast!<p>- The &quot;House&quot; for &quot;Snap to now&quot; feels unintuitive, but that is subjective. How about a text label, so you don&#x27;t need an icon?<p>- That &quot;Calendar&quot; icon for &quot;Select Timerange&quot; as well.<p>- &quot;Step forward&quot; is one day forward. How about naming it.. more like what it is. A step is a generic thing that might be differently perceived, a day isn&#x27;t (so much).<p>- &quot;Start Record&quot; and &quot;New Record&quot; are pretty similar features. I do understand the difference, but I would enjoy more, if those two were simplified into just one in an intelligent way.<p>- That burger menu is, pardon me, somewhat of a problem. There is so much information. I can see &quot;Install App&quot; in the installed App. &quot;Export&quot; happens there but also on the main screen. Which features belong where? Im missing a hierarchy here.<p>- Your hint text in the &quot;Manage tags&quot; dialog is too long. Please build it in a way, where I do have to read less words. More like 5 or so (currently there are around 50).<p>- Is that a refresh button next to the burger menu (left side)? I can click an empty button. Wait, what?<p>- I really do like that infinite scroll and stuff. Looks cool. On the other hand it is quite easy to get lost. Maybe some snapping on day-level (rather than hour-level) might help.<p>- Please don&#x27;t require headings over button groups at all (and then even mix that with my initials!)')
