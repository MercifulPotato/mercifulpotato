I was using the Developer Edition and the last two years the performance is really suspect. I don&#x27;t have a million tabs open, don&#x27;t have a ton of add-ons running and it still lags horribly, crashes and new tabs take forever to open<p>I thought at first it was either my network connection or maybe a system issue. Switched to Opera and was like, &quot;Nah man, it was definitely the browser.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m in the same book with my calendar. I have multiple calendars several family members share. I tried using outlook.com calendars and although I prefer their UI, it wouldn&#x27;t import Google calendars.<p>If you have any recommendations, I&#x27;m all ears.
