All I&#x27;m &quot;demanding&quot; is that white supremacists are no longer allowed to oppose this through outdated xenophobic institutions, including contrived citizenship requirements.<p>Fortunately, most European governments and the EU share this view and have taken bold steps to ensuring a future where Europe is for everyone. I would love this process to be accelerated so that I may see it in my lifetime, but I&#x27;m humbled that, by current trends, a &quot;European&quot; minority will be realised in many of these countries by the end of the century.')
