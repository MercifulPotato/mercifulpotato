If you&#x27;re familiar with SF, it&#x27;s nothing like the Tenderloin but more like SOMA-lite.<p>In addition, shootings are way up. For context, there were 39 total in 2019. In the summer of 2020, we had 40 consecutive days of shootings. Further, the local DA has also adopted the mindset of not prosecuting &quot;low level&quot; crimes of any theft under $750.<p>Sacrificing what makes Austin compelling is <i>not</i> the way to go.')
