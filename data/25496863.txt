And I&#x27;m not sure we can get a consensus that the .Net BCL can be considered &quot;ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation&quot;.<p>That rule comes from a time when half the software written was still writing its own string and linked list data structures&#x2F;classes. Now people just use standard libraries.')
