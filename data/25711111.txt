Item(by='snoshy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610258418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25696607, text='First, I&#x27;d like to express appreciation for a thoughtful and nuanced comment about how this might apply to space, and the boundaries of (extraterritorial?) law.  This feels like a remarkably poignant summary of the issues involved, at least to an amateur.<p>While you did carve out the exceptions earlier for (my summary) laws essentially being created in reaction to actual events occurring, I think this misses some novel aspects at hand here.  Citizenship, and by proxy the (choice?) of personal jurisdiction for persons born on another celestial body are certainly not issues that maritime law can provide absolute analogies for, if these realities come to pass with long term inhabitation.<p>As I think your comment implies, OST is wholly insufficient for any of these new problems, and so it does seem clear that there is a need to resolve ambiguities that might result from these scenarios via new international space agreements.  How might we expect those to play out?<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that ratification of OST (wholly or partially) might perhaps bring some standing to the issues at play, but there&#x27;s really not all that much preventing a dissenting government from exiting it as well, despite international (Earth) condemnation.  Orphaned citizens in space?  Might sound crazy, but the fall of the Soviet Union did result in exactly this scenario for an astronaut that had to go through a harrowing survival situation for a very long time until things were resolved down on Earth.')
