It will happen everywhere where you look and drastically different from anything the local population has ever seen before.<p>Only certain places have a unique culture where such treatment is deliberately frowned upon culturally. We are from the west so equality seems normal but it is not the default. If you decide to live in Asia, expect the default, it&#x27;s not actually racist; it&#x27;s normal.<p>Generally you just don&#x27;t like being treated as a foreigner. But that&#x27;s actually what you are. Don&#x27;t expect to travel to another place and have them treat you as a local.')
