Except it is worse, because my firewall software don&#x27;t track IPv6 changes so breaks whenever the device gets a new IP (say new prefix).<p>When exposing services to the internet it&#x27;s even more PITA since each device needs a DynDNS client configured, whereas with IPv4 just the router needs one for my single public IP.<p>IPv6 on the LAN is quite a pita due to the massive &quot;random&quot; prefix, gone are the days of easy addresses like 10.0.0.12.  Yeah I guess I could just use the local address space but what does that really bring over the IPv4 that I know?<p>And then there&#x27;s the software that just doesn&#x27;t follow the times. My router just doesn&#x27;t handle getting a new prefix. Yeah OK the initial IPv6 wet dream was for an eternal prefix. But clearly that&#x27;s been unrealistic for quite some time, and sadly not all software has caught up.<p>I will admit that some of it is probably down to me learning more. But I struggle to find the motivation. There&#x27;s no &quot;killer app&quot;, just a lot of pain so far.')
