I assume this came from early plastics that were brittle and started to replace metal parts. But the science of plastics have come so far, we have plastics that are incredibly durable while still being lightweight. However many manufacturers are sticking to metal and glass for that &quot;premium look and feed&quot; even if it is heavier and less durable.<p>Another issue might be the variety of plastic qualities that are hard to tell apart from a quick impression. Something that our launch followed by rush to quick reviews society can&#x27;t adequately test. Glass and especially metals tend to have more predictable durability profiles.<p>I think the main problem that we haven&#x27;t solved in plastics is hardness, so glass screens are here to stay, but I wish we could move away from this plastic == low quality perception. I think it would result in better products at then end of the day.')
