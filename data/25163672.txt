If welders made &gt; 300k&#x2F;year, surely they wouldn&#x27;t be in short supply anymore.  Why isn&#x27;t there simply a wage&#x2F;price signal to compensate for this? \n It&#x27;s not like medicine that requires 6-8 years of school, and years more of practice to fill certain positions (where additional constraints are the schools and hospital residencies limited capacity).  For welders, labor supply should be fairly easy and quick to remedy.')
