In the United States, an average of nine million prisoners are released back into the community each year. 48 Unfortunately, “about two-thirds (67.8%) of released prisoners were arrested for a new crime within 3 years, and three-quarters (76.6%) were arrested within 5 years.” 49 Over a five-year study of state prisoners released in thirty states, almost 1.2 million arrests occurred, and 16.1% of these arrests were attributable to released prisoners. 50 Norway, on the other hand, has the lowest reoffending rate of all the Nordic countries; about one-fifth of ex-prisoners reoffend within two years of release, contrasted with a rate of 24–31% for other Nordic countries. 51 Comparing the United States’ 67.8% to Norway’s approximately twenty percent paints a bleak picture for the United States.')
