But the meat replacement (ie similar protein to meat) burgers are more expensive.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why mcdonalds would bother making a meat replacement burger, its fast food so they can just use flavouring to make it <i>taste</i> like meat without incurring the expense of adding protein. It probably will be cheap.<p>As a plus side their customers will still be starving for protein afterwards. Large fries please!')
