Indeed Nietzsche would have been mortally offended by the entire postmodern project, the forerunners of which he clearly believed to be inspired by decadence and <i>ressentiment</i>. Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;there are no facts, only interpretations&quot; goes much deeper than postmodernist ideas about moral relativism or whatever: Nietzsche denies that there is (or at least that we have the grounds to believe in) any such thing as responsibility, guilt, will, causality, Being, or even <i>identity</i>, both in the personal sense and the logical sense.<p>His focus instead is that, given the essential failure of metaphysics, to instead try to destroy as many as the &#x27;old idols&#x27; rooted in these cognitive biases and value judgements - to see to what extent life could endure the incorporation of small-t truth (Nietzsche suspected that many errors were actually necessary for life) - and to re-evaluate our values with the (arbitrary!) view of increasing the health of the human animal. And he makes clear that this depends on the person: &quot;the exception should not try to become the rule.&quot; Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy is explicitly not for everyone.<p>In terms of practical life advice, Nietzsche ends on somewhat common ground with the Stoics -<p>&gt; My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary—but love it.')
