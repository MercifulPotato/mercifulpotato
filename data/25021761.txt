It&#x27;s environmental.<p>In reality, twin studies and adoption studies have shown a large genetic component.<p>We don&#x27;t even need twin studies to know this.  It <i>must</i> be true unless you&#x27;re a young-earth creationist.  If there wasn&#x27;t genetic variability in criminality, humans wouldn&#x27;t have been capable of evolving to be so much less violent than other primates.<p>(And of course, disparities in male&#x2F;female behavior is obviously biological.)<p>&gt; I haven&#x27;t studied the demographic data at length recently, but fairly sure that your assertion does not hold for high income blacks.<p>In fact, it does hold in higher income brackets too.  And I&#x27;d bet whites are more violent than Asians after controlling for income, too.')
