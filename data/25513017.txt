Item(by='kmeisthax', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608682722, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25509667, text='I think you&#x27;re confusing Switch and 3DS. They changed the Switch so that most games can be cloud-saved, and it&#x27;ll automatically copy your saves if you have two systems with the same games on them. Game licenses also carry with you if you&#x27;re online with multiple systems, and the offline half of the license can be remotely revoked and transferred.<p>Animal Crossing and Pokemon are outliers. The former has a backup system that only can be used if you call Nintendo customer support. If you plan your transfer ahead of time you can do it yourself, 3DS-style, but it took them multiple updates to implement that. (Part of this is because the island is owned by the system, not individual users, which is an odd design choice.) I have no idea how Game Freak expects you to keep your Pokemon saves safe.')
