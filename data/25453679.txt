If it&#x27;s nonfiction, it&#x27;s usually on the higher end, and if it&#x27;s fiction, usually on the lower end, but again, it depends on the narrator themself.<p>In addition, I read when doing <i>everything</i>. Exercise? Reading a book. Washing dishes? Reading a book. Commuting to work? Reading a book.<p>A regular-sized book is between 10-20 hours of listening time. If you listen at 2.5x speed, that&#x27;s around 7.5-12.5 hours-ish. If you commute 30 minutes a day each way, and <i>only</i> listen in your commute, that&#x27;s already a book almost every week. Add in doing chores, exercise, etc, and you&#x27;re getting a lot of reading time.<p>(For the record: 2 kids ages 2 and 4, and I read about 90-100 books a year, ranging from short books to long epic fantasies. But I also listen to podcasts quite a bit so that cuts down &quot;reading&quot; time as well.)')
