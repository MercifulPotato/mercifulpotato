Not in mine.<p>&gt; trying to educate people on making as authentic a cheese as possible<p>That&#x27;s the problem. It&#x27;s never going to be authentic. These kind of cheeses are not just about a recipe; they&#x27;re also about the ingredients. I don&#x27;t recall the specific details for grana padano, but to give you an example, the &quot;prosciutto di Parma&quot; is made from pigs who eat a specific type of food that derives from a specific process involving a specific breed of cows (in the nearby area), etc.<p>You can&#x27;t simply substitute the ingredient and think that it&#x27;s going to be the same. It&#x27;s not. And yet, you think it&#x27;s &quot;authentic&quot;.')
