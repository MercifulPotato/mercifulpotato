I want to make it a point to read the whole paper but I think I am a slower-than-average reader and I am able to read 5-6 articles in close to half an hour.<p>How do you manage to read your newspaper daily? Do you read the full-thing? Have you trained yourself to be a fast reader? Do you have any advice on how I can read quicker? I often read out aloud and that seems to help but quite likely it makes me slower.')
