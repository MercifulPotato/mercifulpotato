There&#x27;s no way to hold North Korean state-backed phishing&#x2F;criminal hacking groups accountable without disconnecting North Korea from the Internet or going to war with them. Similar issues apply to curtailing online crime committed by Russian mafia entities, as they are well connected to the Russian government.<p>An alternative strategy would be to crack down on the money laundering channels used by criminal entities to get money from their victims, but this would be politically difficult as it would involve shutting down grey-market banks that are well used by the ultra wealthy to evade taxes and pay bribes.')
