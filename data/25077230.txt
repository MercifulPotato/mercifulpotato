The Developer ID code signing program is not analogous to web certs. The usage of these certs is entirely different.<p>Apps installed on a user&#x27;s Mac are expected to run indefinitely, essentially forever. Developer ID signing certs do expire, but expiration only affects their ability to sign new app versions, it doesn&#x27;t prevent old versions signed with the cert from running. The expired cert is still considered valid when you launch the app on a Mac.<p>When you connect to foo.com on the web, the server can use any valid cert. Certs get replaced quite frequently, often yearly. If you put a new cert on the server and revoke the old one, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily harm web users, because they can make new connections with the new cert. But if a Developer ID cert is revoked, then macOS immediately (on OCSP check) prevents any app <i>ever</i> signed with that cert from launching, and calls it &quot;malware&quot;. (The main purpose of Developer ID is to stop the spread of malware.) Even if the app has been installed on the user&#x27;s machine for a long time, the app will no longer run. Revoking a Developer ID cert is a remote kill switch for Mac apps. This is why revocation of Developer ID certs is so destructive, and is almost always reserved only for malware.<p>The analogy with web CAs simply does not hold here.<p>Until this HP case, I&#x27;ve never heard of a 3rd party developer requesting that a Developer ID cert be revoked. All cases I&#x27;ve heard of are when Apple revokes the cert of a malware writer, which obviously the malware writer did not request.<p>A remote kill switch for Mac apps is extremely destructive, which is why only Apple has the power to revoke the Developer ID certs, which they should only do for a very good reason, such as malware.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that Developer ID is a requirement that Apple imposed on third party developers, purportedly for security purposes. We developers never wanted this, but we had no choice. Again, none of this is really under our control, it&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s program, and Apple is the sole CA for Mac app certs.')
