Better screen. Bigger battery. Better speakers. Better mics (although I don&#x27;t know how much I would buy this one as &#x27;studio quality&#x27; is silly). A &quot;USB Power Port&quot;. The fan will make the MBP perform without throttling a lot longer than the air.<p>The price difference is minor for all that IMO.')
