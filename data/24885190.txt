For the same reason that building a new browser engine is a ton of work, maintaining a fork of an old engine is a ton of work. Take that from someone who has spent a lot of time backporting security fixes for old versions of Firefox in Debian stable back when Debian was <i>not</i> updating to new major versions of Firefox ESR (back when Debian was still calling it Iceweasel).')
