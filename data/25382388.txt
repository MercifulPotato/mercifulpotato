It&#x27;s hard to hold a job when you have no place to shower or keep your belongings;<p>2.  Homeless shelters are frightening, dangerous places and many (myself included) preferred to sleep rough than risk their lives in one of those places;<p>3.  Food banks&#x2F;Soup kitchens, etc. are few and far between.  I shoplifted and ate out of garbage cans when I had to do so;<p>4.  If you have no fixed address or documentation, it&#x27;s hard to get stuff like food stamps or other assistance.<p>It&#x27;s been 35 years since I was in that situation, but it&#x27;s an experience I will never forget.  <i>No one</i> should be put in that situation.  Ever.<p>You have no idea what it is to be penniless and homeless. And for your sake, I hope you never have to learn the hard way.<p>Unfortunately, because of the callous, calculating disregard of the US Senate, many folks in the US have and many more will learn the lessons I did.<p>More&#x27;s the pity.')
