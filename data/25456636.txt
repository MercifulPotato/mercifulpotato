That&#x27;s still only like ~20% of what Mozilla brings in, and I find it unlikely that Mozilla could ever raise that much without driving away users with the annoying ads. That&#x27;s not a problem for wikipedia because there&#x27;s hardly a replacement for wikipedia, but there&#x27;s tons of replacement browsers.')
