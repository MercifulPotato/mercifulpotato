Serious commentary is swallowed by the endless sea of nazism and nazi-adjacent rhetoric.<p>There is no going back to pre-2016 times, it&#x27;s seriously over. It&#x27;s not even full of 20-somethings anymore, it has aged significantly.<p>As for a lack of filtering, that&#x27;s not a thing, either.

There is a serious manipulation effort.<p>Just as an aside, there is no need for them to lie about &#x2F;pol&#x2F; is. &#x2F;pol&#x2F; is less outrageous today because of the election, but here are some gems from &#x2F;pol&#x2F; a week ago:<p>&gt;A post about running over protesters and how hilarious that is\n&gt;Abrahamic religion is a jewish plot to destroy the white race by turning them away from paganism\n&gt;The FBI is a tool of the radical left in order to destroy America, you should get ready to kill protesters\n&gt;People that are making fun of the hunter biden tapes are &quot;tranny shills&quot; trying to make us queer to destroy our masculinity<p>There is hardly any need to lie.
