I think your analogy is flawed:<p>OP disparages people in my sister&#x27;s line of work as &quot;bottom-feeders&quot;, which is just a more euphemistic, if not cowardly, way of saying &#x27;parasite&#x27;, or &#x27;scum&#x27;. My point is to draw attention to the decent people who work as recruiters (I&#x27;m implicitly holding my sister here as the archetype of a good person) and expose the original insult as unwarranted. An axe murderer is clearly someone who is indefensible, so could never be invoked as a positive example in argument with a statement like &quot;Axe-murders are the worst people ever!&quot;<p>Also, an &#x27;axe murderer&#x27; is a caricature of a real murderer, used in comedy, horror films etc..., and not a honest counterexample to my sister.<p>But I digress..., thanks for the note on Totem Poles, I was unaware!')
