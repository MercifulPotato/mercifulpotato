Depending on the colour, I’ve loaded them up with various songs that match my mood (Red for Romantic, Blue for Sad, Black for Darkwave, Gold for Retro eighties&#x2F;nineties, <i>&amp; cetera</i>) and I’ve occasionally dropped one into my girlfriend’s bag as one used to do with mix-tapes, particularly when she was heading off on a long trip of some kind.<p>It’s such a sad shame that they killed them off (and insist on the music-as-a-service model rather than the prior music-as-a-product or the even earlier pre-iTunes Rip&#x2F;Mix&#x2F;Burn).')
