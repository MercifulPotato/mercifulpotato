I don&#x27;t. You think there&#x27;s something between the lines of his words, but that&#x27;s just speculation. If you&#x27;re going to make a claim so grand as the sitting president was inciting insurrection, you need more than speculation.<p>My honest opinion is that Trump wanted a BIG rally to demonstrate that he had a lot of support to make the idea that he lost to Biden seem absurd. He used this reasoning over and over again, even in his call with the GA SoS.<p>Occam&#x27;s Razor makes that far easier to believe than that he wanted people to take over the capitol building. Beyond just sounding like crazed conspiracy, it doesn&#x27;t even make any sense to do. What is he gonna do with a building? Like, what if they managed to take congresspeople or senators hostage? How in the world would that lead to maintaining his hold on power?<p>Sorry, it just sounds like a bunch of conspiratorial claptrap to me, along the lines of the stuff I hear from the right with their Q and Lin Wood nonsense. The crazy thing is that it&#x27;s become institutionalized on the left in the MSM. It&#x27;s bonkers.')
