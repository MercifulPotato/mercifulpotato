Keep your identity small. “I’m not the kind of person who does things like that” is not an explanation, it’s a trap. It prevents nerds from working out and men from dancing.<p>At the same time, identity can be used for positive change. My family values balance and as a result I&#x27;ve grown into a renaissance man.<p>I&#x27;m at the time of my life (college, looking for internships) where balance isn&#x27;t something I need.
