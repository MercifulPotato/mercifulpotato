They pay less than minimum wage in most markets, and, in most markets, that is not enough to pay the costs of a car plus a human.<p>&gt; These business models are ways of draining capital from the economy and putting them into the hands of a few investors and executives. They prey on desperate people who need money now, even if the money is insufficient to pay their total costs. Drivers are draining their own reserves to get cash now, but, hey, they gotta eat and pay the bills.<p>&gt; This sharing economy shit works in a shitty economy. In a good economy, where people have what they need, it doesn’t work.')
