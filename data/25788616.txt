It makes no sense for them to add the touchbar to the base model 13&quot; MBPs only to remove them from the higher end versions. It makes even less sense to add more ports which aren&#x27;t USB-C, as the bits about MagSafe and no dongles imply. Further, I don&#x27;t understand what is meant by &quot;iPhone 12 like&quot; non-curvy design - I have a 2018 MBP 15&quot;, and the sides of this thing are pretty flat and not curved.<p>I mean, these features sound like a dream come true, but I&#x27;m having a hard time believing them.')
