If a forum has bad mods, other forums are on a bit more equal footing as competitors. The discussion thread format is also less prone to bad moderation than reddit&#x27;s link&#x2F;image focused post threads are, and usually also forces the mods to actually participate in the community. Plus if someone breaks a forum rule other than one related to creating threads, other users can come scold them for it more easily (necroing is a common example).<p>Reddit isn&#x27;t built for community discussion and is getting worse at it as the admins try to turn it into instagram.')
