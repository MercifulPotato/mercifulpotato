Item(by='download13', descendants=None, kids=[24693579, 24693988, 24692835], score=None, time=1601935724, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24686247, text='Basically anything by Greg Egan is great.<p>His early short stories have a lot of &quot;drugs can let your brain talk to other dimensions&quot; and &quot;your mind literally makes reality&quot; (though some of those are also really good, &quot;The Infinite Assassin&quot; is a great read and it&#x27;s only like 15 pages), but his later full books are basically all hard (if speculative) physics stuff.<p>Dichronauts is difficult to get your head around, but very rewarding. It&#x27;s about cartographers who work in a universe with essentially 2.5 dimensions of space and 1.5 dimensions of time.<p>The Orthogonal trilogy is about a species living in a toroidal universe where all 4 dimensions are identical and interchangeable.<p>The universes of Diaspora, Schild&#x27;s Ladder, and Incandescence are set in a future when most intelligent life in the galaxy lives in a network of space-computers and interact with the outside world via robots and programmable matter.<p>Oh and I almost forgot the Bobiverse series. Not by Egan, but still good. Some guy gets stuck in a brain-computer and sent off in a self-replicating space probe to prepare other planets for human colonization.')
