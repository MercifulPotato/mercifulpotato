She sent email to large group of employees which violated some standards expected from a manager by Google. She is giving all the information except for what exactly she did. It&#x27;s ironic that she is in &quot;ethics business&quot; but at the same time not realizing that it&#x27;s unethical to withhold what she did while launching attacks on everyone.')
