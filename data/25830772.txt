Every paragraph in the article from “so again” onwards is about performativity.<p>An example of performativity, from the book but not mentioned in the article—Gatsby’s house has bookshelves filled with books, presumably never read, only there for decoration. Gatsby is <i>performing the part</i> of being rich. Since Americans do not have nobility, we take our performance cues (how to act upper class) by imitating Europeans. It’s a hundred years later and we <i>still</i> imitate Europeans and ape European culture when we want to pretend to be rich and upper-class.')
