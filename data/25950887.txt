RH probably figured there&#x27;s no point in integrating all the way to the end if no one would normally use it.<p>Same with doing your own clearing, there&#x27;s complexity involved with clearing and maybe you don&#x27;t want to implement it all yourself when someone does it better for cheaper.<p>It&#x27;s like asking why we don&#x27;t all program in assembly all the time, or even have the option to mix assembly into our high level code. It&#x27;s just nice having layers of abstraction that handle the annoying stuff for you, even if there&#x27;s a minor cost. Why have complexity you don&#x27;t expect to need?')
