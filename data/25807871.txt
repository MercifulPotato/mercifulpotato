I&#x27;ve seen artists gravitating towards more expensive paints as a sign of better pigmentation which is completely misplaced. Pricing of pigments is largely a complex equation including marketing by paint manufacturers to pose Cadmiums and Chromiums as &quot;premium&quot; quality paints. The truth couldn&#x27;t be farther from that. Modern synthetic pigments are superior, safer and have far better lightfastness than the Cadmiums and Chromiums. Perylene red is amazing. Mix it with a dash of Titanium white and you can get very close to the opacity of Cadmiums. Mix it with Zinc white and you&#x27;ve got a far more brilliant red than anything else. But, Artists&#x27; I&#x27;ve worked with tend to gullibly gravitating towards the more expensive == better philosophy. I found this hilarious when buying paint during my early days in art world.<p>The quality of paint is measured by several characteristics such as pigment load, lightfastness, opacity&#x2F;transparency, tinting strength, etc. Not its scarcity in nature.')
