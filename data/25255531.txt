I know it has been in trials and appears to be safe but I personally don&#x27;t think enough time has passed to properly make that determination.<p>I feel is that it has been less than a year since the pandemic was declared and the fact that a vaccine using new synthetic RNA technology that has never been used before is being promoted before studying the long term effects is scary as hell.<p>How many years did we use Antibiotics before it became apperant that over-use results in super bugs?<p>There have been many other novel medications that have turned out to be less than good after they were studied over a longer duration of time. I am worried in 5 or 10 years from now, a whole bunch of people are going to get some new type of autoimmune disease, or liver cancer, or their yet to be concieved kids will get it, or something I can&#x27;t even imagine right now.<p>I hope I am wrong and that everything works out but I feel this whole situation could use some sober second thought before jumping in head first and dose-ing a large percentage of the human species so quickly with a novel technology.<p><i></i>* Edit: I would also like to see antibody tests being done prior to vaccination as already having antibodies might result in negative reactions that were not studied in the current trials, not to mention the effect it would have on the statistics that will be used as a metric to encourage more people to get jabbed.')
