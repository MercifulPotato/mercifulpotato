For two of those I use a managed database service (AWS RDS &#x2F; AWS Aurora Postgres) because they drive mission critical high value products &#x2F; services and I wouldn&#x27;t consider using a standalone install of Postgres. For other apps that are not so mission critical I am perfectly happy saving considerable money and running them on a VPS on AWS EC2 or Digital Ocean or Linode. So ultimately it depends on the app and the risk tolerance for Recovery Time Objective and Recovery Point Objective.')
