E-ink the company has tied up the tech stack in so many patents, NDA&#x27;s, and exorbitant prices that no one wants to touch it. E-ink the technology wont go any where for 10-15 years  when that next big batch of patents expire. Its just like 3D displays and VR there will be a massive consumer push new batches of patents will be filed progress will grind to a halt as no-one can afford everyone else&#x27;s patent licensing fees on a unproven market until the next wave expires and better products can be built again repeat')
