So repeating myself, people can see this Dacia with its 225km range with a 26.8 kWh battery can be had at just under 18k Euros, they can walk up market and at each stage make a determination in their head as to whether the manufacturer is actually offering a good deal. This is going to put more pressure on those who under perform on range as there are a few just over 300km range at very steep price points')
