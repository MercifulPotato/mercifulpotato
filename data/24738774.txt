This is an order of magnitude cheaper (per unit of energy storage capacity) than storing it above ground.  CAES also uses underground storage, and for the same reason.   Trying to use CAES with above-ground storage for seasonal load leveling would be even more ludicrous.<p>But in any case, the energy density argument I made is independent of just where the compressed gases are being stored.')
