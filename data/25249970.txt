Rather than this clear black and white dichotomy of non-drugs vs. drugs, good vs. bad, safe vs. harmful, non-hallucinogenic vs. hallucinogenic, there&#x27;s a lot of nuance and every substance has its own risks vs. benefits to be considered, understood, and respected.  This extends well beyond &quot;drugs&quot;, the same can be said of food, exercise, sports, relationships... it&#x27;s life.')
