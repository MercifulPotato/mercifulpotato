There&#x27;s no &quot;calling&quot; or any sort of &quot;person A would like to talk to person B, person C may or may not be welcome&quot; sort of thing. People just click on a voice channel and they&#x27;re in.<p>Other services have tried the same thing I guess (Hangouts did something kind of similar), but everything adds up to a completely different feeling around voice chat. It feels more like walking into a room with people hanging out than it does dialing someone&#x27;s number and all the low-level anxiety that goes along with it.')
