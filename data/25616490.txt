So no, you can&#x27;t just use Stylus.<p>My first impressions are that Stylus is nice for applying big site-wide styles like dark themes, but this is vastly superior for all the small customizations that you might want to make to sites you frequently visit. No need to go deep into the CSS; just right click a thing and open the sidebar and make it look how you want. Not even close to Stylus. Definitely something I&#x27;m going to keep, and makes for a very powerful combination paired with uBlock Origin&#x27;s element picker&#x2F;zapper.')
