Why is that? It seems to only abstract away the initial mission of the company to a board of directors who may not share the same goals, and lead the company towards a slow death as investors have their turn at trying to make what they can from it in the short term. Would a company like Google actually be better off now if it hadn&#x27;t IPO&#x27;d and was still following it&#x27;s mission?')
