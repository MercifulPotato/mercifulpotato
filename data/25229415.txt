And after 50 years, we&#x27;re both out of time for the slow-and-steady approach and we also have technology that has major real-world adoption.<p>Good-faith actors are hurt by this, but there&#x27;s no real alternative short of A) letting corporate campaigns control the agenda, or B) fixing our political system so corporate money isn&#x27;t so effective at influencing politics. It&#x27;s an unhappy situation with no easy solutions.')
