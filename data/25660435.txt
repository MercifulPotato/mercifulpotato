Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25660675], score=None, time=1609956740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25660371, text='&gt;But Bob isn&#x27;t getting the tax bill, which is my point. The tax bill is going to Famous Writer, who is most certainly going to contest the bill, and will probably win. Now the IRS doesn&#x27;t get their money, so they are not satisfied.<p>Why would it go to Famous Writer? I skimmed the article and it only say the author on the product page is Famous Writer. If Famous Writer wrote it, but then signed over all the rights to Bob&#x27;s Books LLC, then Famous Writer would be the author, but all the proceeds&#x2F;tax bills will go to Bob&#x27;s Books LLC.<p>As for why bother impersonating Famous Writer in the first place? Probably because an unheard of author selling $500,000 worth of books for $500&#x2F;each would be suspicious, but if he was famous it would be less so.')
