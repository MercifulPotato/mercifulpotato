Either you enjoy struggling over mintuae or you have given your mind over to people who will program you with headlines (&quot;... and why that&#x27;s a problem.&quot;).  Remember, <i>you</i> replied to <i>me</i>.  You have conceded that you do not have a reasonable stance, but you will stubbornly hold onto it based on some nebulous tautology that it is that way because someone said it is that way ... which is irrational enough for me to reject it.<p>Only witches support the idea that there are no witches, and we know what to do with witches, don&#x27;t we?  That&#x27;s the historical precedent for the thought process you&#x27;re trying to foist upon me.  I recollect only a paraphrasing of a routine on how bad propaganda is laughably bad on its surface.  It&#x27;s purpose is not to convince, but to make you admit to yourself you have no reason to believe it, but also realize that you will repeat the propaganda anyway ... <i>or else</i>.<p>Having asserted to me that milk is racist, you will not be drinking it in the future, or purchasing it, I suppose.')
