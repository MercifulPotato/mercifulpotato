Then Green will be ON.<p>When Green is ON, &amp; is going to switch off, it will start blinking &amp; then off, &amp; then yellow will start blinking. Its ok to drive through blinking green or yellow if safe. But common training os drive through blinking Green, but if you see blinking Yellow, then stop.<p>Plus, some of the lights have counter. It shows how many seconds are remaining for the lit color. An experiment led the Bombay Municipality to install Noise Sensors are one busy traffic light with counter. Every time there is a Red Light, &amp; counter is less than 10, normally people start getting impatient &amp; start honking to force the front ones to move. But on this light, if the noise is above certain decibel while Red, the counter resets.')
