I at least don&#x27;t and I prefer them to have a slow rollout leading to a stable product once released then a rushed rollout.<p>&gt; but the amount of money I pay to host multiple domains for mail and for their VPN<p>I agree that their price for people with many custom domains is high, but then lets be honest most people (I know, in my experience) have sometimes a custom domain very rarely two and hardly ever more. So my guess is for most users it&#x27;s reasonable priced.')
