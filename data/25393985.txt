IE is a very good example of that.<p>Not sure what the example of IE would entail. IE was insanely popular during its prime of 2006-2008. Even today, Chrome has not captured as much of the market as IE6 did at that time.<p>It was only years of neglect (i.e nearly the entire IE6 team was reassigned to other projects), and governmental intervention that allowed other browsers to even have a significant plurality.<p>So yes, you can win merely by being bundled for free with another popular product.<p>If Slack for instance just came preinstalled on iOS&#x2F;OSX, then people would have standardized on it so long as it was also available on Windows.')
