Seems like a good thing to put near a windmill (or a fusion plant if we ever get there) so we can use existing infrastructure and switch from pumping billion-year-old carbon into to atmosphere to just pumping last-decade carbon into the atmosphere.<p>The wood chips thing is interesting. In the last five weeks I&#x27;ve filled as many trash totes with leaves from the neighbor&#x27;s tree. I wonder how that mass of carbon compares with the gas I&#x27;ve burned for heat this winter.')
