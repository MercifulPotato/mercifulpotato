Certbot is a complex beast that generates TLS configurations, has multiple plugins that likely require specific system configuration, and is I think charitably more than &quot;a glorified Python script&quot;.<p>Yeah, it is complex.  Far too complex for what it does.<p>What it does is implement a not particularly complex IETF protocol between your server and letsencrypt&#x27;s servers, and run a few of your scripts when the protocol wants something done, like &quot;install DNS entry&quot;.<p>In fact the protocol is so simple a bash script can do it.  Dehydrated <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dehydrated.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dehydrated.io&#x2F;</a> is just that - a bash script that implements ACME.  It also is in Debian.  I moved to dehydrated when certbot was slow to implement DNS wildcards.<p>The nice thing about simplicity is it infects everything else: the document becomes simple, which is nice because I had to read certbot&#x27;s doco several times just to figure out what scenario would work for me.  And distribution packaging becomes simple, so no snap&#x27;s needed.  And installation becomes simple.')
