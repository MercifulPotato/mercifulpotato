I&#x27;ve heard people complain that the cashier at the grocery store asks &quot;How are you doing?&quot;. &quot;They don&#x27;t really care, why do they ask!&quot;<p>As a Brit I feel this way, I personally don&#x27;t ask someone how they&#x27;re doing unless I&#x27;m interested in the answer, but the rhetorical <i>How are you doing?</i> is used plenty in Britain.<p><i>How do you do?</i> has fallen out of common usage but traditionally the proper response was <i>How do you do?</i>')
