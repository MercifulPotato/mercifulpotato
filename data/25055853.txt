Item(by='laughinghan', descendants=None, kids=[25056025], score=None, time=1605073768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25055634, text='Thank you for clarifying, makes much more sense.<p><i>Because the only way to do price finding is to make an offer and have customers accept it. [...] So selling with a low (or free) price does not give you any moral rights later to say it was too low, give me more.</i><p>You&#x27;re thinking of this in a very narrow way.<p>If I tell you &quot;here, have this for free, no strings attached&quot;, and then after you use it, I jump out of the bushes and say &quot;hey! That thing had value! You&#x27;re morally obligated to pay me!&quot;, of course you are under no such obligation. That seems to be the situation you&#x27;re thinking of.<p>What if you open your imagination a bit? What if I say, &quot;if I tried to maximize the amount of money I made, I would have to price out people who wouldn&#x27;t be able to pay anyway and their lives would be better off being able to use what I built. I don&#x27;t care about maximizing the amount of money I can make, I&#x27;d just like fair compensation, so instead of setting a specific price I just ask you to &#x27;tip&#x27; a fair amount if you can.&quot;<p>Am I &quot;morally entitled&quot; to any specific amount of money, if I didn&#x27;t set a specific price? Not really, no. But it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m saying &quot;please, have this for free, I don&#x27;t want anything back, seriously&quot;, instead I&#x27;m saying &quot;I would like something back, but I&#x27;m trusting you to decide on a fair amount&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s the more interesting question: if you&#x27;re not obligated to pay a specific amount, can such a &quot;trust&quot; system work? Can I get fair compensation, and still allow anyone who wants to be able to use my work?<p>As it stands today, in most cases, probably not. But open your imagination a little. Can it be made to work? Can there be public pressure on major companies to contribute to TideLift and&#x2F;or OpenCollective? Maybe non-commercial source-available licenses, which still contribute to The Commons, even if they&#x27;re not the traditional understanding of &quot;open source&quot;?')
