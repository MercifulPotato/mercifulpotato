And the frame interpolation techniques might not work as well on a desktop recording.<p>If you can record and process later, you might try recording your desktop in a more raw format.  It’ll be very large on disk, but this avoids the need to transcode the recording in real time and strain your GPU&#x2F;CPU.  In ffmpeg just use `-c:v copy` to capture it raw. (Assuming the transcoding is the main limiting factor)')
