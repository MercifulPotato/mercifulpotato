Every Friday, I go into my bank account amd transfer anything in excess of $2000 into the stock market.<p>Some weeks that&#x27;s quite a bit of money, some weeks it&#x27;s not so much money.<p>As of a week ago when I did the math, we had $65k more to our names this year than we did one year ago.<p>Probably half of that was money we saved directly, and half was stock market gains, so I guess from a debt payoff perspective maybe that&#x27;s closer to $30k.<p>But I guess my point is, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to think a two income household in a higher-income metro than where I live could have $80k&#x2F;yr in excess income to pay down debt with.')
