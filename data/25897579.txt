I have to admit this is my first time submitting, and it&#x27;s my own content. \nI love finding interesting nerdy things and software&#x2F;hardware deep-dives on HN.<p>A year ago I found Fabien Sanglard&#x27;s post about Andrew Kensler&#x27;s postcard pathtracer, and I was hooked.

So I just hope people will also find something of value within them.<p>PS: I also have a CUDA implementation going, but I only included a short video as a bonus at the end of post 3. I should get back on that. :)')
