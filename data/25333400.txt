Neither is the case for data scientists.<p>IMHO, if one wanted to add regulation in this area, the &quot;working&quot; approach would be to add restrictions first -- like only licensed people can work with personal data.<p>But then we&#x27;d have to worry about cases like &quot;there is a team of &#x27;s&#x2F;w engineers&#x27; writing the code and a single licensed person who can only press &#x27;run&#x27; button&quot;. And fixing <i>that</i> would require even more regulations... which will probably transform the B2C software landscape, and it is not clear if it would be beneficial or not.')
