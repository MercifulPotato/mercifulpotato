What I am surprised at is so few folks are talking about going back to physical media.<p>Music CDs will take up physical space and might be more expensive upfront (though I doubt they&#x27;ll be so in the long run). However, the upsides are huge. One, you own the content forever - even if you switch countries or want to pass it along to your children. Two, you can rip higher quality audio (such as FLAC as opposed to max 320 kbps from streaming services). Three, you get a physical artifact of the music you love (artwork and all).')
