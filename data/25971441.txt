I don&#x27;t get to decide when my fridge or HVAC turns on, that&#x27;s a factor of the weather outside (for the most part...). Also, since fridges and HVAC fans run continuously, you end up with an averaged out price for energy.<p>Laundry energy use can&#x27;t be amortized like a fridge can. They use an extreme amount of energy in short bursts. If you time your laundry incorrectly in a TOU setting, you absolutely will have a larger energy bill. I know this because I&#x27;ve been burned by it. 9c&#x2F;kwH (low TOU) vs. 14c (high) is more than a 50% price increase for a load of laundry.')
