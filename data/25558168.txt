There is no silver bullet to simplifying the creation of games and artwork. Roblox is as close as you get today because it takes a ton of the work out of making many kinds of games and starts children with enough templates and community created free art to get rapidly started. Teens and young adults who started at Roblox have made some very impressive games: World &#x2F;&#x2F; Zero, Arsenal, and Bee Swarm Simulator all come to mind.<p>If your game is close to a starting template, it makes it fast to create something fun and let you focus on iterating with players. The further you are, the more effort will be involved. At some point, the effort becomes equal or greater to the other platforms, however, most kids learning on Roblox don&#x27;t have the skills to start with Unity or Unreal Engine.<p>Taking a step back and shifting markets back to GPU hardware, NVIDIA CUDA is Roblox of the GPGPU world - a single stop shop for really great templates and tools to get you 90% of the way to your scientific goal. That last 10% can actually be more like 90% if you&#x27;re in an area where the platform is missing something (this is universally true for all platforms).<p>The computing industry is full of tradeoffs and people re-learning and re-creating patterns to solve similar problems to those that were solved 5, 10, 15, and 20 years prior.')
