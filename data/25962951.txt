That is say 100 shares on loan. The other side of that trade - the buyer - now owns the shares. That buyer can lend those same shares out to another short seller - say 100 shares again. Now we have 200 shares on loan.<p>I don&#x27;t see why someone necessarily has to lose money unless you introduce credit risk (which in the non-theoretical case you absolutely should). Wouldn&#x27;t you just have to unwind each of these loans?')
