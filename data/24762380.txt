Side-projects are useful for doing that, but there are other ways as well.<p>It is entirely reasonable to provide programming tasks or whiteboard interviews or whatever in lieu of going through someones personal project.<p>Using your own lifestyle and tastes as a benchmark is what riles people up. If side-projects are the measure of the man, then there is an expectation of how people should spend their free time.<p>I believe the polarization is coming from how this is expressed, specifically pegging side-projects as the determining factor. People can find joy in their work (programming in our case), but not necessarily want to do the same thing in their free time.<p>This is likely biased as it is coming from someone with no personal projects though :)')
