It was originally used as a keyboard, trackpad, and screen in a laptop format for the Atrix smartphone, but with some converter cables, you can plug into any machine with HDMI and USB and use it exactly as you describe. It&#x27;s finicky, but works well enough to be useful. Total cost for the LapDock and cables was under $100.')
