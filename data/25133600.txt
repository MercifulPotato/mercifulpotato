Intel&#x27;s latest is 10th-generation and even those are slower than Ryzen, much less the older 9th-generation ones. And even those older Intel mobile CPUs defeat the M1 on multi-threaded workloads like Cinebench.</i><p>You seem to be ignoring the benchmarks where the M1 beats the Ryzen 9 5950X on several--but not all--benchmarks. [1]<p>From the article:\n<i>In SPECint2006, we’re now seeing the M1 close the gap to AMD’s Zen3, beating it in several workloads now, which increasing the gap to Intel’s new Tiger Lake design as well as their top-performing desktop CPU, which the M1 now beats in the majority of workloads.</i><p>And there&#x27;s this:\n<i>The situation doesn’t change too much with the newer SPECint2017 suite. Apple’s Firestorm core here remains extremely impressive, at worst matching up Intel’s new Tiger Lake CPU in single-threaded performance, and at best, keeping up and sometimes beating AMD’s new Zen3 CPU in the new Ryzen 5000 chips.</i><p>And regarding power consumption:\n<i>While AMD’s Zen3 still holds the leads in several workloads, we need to remind ourselves that this comes at a great cost in power consumption in the +49W range while the Apple M1 here is using 7-8W total device active power.</i><p>That&#x27;s the point I previously made—Apple’s first go at making their own processors for their entry level laptops and the Mac mini is super competitive with AMD&#x27;s newest and best processors and beats it in several benchmarks, at a fraction of the cost and power consumption.<p>That&#x27;s pretty impressive.<p>It has to make one wonder what the results will be when Apple ships a processor made for higher-end desktops, where they won&#x27;t have the thermal and power restrictions of a laptop processor?<p>I&#x27;m sure when they were contemplating a transition away from Intel, they had to do their due diligence and consider if AMD could be an option. But clearly they knew they have a much higher ceiling with their architecture.<p>You know there are prototypes in Apple&#x27;s lab now that far surpass Ryzen that&#x27;ll be in machines spring&#x2F;summer 2021. Apple&#x27;s been relentless with shipping faster A series chips every year for the iPhone; I suspect we&#x27;ll see the same thing with the M series.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested&#x2F;4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a>')
