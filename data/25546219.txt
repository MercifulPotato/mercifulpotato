Its example may be imperfect, but the problem is ubiquitous.<p>I take it that the writer was a system administrator of some kind. So he had lots of different tasks, security was just one of them. How come he knew more about security than the people whose only job is security? I was a film major. I became a web programmer years ago and am self-taught. Why do I know more about security, and technology in general, than the security team at my company? Their only job is security. I have many distractions (JavaScript, user-interface design, graphic design, SQL, database design, etc.). They have only one focus: security. Why shouldn&#x27;t they be able to school me on the latest password-hashing algorithms? Or why have they never --- never ever --- told me anything that I didn&#x27;t know about security?<p>Also, the bias toward corporate vendors like Microsoft is still commonplace. They still, in 2020, hardly know about Linux, and don&#x27;t know at all about even safer systems like BSD. If I said &quot;FreeBSD&quot;, they would concentrate on the word &quot;Free&quot; and write it off as some shady script by a kid in a basement. Their only point of reference is how Microsoft servers work, so they forced us to install antivirus on our servers and would consider us unprofessional slackers if they knew we weren&#x27;t rebooting monthly.<p>At work there are weekly or daily annoyances. None of them are lethal, but they add up. I would say the majority of them are things that originate from the security department. They are things that don&#x27;t, actually, improve security and only inconvenience users. There are many things I know to do to be secure, and yes, they enforce many of these things. But of the things that annoy me and other users throughout our week, again I would say most of them originate from the security department. As for any annoyance from some other source, almost all of them can be attributed to the same mindset: of being &quot;compliant&quot; instead of actually effective, of ticking a box instead of doing your job, of selfishness instead of service.')
