The Labor party campaigned on &quot;Just Vote 1&quot; and destroyed the Liberal-National Coalition at that election. Those parties in Queensland then had to merge to offset the effect on their primary votes. In turn that caused the separate Liberal and National party caucuses in the Federal parliament to merge into a single caucus (otherwise there&#x27;d be three party rooms). That in turn greatly strengthened the power of hard-right Liberals in the selection of Prime Minister. It&#x27;s been fairly fucked ever since.<p>There are better voting systems on paper, but typically those theories don&#x27;t account for political parties actively misleading voters about how the voting system works.')
