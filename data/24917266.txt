That&#x27;s a smaller playing space than taikyoku shogi, it&#x27;s again a game equivalent to chess (in the von Neumann sense) and a computer wouldn&#x27;t find anything more conceptually difficult about moving through a 3d array than a 2d one. So I&#x27;d expect the computer&#x27;s advantage to be even larger here.')
