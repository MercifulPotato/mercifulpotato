Item(by='yarcob', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607963186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419133, text='+1 for Icebreaker. Their fabrics are a blend of wool with synthetic materials, and they are the best shirts I&#x27;ve ever had. Unlike other wool fabrics they are very easy to take care of. I wash them just like cotton, no special detergents  needed. Not even high spin cycles seem to harm them. (But I&#x27;ve never put them in the dryer, so I don&#x27;t know if they would survive that).<p>They may be odor resistant, but for me they still get smelly after two or three days. A lot better than cotton, but not odor free.<p>The downsides are that even their lightest fabrics are too warm for summer, and the fabric is a lot less mechanically sturdy as cotton. It seems to tear easily. Most of my older icebreaker shirts have a few holes, even though the fabric still looks like new.')
