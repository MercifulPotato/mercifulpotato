I go out to see ~20 gallons of gasoline on the ground (my best estimate - was a puddle about 16 ft x 6 ft x 1&#x2F;2 inch deep)&quot;.<p>They were filling a huge motorhome, so it would take a while to fill regardless and they weren&#x27;t paying attention.<p>I should have called the fire department, but was a dumb teenager working alone.  Threw a few buckets of absorbent on it.  It was over 90F that day and windy, so it took 10 min for most of it to evaporate.')
