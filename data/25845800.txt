Are there, or will there be open-hardware DSP projects which run SOUL, or open-source runtimes which achieve high performance on standard issue CPUs?  If the company behind SOUL goes under (Roli, I think), what happens?<p>* Could I write a program in SOUL that does real time beat detection given an audio signal, say a steady drum beat (to make things simple)?')
