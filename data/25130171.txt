If you believe there are other easy to deploy and maintain solutions with the same amount of relevant user outreach, then by all means suggest them.<p>(I could of course point other reasons, like the fact that even if your website has no sensitive data it can still be scraped to build a profile of the visitor by a third party, etc).')
