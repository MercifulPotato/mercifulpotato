Item(by='MauranKilom', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609350517, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583634, text='According to this [0] recent (Dec 8) meta-analysis, infection fatality rate at 20 years is around 0.01%, with prediction interval about 0.003% to 0.03%. See Fig. 3 (note logarithmic scaling).<p>That is only fatality rate.<p>I don&#x27;t see a good way to aggregate vaccination harm, especially with qualifiers such as &quot;bad&quot; and given the priors we have about the particular vaccines in question. However, let&#x27;s take the narcolepsy issue that has been mentioned multiple times in this thread. According to [1]:<p>&gt;  During the first year after vaccination, the relative risk of narcolepsy was increased 5 to 14-fold in children and adolescents and 2 to 7-fold in adults. The vaccine attributable risk in children and adolescents was around 1 per 18,400 vaccine doses.<p>That puts the rate at 0.005% for a prominent &quot;bad&quot; vaccine. I will note that this disease is not exactly comparable to death.<p>Considering that ~70% of e.g. the US population are older than 20 (with COVID-19 infection fatality rate increasing exponentially with age, e.g. 1% at age 60) and that you are expected to pass it to about one person, you may want to include the assessment of risks not only to yourself but to everyone around you in your considerations.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s10654-020-00698-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s10654-020-00698-1</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;28847694&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;28847694&#x2F;</a>')
