A lot of items have had their prices go down significantly due to globalization, efficiency in production, Chinese production, regulation or just by going obsolete and inconvenient. At the same time, the measures that matter - Healthcare, education, housing, have all gone up. Not to mention CPI does not account for wage stagnation.')
