Item(by='one-more-minute', descendants=None, kids=[25761098, 25761031], score=None, time=1610538863, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25759576, text='Tangential question about FPGAs: Is there any work on compiling code to a combination of hardware and software? I&#x27;m imagining that the &quot;outer loop&quot; of a program is still fairly standard ARM instructions, or similar, but the compiler turns some subroutines into specialised circuits. Even more ambitiously you could JIT-compile hot loops from machine instructions to hardware.<p>We already kind of do this manually over the long term (eg things like bfloat16, TF32 and hardware support for them in ML, or specialised video decoders). With mixed compilation you could do things like specify a floating point format on-the-fly, or mix and match formats, in software and still get high performance.')
