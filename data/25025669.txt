Laughably bad. It might only confirms your biases if you already believe that the allegations are false, but if you haven&#x27;t formed an opinion yet - I assure you, no one is ever going to be convinced by this. A lot of people are now treating those factcheckers as a complete joke that cannot be taken seriously. But I don&#x27;t know, this is just what I noticed by observing this entire thing, make of it what you will.')
