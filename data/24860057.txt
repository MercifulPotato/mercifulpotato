Item(by='teatree', descendants=None, kids=[24860300], score=None, time=1603385188, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24857646, text='I understand taxing an optional luxury item like iPhone to encourage local manufacturing, with all the cheap phones available it won&#x27;t affect the common man too much. But the government here is bent on taxing everything as much as possible. Eg: The Prime Minister keeps harping about &quot;Digital India&quot; but computer components and laptops have an import duty of 80-100%. Does he have the money to build a fab in India ? Hell no, but tax processors at 80%. Talks about &quot;Artiphisial Intelligence&quot; in his speech and annual budget, but taxes GPUs at 80-100%.<p>The rich and middle class have workarounds for these duties by asking friends and family to bring them things from US, but its the poor who&#x27;s children suffer the most. Poverty is not a problem in India, its a design feature, keep people poor and stupid, loot them all you want.<p>Most people who have the resources or skill to leave India are doing it anyway. Policies like these will only serve to expedite it. This country will likely be next Venezuela.<p>PS: This is not a political statement against the present government, every political party here has done and will continue with this stupidity.')
