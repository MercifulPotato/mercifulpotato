In the last few months I learned a lot about circuit design, datasheets, PCB design and hot air soldering! I highly advise if you want to take it to the next level, try making your own board! It&#x27;s super satisfying being able to hold a complicated interconnected circuit board you&#x27;ve put months of work into and say &quot;I built that&quot;.')
