IME, often there are a couple of folks in the entire team who contribute with any regularity, or care to update the docs. Its often not an activity that&#x27;s given credit. When the people who maintained the docs switch teams, there is rot- docs become stale. Because they&#x27;re stale, other users don&#x27;t trust them don&#x27;t update them, just stop using them leading to a vicious cycle where they become totally irrelevant.')
