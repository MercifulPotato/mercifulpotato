I know your hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us, it was a landslide election and everyone knows it especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order we have to respect our great people in law and order. We don&#x27;t want anybody hurt. It&#x27;s a very tough period of time, there has never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election but we can&#x27;t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home, we love you, you&#x27;re very special, you&#x27;ve seen what happens you&#x27;ve seen the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace.&quot;<p>I was watching a live stream from the mob and the protesters (the buffalo costume guy, in fact) were trying to get other protesters to leave on the basis of trumps message and people were believing the claim was fake because twitter restricted sharing so the only way to see it was to directly go to the page.<p>Seems like an odd choice.')
