Most of SF is single family homes, and the vast Bay Area beyond even more so.<p>Also, having done the spreadsheet many times myself, it’s almost never a raise to move to a low-cost area.<p>The reason people make that move is that they’ve accumulated <i>so much wealth</i> in SF that they can basically <i>retire</i> so long as they move to a low cost area.<p>Some people want to do that, and retire very young. Some people don’t, so they stay around until they’re wealthy enough to even afford nice properties in the bay area.<p>The reason for this giant shift, however, is very simply that the vast majority of city life is either closed or greatly impeded at the moment. So the experience of city life has been significantly degraded, and thus many people are now shifting toward places that offer very little <i>except</i> for nice, cheap property, and thus make a good place to hole up and hide out the pandemic.')
