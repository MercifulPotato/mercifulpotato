Item(by='avs733', descendants=None, kids=[25072130], score=None, time=1605194732, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25070772, text='&gt;Japan&#x27;s government has awarded a safety certification to Honda&#x27;s autonomy tech called Traffic Jam Pilot.<p>I don&#x27;t think that is an entirely fair representation. The claim you are referencing in that sentence appears to be about when they will launch. They seem to clearly be the first to actually achieve a certification. Which is what the title seems to be referring too. We can discuss about the potentially too close relationship between the Japanese government and companies,  but the certification is the certification and is a fairly objective measure.')
