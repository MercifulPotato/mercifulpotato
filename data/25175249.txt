Item(by='dehrmann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606024209, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25170547, text='&gt; Many teams implement periods where deploys are forbidden - these can be referred to as code freezes, or deploy policies like “Don’t deploy on Fridays”. Having such blackout periods can lead to a pile-up of changes, which increases the overall risk of something going very wrong.<p>Funny thing with this: CD, or even just frequent ad-hoc deployments can hide problems. When you do a code freeze over, say, the week before Thanksgiving, if you also stop deployments, you&#x27;re changing the how the system runs, potentially leading to an issue at a bad time that the team isn&#x27;t experienced in dealing with.<p>You can obviously configure CD to continue to redeploy the same build during code freezes. I&#x27;m just not sure if people remember to do it.')
