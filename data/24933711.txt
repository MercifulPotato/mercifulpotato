Media companies certainly benefit from optimizing this KPI, but it means they are now going to become entertainment companies. This isn&#x27;t necessarily &quot;bad&quot; from the standpoint of the media companies or their shareholders, but insofar as the people who make up those organizations still want the company&#x27;s value proposition to their customers to be providing journalism, the company has failed. Given the culture of journalism being a mission-oriented pursuit, it&#x27;s fair to assume that many people will feel remorse at these changes occurring within these organizations, even if those organizations become very valuable entertainment companies.')
