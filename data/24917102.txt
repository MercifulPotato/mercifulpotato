Yes, but so was the CCCP.\nWere they socialists. Definetely yes.\nWere they catholic, or even christian. Not at all.\nIf you say that the republicans are right wing, then it&#x27;s hard to put nazis on the same plate.\nThe meaning of the term right-wing changed a lot in the last 100 years.\nIf you trace back to Spain during the Franco reign, then you will quickly realize, that a lot of the people fighting for republic were in fact far left (including notably some anarchists). Basically the whole republic concept was considered to be a lef-wing thing (and it was for the time).\nWere nazis right-wing? At that time yes.\nAre nazis right-wing in the modern meaning of right-wing? Definitely not, those two have nothing in common.')
