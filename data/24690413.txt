I have a personal rule that I close the tab as soon as a modal asking for my email pops up. When the cute little figure on the left _asked_ for my consent to pop-up a modal, I had to click on it because it was so cute and respectful.<p>This is great design that I’m sure converts as well without cheapening your brand and accosting your users.')
