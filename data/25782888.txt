Changes like this protect the elastic enterprise, whether they align with the motives of contributors would have to be evaluated on a per-contributor basis.<p>I&#x27;ve made several contributions to ELK, and my only motive has been that it&#x27;s useful open source software, and I want to make it more useful. I personally don&#x27;t care who profits off the codebase, I think anybody should be free to. I personally would object to anybody trying to lock down how it can be used, and would see any attempt to do so as running completely counter to my personal motivations as a past contributor.<p>Which is exactly what I see Elastic doing here.')
