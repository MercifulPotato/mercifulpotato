If you look at it as en ecosystem, it has become complex, and complexity brings problems to be solved and generate value.<p>For the ideas. Need is a good way. For example, we build custom machine learning products for enterprise in varying sectors, for different problems, to serve diverse domain experts.<p>This takes a lot of time and the consulting model is not scalable as is.
