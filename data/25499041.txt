On AMP it&#x27;s... AMP. So Google thinks it&#x27;s fast enough&#x2F;good enough.<p>On AMP we implemented a lot of annoying CTAs to go to the main website. ”Read Full Article here” ”Read more” ”Details at...”<p>In the past this website would have needed to optimize its real website to gain this much visibility in the search engines. Now they just AMP, then they optimize their AMP to real-world-website CTR, and can continue to have a... sub ideal.... website.<p>AMP is whitelisted cloaking for slow websites.
