The problem with companies like Youtube, Google, Amazon, and Facebook is that they do everything algorithmically, since anything else wouldn&#x27;t scale. Meanwhile, they have no incentives to care about false positives and the power relation between them and their customers is extremely asymmetric - basically, it&#x27;s a system of oppression. To the false positive victims of algorithmic censorship, this can become a Dystopian nightmare of bureaucracy. Like in the movie &quot;Brazil&quot; or a Kafka story, only much worse because everything is automated and biased against them.<p>You can see that with Youtube content policing, Facebook and Google ads accounts, etc. Anyone whose livelihood depends on their services can lose their income at any time for no reason whatsoever. Even spreading the risk will not help much, it still means you might loose 30% or 40% of your income over night at any time thanks to a change of the algorithms. None of this is transparent and the companies will not explain anything, so you will not even know why or how to avoid this. You might claim it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s own fault to depend on such companies, but there are many types of businesses where the dependence is unavoidable. These companies have quasi-monopolies in some areas.<p>AFAIK, the only remedy is to regulate algorithmic control of people and their content by laws more tightly. At least the appeals process needs to be more transparent and there need to be way more humans in the loop.<p>In this case it&#x27;s the same, by the way. I guarantee you that many videos will be flagged falsely and many reputable Youtube content creators will be demonetized once again for nothing. This might be tolerable here and there, but the algorithmic oppression of people accumulates across all domains and also has a strong chilling effect.<p>In the long run, algorithmic oppression of people by a faceless company bureaucracy may turn out to be a bigger problem for society than what these moderation efforts are trying to solve. It creates strong and effective power structures that govern our lives, work in parallel to democratic power structures, and are not democratically legitimized at all. What&#x27;s worse, the people who create them sometimes don&#x27;t even seem to understand what they are creating, which is basically a recipe for creating systemic evil.')
