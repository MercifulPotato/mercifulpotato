If I see the message and immediately respond hello back then I have to sit and wait and watch the &#x27;person is writing&#x27; indication until I get the the real reason they contact me. This time is just active waiting and can&#x27;t be used for anything. In the situation where I see the hello at some later time and reply back the other person might not even be there. Should I actively wait or start something else and keep an eye on the chat, prepared to be interrupted? A lose-lose situation for me..')
