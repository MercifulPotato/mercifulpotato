Item(by='dangus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605065725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25049927, text='You know, honestly, I think it&#x27;s just time to stop making comments like this and admit that Apple isn&#x27;t making products that you are interested in.<p>Stop letting them live rent free in your head.<p>It&#x27;s a consumer product. WHO. CARES.<p>For the average user, these are fantastic. A laptop that lasts beyond the number of waking hours in a day and has no noisy fans with basically untouchable performance in that form factor. And YOU&#x27;RE STILL MAD...about the vocabulary that Tim Cook speaks with compared to Steve Jobs, who has been scientifically verified as being a completely different person. (I highly doubt Steve never said anything about loving Apple products, either)<p>In other words, Steve Jobs has been dead for almost 10 years, it&#x27;s time to leave his personality cult. If you liked what he said better, it&#x27;s probably because he was one of the best salespeople who has ever lived - that doesn&#x27;t change what the product actually IS.<p>And oh my goodness, stop getting worked up about specs and industry-standard price segmentation practices. 99% of customers DO. NOT. CARE. The VAST majority of MacBook Air buyers buy the base model and don&#x27;t need anything more than that. macOS is perfectly usable on 8GB, heck my parents are using 4GB on theirs and it works fine - yes, with Catalina. No joke, you need to open up something like 40 chrome tabs before it matters. RAM requirements have completely stagnated for anything but the most exotic workloads.')
