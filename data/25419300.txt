Honest question.<p>As an undergrad studying Comp Sci and also taking philosophy&#x2F;literature classes it struck me just how rich the Computer Science metaphors are, and how much creativity seemed to go into coming up with a lot of the fundamental ideas of Computer Science.<p>But of course it&#x27;s also possible that I was applying my own bias; I know most of the Comp Sci folks from the 50s&#x2F;60s&#x2F;70s were pretty heavy math folks.<p>But pursuing a graduate Comp Sci degree is something I&#x27;ve considered on and off. Alan Kay has always been especially inspiring.<p>TBH I&#x27;ve also felt like there&#x27;s some unexplored areas where Computer Science and Poetics, or Literary Theory, could make a really interesting combination. Again it&#x27;s a question of rich metaphors and investing meaning into use-of-language in a very comprehensive and granular way (grammar, one verb or adjective versus another, theories of narrative, etc.')
