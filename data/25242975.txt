An underappreciated aspect of customizability is that you don&#x27;t have to learn new habits when the defaults change.  You can&#x27;t know your tools if they&#x27;re constantly changing in ways you can&#x27;t control or override.  I feel like just another dumb user.  I&#x27;ve been using VSCode a lot recently, and I just don&#x27;t feel the motivation to learn anything about it.  Learning a tool is for suckers.  Just google for what you need right now.  No sense going out of your way to remember anything if they&#x27;re going  to pull the rug out from under you next month.<p>Not a knock against VSCode; I acquired this attitude before I started using it.  Maybe if I invested in learning VSCode thoroughly, the investment would pay off.  I&#x27;ve just been so thoroughly trained not to treat anything outside the terminal as stable that I can&#x27;t bring myself to do it anymore.')
