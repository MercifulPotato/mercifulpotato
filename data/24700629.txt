Large companies first and foremost benefit from economies of scale, not any dictatorial dynamics they might pursue.<p>This is important, because when we decide to draw a line based on size (easy) and not on demonstrated harmful behavior (difficult), we have to answer the question &quot;how big exactly we should allow corporations get then?&quot;. The answer to this question will determine if we as a society can enjoy certain things or not, because some goods&#x27; and services&#x27; existence <i>requires</i> that economies of scale.<p>&gt; Breaking up large companies isn&#x27;t even about them. It is about us and the world we want to live in. Remember the wage fixing scandal between Pixar, Google, Apple and bunch of other companies in the bay?<p>How is multiple companies colluding related to the question of a single company being broken up? Again, what they did was wrong, but let&#x27;s not smuggle unnecessary emotional rhetoric into a rational argument.<p>&gt; That is too much power for a company to have or wield.<p>Power concentrates whether we like it or not. Who should wield that power? Nation states? Religions? Or do we mandate a constant break up? You might break up your nation&#x27;s companies but that doesn&#x27;t prevent another country&#x27;s corporations dominating the world market including yours, unless you pull a NK.<p>Yes corporate power concentration can&#x2F;does cause great harm, but I haven&#x27;t heard a suggestion that can actually work in the real world. How about strengthening the opponent process of <i>government</i> and other democratic processes to undertake the difficult task of disincentivizing demonstrated harmful behavior? Developing mechanisms more sophisticated than &quot;just break it up&quot;? American big-co&#x27;s are not the only big-co&#x27;s in the world, maybe compare notes with how other nations handling these?')
