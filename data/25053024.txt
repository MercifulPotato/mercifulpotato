But typical response rates are 5 in 100 â€” often lower, says Andrew Gelman, a statistician and prominent election modeller. He says that only around 1 in 100 people respond to opinion polls. So now picture 10,000 people, 255 who called their vote for Mr Biden, 243 for Mr Trump and 9,500 who never responded. How confident are we feeling now? &quot;<p>Harford is the host of the excellent More or Less podcast that looks at the validity of statistics in the news.')
