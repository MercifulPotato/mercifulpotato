Curse this troublesome software that has gained sentience wreaks havoc on the world.<p>I see this exact argument -- almost word-for-word -- applied to guns.<p>I don&#x27;t presume to know anything about you personally, nor about your political opinions, but I&#x27;ve encountered many west-coast, left-leaning, tech-industry professionals support $TECH on the basis of individual responsibility, whilst simultaneously opposing guns due to their potential for misuse.<p>What this tells me is that the &quot;X isn&#x27;t good or bad, it just depends on who&#x27;s using it&quot; argument is weak.  It&#x27;s weak in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t capture the nuances that might make someone support bitcoin, but not guns.<p>(Again, I don&#x27;t presume to know your thoughts on gun-ownership.
