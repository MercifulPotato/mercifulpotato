See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;European_and_American_voyages_of_scientific_exploration" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;European_and_American_voyages_...</a>, although most of those postdate 1822.  Still, there were a number before then.<p>Even without explicitly scientific voyages, the Americas -- north and south -- had been settled by Europeans for hundreds of years, and the US was now an independent country, and settlement of Australia had been underway for decades.  That leaves plenty of discovery to be done on land.<p>Like, Carl Linnaeus had died some 40 years earlier.  His taxonomy included New World species, and so did other taxonomies made by other later 18th-century biologists.<p>Meanwhile James Cook had taken various scientists on a number of his voyages (which were primarily intended for exploration), resulting in among other things the discovery of a number of new plant species.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think this is an accurate description of the state of affairs at the time.')
