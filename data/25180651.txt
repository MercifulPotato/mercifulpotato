The scale is such an integral part of the kitchen. Because it’s drilled into me, I still measure everything by weight.<p>Otoh, for Indian cooking that I grew up with, it’s always by ratio. Or at least how I learnt it. Example: 1:3 ..rice:water. I guess it’s based on volume but with non standard cups&#x2F;tbsp etc. For seasoning, you go ‘by the nose’. And taste...taste...taste.<p>As an aside&#x2F;off topic slightly: You cook with your senses. For example, one of the earliest kitchen chores my grandmother taught me was to make ghee from churned butter. It’s a thin line between caramelised and burnt. How can you tell? You ‘listen’. When the butter fats are completely caramelised and there is no more moisture content, the top froths and there is no more sizzling sound. So here..when you are in the steam&#x2F;multiple mingling smells and you can’t see the bottom of the pot of caramelised butter fats...all you have is your hearing. If it becomes silent, then it means it’s done. You can’t make ghee with a timer or thermometer. Tools don’t make the chef.<p>I used this technique at work when I was cooking professionally. Caramelised butter can be beurre claire(just melted butter..you don’t want it to smell caramelised), beurre noisette(smells like roasted hazelnut), beurre noir(black..as when used with cooking skate etc). I had a counting system after all sounds have stopped to get to the right point of butter melting.')
