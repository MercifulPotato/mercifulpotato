They have an army of buyers and use some calculated techniques with options to gain leverage. They&#x27;re not all college students in for $100. I know of people who have borrowed 6-digit sums to get in on this bet.<p>Potentially there are also pros on the WSB side of this game but I think they would potentially face legal risks that the individuals don&#x27;t have to worry about.')
