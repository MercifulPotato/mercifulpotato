There are certainly some great games out there, but I believe there&#x27;s a lot of room to explore new concepts as well. I also wanted to figure out just how much work it is to ship even a simple polished game.\nIt&#x27;s a pretty simple concept but I think has some potential (I&#x27;ve had fun testing it with friends at least). The version up works, but a new version with some fixes and features is in the works.\nIf you are interested, can grab a friend or seven, and have some gamepads, give it a shot!\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noncestudios.itch.io&#x2F;ballgame" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noncestudios.itch.io&#x2F;ballgame</a>\nI&#x27;m also looking for playtesting input, so if you have any comments I would love feedback!
