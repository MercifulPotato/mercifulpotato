Most people don&#x27;t like all fillings.<p>Why don&#x27;t all countries use metric? Not everything in this universe needs to follow a perfectly logical explanation.<p>As for the pictures, I can say the most famous brand people are most familiar with where I&#x27;m from is sees candy chocolate boxes. I&#x27;ve never seen Kraft candy, that company is mostly known for cheese. If sees candy did label their candies I&#x27;ve never seen it and therefore it must not have been very evident.<p>Regardless what you think, the quote exists because most people usually don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re eating when they put these candies in their mouths.
