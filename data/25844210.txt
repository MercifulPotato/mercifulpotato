Have a lot of bindings, helpers in my powershell profile, and use it everyday for work.<p>That being said, I&#x27;ll never use it on Linux as my shell. It&#x27;s just too slow to start. Fish, nushell, bash, all start instantaneously, powershell (legacy and core), all take more than a second to start, on beefy machines.<p>I&#x27;ve been looking at the powershell core repo in hopes of fixing this with .net core ready to run profile, but they seemed to have something like that in place, but was disabled  at that time.<p>Anyway, PowerShell is good, probably the best you can get on Windows(nushell also takes a bit to start, and it&#x27;s still new). But, on Linux you can do much better, even if that means having to struggle with Bash&#x2F;Fish scripting.<p>For more complex scripts a full language like Lua or Python are most likely better.<p>Also, last time I checked the docker container for PowerShell Core was easily over 100MB, if I remember correctly. Might work well for a dev machine, where you set it once, but for a CI, it&#x27;s not ideal.')
