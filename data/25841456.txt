Item(by='BrendanEich', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611106040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25839018, text='The phrase &quot;hijacking links&quot; is, in a word, a lie. Its standard meaning implies that Brave changes the URL loaded when you click on a link (any or many links) in a web page. That never happened, and would be fatally scandalous if tried by any reputable browser.<p>What happened was a bug in a keyword and domain autocomplete tier we added. Reminder for those not aware: all browsers add reference codes identifying the browser make (not the user) to keyword queries when you type words into the address bar. This is industry standard. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BrendanEich&#x2F;status&#x2F;1273327455105773568?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BrendanEich&#x2F;status&#x2F;1273327455105773568?s...</a>.<p>The bug in Brave was a flag set wrong for two domain names, which are not keywords: binance.us and binance.com. These should not have default-completed when typed into the address bar with a Binance affiliate code, they should have been suggested completions the user would have had to pick by arrow down and &lt;return&gt; or mouse equivalent. We fixed the defaulting bug and turned off the entire suggested completions feature. As noted by someone else in a comment nearby, we instructed Binance not to pay us for any referred new users who traded (Binance does not pay on the referral, they pay only after if the user trades, sharing a fixed proportion of trading fees).<p>So this was not &quot;link hijacking&quot; in any case. I&#x27;m sorry for the blunder, and we added a process step around any changes to address bar to audit harder.')
