Schedule periodic Google Takeouts (this requires you to download them, though)<p>2. Set up rclone (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rclone.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rclone.org&#x2F;</a>) or timeliner (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mholt&#x2F;timeliner" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mholt&#x2F;timeliner</a>) to use the Photos API. Note that _many_ tags may be missing, scrambled, or wrong. GPS will be completely missing.<p>A much better approach is to set up a server (either at home with just an RPi hooked up to an external drive, or a cheap VPS), and then use SyncThing or Resilio Sync to get your original files off your phone and some place that you control.<p>And then set up automated backups for this server, of course.')
