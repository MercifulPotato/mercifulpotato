I get it, they don&#x27;t like Trump, and who could blame them for it. But Trump  has said and tweeted <i>far worse</i> stuff than what Twitter now sees as cause for suspension.<p>The reality is that Twitter didn&#x27;t want to silence him as long as he was still president for political and business reasons. Now that it&#x27;s clear his chances for a 2nd term have gone to 0, they just have no more backlash to fear. Those two tweets as reason for the suspension is a blatant farce.<p>So, sorry Twitter, I&#x27;m not buying it. To be credible you should have suspended the guy much earlier. Let the downvotes begin!')
