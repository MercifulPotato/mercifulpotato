You were talking about a kiloton level blast. Had they not drained the basement it would have made the disaster worse, but nowhere near as much so as you think.<p>&gt; Perhaps you may just now be getting the sense that nuclear disasters don&#x27;t just last 2 years?<p>The part of it that would give liquidators a lethal does in a few minutes, no that didn&#x27;t last two months, let alone two years. The first few weeks of running onto the roof and pushing a few shovel-loads of debris back over the edge into the reactor room before being replaced by the next guy were much different than the people calmly walking through the woods looking for bits of ejected core. Still dangerous, but orders of magnitude less.<p>&gt; You have no clue what you are talking about. I literally gave you the source<p>Your source wasn&#x27;t worth anything. It was nonsense they came up with before they knew the scope of the problem. Evacuate Tokyo. Lol! Not even close. Not even if all reactors had been impacted. It was redacted because it was wrong, not badly covered up so that people like you could find it as part of some strange conspiracy.<p>&gt; Spent fuel rods remain radioactive and hot for years to decades<p>Many fission byproducts have a halflife and minutes to months. The first day&#x2F;week&#x2F;month&#x2F;year of a spent fuel rod&#x27;s afterlife are the most dangerous. If rods sit for a while (6m - 2y generally) they&#x27;re safe enough to transport to a secondary pool.<p>&gt; Maybe you are just now learning that nuclear power is dangerous?<p>No, I knew radiation was dangerous when I first read about the demon core accident. But nuclear power is still about 100,000 times safer than traditional power. You just refuse to value distributed deaths such as miners and pollution sufferers.')
