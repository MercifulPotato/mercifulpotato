(I actually tried to find the oldest record... the oldest one I could find was from something like 1984 or 1985, if I remember right.)<p>And I know the PMs actually went through the enhancement requests the customers logged (I think it was once per a release cycle), and evaluated whether any of them were worthwhile to implement or not.<p>So, in proprietary software, using a bug tracker to track feature requests is a lot older than Mozilla&#x2F;Bugzilla.')
