Item(by='jeffkeen', descendants=None, kids=[25296958], score=None, time=1607035077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25295368, text='&gt; I like using my linux desktop because I can set it up exactly how I want, and macOS just doesn&#x27;t roll that way.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to have an argument here, but I&#x27;ve never really understood what is the &quot;exactly how you want&quot; that Mac OS doesn&#x27;t provide? Would you mind sharing some details? Is it just a matter of not being familiar with the places to change the defaults to something more to your liking, or is it actually missing the ability to do something you need?<p>I&#x27;ve been a Mac user since the 80s, I write software for a living, and I understand that among tech folk there is a continental divide between convention and configuration, and I think that might translate to choice in OS, too. Seems to me that most Mac users are on the convention over configuration side, and most people who are anti-MacOS are the opposite; they want to configure every bit. Just wondering if that&#x27;s the case here, too, or if there&#x27;s more to it specifically.')
