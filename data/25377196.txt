Why are you placing YouTube on such a high pedestal, assigning such a non-deterministic fate to its decisions and outcomes? They&#x27;re not even a little important to the dissemination of free ideas - perhaps they once were, but that ship sailed long ago.<p>Why are you so in love with YouTube? You clearly despise their choices; abandon the platform and don&#x27;t look back.<p>&gt; This isn&#x27;t a tactical debate, it&#x27;s a philosophical and foundational one.<p>I agree; you need to change your philosophy. Stop relying on YouTube to be the heroic service that you want it to be, and start realizing that it will never do what you want it to do.')
