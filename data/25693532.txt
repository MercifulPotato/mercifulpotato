Whacking one mole breaks up recruitment and kills momentum. People on the fringes lose interest and don&#x27;t bother to find out where the core moved to. \nWhen the next mole comes up it&#x27;s smaller and more divided, so you whack that one, and again, smaller, more peripheral, less momentum. That gives people who have peeled off a chance to get re-integrated into more sane communities rather than being bathed in constant toxicity, so they crawl back from radicalisation. At least, that&#x27;s how it works below a certain size, and is why it&#x27;s worth doing these things early, before they get to the_donald sort of numbers.')
