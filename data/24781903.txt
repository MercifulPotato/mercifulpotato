I need to clear my throat (through voluntary coughing) every few minutes. If I don&#x27;t do that, the phlegm dries in place and I end up with a restricted airway and difficulty breathing. I can&#x27;t really sing because my voice will catch on the phlegm.<p>If you know of anyone with this symptom, or who is familiar with this symptom, please let me know.<p>So far I&#x27;ve seen an allergist, an ENT, and a gastroenterologist, and the response from each has been &quot;that&#x27;s not my problem, see someone else&quot;. (The ENT did at least stick a camera through my nose and photograph phlegm stuck to the sides of my throat, which gives me a response to the people who say &quot;what if you&#x27;re just imagining it?&quot;)')
