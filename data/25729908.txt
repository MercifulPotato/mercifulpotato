And the necessity to hit G server thousands of times to extract even a short video reduces that by quite a large proportion; which is definitely not a shot at the researcher, it&#x27;s a great find, but exploitability is definitely lower than more direct form of IDOR (e.g. input private video ID and get the whole video in response).<p>By the same logic, blind SQLi will typically be valued &#x27;less&#x27; (hence pay out less) than SQLi with output.')
