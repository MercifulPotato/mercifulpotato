It&#x27;s up to the company to decide what kind of platform they want to be.<p>And it&#x27;s up to us to use these systems or not. This above statement works &amp; holds, so long as it&#x27;s only network effect &amp; not technical barrier to generating our own speech systems. Which, thankfully, I feel like the internet readily supplies (at least for now!).')
