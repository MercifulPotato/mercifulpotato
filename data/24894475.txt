It is not clearly defined and needs a court case in order to apply.<p>Therefore I still think that the assumption of Fair Use to apply is wrong. However, the assumption of copyright to apply on the other hand is correct.<p>But, referring to whether fair use exists or not, I agree with you that technically it exists.<p>But as the rest of the very same law criminalizes by default, you can still not refer to fair use if you do not have the required-by-law evidence at hand for it to apply.<p>I think that fair use is almost always nearly impossible to prove, that&#x27;s why I wrote my statement like this. And I agree that it was worded badly.')
