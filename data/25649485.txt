Good question, there&#x27;s a diagram on what a default deployment looks like alongside the M3 v1.0 announcement <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;chronosphere&#x2F;m3-v1-0-released-a-production-ready-prometheus-metrics-store-scalable-to-hundreds-of-nodes-7f673fac4334" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;chronosphere&#x2F;m3-v1-0-released-a-productio...</a> and in depth documentation on the website <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m3db.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;overview&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m3db.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;overview&#x2F;</a>.<p>Storage, aggregation and compute are all separate and scale up&#x2F;down independently. The coordinator and query services are both stateless and you just add more instances, DB nodes do not do compression&#x2F;decompression for instance all this happens as part of computation on the query service.<p>M3DB for storage has a k8s operator that can manage clusters (expansion, etc), and the M3 aggregator can be deployed as a stateful set in k8s and also can be independently expanded.')
