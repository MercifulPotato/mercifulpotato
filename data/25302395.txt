So does the type of company, market, bootstrapped or raising etc.  For bootstrapped companies, typical first hires are product focused (tech.SAE), sales&#x2F;marketing (usually combined at first w&#x2F;a founder doing a lot of sales&#x2F;closing), administrative to help manage day to day tasks, manage HR, handle bookings, scheduling etc, and outside support for legal, accounting etc.  People sometimes try and have a founder do all the admin tasks but it isn&#x27;t worth it, pay someone $15-20&#x2F;hr (even part time at first), you&#x27;ll free up your skills.<p>If you are raising money, then you need your first few hires to have some attractive traits that will make investors confident you can deliver what you say.  I&#x27;d say product&#x2F;tech is critical of course, but then next is someone who can help commercialize the product and get it in the market.  e.g. if a founder already has existing relationships in the market that solves that commercial side usually, if not s&#x2F;he needs to hire someone who can help ease that entry into market.<p>Although I&#x27;d say there are just too many variables until you know the founding makeup, market and finances.  I can give at least 3-4 more examples of different people to bring in under different scenarios, and I&#x27;m probably only hitting a few.<p>Recruiting depends on the type of position and the skillset needed, you&#x27;ll find you need to recruit from different sources for different people, IMO there isn&#x27;t a one size fits all way to recruit across an organization. As for how do you pick them, pick intelligent people who are good puzzle solvers and self motivated.  It isn&#x27;t that hard to figure out during an interview if you can avoid the trap of the typical ego based interviews (especially when hiring engineers).')
