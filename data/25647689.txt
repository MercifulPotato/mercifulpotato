I had an eerily similar experience, that I also left after two weeks. The weirdest part of it all was the manager who was part of it all. She used to send a group chat saying she was going to take a nap, close her office door, turn the lights off, and lay down on the floor to sleep for a few hours.<p>What really did it for me was when we all went out for someone&#x27;s &quot;birthday&quot; (it wasn&#x27;t their birthday, the team had put cards in at a few restaurants with different dates for their birthdays to get free stuff, whatever, the restaurants don&#x27;t care, but it was just weird) and most of the team berated a guy who was trying not to drink so he didn&#x27;t order a beer. You could tell the guy was uncomfortable, and they just kept goading him for the entire 2hr lunch.<p>After a week and a half I called back a company I had turned down for this one and asked if they would still take me. Started there the next Monday. That was 10yrs and 2 jobs ago, and easily the best decision I had made for my career.')
