VP (and former Sen Harris) was  Democratic sponsor of senate bill S.386 which seeks to double the number of Indians who get green cards.<p>The moves of Trump helps Americans.\nThe moves of Biden, Schumer, Harris harms Americans.<p>Those are the facts, irrefutable, as have been presented above.  \nSo, ask yourself, do I want an American President that give in to donors like Bob Iger and brings more foreigners into the country or do I want someone like Trump, who cannot be bribed and does what is best for Americans and not foreigners.')
