Quite the contrary: ARPA (later DARPA) spent prodigiously on various AI labs and companies and in response Japan launched the 5th Generation project.  Other countries (e.g. France, with it&#x27;s Centre Mondial d&#x27;Informatique, though AI was only part of it, and its many universities; UK with Oxbridge, Nottingham etc) also invested heavily.  In the US, Government-Industry partnerships like MCC spent heavily on the field.<p>BTW &quot;AI Winter&quot; was a term coined (ironically by Marvin Minsky) at a panel at AAAI-84 (IIRC in Austin).  The term echoed &quot;Nuclear Winter&quot;, a theory from the late 70s or early 80s.  So it&#x27;s a little weird to apply it to an earlier episode, though as I say that earlier episode didn&#x27;t exist.<p>Also, &quot;AI Winter&quot; was specifically addressing the <i>commercial</i> investment in AI technologies; research continued (e.g. DARPA continued to spend).')
