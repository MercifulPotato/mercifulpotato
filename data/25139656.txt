So when I&#x27;m working alongside specialists -- people with extraordinary depth in one particular aspect of technology -- it can be easy to feel like, &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t even be here.  They&#x27;re going to figure out I&#x27;m a fraud.&quot;  In those cases, I try to remind myself that my breadth is just as important as their depth.<p>I have sat in on job interviews where the candidate was asked questions that I felt confident I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to answer if I were the one in the hot seat, and that definitely triggers feelings of imposter syndrome.  But in many cases, the best response to that isn&#x27;t &quot;Oh my gosh, I shouldn&#x27;t let anyone discover that question is too hard for me&quot; but &quot;Could our hiring process be screwed up?  Is this really the right question to be asking?  Is it more of a gotcha question or does it have real relevance to the position?&quot;<p>Over time, having been in many job interviews as both a candidate and an interviewer, I&#x27;ve come to see how much of a difference it can make to say to yourself, &quot;Even if you&#x27;re completely right that you&#x27;re an imposter, let&#x27;s just pretend that you&#x27;re not and see how far you get.&quot;  I&#x27;m now at a point in my career where I have enough successes under my belt that it&#x27;s a little easier to reassure myself, but whenever I hop into a meeting, I still feel like I&#x27;m jumping into character, pretending to have confidence even if I don&#x27;t.  I have mixed feelings about that strategy, though, because pretending to have a level of confidence in my abilities greater than I actually have might be a contributor to other people&#x27;s imposter syndrome.  But maybe the solution to that is to be willing to &quot;take off the costume&quot; in frank conversations, to clear up any misconceptions.')
