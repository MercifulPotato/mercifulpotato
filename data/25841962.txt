Their ability to sell it for $55 is capped at the total stock they have. Dev companies can print near unlimited amounts of copies for a low price.<p>If Sony prints and distributed TLOU2 for $5 and sells it at GameStop for $60 they make like $40 give or take. If someone plays that 30 hour masterpiece in two days they can sell it back to GameStop for like $20. GameStop can resell it for $55 and pocket every penny. GameStop has now made more money in launch week than the developer. GameStop is incentivized with every fiber of their existence to be a middleman than squeezes every dollar of profit. Game developers respond with digital, micro transactions, tack-on half-assed multiplayer, etc.<p>GameStop is a middle-man that seeks to prevent as many dollars as possible from going to the actual content creators.<p>Sony can print an infinite number of TLOU2 copies for almost nothing. They could let you download the game for less than a nickel. Obviously you can not make a game like TLOU2 if you only charge a nickel to play it.<p>I would have zero issues with GameStop if they limited sales of used games to games that are 1 year old. Hell I might even be fine with six months! But selling used discs less than a week from launch is despicable and I wish them nothing but pain and suffering.<p>GameStops entire business is predicated on being a middle man that adds zero value but extracts value for “used” sales of relatively new games. Fuck em.<p>I used to make games so I am extremely biased. But IMHO I am not wrong!')
