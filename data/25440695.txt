Item(by='ryanyeah', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1608111958, title='Can Digitalocean force me to keep my account open?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I emailed Digitalocean 15 days ago and asked them to close my account. Now I have a ticket going for this entire time where they refuse to close it, refuse to change my password and just blatantly ignore all my questions and requests relating to this. My account is in a locked state so I cannot get in there myself. They say I violated their TOS. The account was never used fraudulently and I really only used the service for testing linux tasks (working as a sysadmin) and it seems unlikely any machine was ever compromised. So I am not sure why.<p>I requested that under GDPR they purge all data associated with me. They informed me that this request was fulfilled and they met the GDPR requirements.<p>Yet when I go to log in again with my usual email and password, I continue to 2FA notifications and can log in. How is my data purged if I can still log in????<p>The support team requested I contact privacy@digitalocean.com and said I would get a reply &quot;as soon as possible&quot;. It&#x27;s been 12 days and I have received no reply. I&#x27;ve since asked for updates (last sent 5 days ago) and they don&#x27;t even reply to the support ticket any more.<p>Why does DO want to force me to keep my account open and keep open the ability for the outside world to log in to their system with my email and password?')
