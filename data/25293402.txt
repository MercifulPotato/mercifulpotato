They can&#x27;t be brought into areas pets are prohibited. You do need to provide verification from a physician or mental health provider to your landlord or the airline for an ESA.<p>Service dogs(or rarely horses) can generally go anywhere the owner can go including areas pets are prohibited. There is no formal verification, but the owner of the property or their employee can ask if this is a service dog that is required because of a disability, and what tasks it is trained to perform. If it is a cat or other animal, or not trained to perform a task, just to provide support it is not a service dog and they can be refused entry and trespassed.<p>Registration of service dogs would disenfranchise the disabled. About twice as many don&#x27;t have photo ID as the general public, many do not own a car or have access to reliable transportation, even relatively small costs can be prohibitive')
