For me, this is housing and zoning reform: needlessly restrictive housing law is creating needlessly expensive housing that is decimating and disrupting local communities. Change here can be at the town level or at the state reform level, and either are infinitely more actionable than say fretting over the supreme court or a politically gridlocked congress.')
