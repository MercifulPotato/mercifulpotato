Working on type theory can improve, at the very least, formal verification tools.  In my view, traditional ZFC-based mathematical logic has a much smaller likelihood of being useful for regular mathematicians.  For example, the vast majority of mathematicians will never explicitly assume the existence of a large cardinal in a paper. It seems to me that the difference in usefulness is probably due to their relative distance from common discourse.')
