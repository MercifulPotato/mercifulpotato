You could just resolve the CNAME and A records until you arrive at an address, do a reverse lookup on that address. Then use the resulting &quot;primary&quot; PTR hostname for the encryption certificate. No additional info for an attacker, no new weird RRs, in the best case just one additional DNS query (but SVCB would need that as well).')
