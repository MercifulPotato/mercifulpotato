Maybe it&#x27;s real; maybe it&#x27;s a deepfake; but if confirmed to be real it certainly would do reputational damage. Non-repudiation by definition prevents me from disavowing it, to no social benefit, and it&#x27;s an anti-feature, in the sense that the large majority of users would prefer to have the ability to repudiate certain message contents than not.<p>Non-repudiation should be opt-in.')
