They can route maybe up to a couple hundred Mbps.<p>I’m wondering whether a mini-PC can route even 1 Gbps at line rate. Lots of people are using mini-PCs as routers, but most of them have only 1×1Gbps Ethernet interface and no PCI slots. The Minisforum DMAF5 has 2×1Gbps Ethernet interfaces, but that’s an off-label use and I haven’t seen any benchmarks.<p>Of course, if you go all the way up to mini-ITX, then there are plenty of options for various performances of CPUs and network interfaces.')
