It&#x27;s 70% of cases <i>for which we have data where the transmission happened</i>. For a good majority of cases the transmission happened at an unknown place. It&#x27;s just that for those where it is known, most are happening at home (as opposed to e.g. at work). Those unknown transmissions are what you want to attack with a mass testing regime. That seems entirely doable, given cheap and simple testing at home.')
