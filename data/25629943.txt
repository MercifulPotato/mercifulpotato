You need only swallow one pill a week,\n    and you would feel no need for anything to drink.\n\n    &quot;Why are you selling those?&quot; asked the little prince.\n\n    &quot;Because they save a tremendous amount of time,&quot; said the\n    merchant. &quot;Computations have been made by experts. With\n    these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.&quot;\n\n    &quot;And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?&quot;\n\n    &quot;Anything you like...&quot;\n\n    &quot;As for me,&quot; said the little prince to himself, &quot;if I had\n    fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at\n    my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.&quot;\n\n\n        ― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince</code></pre>')
