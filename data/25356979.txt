There are many rustup packages available in distros today. Arch has one, nix OS has one. Debian is dragging their feet [0] but they aren&#x27;t entirely opposed to the idea, so maybe something will change about this in the future.<p>* Even if the download process is secured, rustup doesn&#x27;t really verify any signatures, it just downloads what&#x27;s inside the manifest. So you can download potentially malicious code if the S3 bucket is hacked that rustup downloads the compiler from.<p>* Even if the entire process of obtaining rustc is secured, the standard way of using rust + cargo basically gives maintainers access to your local computer through build.rs and other methods. You can sandbox the cargo invocation, but who does that?<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.debian.org&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;bugreport.cgi?bug=955208" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.debian.org&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;bugreport.cgi?bug=955208</a>')
