(And if there isn&#x27;t, that sure is a strange sentence to have in the letter - almost as if they are misusing this takedown letter template after all!)<p>Fair Use is about using copyrighted content, which is widely shackled behind DRM. Any court can easily see that in order to exercise your right to use that content in a Fair Use sort of way, you must break the DRM. Therefore, the existence and availability of DRM-breaking tools is a necessary condition for Fair Use to be exercised at all in conjunction with the modern media landscape.')
