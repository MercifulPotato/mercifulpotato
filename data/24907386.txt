These people aren&#x27;t any more racist or sexist or whatever than anyone else.  They&#x27;re just willing to crack jokes about a hell of a lot of stuff that would make most white collar employees cringe.<p>In a blue collar work place welders are dumb, electricians are gay, jokes about wives and girlfriends are fair game and a suction cup didlo is a tool of endless comedic potential, not a HR disaster waiting to happen.  And the overwhelming majority of the time nobody takes any of that seriously or gets offended by any of it.  It&#x27;s just how the culture is.')
