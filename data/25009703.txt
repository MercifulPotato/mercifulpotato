I&#x27;ve never brought up the question before and hoping that HN can explain it in a logical way that I might understand.<p>Let&#x27;s say that a neighborhood is rated 3 out of 10 - not very good. There is a mix of people that live in this neighborhood. Some people own property and some do not.<p>Then the community makes the neighborhood better and it rises to a 7 out of 10 ranking. The people in the community that own houses costs are fixed and they now recognize the improvement.<p>The part of the community that don&#x27;t own eventually see their costs rise. At some point they can&#x27;t afford to a community that ranks 7, might only be able to afford a community that ranks 3 and would need to move to a community with that ranking.<p>It seems like part of the original set that owns experiences a large and lasting benefit. Another part of the original set experiences a short term benefit, then a transaction cost (moving) and reverts back to the mean.<p>Can someone explain what this description misses and where the harm comes from?')
