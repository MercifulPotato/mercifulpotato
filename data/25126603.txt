As long as you don&#x27;t switch too rapidly between kanji and borrow words, it&#x27;s more compact, but more complex to implement (I would say less so than implementing gzip but if you aren&#x27;t using zlib, one of the most portable libraries in existence, you have much bigger issues than character encoding).<p>UTF-8 takes 3 bytes for all of the first block. Only the first 2048 characters fit into 2 bytes, which is mostly European languages.')
