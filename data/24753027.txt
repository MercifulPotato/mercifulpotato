I&#x27;ve never done this, but when I was playing with Godot there were references to being able to go to a particular consultancy who are able to provide a build chain for consoles - the issue there isn&#x27;t that Godot can&#x27;t support them, but that the NDAs required for console builds don&#x27;t allow the integrations to be open source.')
