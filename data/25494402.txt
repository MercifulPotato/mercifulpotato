We must have dealt with countless species and strains of coronaviruses already. So, our genes have a lot of training they need. Even if we haven&#x27;t trained for this particular strain or species, we will most likely fare better than the solution that has never been tried ever.<p>What if the children of those vaccinated turn out to be much weaker against other common antigens start dropping dead? It will set humanity back by a lot.<p>These are not exaggerated hypotheticals. These are VERY REAL possibilities: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5607155&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5607155&#x2F;</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK233000&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK233000&#x2F;</a><p>&gt;<i>since people don&#x27;t already have immunity, so your &quot;millions of years&quot; thing is completely off base.</i><p>We do. Most people are completely unaffeted by the virus. It&#x27;s a relatively small percentage that has severe problems. To endanger EVERYONE because a small percentage is affected is downright retarded. Having said that, I&#x27;m not at all against trying different things out. The best way to roll it out would be to do it over a VERY LONG PERIOD, spanning generations. And most importantly, keeping significant number of people completely unvaccinated. This has not been a problem until now because big enough population chose to be unvaccinated. However, the scale of current problem might mean that this could change... which is terrifying.')
