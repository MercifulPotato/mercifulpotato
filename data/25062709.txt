An architect did not build the SR-71. Physical engineering involves a feedback cycle and iterative design refinements, just like software engineering.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s common from some architect to just draw a blueprint, hand it off to some people to build it, and that&#x27;s it, we&#x27;re done here, my design came to life thanks to my Godly design skills (and the simple work of 40 lowly engineers). The SR-71 is a project that took years and years of work, lots of failed attempts, experiments and lessons learned. There&#x27;s no way that the majority of the credit for the SR-71 goes to some bossman architect dude who just told people what to do. It was very much teamwork. Everyone, including the test pilots, participated in its design and refinement.')
