There are multiple forums where people discuss nothing but Tesla, including some focused solely on the stock.  Many financial wizards have talked specifically about TSLA and how it is a bad investment, such as David Einhorn, and many of the stockholders have been happy to rally to higher prices because Elon Musk tweets he wants to see a higher number.<p>It seems like both stocks are targets of manipulation to me.')
