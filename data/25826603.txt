Neither me nor parent comments said that being visible today or in the past has anything to do with being visible in the future.<p>I would argue that science is about a core of what is considered proven and thus is true, as well as topics that are currently discussed and a large amount of knowledge that still has to be discovered. And I think these galaxies that are invisible today might be in the latter category - if they exist at all. But I wouldn&#x27;t rule out their existence unnecessarily. In a few years, due to advances in technology, it could be possible to &quot;discover&quot; (or rather estimate) far more galaxies than what is proposed in this study.<p>Just because mankind in the middle ages had never seen Pluto doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t exist back then.')
