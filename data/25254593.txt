The few exceptions are all based on RISC architectures). Thirteen supercomputers, including the no 2. and no. 3 are based on the Power ISA used by IBM POWER microprocessors, three on Fujitsu-designed SPARC64 chips. One computer uses another non-US design, the Japanese PEZY-SC (based on the British ARM[8]) as an accelerator paired with Intel&#x27;s Xeon.<p>There <i>are</i> non-x86 architectures in the TOP500, including ones which have less cruft than x86, but the x86 chips keep on being used in some of the fastest machines on the planet. My hypothesis is that x86 cruft doesn&#x27;t really matter, and you&#x27;d need to go to a cruft level that was orders-of-magnitude worse for the ISA choice to dominate performance.')
