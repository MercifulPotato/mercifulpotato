You only target small pieces of your program to be compiled to C or C++ for optimization, and the rest where runtime is already fast enough or otherwise doesn’t matter, you seamlessly write in plain Python.<p>Using extension modules is just a time-tested, highly organized, modular, robust design pattern.<p>Julia and others do themselves a disservice by trying to make “the whole language automatically optimized” which counter-intuitively is worse than make the language overall optimized for flexibility instead of speed, yet with an easy system to patch optimization modules anywhere they are needed.')
