Item(by='chihuahua', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609442770, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583674, text='I agree. I&#x27;ve had about 400 Amazon orders over the past 20 years, and as far as I can remember, with every single one the item was as described and with good quality. I think I&#x27;ve had 3 problems over the years (item didn&#x27;t arrive; missing part; container of spices opened during shipping) that were accidental in nature, and they were easy to resolve (refund or replacement)<p>It does help to be a bit sceptical about some listings. For example, a webcam by &quot;GREETBUAY&quot; for $25 is probably not going to be of high quality. So I don&#x27;t buy those kinds of things. But in cases where the nature of the item is that it&#x27;s a single piece of plastic that just needs to be the right shape, I&#x27;ve bought them from sellers with bizarre machine-generated names and received exactly what I wanted.')
