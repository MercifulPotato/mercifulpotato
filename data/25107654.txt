Nothing he ever says can wash the blood off the hands of a man who dedicated his life to preventing gun control, supporting the Iraq War and profiting from the military industrial complex. The only justice possible for a ghoul like Koch is the forfeiture of his assets and the blade of a guillotine.<p>Charles Koch deserves to die and I will celebrate when he does. I hope future generations will piss on his grave.')
