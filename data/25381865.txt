I get what you’re saying. I do. I need results and I need SMEs so I’ll gladly pay the rates. But, I’ve come to think of contractor rates are actually just market rates and thus appear to be colluded. A similar thing I see happen in construction contracting as well. A “going rate” is informally decided (eg. price per foot for flooring installation), so I could get 10 quotes and they will look very similar; the outliers being fly by nights and the white gloves. I don’t see the rates as tied to much else than what they feel the market will bear. It will go up as quickly as the market will allow.')
