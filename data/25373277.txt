Or not in a strict sense at least.<p>Last year I had a bit of a crisis. I believed that I needed to become more focused on one particular area to facilitate long term professional success. I think I got this advice directly or indirectly from different people at different times.<p>But I couldn&#x27;t. I looked at specific areas to specialize in isolation. All of them are interesting, but I could feel almost physical pain from just thinking to narrow down my focus on any of those.<p>Then I gave up, and what a relief that was. I realized that I&#x27;m not wired this way. I see the connections between the things. That&#x27;s what draws my attention and endlessly motivates me. Tackle a new problem, refine my skill a bit here, bolster my knowledge a bit over there.<p>Quoting Heinlein: Specialization is for insects.<p>This resonates with me.<p>Now I&#x27;m a programmer (full-stack web), teacher, consultant. Recently also started learning technical writing and working towards building an animal sanctuary.<p>I see more and more connections between those things, which is satisfying and rewarding, often in unpredictable ways.')
