At the start of the interview the store manager told me that he had been busy preparing the shop&#x27;s regular report of addresses  of everyone who had purchased a new TV for TV licensing. I imagine these were then cross-referenced against who had a TV license for potential follow-up. I struggle to see how the idea of TV detector vans were more than &#x27;enforcement theatre&#x27;, although possibly a cheap and effective strategy in the past.')
