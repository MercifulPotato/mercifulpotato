Item(by='bombastry', descendants=None, kids=[25313954], score=None, time=1607155308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311848, text='Org-Capture creates a temporary buffer, inserts its template string, processes the special escape sequences (called &quot;%-escapes&quot;)[1], and then lets the user edit the buffer before adding it as an entry. Where the entry goes is specified by the code that sets up the template.<p>The power here comes from the %-escapes, which range from asking the user for a prompt and pasting it in that location (&quot;%^{PROMPT}&quot;) to arbitrary code execution (&quot;%(EXP)&quot;) that can include text input from the user from other %-escapes. There are escapes to insert the file name (&quot;%f&quot;) and the full file path (&quot;%F&quot;) of the file that was visited when the template was triggered.<p>I think it&#x27;s a lot easier to evaluate this kind of thing in action rather than in screenshots, so I&#x27;ve added an example screen recording[2] with a keylogger to show what a capture using a fairly simple template looks like. This Imgur album has both the screen recording as well as what the resulting entry looks like after it is saved.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orgmode.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;Template-expansion.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orgmode.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;Template-expansion.html</a>\n[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;l8jwbnN" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;l8jwbnN</a>')
