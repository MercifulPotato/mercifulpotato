I haven&#x27;t really played many AAA ports because I would prefer to play them on PC or on the Xbox.  But all of the indie games I&#x27;ve played as well as all the JRPGs, both Switch-exclusive and multi-system releases, have run flawlessly for me.  Considering the hardware in a Switch is about on par with a mid-grade phone from a few years back, and the Switch OS seems to be a fork of Android, I am consistently surprised at how well everything just works flawlessly with it.  My experience of trying to use phones as gaming devices have been pretty miserable and I don&#x27;t keep any games installed on my phone these days, despite always having flagship devices.<p>If they ever release an upgraded set of Switch hardware that maintains compatibility with previous titles, I&#x27;d be really interested.  But I have to be honest and say I&#x27;m not really dissatisfied with what it is today at all. Even the resolution is okay, considering the screen size.  Hades is one recent release that&#x27;s really great and works perfectly on the Switch, as an example.')
