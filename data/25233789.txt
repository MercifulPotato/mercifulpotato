That isn&#x27;t necessarily hard evidence of anything on its own, but fits the general pattern described in the rest of the story.<p>&gt; In a previous article, NYT failed to mention at all that Coinbase had provided severance of 6 months (which is very generous). NYT made it seems as these employees were forced out the company and lelft out in the streets<p>The departures described in this story all occurred prior to Coinbase&#x27;s no-politics severance offer.<p>&gt; Omitting key details, is a very malicious type of journalism, and NY Times has been doing that for a while.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what key details are omitted here. The rest of your argument, to me, is very conspiratorial. The NYT certainly has a point of view, and no one&#x27;s denying that. But considering that NYT has had incredibly strong financial results over the past 5 years, I find it difficult to believe that anti-tech stories are all part of a secret smear campaign to undermine a supposed business competitor.')
