Even citizens in most staunchly pro-European countries such as Germany, France, or the Netherlands culturally still see themselves as citizens of the respective country rather than Europe or the EU.<p>The most relevant factor in that respect is language. Most Germans don&#x27;t speak French. Most of the French don&#x27;t speak German. Hence, cultural and economic exchange might happen at the upper echelons of society but as for everyday life citizens of EU member states still pretty much keep to themselves, for the simple reason that they don&#x27;t understand each other.')
