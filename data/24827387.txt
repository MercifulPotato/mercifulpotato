A chess engine won&#x27;t care about what is natural and will maximize the position 15-20 positions down the line. For this reason, they will make sometimes a weird move given the current position that will result in an advantage a lot of moves downstream.<p>One of the main reasons that Petrosian &quot;got caught&quot; was other GMs (see Hikaru&#x27;s YouTube video on this) pointing out how unnatural some of his moves felt to them and considering the speed at which he supposedly calculated them.')
