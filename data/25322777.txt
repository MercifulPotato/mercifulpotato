The woman who asked me to do it didn&#x27;t even look at my profile where my profile pic clearly show that I am a male (beard, moustache and stuff..).\nThey&#x27;ve only seen the role I am on, experience and probably had some female name database where they filtered me out.<p>On more serious note, I got contacted by every FAANG(M) company in last 6 years and got hired two of them through it. Nice tool, but not for every sector.<p>Edit: words')
