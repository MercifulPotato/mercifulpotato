Maybe some of those rumored things will happen, but it&#x27;s pretty unlikely that <i>all</i> of them will happen.  (I&#x27;d be OK if the touchbar vanished though!)<p>Apple just announced a magnetic feature for their phones called &quot;MagSafe&quot;.  What&#x27;s the chance that the revived MacBook feature called &quot;MagSafe&quot; won&#x27;t be something phone related?  A charging region on the notebook seems hard to believe but stranger things have shipped.<p>The author is also quite dismissive of the 12&quot; MacBook which for me was a breakthrough product.  I traveled around the world with one in my bag, wrote a ton of code, and often had to check to see if it was in my bag, it was so light.  I&#x27;d still be using it except it turned out one day not to be rainstorm-proof :-(.<p>As for the SD slot: I asked Jobs about this in the early 2000s (this was around when PCMCIA was phasing out) and he was dismissive for the same reason: &quot;Oh, you have an SD card?  Do you also use CF?  And Memory Stick?&quot;  This was painful because indeed, I used all three.<p>The fact is the TB3 (USB4) ports are powerful enough that they can connect to almost anything a user has.  I know everybody&#x27;s milage varies, but for me that&#x27;s more powerful than a dedicated port I only use occasionally (as FW400 was for me) or never (FW800 in my experience).')
