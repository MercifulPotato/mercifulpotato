Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25720285], score=None, time=1610313573, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25719626, text='<i>&gt; will the gullible and not-so-gullible-but-partisan accept actual, material evidence when it&#x27;s presented?</i><p>What is being presented is not evidence. It&#x27;s absence of evidence, combined with blunt assertions. That&#x27;s not what we should be getting from a truly secure election system.<p>Years ago, the kernel.org servers that host the source code to the Linux kernel were hacked. Lots of people and lots of corporations use Linux, so the security of the source code of the kernel is a serious issue. So what did the owners of the kernel.org site do? Did they shout over and over that there was no problem? Did they make a huge effort to argue against people (and there were plenty of them) who claimed this showed Linux was just not a serious OS, as compared to those other OSs owned by large corporations? No.<p>What the kernel.org owners did was much simpler. They just <i>showed the security measures they already had in place, and explained how and why they worked</i>. And since those security measures were good ones, based on cryptographically secure methods of signing and verifying code and detecting tampering, and since they were open, so anyone who wanted to could check and verify them, <i>that was all they had to do</i>. All the accusations and speculations about insecurity simply evaporated.<p><i>That</i> is the kind of security we should have for elections. And it&#x27;s blatantly obvious that we don&#x27;t. And until we do, given how divided the country is, we will continue to have close elections that the losing side, or at least a significant portion of it, refuses to recognize as legitimate. This problem cannot be handwaved away, and it cannot be solved by shouting louder, the way Americans do in foreign countries in the hope that it will cause the natives to start understanding English. It can only be solved by implementing a secure, and <i>transparently</i> secure, election system, where nobody has to take anybody else&#x27;s word that nothing questionable happened.')
