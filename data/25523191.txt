Identrust will do so using their <i>expiring</i> cert which, due to Android&#x27;s certificate policy <i>should</i> work.<p>From TFA[0]:\n&quot;IdenTrust has agreed to issue a 3-year cross-sign for our ISRG Root X1 from their DST Root CA X3. The new cross-sign will be somewhat novel because it extends beyond the expiration of DST Root CA X3. This solution works because Android intentionally does not enforce the expiration dates of certificates used as trust anchors. ISRG and IdenTrust reached out to our auditors and root programs to review this plan and ensure there werenâ€™t any compliance concerns.&quot;<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letsencrypt.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;21&#x2F;extending-android-compatibility.html#" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letsencrypt.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;21&#x2F;extending-android-compati...</a>')
