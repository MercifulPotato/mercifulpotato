If you divide the number of deaths by an IFR of 1% you get 30 million infected so far, while with an IFR of 0.5% you get 60 million. There are probably half a million infections every day right now, so 100 million by February doesn&#x27;t seem that far fetched.<p>Though I see no reason to complain about the FDA dragging its feet, given that the bottleneck to vaccinating the populace is manufacturing, not authorization.')
