The city found a hired gun to manage the costs from $3 billion down to $1.2 billion, but alas, nobody except the occasional JAL flight uses that terminal.<p>Smaller airports available for public use get FAA airport improvement funds, which is why the US has more airports than the rest of the world combined, and why Walmart can use private jets to fly managers from store-to-store, sometimes 3 in a day.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faa.gov&#x2F;airports&#x2F;aip&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faa.gov&#x2F;airports&#x2F;aip&#x2F;</a>')
