There are products from CDNs like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;argo&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;argo&#x2F;</a> which combine CDN cache tiering with higher tier network transport to origin servers for all cache misses (or uncacheable content). Again though, it depends on if it&#x27;s critical to your site&#x27;s performance or not. If you don&#x27;t have a bunch of uncacheable content, that content doesn&#x27;t need the absolute best transport, or the time&#x2F;money could improve some other part of the site speed more then it&#x27;s not critical to your site&#x27;s performance.')
