In cases where it is 100% false I think your approach works (although it might not actually be a sufficient deterrent).<p>In practice they always seems to be mixed with partial truths (when you read past the headline)... plus, determining what&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; is kind of a nonstarter, especially at that scale.<p>I am also certain you would find things on NYT, WaPo, etc. that is not 100% truthful, even if the consequences are not as egregious. It&#x27;s not just Breitbart. I say this because people on the other side of the aisle will take whatever you design and throw it back at you.<p>Identifying critical thinking as the problem (as you did in your post) is IMO somewhat right but maybe too hard of a problem to solve (as you pointed out).<p>The way I see it... we&#x27;re in the middle of a tug-of-war between the old guard that used news &amp; other power structures to broadcast what they wanted, and the new, democratized users who felt they didn&#x27;t need to trust them while simultaneously being empowered to have their own voice heard.<p>The former would manipulate our perception of what was going on through news (print &#x2F; media), while the latter are empowered by companies that control the new media landscape (Twitter &#x2F; FB &#x2F; IG).<p>What&#x27;s interesting about the latter is that they leverage a system that was designed innocuously (&quot;serve better ads&quot;) but can be adapted to control someone&#x27;s perception of what is happening in the world (targeted content &#x2F; engagement).<p>As of late, I&#x27;ve been thinking that the way forward is going to be identifying the forces that drive extreme polarization and re-imagining them to reign them in.<p>When I look at what happens with the way feeds are designed, there is such a crazy reinforcement of what I already &quot;like&quot; that drives polarization that maybe it really is just as simple as re-designing the feed to promote more diversity of content. It could be enough to temper some of the extreme outliers of craziness we see on either side of the aisle.<p>I will admit I am arm-chairing a bit here...')
