A single card doesn&#x27;t need to answer absolutely everything there is about a red black tree. You want to ask about a single aspect of it per card.<p>The definition is &quot;what is it?&quot;. There is nothing to understand here. It could be taught to a parrot or child to repeat this information.<p>What you&#x27;re mentioning is a bunch of cards on top of that: how does a red black tree stay balanced on insertions? When is the self-balancing property of red black trees useful? When is it not? Etc etc.\nYou cannot answer this if you mistake a red black tree for another tree for example. It&#x27;s essentially vocabulary.<p>Another one would be notations: what&#x27;s the symbol for a cross product? Again, nothing to understand, but you must know it to work on actual math problems involving cross products.')
