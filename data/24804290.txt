There are promising candidates, sure, but I don&#x27;t think any have already been shown to be both effective and safe, which I&#x27;d say is required for one to be working, on the timescales that are needed, and I wouldn&#x27;t know how one might do that so quickly. The current forerunners might well not work out, though I hope at least one of them will work, but my understanding is that anything immunity-related is fiendishly hard.')
