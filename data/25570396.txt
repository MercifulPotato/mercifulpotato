They don&#x27;t even work with the normal socket APIs without doing some extra gymnastics (specifying interface indices etc).<p>What does work though is ULA (Unique Local Addresses) - they&#x27;re  also designed to prevent conflicts when you eventually end up making a mashup of your and someone else&#x27;s network who also wanted to use their own addresses.')
