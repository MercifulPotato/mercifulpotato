But because so much of the content I used to consume with it is gone now. I used to follow a few dozen blogs that got updated regularly, and had RSS feeds. Now almost all those blogs are dead, migrated to Substack or Twitter, or post so infrequently that it&#x27;s not worth a subscription.<p>A decade ago, the web browser felt like an endless source of amazing content, and an RSS feed was a great way to keep track of a lot of it at once. Today, I feel like there&#x27;s still great content, but it&#x27;s in Twitter feeds and newsletters, and my browser is for accessing webapps and storefronts. Maybe I&#x27;m looking at the wrong content or just don&#x27;t know where to go to find the good stuff anymore, but somehow the end of Google Reader was prophetic, and whether that was a self-fulfilling prophecy or not is up to each of us to decide.')
