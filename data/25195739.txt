My understanding is that Google and Facebook have centralized hiring pipelines and so an exception would be a lot more unique than, say,  Microsoft,  where each org&#x2F; team defines their own standards and requirements. (By the way, this is why internal transfers at MS can require an interview process. Some orgs don&#x27;t trust the hiring standards of other orgs and have rules for which transfers require a technical interview and which don&#x27;t.)')
