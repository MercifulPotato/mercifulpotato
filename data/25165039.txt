DNSSEC isn&#x27;t happening. Enabling DNSSEC in your local configuration won&#x27;t meaningfully protect you, because you depend on the security teams of large companies to also participate in the system, and DNSSEC has been more or less rejected by the market. Meanwhile: there are specific problems that DoH does protect against, it&#x27;s easy to roll out, and doesn&#x27;t depend on the Stripe security team changing their mind about DNSSEC --- so DoH is on a path to become universal, even as DNSSEC whithers.<p>(I invite the curious to test my reporting out with the `host -t ds foo.com` command, for arbitrary values of &quot;foo&quot;).<p>I know I sound like a sore winner about this, and I guess I sort of am, but it is a little alarming that there are still currents of sysadmin wisdom telling people to go out of their way to opt into DNSSEC, in the belief that it will somehow protect them from any kind of real attack. In reality: corrupted DNS records overwhelmingly come from phished registrar accounts, not the elaborate, geographically-specific DNS cache corruption attacks DNSSEC was envisaged to deal with. I think it&#x27;s worth being plain with people about this stuff.')
