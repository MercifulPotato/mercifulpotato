To prevent literally what is happening right now, and to make it impossible for any US government agency to ever prosecute either Assange or Snowden.<p>Thats why!  Because he is subject to an extradition request.  All of that could have been prevented, with a pardon.<p>This is Kafkaesque levels of reasoning here.  Literally what was predicted was going to happen, did indeed happen.<p>And every justification for &quot;Well, why would you pardon someone who is not being arrested&quot;, is literally proven wrong, because this is what ended up happening!  The current state of Assange is the proof and the reason why everyone who was arguing against a pardon were wrong.<p>&gt; Obama repeatedly stated he would not pardon anyone not convicted of a crime<p>Yes, because he wanted those people to be sent to jail.  Because of the efforts that he was doing to get them sent to jail.  Thats why.  Obama could have stopped all this stuff from happening, but he didn&#x27;t.  Thats the evidence.')
