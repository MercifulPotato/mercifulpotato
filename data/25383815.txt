Why are you advocating to have your own rights&#x2F;freedoms removed for the benefit of the company? Not even the company is asking for that. Why don&#x27;t you leave advocating for the company to paid advocates of the company?<p>Let&#x27;s be super clear, once you purchase the car, it&#x27;s not <i>their</i> product, it&#x27;s <i>your</i> car. That&#x27;s how ownership works. Once it is in your physical lawful possession, it is your to do with as you please. The entire legal system is built around this idea.<p>For instance, if someone steals my car and wrecks it, does Volkswagen sue the car thief for damages, or do I? If you answered anything other than Volkswagen, it&#x27;s not &quot;their product&quot; anymore.')
