It had a beautiful wysiwyg interface and the most elegant way of writing equations. You used the tab key a lot to cycle between symbols. So &quot;3=&lt;tab&gt;4&quot; might turn the = into an equivalence sign; another tab might give you approximately equal; and so on. Or &quot;a -&gt; &lt;tab&gt; &quot; would let you cycle through different arrow styles.<p>In the end I gave up because LyX seemed better supported. I&#x27;ve not tried it for a long time. Since then I&#x27;ve learned to hate  TeX vehemently; that system really needs to die. It would be good to have more alternatives. (TeXmacs itself isn&#x27;t TeX, but uses some weird lisp-like syntax IIRC.)')
