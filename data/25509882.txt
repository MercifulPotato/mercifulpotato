BOM*quantity + mold cost. Those are sort of the basic knobs you can fiddle with. Not all molds are equal. I was just talking with someone last week who was going to 3d print one of the housings for a component he&#x27;s designing, since the quantities are low, but found a molding technique that&#x27;s low quality but simple, and he said it was maybe an order of magnitude cheaper than anything I was familiar with, so learning about molding processes can allow you to design products with a cheaper upfront cost there. I think he said this mold he was looking at was like on the order of hundreds of dollars, instead of thousands of dollars that I typically expect.<p>BOM reduction can be tricky. Lowering your BOM makes more sense the larger your production runs, but when selecting components  I tend to sort by price, then find the cheapest component that satisfies my needs. Of course, a more expensive component may allow you to skip other related circuitry, giving a cheaper overall build, so diving into datasheets is important.<p>Quantity is the other thing you have some control over, but lower quantity batches have higher per item costs. Setting up a pick and place for a single board takes the same amount of time as setting one up for a larger run. If your quantities are low enough eventually setup fees are likely to start being a bigger percentage. Quantity also effects BOM costs. You can easily pay 2x as much for a component at low volumes, so you may not actually save as much as you think you will.<p>I agree with you that 30k isn&#x27;t cheap. But if you look at things historically, we&#x27;ve finally reached a price point for hardware, that you don&#x27;t need to be a big business to even think about having consumer quality electronics. Apple started with kits 40 years ago and took investor money pretty early if I recall my history correctly. Today I expect it to be easier to bootstrap a hardware company since there&#x27;s more infrastructure around bootstrapping. I&#x27;ve seen successful products that won&#x27;t do a production run until they have a certain amount of preorders. But hardware is just always going to be fundamentally more expensive than software')
