Nim offers similar guarantees overall (checked arrays etc) and Nimler has exception checking enabled so the compilers checks if you have any possible checkable exceptions. Personally, I use Nim since it’s easier to use on embedded Linux devices by precompiling to C. Rust has some odd dependencies on the target’s C linker but doesn’t check the standard $CC or $LD variables. Zig is interesting but it offers the least memory protection.')
