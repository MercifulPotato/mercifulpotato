I&#x27;m not a sperm donor, it just seems wrong to open up doors that were never agreed to under the original terms of the sperm donor agreement.<p>And regarding using the technology to search for criminals - it&#x27;s a classic slippery slope issue. Many of us are happy that a serial killer or other murderer&#x2F;rapist was found using the technology, but already police have used it to find a burglar. I&#x27;m assuming that they&#x27;ll use it for non-violent drug crimes next.')
