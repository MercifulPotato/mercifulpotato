I just disagree a bit that you have to conform to a standardized way to use a platform. Perhaps you do, with OSX, and it <i>is</i> a unique problem there? Obviously due to market structure, Microsoft gears Windows to &quot;everyone&quot; without being the &quot;best&quot; for many people, although it tends to be the best for PC gaming.<p>What is holding me back from trying the M1, personally, is cost. I just paid $950 for a Ryzen 7 4800H with 16GB and GTX 1660 Ti. It can&#x27;t hold a candle to an M1 Macbook in battery life, but I know I can run my programs and play my games and not think twice about it. My failsafe is an electrical outlet. I&#x27;m hoping I can end up trying an M1 (or successor) through an employer though! I spent the past year using a ~2014 Macbook Pro through work, and for work things, it was better than my Windows machines for working on projects where everyone else used bash on a Mac. As WSL improved, I was able to be equally productive on my Windows machines and tend to use them and not bother with the Macbook Pro.<p>That&#x27;s all a lot of extra anecdote you didn&#x27;t need, but to be sure, I&#x27;m not trying to single out OSX - the OP singled it out by saying, essentially, &quot;you&#x27;re using it wrong!&quot;')
