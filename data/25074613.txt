Let alone that changing between phones has friction and can have significant costs.<p>Also by comparison consider the statement: &quot;The New York Central Railroad&#x27;s &#x27;monopoly&#x27; of railway access between 14% of the worlds cities doesn&#x27;t stop anyone traveling by road or doing business between any of the other cities in the world so clearly it&#x27; not a monopoly&quot;.<p>Having said that of course Apple is no where near as egregious a monopoly. However you&#x27;d have to agree any profit focused mobile app simply must (if it can) be available on iPhone and that does give Apple a monopoly position. It&#x27;s only a question of if Apple is abusing that position.')
