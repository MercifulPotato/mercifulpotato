However too often that is not the case.<p>Multiple times have I filed an issue, that collects many people&#x27;s &quot;me too&quot; and workarounds for over a year. And every month, stalebot comes and mentions everybody, so that I have to go and type in that stalebot command.<p>Until one day I give up, because I don&#x27;t want to get those notifications anymore, or because I move to a more active project. The issue gets closed even though multiple people are affected, and all they can do is open a new one, link to the workarounds somehow, and take over the duty of fighting the bot.<p>Why make everyone do this? You say you don&#x27;t owe me anything, but that&#x27;s different from taking active step to hurt your community.<p>(and by you I mean stalebot users like andrew_)')
