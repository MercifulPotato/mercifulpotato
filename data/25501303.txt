I&#x27;m sure the people buying the iCar are going to be the same ones dropping $1200 every year for the latest iphone<p>&gt; battery range<p>they seem to have a lot of experience with batteries<p>&gt; price and battery range are the biggest competitive factors with EVs<p>and the smartphone ecosystem was full of tiny physical keyboards before apple released the iphone. Apple has a unique way of redefining &quot;must have&quot; features when they enter the market.<p>If anything, I think tesla will be the android of EVs and the iCar will be the iphone of EVs')
