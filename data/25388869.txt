Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607710976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25380679, text='&gt; No one person can hold all the information, discoveries we have accumulated over the years, so we ultimately rely on the belief that someone we respect is trustworthy.<p>Agreed.  However:<p>a) it is not necessary to accept these beliefs as epistemically flawless<p>b) it is possible (and useful) to be consciously aware that we have done this (as opposed to holding the perception that we <i>know(!)</i> these things)<p>&gt; With these things aside, the both sides mentality stops being applicable at a certain point.<p>I&#x27;m not sure, so I will ask for clarification: do you believe I have asserted that both sides are equal, <i>at the object level</i>?  I am pointing out their similarity at the abstract, neurological level, although perhaps that is lost in translation (but the more explicit one is, it seems the more offense is often taken)<p>&gt; While one side can show you thousands of evidence that a certain cure does work, the other side shows one questionable example of it not working and it is enough for their believers<p>How confident are you that this belief is accurate?  You realize that it is an intuitive belief, at least now that I point it out, right? (And I do not mean this in a snarky way, I mean it literally, and seriously, for reasons that may not be obvious).<p>&gt; So as to answer the specific case with antivaxxers: I will not engage with such an argument because they in fact have no scientific leg to stand on automatically.<p>This suggests omniscience, on at least two levels. (I do not intend this in a snarky way either.)<p>&gt; For to have any meaningful debate, we would have to talk about a specific vaccine that may or may not be safe.<p>There is no shortage of anti-vaxxers willing to have that conversation.  Finding one that genuinely knows what they are talking about, that is another matter, but there are some very well read people among all the idiots.<p>&gt; If we have such a strong statement (in a mathematical sense) that ALL instance of something is a given property, is ought to not be true in a mathematical sense - and without understanding probabilities [and epistemology] there is no point in arguing.<p>Does this apply to both sides of the disagreement?  :)<p>I believe that a big part of the problem here (and the numerous other culture war arguments that are currently raging out of control) is that people tend to approach&#x2F;discuss the issues from a strict object level perspective, and also that both parties tend to not be mindful that such discussions are fundamentally a neurological process, and therefore subject to all the flaws and fallacies inherent in any such undertaking (which seem to be heavily amplified in discussions that are indeterminate, and culture war based) [1].<p>I believe that if people <i>really</i> cared about optimizing outcomes on these issues as much as they proclaim&#x2F;self-perceive that they do, they would be willing to take the steps that are necessary to do so, or at least consider the ideas.  But alas, it seems to be a bit of an intractable, recursive&#x2F;coordination problem.  Maybe things will get better in 2021 - one should never give up hope!<p>[1] For example, if you go looking for it specifically, can you spot any omniscience (lack of self-awareness) in this thread (both in the noted anecdotes, as well as in the conversation itself)?:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25385833" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25385833</a>')
