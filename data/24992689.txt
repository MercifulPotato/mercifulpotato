Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=[24992902], score=None, time=1604521326, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24992476, text='&gt;Canâ€™t you argue that they have no way to know whether the other links are also infringing or whether those other users have a legitimate license for the content?<p>IANAL so maybe the plausible deniability here is enough legal protection, but this is an argument that rings hollow to me from a technical perspective. Usually content ripped from physical media is not stored in its original format, especially during the timeline of MegaUpload&#x27;s existence.  The data is going to be encoded in a different format and therefore could have a variety of different potential hashes.  A bunch of people having exactly the same version of this media indicates that it is a single encoding being repeatedly shared.')
