I have made small contributions to open source projects, including fixing typos, and have never felt unwelcome.<p>I&#x27;m a teacher of economics and open source software including Python, Julia, LaTeX, R and Linux are essential to my work. I would find it hard to pay for proprietary equivalents of all the open source software I use. I consider it my duty to contribute back in whatever way I can.<p>My national pride is not hurt just because another Indian who did something wrong was criticised on the Internet.')
