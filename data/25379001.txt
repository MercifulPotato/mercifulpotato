Specific things worked reliably which seemed like they were inconsistent, broken and&#x2F;or untried by their developers, elsewhere.  And the Debian Policy makes packages and the system as a whole work well, more consistently, IMO.<p>(Though I mostly use OpenBSD now -- when I have to use a linux, it is debian or devuan.)<p>Edit: also, Debian is very easy to install, has extensive documentation, and (IIRC) commercial support is available.  There are reasons that there are more eventual Debian derivatives than of any other distro.')
