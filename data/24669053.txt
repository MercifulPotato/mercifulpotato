The infamous. The scoundrels! A household name, in fact. The textbook definition of organized crime! Our kids aren&#x27;t safe with all these...video game console hackers. I can&#x27;t believe a bunch of feds are getting paid to investigate and track down geeks in their basement. I think there&#x27;s more important issues to focus on. Regardless of how you view this, I think we can all agree that it&#x27;s a waste of resources. I think they should all go get a real job. Maybe Captain America will bust into some nerds house one day and beat the crap out of him for hacking his xbox. Would pay to see that movie. It probably wont come out though because it would make no sense at all.')
