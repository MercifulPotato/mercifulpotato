Gave up on it and went back to regular razors. The difference in cost is maybe $20&#x2F;yr for me but the time difference makes it not worth the trouble. Back when I was living off a $700&#x2F;month, safety razors made sense (cause $10 for 100 blades)... But now I&#x27;m living off more than 10x that and it doesn&#x27;t make sense.')
