What are facts other than just things where you can verify? Where you can think &quot;Ok, I agree that this is true&quot;. Like 2 + 2 = 4. We probably can both verify this, so that&#x27;s a fact. How about e = mc2 ? Well, it&#x27;s stood the test of time and many physics professors saying what it means, so to me this is also a fact. Same with the fact that the earth is spherical; but if you talk to a flat-earther, they&#x27;ll start saying all sorts of nonsense (at least to me) because they don&#x27;t believe the hundreds of years of research, and &quot;want to see it for themselves&quot;, and what they &quot;see&quot; is that the earth is flat (because they have confirmation bias)<p>Yesterday MSM reported live as Trump supporters attacked the Capitol. I see that as factual information, there were thousands at a Trump rally nearby, presumably because they wanted to hear their leader talk; and nobody&#x27;s said these people dispersed and a bunch of others came from the bushes...<p>The media also said &quot;x thousand more people died due to Covid-19 yesterday&quot;, here I do have implicit trust that the reporting is correct, then again they&#x27;re just reporting numbers from government agencies. TBH I&#x27;m not that invested in this that I need to proof whether the number is correct or not, but that&#x27;s the thing isn&#x27;t it; a Covid-denier wants to think Covid is a lie, and therefore the number of deaths is a lie, because there&#x27;s something in it for them, maybe it&#x27;s because their business is currently shut down and their bank account is being drained and they&#x27;re going to lose their house and go hungry soon..')
