Though the pay is not as high as being in the US, it&#x27;s decent. The lifestyle is good. The people are great. The tech punches above it&#x27;s weight. There is a good focus on success through numbers, vs too much talk in the US (my impression anyway).<p>When you&#x27;re talking about contracts, that makes me think you&#x27;re working for a consultancy, or similar job shop. That&#x27;s not where the good work is.<p>A &quot;tech backwater&quot;??? I&#x27;m a bit jaded because I worked at CSIRO, met a few Atlassian people before I moved here (and before it was big), saw friends and co-workers become early hires at Canva, OneLogin, Propeller, etc etc.<p>With the new tech we&#x27;ve been working on in the health space, my co-founder and I were surprised to discover one of the bigger BCI companies does all their R&amp;D in Sydney! We commented on how big things are quietly being done in Sydney. But hey, our old boss invented WiFi, so we are looking at things through that lens.<p>Australia punches above it&#x27;s weight for tech, perhaps you&#x27;re just not in the right circles.')
