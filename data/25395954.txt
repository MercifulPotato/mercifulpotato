I went to tournaments and blew up or \ncoped with anger pushed down and turned rancid. It wasn&#x27;t being mad at people who were better at me, it was being mad at myself for not being better. I used losing as an excuse to self-flagellate. Trying harder to be competitive was utterly counterproductive.<p>Going on testosterone blockers helped a little bit, but really it was important for me to realize that this <i>was</i> a manifestation of a real emotional problem I had. It was also important for me to realize that while it was my responsibility to cope with, there is no possible way it could have been my fault. I&#x27;d been pushed and prodded to be the best at everything I did since I was three years old, so naturally I cultivated my experiences accordingly. I didn&#x27;t ask for that. I&#x27;ve had to learn to see the way I see the world as a bunch of adaptations to a profoundly inhumane environment, and that makes it a little more possible to deconstruct them.<p>My inner critic is an introject of my emotionally neglectful and sometimes abusive parents and the teachers I had when I was very young, all of whom had the same utterly unreasonable expectations of me. &quot;Git gud&quot; doesn&#x27;t have a time limit attached. Maybe, when people say that, you should be hearing &quot;git better.&quot; Maybe you need to git gud at gitting gud. Question your beliefs. Interrogate the notion that you&#x27;re unworthy of self-compassion because you&#x27;re Bad At Something. Physically scream at it if you have to. Say, &quot;Get out of my fucking head,&quot; and hold what&#x27;s left gently and say &quot;it&#x27;s okay.&quot; Let yourself cry. It&#x27;s okay.<p>Find more things to suck at. Sucking at stuff is punk as hell.')
