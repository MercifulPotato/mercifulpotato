To the end user, this is a problem with MacOS, which does not allow GPU vendors to update their OpenGL drivers. Meanwhile, Ubuntu has far superior OpenGL performance <i>and</i> superior Vulkan performance on the same hardware.<p>&gt; It’s a lie to say “The software adds a 30% performance penalty on top” based on these results.<p>You keep saying that, but you haven&#x27;t explained why. MacOS is also twice as slow on git operations according to the benchmarks. Java2D and git are software that people use that are multiple times slower (not merely 30%) on the same hardware.<p>&gt; I’m not going to watch YouTube videos.<p>Then I&#x27;ll post text summarizing them. Android on midtier previous generation phones launches apps to interactivity faster than iOS running on latest generation hardware, and this has been the case for about ten years now. There are hundreds of videos on YouTube substantiating that.<p>Edit to respond to below comment due to rate limiting:<p>&gt; YouTube videos, however many, are not a credible source of operating system performance claims. You can find YouTube videos supporting flat earth theories or that Obama is a lizard alien.<p>The YouTube videos doen&#x27;t <i>say</i> that Android is faster. They <i>show</i> that Android is faster. You seem to not understand the difference between people claiming things are true and people showing things are true.<p>It&#x27;s the same with the 30%. I showed a suite of benchmarks where MacOS is 30% slower on average. It was <i>many times</i> slower on a few specific benchmarks I called out.<p>&gt; If you are a heavy Java or OpenGL user, don’t by a Mac.<p>I&#x27;m glad we can agree on that. You forgot heavy git users.<p>Edit 2:<p>&gt; It creates a dishonest impression of the thread.<p>How does replying with edits create a dishonest impression of the thread when I very clearly indicate which comment I am replying to? If you would like to respond normally, there is a very easy way to enable that. Simply upvote my comments to disable the rate limiting.')
