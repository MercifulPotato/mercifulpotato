It&#x27;s more like &quot;X has happened, therefore X is an inevitable consequence of Y which preceded it.&quot;<p>You are splitting hairs now. The point I am making is that frequently on this site observations are discounted immediately as survorship bias. It almost as if it the only one people know.<p>It simply isn&#x27;t survorship bias if something been going on for hundreds of years in a particular direction.<p>&gt; Also, tropes are often tropes for a reason. You can&#x27;t dismiss something just because it comes up often.<p>I am dismissing it because it doesn&#x27;t make sense and it is frequently overused. Thus the hammer and nail analogy.<p>In any event it pointless continuing this discussion further. So lets just leave it.')
