This will mean the proliferation of rooftop solar and consumer batteries, as well as solar+batteries at utility scale</i><p>Rooftop solar and consumer batteries does require consumers to have access to capital, though.<p>It&#x27;s easy to forget (especially if you make $$$$$ in tech) that many people just aren&#x27;t in great shape financially. Even if rooftop solar pays off in the end, they may not have the cash sitting around, may not be able to qualify for a loan, or may have other more urgent needs (car loan, etc.).<p>Plenty of people will understand the payoff and will be able to push themselves over the hump to reach a more optimized state. But there will probably always be lots of people who can&#x27;t and will buy electricity instead.')
