The value proposition of a combined console and handheld, coupled with lots of nice games made it well worth it. On the other hand, I&#x27;m no longer interested in the Playstation series due to lack of backwards compatibility. I&#x27;ve still got lots of PS1 and PS2 games but no more PS2. If the PS6 will support them, I&#x27;d get it. Otherwise, not.')
