I don&#x27;t want to play games with my young nephews, and I don&#x27;t want to play random games with someone who is more or less experienced then me.<p>If you want to play games with friends, there are simple features exactly for that, and game-specific friends lists. Using the FB social graph for this is counter-productive.')
