I saw this article yesterday being raved about on foodie Twitter, but didn&#x27;t try submitting to HN because I figured many users might be a little annoyed by not only a food story, but one that takes 1,200 words (i.e. the length of &quot;Part 1: The Mystery&quot;) before getting to the chase. A 1,200 word scene-setting intro is a lot for any kind of reader so it&#x27;s a testament to the author&#x27;s skill that it&#x27;s entertaining enough to keep readers&#x27; attention.')
