Item(by='vmception', descendants=None, kids=[25298339], score=None, time=1607033065, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25295573, text='Okay.<p>Truce, one last &quot;ad hominem&quot; and I&#x27;ll move on<p>&gt; Of all the endless knowledge that humanity produces, you have to ask yourself whether or not thereâ€™s meaning in pursuing topics endlessly.<p>This is a verbose way of saying ignorance.<p>Okay moving on.<p>My real argument is that Tulip mania is actually the <i>worst</i> poster child of speculative bubbles, as the spot market was largely unaffected and for a brief period of time the futures market became very divorced. It also ended with a local bubonic plague, which means the speculators died, so we don&#x27;t really know if there was merit to the future delivery or not. Also public policy played a role in the futures contracts, and for that I would have to brush off more literature to expound upon. But the idea in popular culture is quite wrong.<p>I personally did not comment on beanie babies and ignored it. My first inclination on that speculative bubble is that it was silly, but I didn&#x27;t comment on it because I don&#x27;t know if there were supply and demand conditions to support it, and such imbalances can occur in any asset class whether there is utility or not.<p>Regarding crypto in the light of other speculative asset price bubbles, even ignoring the utility that it does have for a broader and broader set of people, the staying power alone has defeated the bubbles you mentioned. But to counter the lowest hanging rebuttal of &quot;but it can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent&quot; you have to then counter in how the utility does address a wider and wider market. Its not just a payments, it is far beyond payments right now, and all of these crypto assets inherit the payments capability.')
