Different countries use different\ncolors and styles for road markings. Some use yellow lines in\nthe middle, others orange in the case of redirection around\nconstruction sites. Then there are the cases where the lines are\nsimply incorrect or out of date(which famously lead to the fatal\nTesla autopilot crash).<p>It is impressive how far the technology has come, but it&#x27;s an\narea with countless edge cases and unpredictable situations\ncoupled with high stakes if something goes wrong. I can see\nself-driving trucks being adopted slowly on specific routes, but\na full switch not labeled as &quot;pilot project&quot; will still take a\nwhile I think.')
