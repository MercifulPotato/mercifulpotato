So the reporting about the given scoop may be 100% fair and honest, but there is still, in the bigger picture, a large statistical bias, since only some types of things qualify as &#x27;worthy of reporting&#x27; and get converted to scoops to begin with.<p>e.g. imagine one news outlet that only reports about homicides, another than only reports about theft, and another that only reports about covid deaths. All three can be perfectly factual, but they still present <i>radically</i> different views of what is wrong with the world to their readers.')
