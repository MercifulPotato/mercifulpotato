Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25683154], score=None, time=1610069877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25674615, text='&gt; I think an MBA will help you be a better manager if you want to be, because at least there&#x27;s some clue about what a &quot;good&quot; manager should look like.<p>I think even that part is disputed; we really don&#x27;t know what a good manager looks like. Some of what&#x27;s taught in MBA classes now is the opposite of what was previously taught, and there seem to be as many failure stories as success stories. I do take your point that maybe just thinking about anything other than the authoritarian mode is enough to raise a manager above the average, which is distressingly plausible.')
