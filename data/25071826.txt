At those odds, your expected wait to marry is over 16 years, which defeats the purpose.<p>Most people who are motivated to get married explore more than one option at the same time. So you do this <i>plus</i> some combination of other things likely to get you socializing with members of the other gender: start doing the weekly ski&#x2F; bike trips; going to pubs; going to yoga; join the square dancing club, etc etc. (Clearly my recent experience socializing with the opposite gender is pretty badly out of date).<p>Again, nothing legal&#x2F; ethical and guaranteed so the only way to increase the odds is to increase your exposure to your audience. If your goal is marriage, $120 and 6% on eHarmony is price and time competitive. Though likely not as fun as going on weekly ski or bike trips.')
