Agreed that a lot of text manipulation tasks that existed before the data exchange standards like JSON and XML came around don&#x27;t exist anymore. The use cases for Perl have reduced. But the overall point stands of course. People are willing to write 100 classes to extract a string from data, than learn to write 10 lines of regex code.<p>If the only thing you are willing to learn and use is a for loop, if statement and function&#x2F;class syntax. Anything will look off putting.<p>Just see how many programmers struggle with concepts like concurrency, pointers, recursion etc. It&#x27;s just that these people struggle to hold non-trivial concepts in mind.')
