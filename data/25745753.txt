It&#x27;s because they didn&#x27;t present any evidence.<p>I find it fascinating that it&#x27;s assumed if there&#x27;s fraud it&#x27;s to benefit Biden, and also that if Trump won then they&#x27;d consider the election fair.<p>Also, during recounts that did happen there were more votes for Biden that were added - which perhaps suggests there was fraud during counting in favour of Trump - however Trump&#x27;s vote count went up too from what I remember, but the proportion was that Biden had more votes that were missed during the first count; I haven&#x27;t looked into confirming this though.')
