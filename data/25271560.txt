For example, consider this:<p>ZUCK: yea so if you ever need info about anyone at harvard<p>ZUCK: just ask<p>ZUCK: i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, sns<p>FRIEND: what!? how’d you manage that one?<p>ZUCK: people just submitted it<p>ZUCK: i don’t know why<p>ZUCK: they “trust me”<p>ZUCK: dumb fucks')
