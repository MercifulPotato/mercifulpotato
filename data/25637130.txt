Today, we take for granted the &#x27;vault&#x27; space offered in games, but by storing items and currency both on the blockchain, new opportunities for in-app purchase become available that players will surely enjoy interacting with.<p>In this article, a &#x27;bank&#x27; is sold for $800,000 USD, and the purchaser of that &#x27;bank&#x27; will, presumably, get a fractional share of the revenue from all &#x27;vault this item&#x27; paid transactions. Since payment can occur either using in-game currency and&#x2F;or real money transactions, and presuming they get a blockchain currency listed on Coinbase, the owner of the castle will be able to cash out their revenue stream into their real world bank account.<p>I&#x27;m probably missing some subtle aspect of the specifics here, but that&#x27;s what I took away from it. I assume the creator of the game is hoping that the SEC will not realize that this is an $800,000 investment in a public offering of stock in their still-vaporware game. I also assume that by taking advantage of the Coinbase tax-paperwork infrastructure, the game&#x27;s operators will attempt to have no legal obligation to register as a financial institution, or otherwise owe any regulatory debt.<p>You may find value in reading the novel &#x27;REAMDE&#x27; as it spends some amount of time walking through the implications of a world where you can earn real money using virtual gameplay.')
