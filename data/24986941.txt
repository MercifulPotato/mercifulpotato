I&#x27;d agree with your evaluation with respect to the expressiveness and power provided by the language.<p>...but the tooling, at least at that time, was terrible. SBT was terribly overcomplicated, and full of foot-guns. I spent far too much time debugging dependency collisions, issues created by so-called &quot;autoplugins&quot; and other nuances that had nothing to do with getting real work done.<p>Now I&#x27;m writing a lot of Go. I&#x27;ll admit, it&#x27;s not nearly as fun to write. There&#x27;s a lot less creativity and expressiveness -- though I think this is probably a good thing. But it also feels like I&#x27;m getting a lot more stuff done, and the tooling is amazing.')
