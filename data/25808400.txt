Piracy actually takes a ton of work. Of course paying for a streaming subscription is the easiest solution: people just pay and enjoy what it offers. The problem is the fact they consistently offer the lowest quality product.<p>1. Horrible video compression to save bandwidth<p>When they offer users high definition content, they&#x27;re actually talking about the resolution of the image. The quality and detail of the image will almost always be much worse if compared to another source such as Blu-Rays. Netflix somehow manages to add compression artifacts to nearly 100% black frames. Scenes with a lot of movement are actually painful to watch.<p>Compare that to the obssessive attention to detail you can often find in piracy communities and the winner is obvious.<p>2. Censorship<p>These services aren&#x27;t afraid to cut content in order to broaden their audiences. They may even be required to do it by law. Pirates obviously don&#x27;t have these problems.<p>3. Annoying copyright issues nobody cares about<p>Netflix once had Terminator 1 and 3 but not 2, as well as Spider Man 1 and 3 but not 2. Was the license for these movies too expensive for them? Who knows? Who cares?<p>Want to watch a classic film? An influential film? Chances are it&#x27;s not on Netflix. Where is it then? Who knows... Maybe not actually available at all anywhere no matter where you look.<p>Piracy just ignores these issues. As a result it gives you access to almost everything humanity has ever created.<p>4. DRM<p>Netflix won&#x27;t give you access to their precious 4k+ streams if it feels your device isn&#x27;t locked down enough. Disney is even more aggressive with these measures. Even on my perfectly locked down PS4 system it won&#x27;t let me download content ahead of time. Apparently they think network connections are reliable.<p>Pirates simply don&#x27;t have these problems.<p>5. Superior technology<p>Netflix&#x27;s video player is garbage compared to mpv. The video players of every other streaming service manage to be even worse. It&#x27;s not just the basic-ness of it either: sometimes it stutters and falls out of sync with the audio, sometimes it screws up the rendering of subtitles...<p>The one area where streaming service technology wins is their ability to offer alternate audio streams.')
