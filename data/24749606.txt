The US is currently conducting a poll to decide most of the composition of its government (including some local and many national political positions) and as you claim, the voters will say &quot;all kinds of things&quot;.<p>But the answers stick anyway. Even though they say &quot;all kinds of things&quot; you live in a democracy and those &quot;all kinds of things&quot; decides the rules. Now, given that I&#x27;d be trying to maybe get them to say smarter things, but if you prefer to just smirk about it I cannot stop you.')
