That&#x27;s the extent of disclosure.<p>Trade secret just means that they don&#x27;t share the recipe and make efforts to keep it secret. Calling it a &quot;trade secret&quot; is really a marketing strategy as much as anything else. Just like the rumors that coca leaf extract are an ingredient... something that is &quot;neither confirmed nor denied&quot;.

One you start adding that many flavors to a recipe, the exact flavors are no longer important, and I&#x27;m sure you could replicate something similar at home if you were willing to do enough experimentation. There are a few recipes online that you can use.')
