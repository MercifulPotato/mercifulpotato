Through there are are very many cases where specific kinds of lies could be made illegal.  HOWEVER, for free speech to work, I think it&#x27;s supremely important for everyone in society to do whatever they can to suppress lies, liars, and falsehoods.  If that&#x27;s not done, <i>at best</i>, the public square will degrade to being little more than a useless Library of Babel [1].  Unfortunately, a lot of people nowadays can&#x27;t seem to tell the difference between a dissenting perspective and a lie, and that position ultimately discredits free speech.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Library_of_Babel;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Library_of_Babel;</a> &quot;In any case, a library containing all possible books, arranged at random, might as well be a library containing zero books, as any true information would be buried in, and rendered indistinguishable from, all possible forms of false information...&quot;')
