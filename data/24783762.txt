Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602725062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24783687, text='&gt;Twitter is a public forum akin to a government institution and is now censoring political viewpoints it disagrees with.<p>No it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a platform run by a private company for its own ends that offers membership under terms of service which grant it absolute, universal, irrevocable and arbitrary rights over user content and accounts. Terms of service that everyone with an account agreed to beforehand.<p>That it has global <i>reach</i> no more makes it a public forum than CNN, the BBC or the Wall Street Journal, and &quot;akin to a government institution&quot; is just an attempt to muddy the waters between the definitions of public and private enterprise.<p>If you or anyone wants to make this a free speech issue, don&#x27;t misrepresent the nature of the problem. State that you want the government to take over social media platforms, restrict their free speech rights and force them to publish content against their will. Even if it&#x27;s racist, even if it&#x27;s false, even if they&#x27;re not a general purpose forum, the men with guns should force them to.<p>People who claim, for instance, that it should be a crime for websites to moderate any content, in any way, that isn&#x27;t strictly illegal, or that all moderation should be subject to judicial review (both positions I&#x27;ve seen repeatedly here) should realize just how radical and potentially authoritarian such moves would be, particularly given their correlation with the current atmosphere of anti-leftist panic.')
