It&#x27;s a basic reddit-style forum that allows comments and up- and down-voting. What&#x27;s the secret sauce that causes Hacker News to &quot;support critical thinking&quot;?<p>The answer isn&#x27;t secret, and it&#x27;s pretty simple: there are commenting guidelines[1]. If you don&#x27;t follow the guidelines, your posts are killed. If you repeatedly don&#x27;t follow the guidelines, your account is restricted.<p>This is the <i>same exact</i> mechanism that distinguishes subreddits with high-quality comment sections (&#x2F;r&#x2F;science, &#x2F;r&#x2F;askhistorians) from the rest. And it&#x27;s worth noting that even the rest have <i>some</i> forms of moderation. You&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find anywhere on the Internet with no moderation that hasn&#x27;t become an absolute cesspool dominated by the worst possible actors.<p>&gt; As far as I know and saw, @dang and co try to be involved the minimum with the platform<p>If I&#x27;m reading this right, you acknowledge that @dang and co have the power to moderate Hacker News essentially however  they see fit, and yet you simultaneously recognize that they&#x27;re capable of exercising these powers judiciously and only when needed.<p>Maybe sit back and reflect on that for a minute.<p>&gt; ...in a few years I never saw content that was censored by the moderator.<p>You can literally see a graveyard of three dead comments on this very thread, that are invisible to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have `showdead` flag turned on. It&#x27;s not remotely difficult to find accounts whose posts are hidden by default from the community as a whole, to the point where some people make a point of notifying individuals who&#x27;ve been commenting for years without realizing that nobody can see their posts.<p>The fact that you don&#x27;t personally see moderation is not evidence that there&#x27;s no moderation.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
