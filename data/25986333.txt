As much as I really want to use it, I always end up doing ... Linux ... as opposed to any real work.<p>Just last week, I moved my laptop back to Windows from Ubuntu because it froze up on me at least a couple of times a day (and that is a XPS13 - a system which is supposedly built to run Linux).<p>I have been using Linux since kernel version 0.99 or something, so its not like I dont know my way around it. I just dont really care which OS I run. It just needs to get out of the way and work for me and not against me. Windows does a good enough job at that.')
