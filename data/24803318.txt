Item(by='ouid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602871183, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24799459, text='I think &quot;person A does X because not X represents a threat to their worldview&quot; is a pretty unlikely explanation for behavior, a priori. I don&#x27;t watch fox news because it represents a threat to my worldview. I don&#x27;t watch fox news because it makes me angry. It&#x27;s not impossible, of course, but there&#x27;s usually (always, imo) a deeper reason why a worldview needs to be protected. For instance, &quot;If I don&#x27;t believe X, I will lose my friends, who all believe X and believe that people who don&#x27;t believe X are evil, therefore I must avoid any potential evidence of not X&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s dangerous to approach this topic at all, but I would sincerely argue that modern trans-<i>activism</i> is by far the most visible example of this dynamic today. This is anecdotal, of course, but the only enforcement of gender roles that I am personally exposed to comes from this community. If I don&#x27;t believe in gender identity, and say so publicly, I am liable to lose friends. That strikes me as cultish and regressive.')
