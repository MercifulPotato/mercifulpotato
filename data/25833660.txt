A flat-rate tax is regressive, because poor people pay the same as rich people. A sales tax (such as VAT) is regressive, because poor people buy more stuff as a proportion of their income.<p>An income tax is progressive, because you pay more if you earn more.<p>Several people have claimed that the Beeb is some kind of &quot;public good&quot;.
