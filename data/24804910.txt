What you&#x27;re saying is that IBM has a business that generates revenue, but that business continues to exist (and generate revenue) despite people not actively being at a desk, not that IBM has somehow managed to find a way to make money from empty desks, right?<p>WeWork makes more money from an oversubscription model, and thus could also make money from desks being unused. (Have 10 desks, rent out &quot;13&quot;, and hope that all 13 people don&#x27;t need desks at the same time).')
