Then it was reassembled in the morning. This would leave a lot of room for error and possible contamination in the process. And the sight of a shake machine hitting full pressure with a misaligned O-ring in the barrel is a lovely one indeed.<p>So the newer machines take a different route: they self-pasturize. The machine goes out of service and slowly heats everything up to a bacteria-killing temperature (including the dairy mix inside), then cools everything back down to freezing temperature to serve.<p>This process takes about four to five hours.  But if you set the clock wrong, the machine will go into its cycle at some super-inconvenient time.  There are other triggers that can force a self-clean but in general it&#x27;s not &quot;broken&quot;, it&#x27;s just doing this process at a bad time for you.<p>I&#x27;m curious how this data is being sourced. The last I checked there was an effort to put cloud-based telemetry into every unit and have them report home constantly (both to the equipment maker and to McD), but that was never intended to be public data.<p>EDIT: Ah, I didn&#x27;t RTFT. He&#x27;s using the public ordering site to scrape it (and now the title has changed). But that does mean there&#x27;s some working connection from the equipment to the McCloud now.  That&#x27;s cool.  Or maybe a manager is doing it by hand.')
