People could make the same claims about microsoft, that it &quot;created&quot; it&#x27;s own OS market.<p>But we all know how that went. Microsoft lost its anti trust case.<p>&gt; antitrust has generally been focused on acquisitions and mergers<p>Or we could just look at the Microsoft case. The Microsoft case is directly applicable to Apples case.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if microsoft or apple &quot;created&quot; the market for OSes. They can still have significant market power.<p>Imagine if Microsoft took the same exact actions that Apple did regarding app stores, on internet explorer.<p>Imagine that Microsoft prevented all 3rd party web browsers, and then charged a 30% fee to websites accessed through IE.<p>This would be clearly and obviously anti competitive. Why can&#x27;t we use the same argument against Apple?')
