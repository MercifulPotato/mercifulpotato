You won’t convince anyone to take the vaccine without first admitting their concerns are valid and trying to address them.<p>I would say there are two major groups who would most reasonably decline a vaccine. First, is anyone who has already had COVID. Natural immunity is more effective than the vaccine at preventing COVID, and I don’t know of a single case of someone spreading COVID after recovering. The vaccine on the other hand is not proven to prevent spread, and is not proven to provide longer duration immunity than natural infection. The article makes no mention at all of what percentage of health care workers declined a vaccine because they are already naturally immune.<p>Second, is anyone who is pregnant, as the vaccine is completely untested in that scenario. Curiously, TFA’s only specific example of someone who declined is someone who was pregnant.<p>Given the efficacy of the vaccine, anyone who hasn’t already had COVID who doesn’t want to get COVID should take the vaccine. Anyone who hasn’t already had COVID who doesn’t mind taking the risk of getting COVID can pass on it. We should give doses to those who want it, as fast as possible. Doses sitting on shelves are the biggest problem, because we are overly concerned with micromanaging the queue.<p>It’s like loading passengers on a plane. Going from front to back in strict order is the slowest possible way to do it. As I recall, a purely random ordering will load the plane at nearly the optimal rate, and if you include the time outside the plane spent on ordering, random is by <i>far</i> the fastest. COVID vaccination rate probably works about the same way.')
