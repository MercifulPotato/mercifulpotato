Wide open. But I do find a some of his writing quite mediocre. I&#x27;m surprised by how highly he is regarded. I read Soul of The Marionette recently.and I thought it was a somewhat aimless and poorly written meander through other people&#x27;s ideas. Had a bit of a Gell-Mann moment as well when he discussed Philip K Dick and I found his summation of Dick&#x27;s ideas flat and lacking in insight: that was one of the writers on the book whose work I knew well.')
