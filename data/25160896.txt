If any supplier or subcontractor was dragging their feet, all we had to say was &quot;this is for a machine which makes the swine flue vaccine&quot; and we suddenly would somehow jump to the front of their queue. I imagine the situation is even more that way for anyone involved with Covid vaccines, so I am 0% surprised by how efficiently this was developed. Magical things happen with price and priority are no longer concerns. (edit:sp)')
