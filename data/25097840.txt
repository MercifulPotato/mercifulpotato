There is no reason at all that consciousness is impervious to a materialistic account. Consciousness can be framed as an emergent property of systems that can process the concept of self and actualize upon it and their environment.<p>You might say that <i>qualia</i> is impervious to materialistic account, however, arguments based on qualia that attempt to be a refutation of materialism are circular - for example, the p-zombie argument, that says that there could conceivably be a &quot;zombie&quot;, that acts exactly the same as a human but lacks consciousness, which is only possible if you accept that one could act perfectly human but lack consciousness, which is itself only possible if you accept that something may be different but indistinguishable from something else, which is itself only possible if consciousness is special in some way - which there is no reason to believe.<p>And so, I disagree that the existence of consciousness is inconsistent with materialism.')
