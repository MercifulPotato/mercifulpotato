It feels like a market for lemons, the cheap ones are obviously crap, but who is to say that an expensive printer will be any better, especially with all the silly strategies the bean counters are using to squeeze the last bit of revenue out of the consumer. Reading the other comments, HP seems to be the company to avoid (My last cheap laser printer from them, P1006, was reasonably good though, it just doesn&#x27;t support duplex and I won&#x27;t run around with double the paper that&#x27;s needed)<p>On the distance learning bit: My old iPad I used in college and grad school was great. When I had a bunch of readings to go through, I did prefer it to printing for the lower cost, synced notes, less to carry, better for the environment bits.<p>Now that I don&#x27;t have any class notes and assignments, I would really like a printer for the once a month 30-50 pages duplex prints. Especially since my iPad is essentially a brick now that it can&#x27;t access my Safari saved pages or iCloud Drive and can&#x27;t install Firefox â€“ yes it&#x27;s old, but it would work fine except for software, so I&#x27;m not getting a new one.')
