On HN I frequently see users claim that Google sells user data, but that isn&#x27;t true; user data is only used for ad personalization.<p>I also frequently see the claim that &quot;Don&#x27;t be evil&quot; has been removed from Google&#x27;s code of conduct, but it&#x27;s still clearly visible in the document.<p>I hope we develop better tools to combat misinformation in the next few years, because social media is far too effective at propagating it.  For every person that verifies and corrects a claim, there&#x27;s ten others who will gladly repeat it.  This is especially problematic when there&#x27;s a bias to exploit, be it political or otherwise.<p>&quot;A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes.&quot;')
