Thinking about it again, now, I think this may just be what cities&#x2F;towns are basically. It’d be interesting if that could be decoupled from territory somehow.<p>Edit - I.e. have the citizens of the “guest country” be employees of the guest country.<p>Some properties:<p>-It would probably be constrained to the currency of the host country.<p>-It’s income could be “tax” like a monthly subscription to its “citizens.”<p>-It would possibly work best if it did have some real assets to back its finances.<p>-The “warrior class” of the guest country could very well be well-versed lawyers within the host country.')
