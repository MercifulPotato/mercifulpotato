Item(by='jelliclesfarm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605827569, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25144327, text='I agree. But my model is slightly different. I feel it’s better to have children of multiple ages together in three schooling stages for multiple years.<p>Example: grade 1-5 can have children of that age range in that section for five years. Ditto for grade 6-9 etc. this way, children can learn at their own pace and time. And from their peers. Gives them more flexibility.<p>Schools should be for social education too and learning how to become adults. Parents should be more involved in forming peer groups rather than schools.<p>School buildings should be the only tax payers funded capital expense. And a skeleton crew of teachers with something like khan academy. Schools are where they can congregate for group studies or games or swimming pools or sports or music rooms or robotics meetups or shop work or fill in the blank etc.<p>Parents should raise children and make decisions. Not school unions. Also..why should those without kids in school pay taxes for everyone and sundry forever? There should be a base minimum towards public contribution for public education(the capital cost of neighborhood school buildings etc), but cost of raising and educating children should be shared amongst those whose children are studying. This will also help people make financially responsibly decisions as well location preferences when they want to grow and raise a family.<p>I am appalled that the govt..at least in the USA..has the responsibility of child care, child rearing and the other education. What are the parents doing? Parenting doesn’t end with just birthing your progeny.')
