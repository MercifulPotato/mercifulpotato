It&#x27;s easy to make mistakes and current software doesn&#x27;t really offer assurances. Right now I sometimes visually compare source &amp; destination directories. Like literally, make the windows the same size and scroll through them so I can notice if anything has visually shifted, which tells me files are missing. That&#x27;s how I found some missing RAW files, but turns out those were taken on the fuji&#x27;s auto settings which desn&#x27;t store RAW even though I have it set up to take JPEG+RAW (many such idiosyncrasies with these cameras).\nI then almost had a heart attack when I realized that my camera filenames did a roll over from 9999 to 0001 and I wasn&#x27;t paying attention. Luckily there was no overlap in that directory, but I could&#x27;ve easily clicked confirm to replace my earlier photos with new ones (DCIM better be replaced with something better soon).')
