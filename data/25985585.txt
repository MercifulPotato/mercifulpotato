When the anti-police movement (ACAB = All Cops Are Bastards)  erupted in San Francisco, I became angry at my fellow liberal kindred--some of my friends are cops, and they&#x27;re good cops, and I didn&#x27;t like seeing them being demonized.<p>Friendships help bridge many divides: It&#x27;s hard to be homophobic when half my friends are gay. It&#x27;s hard to hate Trump supporters when at least one of my rugby teammates is a Trump supporter (I don&#x27;t agree with him--I think he&#x27;s misguided--but I don&#x27;t hate him).')
