Item(by='341341', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604560125, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24995624, text='&gt; Gerrymandering<p>What does this have to do with a Presidential election?<p>&gt; vote suppression<p>Dead people, illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, and people who&#x27;ve already voted <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be able to vote. That the left opposes reasonable measures to prevent this, like voter ID laws, demonstrates clearly that they disagree.<p>And this &quot;count every vote&quot; mantra, even if restricted to the votes of citizens (meeting age, residency, and registration requirements), is still absurd. In my state, they print ballots in a half dozen different languages. I flatly disagree that someone who can&#x27;t read and write English (especially the basic English used in election materials) should be voting. Our laws are written in English. Likewise, if you&#x27;re too lazy to make the effort to vote and require a fraud-prone mail-in ballot, or if you&#x27;re so cognitively impaired that you can&#x27;t follow basic instructions and your ballot requires interpretation to divine intent, your vote shouldn&#x27;t count.')
