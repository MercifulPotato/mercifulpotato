I saved my paper route money (when that was a thing) and bought the Amiga 1000 as soon as it was available. I loved the computer and I am thankful for how it set me up for my expectations about what personal computing should be.<p>HOWEVER...<p>I&#x27;m perplexed how I keep seeing all these projects over the years to revive the platform. AmigaOS was good for its time but there&#x27;s nothing it offers now that any modern OS doesn&#x27;t do now. For how cutting edge it was, it was an unstable POS too.<p>GAH!')
