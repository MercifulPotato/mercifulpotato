In fact if you fixed each item here, it would be worse.<p>Jira sucks because it is unopinionated and infinitely customizable. As a result, everybody who believes they&#x27;ve discovered the perfect project management setup (spoiler: they haven&#x27;t) is empowered to cook up their vision via an inscrutable set of customizations. This leads to a bunch of inconsistencies between projects and endless bikeshedding. I imagine all this dynamic configuration is also the reason their cloud hosted version is so painfully slow.')
