Item(by='justin66', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604024110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24937793, text='&gt; When my wife (46) and I found out that she was terminally ill, I promised her that I&#x27;d never let her end up in a Nursing&#x2F;Hospice home. She&#x27;ll get care at home. When the time comes, she&#x27;ll die at home, too.<p>Plenty of spouses make a rather different promise, that they&#x27;ll go away to receive professional care rather than have their spouse take care of them 24&#x2F;7, which can be incredibly punishing work, and undignified for everyone concerned, depending on the specifics. Whatever works for you.')
