It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you&#x27;re talking about pedestrians, cars or bikes, the ability to accurately anticipate other parties moves is what makes for safety.<p>College campuses suck so bad for safety because you have people from tons of different regions with different etiquette and standards, in a new environment and nobody can predict what anybody else is about to do.  Add in the drunks and it&#x27;s amazing they&#x27;re as safe as they are.')
