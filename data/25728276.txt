Is 20ish years vs 30ish years a relevant distinction when the far newer raspberry pi serves to reify the educational goals and funding that the Archimedes was underwritten to do. Unless you are saying the pipeline for educating tomorrows computer engineers should start with M1 macs instead of raspberry pi, it seems we are in violent agreement. There is a typo where I wrote &quot;to tech&quot; instead of &quot;to teach,&quot; perhaps that added confusion.')
