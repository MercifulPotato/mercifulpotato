Half the participants got the vaccine, the rest placebo, before going about their usual lives. Now, a few months later, 95 cases have been confirmed across both groups. Of these, 90 had received the placebo and only 5 the vaccine. If the vaccine didn&#x27;t work at all, the split would be roughly 50&#x2F;50. A somewhat effective vaccine might result in a 70&#x2F;30 split, and so on.')
