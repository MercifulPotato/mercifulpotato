MCAS is primarily concerned with making the forces one needs to apply on the stick at high angles of attack comparable to earlier generations of 737.<p>An interesting question is going to be as to what happens elsewhere in the world; I&#x27;d be intrigued to see if Boeing ends up certifying the 737 MAX with MCAS as an optional feature with additional difference training required, as some things mentioned suggest that it&#x27;s not implausible that this will happen.')
