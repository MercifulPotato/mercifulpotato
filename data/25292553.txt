Item(by='trhway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607020190, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25292155, text='bank may not open an account for the driver, and why push the drivers to the bank if you can provide kind of substitute of those services thus expanding your business in such a great way.<p>&gt;Stripe Treasury would let the rideshare platform give their drivers an embedded money management account. That would allow indefinitely holding money, and would allow them to use e.g. bill pay for car payments, similar to the way that many HNers probably pay their own car payments today.<p>It sounds like what Stripe is doing is providing a quasi-bank account, kind of retail frontend emulating limited banking services and backend-ed by GS and the likes as Stripe doesn&#x27;t seems to have a license themselves (&quot;commoditize your complement&quot; comes to mind). Though it doesn&#x27;t sound like a service for the driver, it only looks like it. It is the service for the platform. Interesting  who really owns the &quot;embedded&quot; account&#x2F;money - platform or the driver. If the driver then it looks more like bank, if the platform - interesting can of worms, like you employer providing an imitation of a real account for you and holding money in your name. I.e. it seems that the point here is to find a way to keep money in the system (the platform keeping drivers&#x27; money in Stripe - i.e. &quot;That would allow indefinitely holding money&quot; seems to be the key here) instead of just merely piping the money.')
