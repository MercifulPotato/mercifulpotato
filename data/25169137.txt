Nobody looks at those designs with approval and admiration.<p>Well, at least that&#x27;s an insight. I wasn&#x27;t sure that anyone Japanese does think it&#x27;s ugly because, as the article points out at the very beginning, it&#x27;s in contrast to other parts of the culture that are deemed part of the design world.<p>Other than that though, I&#x27;m not sure what your point is?<p>&gt; They keep repeating their Japanese people propaganda, but you don’t have to believe it<p>Strangely enough, I have no inclination to believe it. I&#x27;m more worried about the insidious racism and xenophobia that it breeds in those who do believe it, which seems to find enough expression in the general population that there&#x27;s an endless stream of anecdotes shared among foreigners here.<p>&gt; my foster family felt very strongly about America being the best in everything, and they made sure I heard it all, but in the end, I never really believed what they said. It sounded too similar to what my family said back home.<p>Okay, it&#x27;s just bad luck and foreigners are being mean by bringing up fax machines. Convenient how that argument insulates the culture from criticism and implies that nothing should change, which is a view that over-patriotic people would probably agree with.')
