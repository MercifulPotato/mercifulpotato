If the brain is a somewhat general purpose computer that&#x27;s been really slowly optimised by evolution, the alternative approach to ours is akin to* scheduling hundreds of threads on a small number of hardware threads. Doable? Sure. Ideal? Doesn&#x27;t feel like it to me.<p>I&#x27;ve tried allowing myself to just continuously spawn tabs and it makes me uncomfortable much like it does to see a Windows desktop used as a dumping ground for whatever a person happens to want to save on their machine. Fortunately I almost never see the latter these days, and I&#x27;ll choose to believe people don&#x27;t do that anymore without verifying that assumption...<p>*this is really hand-wavy, please don&#x27;t shoot.')
