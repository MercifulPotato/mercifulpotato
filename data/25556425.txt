Brain state could be defined as locations and forms of all proteins, ions, and other compounds. Next brain state is entirely dependant on the previous state as you take infinitesimally small steps forward through time. Signals flow through our neuronal networks along pathways dependant on brain state, although signals when understood as action potentials are also part of the overall brain state.')
