Item(by='leptons', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606070938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25178961, text='&gt;Instead of downvoting the parent (who is asking a legitimate question) or getting snarky, maybe the commenters can actually explain how such a donation makes a significant difference to an industry that operates with much larger numbers.<p>Downvotes with no explanation is all too typical on HN, just like it is on other platforms. Seems like having to comment should be required before downvoting, if only to help the commenter understand why their comment was bad and to give some justification for the downvote. If the justification for downvoting is bad, then the downvoter also deserves a downvote, and not the no-repercussion downvoting system we have now.')
