Almost all of the issues listed in the article annoy me (particularly Bluetooth...)<p>Problems with the hardware:\n - When I use any of the USB-C ports on the <i>left</i> to charge it, performance tanks... why? because for some reason it overheats when you do this and the CPU gets throttled.<p>- When I use a high-speed USB-C device (USB 3.1, Displayport, etc) in the ports on the left, the WiFi stops working. This always seems to get blamed on cheap cables, but this answer does not satisfy me.<p>- The TouchBar is awful in many ways, but the most fundemental failure is that it regularly doesn&#x27;t detect key presses! I tap a key, I can see the &quot;highlight&quot; effect, but nothing happens.<p>My gripes with macOS:<p>- Performance when using an external monitor is pretty poor. When I have my Dell U2720Q connected, WindowServer starts using more CPU and the interface gets noticably sluggish.<p>- With the macbook having &quot;the fastest SSD on a laptop&quot; and APFS being &quot;designed for SSDs&quot;, I expect some decent performance when dealing with disk IO. But particularly Archive utility is always very slow to extract files, and Finder always has a (small, but annoying) delay when listing folder contents.<p>- Updates take ages and are MASSIVE. \n - The XCode 12 update, which I had to rush to download after apple released iOS 14 with no warning, was 11GB and took ages to download, and ages to extract and install.\n - macOS minor updates also have large downloads and take between 30-60 minutes to install')
