Mostly from businesses upgrading. Then we would wipe them, fix anything that needed fixing (always with repaired&#x2F;recycled parts), and sell them.<p>Not the most reliable machines for the end users, but super cheap!<p>It was kind of interesting, we would use RAM that had been sent back through a solder reflow oven to fix bad solder joints, figure out ways to repair dented and broken machines, etc.<p>I hated the job since it was super monotonous, but it paid.')
