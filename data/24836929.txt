Firm banks the profit from the real estate deal, then resells the business that&#x27;s now saddled with way more debt than it ever had in the form of leases back to the CEO they bought it from to begin with for peanuts.  It&#x27;s really the fleecing of America.  Sure someone made a ton of money but now the once &quot;community&quot; hospitals are left in horrible shape.')
