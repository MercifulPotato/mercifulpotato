Did you know for the original SARS, natural immunity lasts ~3yrs? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2851497&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2851497&#x2F;</a><p>Makes all you&#x27;re saying have even less sense.<p>&gt; They didn’t create a successful vaccine in under a week from scratch without a lot of knowledge of closely related diseases. It’s that same knowledge which is behind the dosing schedule, and why it was tested like that.<p>Was there a SARS vaccine? What same knowledge would give the current dosing schedule then? Why does it trump the new knowledge gained from an actual RCT of the vaccines?<p>&gt; With local herd immunity things go back to normal even if the rest of the world is dealing with the disease.<p>Huh? So then the US doesn&#x27;t need the global herd immunity like I was suggesting?<p>&gt; PS: The demographics of the developing world even support a staggered approach. First a focus on vaccinations for the elderly and medical workers globally then local herd immunity based on population demographics. Local herd immunity protects those who the vaccine can’t, but evenly spreading out vaccinations to the younger population accomplishes little.<p>Okay, how is this relevant to whether or not there should be a longer time between initial dose and booster? It&#x27;s totally irrelevant.')
