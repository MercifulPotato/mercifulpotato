Here&#x27;s a YouTube video of a presentation&#x2F;lecture we made at the B.U Graphics Lab then, with one of our first rendered fractal animations at the 2:30 mark. I remember working on this. We had AED graphics terminals (able to display 256 colors!) connected to an IBM 3090 mainframe. With special priority, our processes calculating a fractal would <i>only require a few minutes per frame at 256x256 resolution.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6QIhaDvTHXk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6QIhaDvTHXk</a><p>I fucked up once, trying to create a 256x256x256 fractal volume. How we were calculating them then was not optimized, and the hardware then is a fraction of the phone you own, and that hardware then was shared across the entire university... After my <i>priority process</i> calculating that 3D fractal volume was killed, because it ground the entire University Computing Center to a halt, the post mortem calculated how long the process would have required: 36 years. It would not be done yet if left running. Oops.')
