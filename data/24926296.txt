Last time I checked (shamefully, probably 2 or 3 years ago), LLVM still heavily prefer in-tree projects (creating a sub-directory and CMakeList.txt file) for source-code level distribution. If I can `deps = [&quot;@llvm-project&#x2F;&#x2F;:xxx&quot;]` to start write new passes for llvm bitcode, it would be very exciting.')
