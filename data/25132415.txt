Kilt, caftan,dhoti-kurta, pheran, kimono, etc.<p>Also missing: hats! Where are all the hats? And belts?? You can&#x27;t wear a random belt with any old pants and shoes. And watch???<p>From a fashion perspective I would also put a big yellow warning sign over the cargo pants&#x2F;shorts. Unless you&#x27;re a carpenter, a photographer, or some other working person who needs to carry more than a wallet and a phone, no men should be wearing those.<p>From a sample selection of jeans and polo it recommended to me an orange polo shirt, a burgundy hooded down jacket, dark denim jeans, and yellow velcro sneakers. So probably there&#x27;s some bugs to work out still. :)')
