If the tools can compile&#x2F;target a given CPU and operate, devs largely won&#x27;t care.  Some will, most won&#x27;t.<p>I don&#x27;t think that MS and Amazon will stray too far from generally supported 64-bit arm instructions as a base.  Maybe hardware optimizations that will work better in some workloads, but the baseline will likely work.  This is only because of the diverse languages and tools that they need to support.<p>I think it&#x27;s more about shoring up options, reducing costs and optimizing data center layouts.  When targeting cloud, many apps are already scaling horizontally.  So you don&#x27;t need to perform like an M1 for general use as long as you can scale horizontally enough at a competitive price point, you can get a very long way without a ton of custom extension.')
