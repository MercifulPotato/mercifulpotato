Item(by='manyxcxi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607919869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25413339, text='Yeah but CAN bus is all about the various electronic modules talking together. The parking brake assembly has a switch on it to detect if the pedal is depressed, IE the parking brake is applied. I could understand not detailing those too much, because even the knowledge won’t help you when your “entertainment module” AKA radio is VIN locked and you HAVE to go to the dealership to deal with it.<p>There was no mention of the parking brake, the cables, or the fact that the parking brake is tied to the rear brakes in the entire manual.<p>It was honestly the first time I’ve ever been disappointed with a manual. Then again, all my old books prior to ‘01 are a Chilton which are IMO more technical and precise. Of 8 books, only two are Hayne’s. And Hayne’s bought Chilton some time ago, so I’d be interested if Chilton is more like Hayne’s these days.')
