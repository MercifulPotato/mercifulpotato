I mean, if you work as a cashier in a supermarket, you cannot tell your boss that somehow the money in the cash register got lost or that it was taken away by an armed robber which is not visible on any security video picture.<p>The counter-measure would be to put full regular taxes on profits on any kind of proclaimed ransom payment.')
