Some mention its CoW architecture, system design, too many features and not limiting storage to 90% and so increasing complexity. Others mention usual kernel issues.<p>Others mention that they had no issues to begin with and that its mixed reputation is unwarranted. I&#x27;m not clear who is right, but they are data points.<p>Thank you for your input in cautioning of rewrites to avoid needless work, I appreciate it.')
