We’ve had some of the highest effective tax rates on capital in the world for a while, and the Trump tax cuts didn’t help that much.<p>IMHO, that&#x27;s mistaking a boogeyman for a cause.  The real cause here is any policy that allows important productive capability to be moved away in search of short&#x2F;medium term profit increases.  The idea that you&#x27;d replace those jobs with higher-paying fluff was just a little sugar to make the poison taste better.<p>Also, I can&#x27;t remember exactly where I read it, but some well-known successful businessman candidly said that lower taxes actually make it less likely for him to invest profits back into his business.')
