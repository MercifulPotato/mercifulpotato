It would be like a road collision: you&#x27;d rather have two small cars collide than a car and a semi-truck, assuming the same speeds. The truck has more kinetic energy to send fragments of the car flying everywhere.<p>Clearly you&#x27;d rather a collision between two 1kg satellites than two 1000kg ones - where does this logic break down as we make one or both sats bigger?')
