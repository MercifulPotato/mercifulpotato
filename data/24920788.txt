The file format is practically documented by reading this code. The function has a single obvious purpose.<p>The function length and nesting is more a result of the file format itself. Seems like a waste of time breaking this function up. It would serve no other purpose than delaying the ship date and making this function less readable, a function that may likely never need to be visited again.')
