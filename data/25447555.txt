I don&#x27;t like this attitude from the government that people can&#x27;t be trusted to be responsible adults. Same as when Fauci lied about masks to save them for healthcare workers. Let people have anonymous tests if they want, and make sure there&#x27;s financial and community support for them if they do test positive, but they don&#x27;t need to phone home.<p>I&#x27;m probably visiting family for Christmas. I&#x27;m being cautious in the weeks leading up to it, but am I getting a test? No, and only because they&#x27;re too hard to get. I&#x27;m not sitting in a drive-thru line for an hour for one, not even going out of my way for one. The at-home version is what I want, but I&#x27;d like to think I can be trusted to do the right thing with the results.')
