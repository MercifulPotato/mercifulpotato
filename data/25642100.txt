This was once a major innovation.<p>CDK by AWS ups the level of abstraction, allowing for one to create object oriented abstractions over their complete software infrastructure. This, in the next five years, will completely change software development. We have never seen this level of abstraction, with the whole power of the AWS stack at the finger tips of the developer. How can a team justify not being on AWS?<p>CDK is to cloudformation as c++ is to assembly.<p>Templates of complete software stacks, with all devops built in, will be created and will completely automate dev ops. Whole websites can be spun up in minutes, pieces of them mixed and match with open source infrastructure templates pulled in.<p>Imagine a spring package where your ORM already has an aws database baked in, with the automated switching between dev and prod, profiling, etc. Right out of the box. Just a random example, but the automation here is massive<p>Why am I not reading more about this?')
