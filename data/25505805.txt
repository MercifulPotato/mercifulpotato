Why not assume it&#x27;s good? I mean, I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence for either outcome and the stress and worry about eating them is probably worse for our health than the microplastics themselves.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m not sure why downvoting this comment helps. I&#x27;m not saying microplastics are good or bad for human health, just that we get scary articles all the time telling us how they are everywhere, but no one saying anything yet about their harm (or harmlessness).')
