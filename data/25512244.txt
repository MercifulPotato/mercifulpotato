Nevertheless, I generally recommend it as default for most pet owners, as it goes along with their expectations of what their pet&#x27;s life will be like.  People who elected to leave their dogs intact are often shocked by something down the line.<p>1. Pyometra.  Dogs do not have menopause, but they may stop cycling.  When they do they can develop a uterine infection that can become life threatening in hours.<p>2. Perineal hernias.  Unneutered, aging dogs are at risk for pelvic floor weakness that results in specialty surgery (and neutering), costing thousands of dollars.<p>3. Hit by car.  Unneutered pets are much more likely to escape randomly and get hit by cars.  Even pets that normally do not run away from their owners.<p>4. Mammary tumor.  Unspayed or late-spayed females are at significantly more risk than those spayed at 6 months.<p>5. Pregnancy.  Shocked pikachu face when the unspayed chihuahua actually did get knocked up by their friend&#x27;s unneutered chow.<p>6. Bleeding.  All bitches bleed during proestrus.<p>7. Behavior.  The dog-park behavior people like in their pets is the behavior of neutered dogs.  Unneutered dogs are much more likely to attempt to dominate the other dogs and get into fights.<p>That said, it&#x27;s a trade off.  Unneutered males definitely have a different growth pattern and develop a stockier build.  They also seem to have significantly fewer issues with the cranial cruciate ligament in the stifle (knee).  There are some other, more hand-wavey associations of cancer in golden retrievers related to neutering, but it&#x27;s hard to tell if that&#x27;s just an artifact of the data as it&#x27;s more likely unneutered dogs appear at teaching hospitals for injuries (hit by car, fights) rather than for cancer.<p>I would love to just recommend people be responsible adults.  I wish that the US could be like Norway, where people don&#x27;t seem to abandon their unneutered animals, and they don&#x27;t seem to have problems with their bad behavior.')
