Most murderers are psychopathic&#x2F;sociopathic and predisposed to more serious crimes. That said...<p>There is a recent shift of police and social resources away from &quot;crime as usual&quot; toward the handling of social unrest and crowds&#x2F;mobs. Most departments try to anticipate such shifts, which strongly affect the size and allocation of  manpower within the police department. A small police department can find itself unable to investigate serious crimes in times of social unrest. Anyone who is intelligent and who wants to commit a premeditated crime knows this and could be expected to take advantage of it.')
