It did also work.<p>And now its being used by police to crack down on specific groups and individuals that the government doesn&#x27;t particularly like, even after that same government assured the Vietnamese people that this data wouldn&#x27;t be used in such a way.<p>&gt; The US instead attempted to implement &quot;proven measures&quot; that &quot;relied on the public . . . to adhere to them.&quot; This also did not work, for the reason technosolutionists said it wouldn&#x27;t: the public didn&#x27;t adhere to them.<p>It didn&#x27;t work because America is advanced freedom. Not freedom in the sense of, &quot;You&#x27;re free to eat sushi or have a burger instead,&quot; but freedom in the sense of, &quot;You&#x27;re free to make a cornucopia of bad choices... but you&#x27;re going to be free to suffer from them too.&quot;<p>The best quote I&#x27;ve ever heard in regards to this: &quot;The true price of freedom is having to endure what other people do with it.&quot;')
