If my 15 year old is still dumping milk on the floor and laughing surely the &quot;Model Graciousness&quot; phase has ended.<p>Also not covered is what makes &quot;a spoiled brat&quot;. In my experience, both as a child and adult, it seems the &quot;spoiled brats&quot; are the children that have little to no boundaries and are allowed to do whatever they want even if there parents are present, and display helpful properties.<p>I considered my self a pretty forgiving parent, but in my opinion a parent who is not in control of their children at least to a degree where they can be pleasant to strangers in public(what if they dump milk on a stranger in public and laugh?), is not a good parent and their children struggle from a lack of structure.')
