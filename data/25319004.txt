Item(by='bachmeier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607207128, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25317554, text='&gt; we need a statically typed contender to R, Python and Julia.<p>I&#x27;m not sure we really need a &quot;contender&quot;. We need a complement. I personally use D. I love the language, I can compile my functions into a static library, and I can have R load them the same as it loads a library of C functions. It&#x27;s worked well for me for years. Should work for plenty of languages, whether that&#x27;s Rust, Nim, or whatever.<p>There are at least two reasons I&#x27;ve moved away from the idea of a replacement language:<p>- It&#x27;s pretty easy to do if you already have experience with a compiled language. The benefit of a replacement language is small.<p>- You can move to the new language slowly, to the degree that you want, without giving up or rewriting any already working code. Others can easily use your code without having to move to that language.')
