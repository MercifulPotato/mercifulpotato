I would agree with you if you said Gab.<p>This may surprise you but the vast vast majority people are joking about the likes of the lizard people. It is a bit of fun because of how ridiculous the idea is.<p>&gt; Let these people go there and convince each other of their fringe conspiracy theories. Freedom of association and all that. If they will stop polluting normal places with their crackpottery we&#x27;re all better off.<p>From &quot;Anatomy of the State&quot; by Murray Rothbard pages 27 and 28:<p>&gt; It is also important for the State to inculcate in its subjects an aversion to any “conspiracy theory of history;” for a search for “conspiracies” means a search for motives and an attribution of responsibility for historical misdeeds. If, however, any tyranny imposed by the State, or venality, or aggressive war, was caused not by the State rulers but by  mysterious and arcane  “social  forces,” or by the imperfect state of the world or, if in some way, everyone was responsible (“We Are All Murderers,” proclaims one slogan), then there is no point to the people becoming indignant or rising up against such misdeeds. Furthermore, an attack on “conspiracy theories” means that the subjects  will become more gullible in believing the “general welfare” reasons that are always put forth by the State for engaging in any of its des-potic actions. A “conspiracy theory” can unsettle the system by causing the public to doubt the State’s ideological propaganda.<p>When large news organisations that are owned by the rich or the state are telling you that they need to &quot;stop mis-information and conspiracy theories&quot; on platforms where anyone can post anything that means some of those theories might not be as soo fringe as you like to make out.')
