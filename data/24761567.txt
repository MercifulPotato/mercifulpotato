Crazy build times on large applications can be alleviated if your approach is to build logic in isolation, then do final testing and fitting in the destination.<p>It’s hard to do this when surrounding code doesn’t accommodate the approach, but it’s great way to design an application if you have the choice. I really love sandboxing features before moving them into the application. Everything from design to testing can be so much faster and fun without the distractions of the build system and the rest of the application.')
