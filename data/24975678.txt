My answer is that programming and effective engineering is a team sport. Not asking for input and feedback is counter-intuitive for me and frankly is a form of machismo that I would rather avoid. I&#x27;m not an effective engineer because I can ship code 24 &#x2F; 7, I&#x27;m an effective engineer because I can transfer and translate business requirements into code and effectively communicate the semantics of the code to others contextualized with the business requirements that lead to the creation of the code.')
