Item(by='borepop', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608390230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25476484, text='I don&#x27;t love the terminology either, but it&#x27;s like a lot of evolving linguistic culture: it tends to stick in the craw of those of use who grew up using different words, not because it is &quot;wrong&quot; per se but because it is different.  I think the linguistic shift actually does map on to a notably different attitude toward the way cultural products are produced and consumed, as other commenters have noted, as well as the democratization of the resources for creating things like video due to the ubiquity of smartphones.')
