We designed CSS, for example, to have a layouting algorithm that is limited in terms of backtracking (or disallows it) and is terminating.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want my Browser to execute any layouting algorithm somebody sends to me.<p>The web has been successful because it was declarative. And most avenues where imperative solutions were necessary, were later fixed with declarative extensions.<p>Once you&#x27;re at the &quot;just send me assembly&quot;-level, every non-trivial property of the page is undecidable. And the declarative description of a website can be used by different renderers to generate something the user wants to see.<p>Implementing such a proposal based on a turing-complete imperative language would basically mean the end of the open web.')
