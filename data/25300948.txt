These days I&#x27;d probably have a checkmark and a broken checkmark to denote &#x27;checked in&#x27; and &#x27;not checked in&#x27;.  Crucially it would probably need to be two checkmarks when fully checked in, and a single big checkmark in back with a smaller obviously broken one in front to denote an older version exists.')
