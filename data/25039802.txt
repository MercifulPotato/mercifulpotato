I&#x27;m used to being able to manipulate data efficiently via streams&#x2F;sequences and a rock-solid stdlib which just isn&#x27;t possible in Go due to a lack of generics.<p>A close second would be the lack of good performant libraries, which is somewhat due to number 1 and somewhat due to it being a relatively newer language.
