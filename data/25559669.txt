Feel free to disregard these questions because at this point I feel I&#x27;m prying.<p>&gt;&gt; We want to help you finding products and brand that reflect your values. That&#x27;s why we collect a lot of information about a brand, i.e his manufacturing practices, certifications, warranty or repair service.<p>How do you suppose you&#x27;ll match a user to a brand (or to a collection of brands)?<p>&gt;&gt; We are not in a position to assess such data, so we are partnering with different companies and standardisation bodies that assess sustainable production standards.<p>That sounds like a deliciously hard problem to solve.
