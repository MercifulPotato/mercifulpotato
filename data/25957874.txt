The core of Marxism is the idea that capitalism is the most effective method of increasing productive capacity, and that this is fantastic (the first chapter of the Communist Manifesto is fanboy-level praise for capitalism), until it runs out of room to grow into.<p>Whether or not you agree with the analysis, the core problem it posits - that capitalism will grow out of markets to expand into, and that once it does, it will fundamentally change the game - matters.<p>We can necessarily not have growth forever - if not before, eventually we run out of exploitable energy within our light-cone. In practice we&#x27;ll hit limits far sooner that will cause competition to drive down production cost will be far harsher than it needs to be in an environment where you can compensate by expansion.<p>Marx thought that would happen &quot;soon&quot; - when capitalism has spread to the entire world. But it&#x27;s a question when, not if, we hit a ceiling where further demand growth can&#x27;t physically happen, and quite likely we&#x27;ll reach a ceiling long before there where it&#x27;s not happening <i>fast enough</i> to counter competitive pressure. The world population is expected to stabilise and start dropping - at least for a while - possibly as soon as towards the end of this century. What happens to growth then?<p>Whenever we reach a point where capitalism is no longer getting growth by growing into expanding markets, the question becomes whether capitalist competition will drive us to a level of automation that threatens to kill capitalism. Marx believed that would happen by causing crises of &quot;overproduction&quot;, where improved efficiency would cause mass unemployment and by extension kneecap demand by taking away peoples incomes. Alternatively, whether we&#x27;ll be able to as a society reign things in and ensure people share in enough of the improvements in efficiency for capitalism to survive - be it with UBI, or shortening working hours, or other means.<p>Because it&#x27;s easy to forget that one of the &quot;promises&quot; of capitalist competitive pressure is to drive margins towards zero, because a company that can survive with lower margins can out-compete one that can&#x27;t. And ultimately that means driving every cost that can be reduced down, and that means ultimately driving labour costs down as far as they can go...')
