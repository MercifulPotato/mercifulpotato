We are better in the sense that our native resolution will be 25x finer than theirs - Planet SkySats have 50cm native GSD and our satellites will have 10cm native GSD. This is &quot;better&quot; in the sense that we&#x27;re more resolute, but we do sacrifice coverage.<p>As far as cheaper goes, the commercial space industry has made a lot of progress in the past 10 years, and as a result, getting to space has gotten substantially cheaper. This may be slightly oversimplified, but we&#x27;re hoping cheaper costs for us will transfer over to our users.')
