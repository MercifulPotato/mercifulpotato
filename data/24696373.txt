It all depended on the fan interpretation to to make sense. If you are non religious and think about the old testament just as what it was, its easier to understand the contradictions.<p>(1) In Genesis 1 the god creates animals before the man. He creates man and woman and tells them to be fruitful and multiply.<p>(2) In Genesis 2 God creates Adam before animals. Adam and Eve are put into special place called Eden and are not aware of their sexuality until they sin.<p>Judaism is folk religion of the Israelites, not universal religion. Old testament tells the story from the point of Jewish tribes. in it&#x27;s  current form it was created around (538–332 BC). Israelites “God’s chosen people” in the old testament. All the interaction with the god and men is actually about Israelites and God, not the humanity and God.<p>One way to think this is that genesis 2 is the general creation myth, Genesis 2 is the story of how God created two first Jews. Jewish people started to separate religiously from other Canaanites between  1200 and 1000 BCE, so maybe you can put the Adam and Eve myth there.')
