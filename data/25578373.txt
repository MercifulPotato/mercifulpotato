Very few healthy 41-year-olds have succumbed.<p>Judging from the most recent photos I could find (the one in the obit is old) he was overweight but not obese. (Being overweight increases your risk, according to CDC.) He didn&#x27;t appear to be a mask-denier. Plenty of photos of him wearing a mask. (But a cautious person wouldn&#x27;t spend any time socializing indoors, mask or not. I don&#x27;t!)')
