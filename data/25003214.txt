Item(by='throwaway34241', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604618530, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25001509, text='&gt; It&#x27;s complicated and there was miscommunication but it forms part of the pattern.<p>It looks like from that thread that the Go team was never on board with certain technical aspects of how dep was implemented.  Obviously there are trade offs so it&#x27;s hard to determine what answer is &quot;right&quot;, but opposing a design for technical reasons is still pretty different than pure &quot;not invented here syndrome&quot;.<p>The dep author in that thread says part of the reason he did not make a proposal was he was worried &quot;what negative community consequences (wasted work&#x2F;goodwill) a misfire proposal might have.&quot;  But since dep was becoming a de-facto standard, skipping the proposal process was basically doing an end-run against the technical decisions of the Go team (and others in the community not already aboard the dep train).<p>I have to admit I&#x27;m a bit biased here, I use Go and Go modules, followed closely the discussions at the time, and strongly prefer the trade offs made by the (now official) Go package manager over those made by dep.  I can understand how people with different priorities (or who dislike Go in general) might feel differently, but I think it&#x27;s a bit unfair to call rejecting something over real technical trade offs &quot;not invented here&quot; thinking.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s been several different proposals for generics<p>I don&#x27;t know of any?  By formal proposal I think they mean complete specification of how it would work with the existing features, not just the start of an idea, because of course you need that to actually add it to the language.<p>I think few people expected someone external to the Go team would do it, but I think that&#x27;s more because it&#x27;s an enormous amount of work that an expert would have to put in for free.  In the end I believe even the Go team ended up asking for help from academic specialists to work out the details. [1]<p>&gt; The second a core language change actually involves a person external to google or the team drop the concept that that could happen I&#x27;ll withdraw my criticism<p>They&#x27;ve made almost no changes to the language so far so obviously the evidence is still out on the former case, but for the latter I believe Russ Cox&#x27;s check&#x2F;handle proposal [2] and Robert Griesemer&#x27;s try proposal [3] (both core team members) were rejected after community feedback.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2005.11710.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2005.11710.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.googlesource.com&#x2F;proposal&#x2F;+&#x2F;master&#x2F;design&#x2F;go2draft-error-handling-overview.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.googlesource.com&#x2F;proposal&#x2F;+&#x2F;master&#x2F;design&#x2F;go2draf...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.googlesource.com&#x2F;proposal&#x2F;+&#x2F;master&#x2F;design&#x2F;32437-try-builtin.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.googlesource.com&#x2F;proposal&#x2F;+&#x2F;master&#x2F;design&#x2F;32437-t...</a>')
