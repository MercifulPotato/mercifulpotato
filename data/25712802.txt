In other cases it depends on who defends the codec.<p>H.265 is an anti-example, because there patents were pooled for offensive purposes to begin with, while AOM pooled resources for defense. I.e. something like MPEG-LA exists to extort money, not to defend anyone. That&#x27;s also why you got two separate pools there. Patent aggressors don&#x27;t want to share, each of them wants to get all the loot for themselves.')
