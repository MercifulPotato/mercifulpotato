Ultimately housing prices always recovered to their inflation adjusted average, Robert Shiller wrote a lot on this topic. Both from being undervalued and from being overvalued. The only thing that&#x27;s always unclear is the path.<p>Note that this implies two exists from the situation, or a combination: CPI will go much higher or nominal housing prices will go much lower. 1970s saw the first variant, 1930s and late 2000s saw the second variant.<p>Also, if you want to see true insanity compare Chinese big city apartment prices to salaries and CNY interest rates. That is true insanity. No other country comes even close to what&#x27;s going on there (maybe 1980s Japan? I suppose it&#x27;s close). It has a lot to do with chinese people having strong conviction in government&#x27;s support of the market, kinda like the US equity market is now widely believed to be completely supported by whatever means will necessary. Time will tell how much such self-fulfilling illusions last.')
