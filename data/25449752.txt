That wouldn&#x27;t take much more tracking than what they already do. But in this case, you&#x27;d have a lot of people maximizing their time on Facebook in order to increase their payout. Win for them, bigger win for Facebook. Heck, Facebook could even get rid of all their stupid dark patterns, and stop the endless research into more dark patterns, improving their bottom line even more. No need to trick people into engaging if they are voluntarily engaging for a small sum.<p>I still don&#x27;t think the ROI for the user is there. \nThe average FB user spends about 35 min per day, or 210hrs&#x2F;year on the platform. Assuming 10% revenue sharing, that is $0.10&#x2F;hour. \nIf the average user were to double their time on the platform, they would make an extra $20&#x2F;year.<p>This is a laughable incentive for most people, let alone your most valuable add targets (people with disposable income).')
