I&#x27;ve had BT headphones before my Airpods, and I really kinda hated them all. They were just clunky and awkward to use. Airpods changed my expectation around that kind of listening.<p>The competition for a $549 Apple over-ear ANC headphone is, realistically, $300-$400 over-ear ANC headphones from everyone else. Because user experience and usability matter a LOT; I&#x27;d definitely pay a premium to avoid all the goofy crap that goes with &quot;regular&quot; Bluetooth.')
