I just don&#x27;t know how much stronger. I guess that was the sort of thing I was wondering-out-loud about) and also saying some thoughts that that brought to my mind.<p>But yes, &quot;it working at any time if you wait 5 years&quot; would be relevant.  \nI guess I was trying to think about, &quot;what would the chances be of that happening to have been the case purely by chance?&quot;.
