People can check-in every week, and their managers can give them positive&#x2F;constructive feedback on their performance. For a fun aspect, we have also added a banter feature.<p>Last thing, we saw many companies needed a &#x27;Review&#x27; feature so we&#x27;ve baked it into the tool. The plus thing is that this tool has made our and our clients&#x27; reviews easy since the review forms are being populated from the data people submit on this tool.<p>Similar products in case someone&#x27;s interested in them: 15five, Lattice, PeakOn, CultureAmp.<p>Help your teams grow in this time of distress!<p>p.s. it is free for the first 6 months!')
