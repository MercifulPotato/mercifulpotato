That&#x27;s how One Day at a Time got saved, PopTV which is owned by CBS, so technically network, managed to buy the rights. However they aren&#x27;t allowed to add it to CBS All Access like they do other Pop shows. Doesn&#x27;t help that the Netflix demographic, _especially_ for shows with large fandoms, don&#x27;t generally use network TV.')
