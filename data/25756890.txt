No interest in whether Google wants to get rid of a high-profile AI ethicist, because hey, it&#x27;s a private company. No interest in Facebook censoring breastfeeding groups because OMG NIPPLE. No interest in, as you say, making it impossible for legal sex work to operate. No complaints that Apple forbid R18 material in the app store years ago because Steve Jobs didn&#x27;t like it.<p>Now, suddenly, it&#x27;s a great big issue because a bunch of neo-Nazis got run out of town? Not a great look, eh.')
