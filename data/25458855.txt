Item(by='jryans', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608231071, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25458080, text='Thanks for mentioning all these great articles and efforts! :) I hope more people will explore everything you&#x27;ve listed here. As you say, we need to go even further and more radical than e.g. GNU to address the tar pit we find ourselves in today, and so the more we can get people imagining what the future could be like, the better.<p>&gt; (Side note: former Mozillian here, and there&#x27;s no real excuse for why the Firefox contribution process itself hasn&#x27;t worked like this for the last 10 years except for Mozilla&#x27;s infamously poor competence at almost all things re project management.)<p>As a former Mozillian myself, I agree it&#x27;s quite sad that so many paths that would have eased contribution and supported a universe of surrounding projects were sacrificed on the altar of Firefox. The management team at Mozilla doesn&#x27;t seem to understand the huge impact the organisation could have had by supporting a whole ecosystem and way of building &#x2F; thinking about software.<p>&gt; The Malleable Systems Collective &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;malleable.systems&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;malleable.systems&#x2F;</a>&gt; was introduced this past spring, but seems to have fizzled since then, possibly due to COVID-related dampening effects.<p>(With my Malleable Systems Collective organiser hat on...) I think it&#x27;s been a difficult year for most people, and it has been harder than I hoped to find time for this effort in 2020. Actually though, the website is a bit deceptive: while the blog has been pretty quiet, the Matrix room (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.to&#x2F;#&#x2F;#malleable-systems:matrix.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.to&#x2F;#&#x2F;#malleable-systems:matrix.org</a>) has an active community regularly trading ideas in this space.<p>I&#x27;m hoping to have some more time and energy in 2021 for both experiments and writing that add to both the collective and the more general conversation that you are highlighting here.')
