No history&#x2F;undo within a note - I&#x27;ve accidentally deleted parts of notes numerous times\n2. Limit on size of each note (I don&#x27;t hit this often, but it&#x27;s annoying when I do) \n3. Lists only support 2 levels\n4. No access to the underlying data\n5. General anxiety about Google discontinuing it<p>I came across GitJournal and have been using it for a grand total of 24h, but I&#x27;m really happy with it so far!<p>As the name suggests, it syncs your notes to Git, and I have it syncing to a private GitHub repo from the Android app. Setup was a doddle.<p>It supports markdown, lists and journal-style notes, with attachments and images. I&#x27;d like the ability to change to a monospace font though (Keep doesn&#x27;t have that either, mind).<p>The only 2 notable things Keep has in it&#x27;s favour are the ability to add collaborators, and notifications. My wife isn&#x27;t going to install GitJournal though, so I&#x27;m happy to keep using Keep for shopping lists and the odd thing I want to collaboratively edit with her.<p>Everything is OSS, but the official build in the Play Store hides some features behind a paywall - you are free to build the app yourself if you really want. It&#x27;s a very interesting monetisation model that I think works well for Android and iOS apps. Pretty sure I&#x27;ll end up paying for the extra features, as I&#x27;ll get plenty value out of it.<p>Interested to hear if other HN&#x27;rs have tried this, or similar note-taking apps?')
