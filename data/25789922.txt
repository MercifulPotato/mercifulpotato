I mean, it is a technology that lets you control what you want to share. However, engaging in business with a partner who decides to change the rules, is something I see a lot more critical.<p>So maybe the lesson should sound more like<p>- &#x27;Don&#x27;t use Dropbox for anything you care about&#x27; or<p>- &#x27;Don&#x27;t do business with large corporations for anything you care about&#x27;<p>To clarify, I am not saying it to protect oauth (in its current state I am not a particular fan of it), but to show, that the technology doesn&#x27;t change by itself and that someone decided to change it.
