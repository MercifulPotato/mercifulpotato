They&#x27;re more likely to identify with the main character, and they can follow the logic that makes her think racism is bad.<p><i>The white-saviorness of Atticus can&#x27;t really be denied</i><p>Your bias is showing here, it&#x27;s not cool.. There were plenty of unsavory characters in the book.<p><i>Scouts willingness to fight for justice isn&#x27;t born out of a dislike of racism, but of a need to defend her dad.</i><p>It starts like this, but they also go into the logic of why her dad thinks this way. She&#x27;s a girl who learns from her family like all kids.<p>If there are other, better books to read, then recommend other books. Don&#x27;t ban this one because you don&#x27;t think it goes far enough.')
