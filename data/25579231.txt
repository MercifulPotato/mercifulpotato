People are acting like &quot;cancelling&quot; someone is a new thing, but this is something I saw happen all the time in academia. It just used to be the purview of small cliques of powerful professors who had chokeholds on particular fields. Immunology is particularly bad. Say something bad about professor X&#x27;s proposal? You&#x27;re never getting a grant funded again. Professor Y harassed you when you were a grad student and you&#x27;re upset? Best get out of the field and don&#x27;t make a fuss.<p>What&#x27;s different now other than larger groups with nontraditional forms of power are trying to impose consequences in return?')
