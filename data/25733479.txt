I thought moderators could allow&#x2F;disallow whatever they wanted as long as it doesn&#x27;t violate TOS or is illegal? I have seen the same thing in more left leaning, women&#x27;s rights, or whatever. Am I missing something in your complaint? That said all that the_donald&#x2F;conservative&#x2F;etc is a dumpster fire.')
