So something like the massive surge we saw in Latino Trump voters in Florida and Texas would be difficult to see coming unless you have some reliable way of forecasting which seemingly-unlikely-voters will actually turn out this time around, which is extremely difficult -- people tend to be much more likely to say they&#x27;ll vote than to actually vote, so simply asking them isn&#x27;t reliable.<p>&quot;Shy Trump voters&quot; probably isn&#x27;t the core problem in an unusually high-turnout election. The problem is that there&#x27;s no real way of predicting who pollsters should be interviewing.')
