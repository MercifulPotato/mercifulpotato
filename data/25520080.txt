This is not neutral, and can be very political.<p>However, this is in a different universe than if I offer the grant with strings attached like editorial control on the paper(s), or a veto on publishing.<p>As you note, most failed research doesn&#x27;t get published but vanishingly small amounts of that are due to outside pressure, it&#x27;s mostly more mundane reasons.<p>Research is sponsored by, and done by people, hence it is flawed.  But the best of is places value on the rigor of the research regardless of outcome, and certainly does not attempt to silence results that are not favourable to the sponsors goals.
