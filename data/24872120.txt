Heads of state don&#x27;t get to tell other people how not to mess up. They can&#x27;t pass laws saying they themselves can communicate perfectly or point everyone in the right direction or group the right people together. So they can&#x27;t pass laws telling you how to communicate perfectly or assemble or perceive the world the right way. And that&#x27;s not &quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot; or &quot;won&#x27;t&quot;, they can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s impossible. Might as well plan for the sun rising in the west or water running uphill.<p>Lost in the USA vs China debate are many international companies who are loyal only to themselves and have absolutely no awareness of geopolitical issues.

That&#x27;s what nature does, how it&#x27;s undefeated since the start. If you are afraid of past mistakes or present problems, don&#x27;t worry. The horror capable within future conflicts puts all of that to shame, such as war where we don&#x27;t kill people but keep them alive, forever. Like that head transplant doctor, or what they are doing with genetics.<p>It&#x27;s best not to dwell on such distractions. Nothing good can come from it.')
