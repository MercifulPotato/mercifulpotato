While it is possible to have each developer register for their own account, this is not ideal from a management or efficiency standpoint. For example, if a company wanted no-cost Red Hat Developer Subscriptions to cover 100 developers, each developer would need to individually register and independently create 100 accounts that need to be tracked and maintained. For enterprises that use Red Hat Satellite to manage multiple systems, all 100 accounts would need to be added individually. Accepting the terms and conditions and renewing the subscription annually would need to be done individually and manually for all 100 accounts. Staff turnover in the development team would create additional management challenges with individual accounts. Therefore in terms of lost productivity, managing individual no-cost subscriptions will not be cost-effective for many groups.<p>Many development organizations benefit from having Red Hat Developer Support. Cost effective bundles are available that include support with a pack of 25 Developer Suite subscriptions that can be managed from a single account. Each of these subscriptions is based on systems, rather that users.</i>')
