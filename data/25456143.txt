Both USD and computers are inflating in supply, but computers are inflating faster (in terms of processing power at least)- hence the continuous drop in price. You could argue USD is deflating in comparison to computers, but computers are not deflating in comparison to USD.<p>Edit for a bit more clarity: Inflation &#x2F; Deflation is relative to a &quot;base asset&quot; which is considered unchanged in value. For USD this is normally a standard basket of assets (foreign currencies or a &quot;market basket&quot;).')
