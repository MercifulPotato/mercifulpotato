What a joke. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;reformingislam.org&#x2F;quran-verses-inciting-terrorism&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;reformingislam.org&#x2F;quran-verses-inciting-terrorism&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; 2:193              Fight them until there is no more disbelieving of Islam and until all worship is for Allah alone.<p>&gt; 4:47                Jews and Christians, believe in Islam before we destroy your faces and twist them toward their backs and curse you.<p>Now that&#x27;s actual hate speech right there in the Quran, but that&#x27;s perfectly fine &quot;for the sake of diversity&quot; right ?<p>If you were to censor &quot;muslims are terrorists&quot;... then you would have to censor the Quran itself, which says so many worse things about women, queers, and disbelievers including those of your family. Censoring the Quran would be islamophobic, right ?<p>&gt; 9:23             Do not take your fathers or your brothers as allies if they have preferred not to believe in Islam.<p>That&#x27;s criminalizing freedom of thought, going against the core principles of Universal Human Rights Declaration.<p>Anyway, Quran verses are cited during prayers, and not just the ones that abide by your Kufr standards, FYI.<p>Samuel Paty, a story where &quot;muslims against islamophobia&quot; feed islamic terrorists: drawings of the prophet ARE islamophobic according to them for sure. And don&#x27;t worry about Taqiya BTW.<p>Sorry for the victims of islamophobia, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to what victims of islamic violence have been through, so, guess who I&#x27;m crying for.<p>You want to censor hate speech, this could be respectable if you were to apply it to both sides, and not &quot;just the islamophobic side&quot;.<p>We left our islamic countries for your civilized countries to be free, we have worked hard to integrate and become worthy citizen because we value your culture above theirs, don&#x27;t betray us now!')
