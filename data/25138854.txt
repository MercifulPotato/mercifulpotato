It&#x27;s a functional description, not a slur.<p>I have some similar things which I&#x27;d rather not expand upon, but I don&#x27;t think that gives me the right to be offended at  terms unless they are slurs. As a comparison, people shouldn&#x27;t be offended at any usage of the word &quot;smart&quot;, but they&#x27;re allowed to be offended by the word &quot;nerd&quot;.')
