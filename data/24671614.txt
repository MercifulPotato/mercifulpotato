If you produce bad software, people will not or at least stop buying it.\nYou can dump everything into the open source domain without any restrictions.\nTherefore, commercial code is of better quality.<p>It&#x27;s not that I believe this, I find neither of those convincing. There is great open source software and there is great commercial software. There is a huge amount of bad software on both seids either.<p>Is good open source software better than good proprietary software? Depends on what are the criteria for good, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s something we could state as general as &quot;open source is better.&quot;<p>Going back to the original article:<p>The distinction the article talks about seems to be personal motivation to make the code better. While there might be a shift to be more engaged in a personal project (which is likely) the licensing model of that personal project is fairly irrelevant for this.\nFuther, quite a lot of people are also engaged in their job and care about the product they are working on.<p>Are people that don&#x27;t care about it on their job more or less likely to even start personal projects? To contribute to open source? I don&#x27;t know, maybe there is some data on that.')
