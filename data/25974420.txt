I live on a family farm so I can&#x27;t &quot;move to the city&quot; and I can&#x27;t bring the jobs to me - so I have a long commute for a good wage. It&#x27;s a tradeoff. (&quot;cheap housing&quot; isn&#x27;t an issue - we own the land... but at an &quot;extreme&quot; commuting range)<p>So for me, partial remote is perfect... I get &quot;social interactions&quot; that remote can&#x27;t replace... while losing a large chunk of commute (hours a day).<p>If I wasn&#x27;t &quot;tied to the land&quot;, I&#x27;d move to the job in a heartbeat.')
