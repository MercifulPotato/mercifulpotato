It was really very interesting and I think this research has the potential to make the trade offs between suffering and possible recovery much easier to answer. (This isn&#x27;t to disagree with you, just to express my surprise that, although I agree with you, researchers actually know&#x2F;suspect a lot more than I thought they did.)')
