The second was actually much higher than what Glassdoor said, likely because I was joining a new team on a new project with a good budget.<p>Idk if it&#x27;s being gamed. But if anything, I&#x27;d imagine it would be lower than what they would offer, simply because the data might be from employees that have started long ago and haven&#x27;t gotten raises to match what a new offer would given for salary. As well as dated information (someone added their salary 3 years ago, but has gotten raises and hasn&#x27;t updated their salary on Glassdoor).')
