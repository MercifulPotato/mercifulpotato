Throughout his career, as the Republican Party veered right, and then further right, McConnell moved with it. “It’s always been about power, the political game, and it’s never been about the core values that drive political life,” John Yarmuth, Kentucky’s lone Democratic congressman, told Alec MacGillis, author of the 2014 McConnell biography</i> The Cynic<i>. “There has never been anything that interested him other than winning elections.”</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rollingstone.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;politics-features&#x2F;mitch-mcconnell-man-who-sold-america-880799&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rollingstone.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;politics-features&#x2F;mitc...</a><p>&gt; <i>“Trump is about winning the day, or even the hour. McConnell plays the long game. He’s sensitive to the political realities. His North Star is continuing as Majority Leader—it’s really the only thing for him. He’s patient, sly, and will obfuscate to make less apparent the ways he’s moving toward a goal.” The two men also have different political orientations: “Trump is a populist—he’s not just anti-élitist, he’s anti-institutionalist.” As for McConnell, “no one with a straight face would ever call him a populist—Trump came to drain the swamp, and now he’s working with the biggest swamp creature of them all.”</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;20&#x2F;how-mitch-mcconnell-became-trumps-enabler-in-chief" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;20&#x2F;how-mitch-mcco...</a><p>Remember McConnell (and the GOP) were also all about austerity during Obama&#x27;s terms (when economy could have used economic stimulus).
