Most of that US off-shore money is in New York to avoid currency risks, etc. Then those accounts are used as collateral (if needed. I doubt if anybody says to Apple, &quot;Where&#x27;s your collateral?&quot;) for loans.<p>Also, the biggest money havens in the world are 2 US states, with special privacy laws. All those guys playing games in Panama, etc. were better off just using US state tax shelters.')
