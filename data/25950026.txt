If I like talking face to face in an office, and you prefer talking via zoom from home: either I have to yield to your preference and setup zoom, or you have to yield to mine and come to the office.<p>And that&#x27;s where company&#x2F;team policy and culture will rule. Some companies will be &quot;remote first&quot; and zoom will win - most of the time. Some companies will be &quot;onsite first&quot; and office it will be - most of the time. Both policies are completely OK when understood and agreed upon by everyone. I know that it&#x27;s important for me, personally, to work in a company that will favour the office option. I also know that some other people will prefer the zoom option. The key part I believe is that company should clearly set and communicate their policies and expectations and employees should seek to work in companies that have culture matching their preferred way of working.')
