I do agree that it&#x27;s very important to not get stuck in local maxima. However, I think the author heavily underestimates&#x2F;overestimates the chances of the following:<p>1. The author underestimates the rate of competing ideas coming out of &#x27;learned&#x27; scientists.<p>2. The author overestimates the possibility of an &#x27;internet dilettante&#x27; without good knowledge of prior art coming up with something useful.<p>To me it&#x27;s a bit like me playing chess with a Grandmaster. Sure, I know how the chess pieces move, I know basic tactics and strategy. But I have never studied a chess theory book, never learned any openings. What&#x27;s the chance of me coming up with a chess theory novelty that provides a better model of the game and lets me win the Grandmaster? It&#x27;s not none. But due to my lack of knowledge of prior art the chance is pretty thin.')
