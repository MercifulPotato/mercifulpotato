Companies are mostly trying to move in one direction and having lots of independent people off doing their own thing runs counter to that. Other similar structures follow this pattern as well. Part of it is cultural norms developing but part of it is recognizing that a company is very much exerting pressure on the people that work within it. Which is probably why founders find it easier to talk to other founders as they both have the luxury of the freedom to think independently within this context as they are steering the company itself.<p>You see this with attempts at internal startups or R&amp;D teams where independence is encouraged but it&#x27;s impossible or hard to spin anything out of them because you end up bumping back into the company pressures trying to do so. You&#x27;re basically asked to &quot;go do something amazing&quot; ... &quot;but not like that!&quot;<p>Personally I love small companies primarily for the autonomy it provides and as a designer really value applying  myself to different problems. So I get the joy of independence but I think I&#x27;m fairly conventional on other topics.')
