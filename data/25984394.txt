Chanos founded Kynikos in 1985. Kynikos has a short-only fund, a long-short fund and a 190% long&#x2F;90% short fund (i.e. a +100% net long fund).<p>This FT alphaville interview with Chanos: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;da70b2f9-3a0b-4258-9996-86dfd68029ed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;da70b2f9-3a0b-4258-9996-86dfd6802...</a> contains a few interesting morsels of information -- including some touching on risk management &amp; the risks that short sellers are exposed to in periods of market instability where there is a risk that counterparties might go bankrupt, e.g. during the GFC.<p>* &quot;I&#x27;ve seen far more stocks go to zero than to infinity&quot;<p>* &quot;short selling is a portfolio [...] no one position will ever be more than 3 or 4% of the portfolio&quot;<p>* &quot;if you go into one of our partnerships, as a limited partner, you can only lose what you put in&quot;<p>* &quot;the short side has a lot of asymmetries: [...] if a position goes for you, it becomes smaller, unlike on the long side&quot;<p>* &quot;if you gave me $100 and I just had a one stock portfolio on the short side, you wouldn&#x27;t have to give me any more money and if I shorted Enron $100 and continued to short it on the way down, I could make more than 100%. I&#x27;ll let you think that through&quot;')
