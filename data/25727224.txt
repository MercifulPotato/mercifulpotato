So over the course of a month or more I may a long running series back to back,  several of them that ran in the early 00&#x27;s till after Trumps election you can see a clear political messaging shift in them, from an attempt to being &quot;neutral&quot; in their politics to a clear hard left turn.<p>Further Print News media is clearly Left bias as well probably 70% &#x2F; 30% left to right positioning<p>Your lone example of Cable TV news is a weak argument, and if you talk to many conservatives you will find there is a large contingent of people that believe that since Roger Ailes passed Fox News has also taken a left turn...<p>I think alot of your position is based on the fact that many of these places are &quot;not as far left&quot; as you, or other organizations, but this does not make them &quot;right&quot; either.<p>CNN is not as far left as MSNBC, but CNN is not right either.<p>Barrack Obama is not as far left as AOC but that does not make Obama a Republican')
