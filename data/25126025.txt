I&#x27;m an advocate for HTTPS-everywhere, but I think we&#x27;re quickly moving past the point of usefulness for most people.<p>On a personal level, as a developer, I actually find the ban on mixed connections on a web page much more frustrating. It&#x27;s easy for me to get a cert for nginx for my side project. It&#x27;s another thing entirely to figure out how to give my application server access to the certs in the &quot;right&quot; way so that the application can terminate wss:&#x2F;&#x2F; connections. I have to figure it out, of course, because firefox will refuse to connect a ws:&#x2F;&#x2F; connection on a https page.')
