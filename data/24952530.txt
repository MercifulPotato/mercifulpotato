I find myself biting my lip hard at this topic because most folks have never heard of them and demand some kind of research backing the wild anecdotes surrounding them. They’re both incredibly potent and can treat a wide range of maladies, but are very demanding ordeals to actually go through. I’ve come to terms with not giving advice, and tell myself that he&#x2F;she must want to be healed and they will ask if&#x2F;when they want it. Often I simply want to bring them up, just to raise awareness, but even that very difficult considering just how “out there” they are (usually getting dismissed or raised eyebrows). Any suggestions for how to talk about these unconventional things without offending sensibilities?')
