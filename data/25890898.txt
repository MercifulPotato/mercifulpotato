Is it even defined by this implementation?<p>Compare to eg. C or C++.<p>Diversity, and interoperability is important as it is a significant contributor to longevity.<p>I do like that you&#x27;ve used the term &quot;API&quot; as I think that sums it up. To think of &quot;Python&quot; not as a language agreed by multiple implementors, the behaviour here is that of a &quot;library&quot; with an &quot;API&quot;.')
