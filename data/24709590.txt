In fact, it is irrelevant how many units of currency you earn, as long as your units of currency cover your basic needs plus a bit.<p>Sixty units of currency are a lot of money when rent costs you ten and bread costs you one.<p>In Bulgaria, most things are half the price. Food and rent are damn cheap for someone who earns money in euros.<p>They earn half as many units of currency compared to people where I live. That&#x27;s an amount of currency with which I could never live where I live now, but <i>there</i> it would last.')
