Much worse now with the library and bookstore either being greatly gentrified or closed for good.<p>Parents supporting a child hobby because they understand its potential value cant be overstated. Being poor just doesnt give any latent interest a chance to develop. That&#x27;s the key. NGOs try to bridge this gap but without the kids parents&#x2F;siblings&#x2F;community understanding the value of these things, its an upward slippery slope with far more risk.')
