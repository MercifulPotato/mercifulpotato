Item(by='FastQ', descendants=None, kids=[25372939, 25373093], score=None, time=1607602803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25372336, text='I&#x27;m just a student but I&#x27;ve spent about 10 hours trying to figure out why Azure has been charging me &gt;$5&#x2F;day for their &quot;basic&quot; database @5DTUs, 2gb max storage. This morning I was so exasperated I sent a letter threatening to report them for fraud if nobody could tell me why I was being charged 30x the listed rate, which so far no one has. This is an extremely cathartic post to see that I&#x27;m not alone, thanks for sharing.')
