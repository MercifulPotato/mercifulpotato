Hopefully with the extra airflow accounted for in the console design and the massive fan, it should mean that it doesn&#x27;t need to run full bore all the time and can help keep it quiet.<p>I have an original PS4 (bought it at launch, haven&#x27;t needed to replace it) and that thing runs fans at full tilt with any modern PS4 game and it gets loud enough to really ruin the experience.<p>My PC also makes a lot of fan noise, but since I play with a headset at the PC, I don&#x27;t hear it. But with the PS4, I am playing in the living room with speakers, so it matters a lot more.')
