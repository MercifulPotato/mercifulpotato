What&#x27;s an example of the Elite behaviors&#x2F;language? How would I know Powertalk when I see it? What would an Elite do&#x2F;have to show their true status?<p>I definitely accept that I&#x27;m not an elite. I am &quot;wealthy&quot; in a strictly relative financial sense but I have no political power&#x2F;connections derived from it and have never tried to gain any. This has always been my personal distinction between say myself and the true elites. Wealth doesn&#x27;t inherently get you power and I don&#x27;t really even know how I would leverage what wealth I have to gain power despite this being a potentially viable avenue. Is this not a much better distinction?')
