Because in general, when I look at the software ecosystem (in the open-source community and the closed-source cross-company community), I see a minefield of impedance mismatches and a programmer&#x27;s lifetime of writing shim code.<p>The one-company ecosystems are incentivized to make their software work with its siblings.
