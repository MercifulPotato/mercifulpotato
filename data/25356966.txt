The article manages to describe it in the first paragraph like this:<p><i>The object in the photo has been described by U.S. officials as silver and “cube-shaped,” according to a report from The Debrief, which first shared the image.</i><p>which is ridiculous because it&#x27;s clearly not. Are they talking about a totally different photo I wonder? Later in the article the guy who took the photo is quoted as saying:<p><i>It’s likely that a backseat weapons system operator on an F&#x2F;A-18F Super Hornet took the photo of the object, which McMillan calls “inverted” and “bell-shaped,” and describes it having “ridges or other protrusions along its lateral edges, extending toward its base.”</i><p>So there&#x27;s something seriously wrong with this article.')
