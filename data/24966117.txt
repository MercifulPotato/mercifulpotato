They are neither pure nor functional. They are function components. We can still have pure components without hooks but function components are no longer pure by default. Its actually one of the downsides of the move to hooks. It used to be very obvious when you needed to worry about state and when you didn&#x27;t. However the benefits of hooks outweigh that nicety in my opinion')
