As I aforementioned in another thread, we also need C&#x2F;C++, Python, Perl, etc. as is since they fill different roles and attack different problems.<p>I&#x27;ve written Java, C, C++, Python, Perl, PHP. Had to abuse some of them to fit roles which they&#x27;re not designed to do. At the end of the day, these languages satisfy different needs and solve different problems in different scenarios. Java wouldn&#x27;t be able to do all of them. Neither C++, nor Python.<p>As I said, you may like Java but, it&#x27;s not the king of every programming language. No programming language is king of everything BTW.')
