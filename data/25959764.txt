Item(by='CarelessExpert', descendants=None, kids=[25960334, 25960195], score=None, time=1611940830, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959674, text='&gt; Lots of other brokers also did the same.<p>And a lot didn&#x27;t.<p>Some (e.g. TD A) imposed increased margin requirements, but that&#x27;s perfectly normal for high volatility stocks or options in margin accounts, and to be honest I&#x27;m amazed it didn&#x27;t happen sooner.<p>This comes down to those brokers that are their own clearing house versus those brokers that rely on a company like Apex.<p>It looks like Robinhood, Webull, IBKR, and others, all ran into the same capital requirements issues as their customers loaded up on a high value, high volatility stock.  Their clearing houses basically told them they had to pony up more cash, or they had to stop allowing customers to increase their positions.<p>So this was &quot;coordinated&quot; insofar as they all used a clearing house (I believe RH and Webull both use Apex, but don&#x27;t quote me on that) that made what amounts to a margin call on the brokerage.<p>To be clear, <i>this should not have happened</i>.  It&#x27;s entirely a function of the companies being under-capitalized as a result of inadequate risk management practices in this very strange market environment.')
