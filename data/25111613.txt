It took me a few visits to realize my doctors didn&#x27;t realize that saying it was an 8 at night didn&#x27;t make it clear that I was being rocked with waves of stabbing pain, where I couldn&#x27;t sleep all night, and literally couldn&#x27;t move my foot, even if I tried to pick it up with both hands. But because I was coherent and calm the next morning, an 8 must have seemed like a moderate amount of pain!<p>Anyway, the right place to go is rheumatologist. Urgent care or ER in the meantime, but insist that you get steroids or at least colchicine if you need pain relief.')
