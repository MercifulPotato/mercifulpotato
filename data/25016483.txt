Item(by='dane-pgp', descendants=None, kids=[25019059], score=None, time=1604769712, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25014370, text='&gt; I know using the phrase &quot;virtue signalling&quot; tends to merit a bucket load of downvotes here on HN.<p>Perhaps because it is an unfalsifiable claim.  If someone does something that they think is good, and someone else notices, were they &quot;virtue signalling&quot;?  In the case of public figures, especially legislators, many of their actions are broadcast to the public, so condemning &quot;virtue signalling&quot; is like condemning virtue itself, or merely stating that you disagree on which acts are virtuous (as is expected in a society where we are free to disagree).<p>&gt; legislators are falling over themselves to draft ever more idiotic laws intended to show how much more &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot; they are than the next guy.<p>I imagine that legislators think &quot;Violent people often have a history of saying bigoted things, but none of my friends say things that I think are bigoted, so locking up the people who say bigoted things will only have a positive outcome on society.&quot;  Unfortunately there are enough people who can&#x27;t imagine any bad consequences of such a law (even to themselves, eventually) that there is a genuine democratic mandate for it in some places.')
