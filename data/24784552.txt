The gender&#x2F;race swapping is sort of a different thing I guess. By all means, diversity is good, but at the same time, I kind of rolled my eyes when seeing &quot;Enola Holmes&quot; show up on netflix. It&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes, but a girl! Well technically his sister, but its more or less the same. Maybe its good, but I&#x27;m hesitant to watch something that&#x27;s main thesis seems to be &quot;Girls can be good detectives like Sherlock too&quot;. I don&#x27;t want that. I want a story about a competent female detective that just does things her own way. Say, idk, Jessica Jones.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between making a film about black Peter Parker vs. (black) Miles Morales for spider man. If they go for Miles, great, sounds like a good start. If they go for the former, you really have to wonder why, and how big of a deal its going to be. Being talked down to with drudgingly obvious and childishly simple messages about racial equality is annoying. It&#x27;s so, so much better to demonstrate equality by having competent outcomes from a diverse cast.')
