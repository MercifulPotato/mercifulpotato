I published a library that is still being used by others after only 2-3 months and looking at it now I still think it was done relatively well, though it was basically a simple wrapper. I began by reading the entire &quot;Learn You a Haskell&quot; book which is probably the best introductory book I&#x27;ve read about any programming topic, and then most of Brian O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Real World Haskell&quot;. There are better sources than the latter now, which was outdated at the time (~2014). Of course, focused full time or at least half time it would not take nearly this long for a team to come up to speed as long as they have at least one really strong member from the start. I&#x27;d say people could become productive in a couple of weeks in those circumstances; which is still much longer than pretty much any other language that is actually used in industry.')
