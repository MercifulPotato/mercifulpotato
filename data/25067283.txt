I thought I was very dismissive [1] with the new MacBook especially with regards to pricing. ( Mostly because of BOM Cost and Margins are price gouging, even by Apple&#x27;s standards )<p>Now things are settled a bit I thought may be it isn&#x27;t as bad as I thought . Had the MacBook Air Priced any lower, it would have seriously hurt their sales of 16&quot; MBP. Once MacBook Pro transition to ARM, with a rumoured of Mini-LED Screen refreshed as 14&quot; and 16&quot;. ( MingChiKuo has been extremely accurate with regards to Display Technology used on iPad and Mac ) So MBP wont be lower in price but offer more features ( Mini-LED is quite costly ). And possibly an M2 with HBE? I am not sure how Apple is going to coupe with the bandwidth requirement. It would need to be LPDDR5 Quad Channel at 200GB&#x2F;s or HBM2 if we assume M2 will double the GPU core again.<p>May be only then Apple could afford to offer a MacBook 12&quot; at $799. And educational price at $699. Although I am not sure if that is enough, Chrome Book in many classes are going at $299. Apple doesn&#x27;t have to compete dollar to dollar in pricing, but 2X difference is going to be a hard battle to fight. But at least it would allow Apple to win key areas in Education market where TCO and Cost are not as stringent.<p>May be Apple will do just one more Final update for some Intel Mac like Mac Pro ( At least I hope they do for those who really need an x86 Mac )<p>Oh M3 in 2022, Still within the 2 years transitional period, I think we are going to see a 3nm monster Chip for Mac Pro. When Intel is <i>Still</i> on their 10nm. And I think 2022 is when we will see an Apple console. Cause I dont think the Mac Pro Monster SoC volume is enough for its own investment. Some other product will need to use that, and Game Console seems like a perfect fit. ( At least that is how I could put some sense to the Apple Console rumours )<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25049927" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25049927</a>')
