If I have to build special containers specifically for Lambda because they require these special runtimes, that defeats the entire point.<p>&gt; You can&#x27;t run a random container and expect Lambda to know how it should communicate with the world.<p>Google Cloud Run, which everyone keeps comparing this with, works exactly like that. Upload any random container, tell it which port to open, and bam... running application. You don’t have to mess around with adding any “Cloud Run runtimes” or modifying your code to add special “Cloud Run handlers”. Because that would be silly.')
