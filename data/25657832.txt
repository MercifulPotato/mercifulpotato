At that point, the premiums start to resemble a tax.  I actually do consider the premiums a tax for the following reasons:<p>1)  there is a mandate to purchase health insurance (although now neutered in most states due to removal of federal tax penalty)<p>2)  the maximum premium is set to 3x the lowest premium (means young people subsidize old people)<p>3)  premiums can only vary based on age and tobacco use<p>4)  there is an annual in network out of pocket maximum<p>Another example of an uninsurable risk is insuring homes on the Florida and other Gulf states coastline for flooding.  No private insurer would touch this market since the losses are so high, so the government created the National Flood Insurance Program, which is the federal taxpayers taking on the liability for flood damage for those homes.')
