What’s all the I-am-smarter-than-you smugness about?<p>&gt; Law text: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher.”<p>People who want Section 230 repealed or modified want to be able to make the legal argument that by actively banning certain speech while elevating other speech, social media companies ARE acting as publishers. The law doesn’t need to define publisher again.  We already have an understanding of what publishers do: they selectively choose and publicize OTHER people’s content.<p>What am I missing?
