The decision to keep dorms open was most likely made with limited information. To put this into perspective: many Harvard&#x2F;MIT students didn&#x27;t realize there was a flu until they arrived on campus and were told to turn around. Those students then had to alert any other students or travelers they met on their way home to also turn around. This propagation took a few weeks.<p>But lets entertain whether or not this was a good decision(it wasn&#x27;t):<p>* Impromptu hospitals had to be arranged for at the A.T.O., Delt, Fiji and Theta Chi fraternities within weeks of the flu hitting Palo Alto.<p>* Administration banned social gathering and unwarranted travel. Students were quarantined on campus and could not leave. Masks were compulsory everywhere on campus. Anyone not complying with the masks guidelines received a fine (this is somewhat less harsh than the police beatings in Boston&#x2F;Cambridge).<p>* By October, it was considered a success that only around ten students died.<p>Meanwhile, not a singular undergraduate from MIT died on campus, and they continued their studies with an accelerated semester the following year.<p>Sources:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.stanford.edu&#x2F;thedish&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;15&#x2F;100-years-ago-the-spanish-flu-hit-the-stanford-campus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.stanford.edu&#x2F;thedish&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;15&#x2F;100-years-ago-t...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mit.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;3-questions-archivist-nora-murphy-how-mit-experienced-1918-flu-pandemic-0505" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mit.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;3-questions-archivist-nora-murphy-...</a><p>MIT Archives &amp; Distinctive Collections')
