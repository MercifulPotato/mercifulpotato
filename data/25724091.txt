The decision to keep dorms open was most likely made with limited information. To put this into perspective: many Harvard&#x2F;MIT students didn&#x27;t realize there was a deadly flu until they arrived on campus and were told to turn around. [0]  Those students then had to alert any other students or travelers they met on their way home to also turn around. This propagation took a few weeks.<p>But lets entertain whether or not this was a good decision(it wasn&#x27;t):<p>* Impromptu hospitals had to be arranged for at the A.T.O., Delt, Fiji and Theta Chi fraternities within weeks of the flu hitting Palo Alto. [1]<p>* Administration banned social gathering and unwarranted travel. Students were quarantined on campus and could not leave. Masks were compulsory everywhere on campus. Anyone not complying with the masks guidelines received a fine (this is somewhat less harsh than the police beatings in Boston&#x2F;Cambridge).<p>* By October, it was considered a success that only around ten students died.<p>Meanwhile, not a singular undergraduate from MIT died on campus, and they continued their studies with an accelerated semester the following year. [2][3]<p>--<p>Notes:<p>[0] I&#x27;ve edited this from &quot;flu&quot; to &quot;deadly flu.&quot; Initially, a few colleges (MIT included) opted for delaying the semester a few weeks. This led students to believe the flu was not too serious, resulting in students being caught mid-travels before being told how deadly the flu really was. This led to a lot of confusion and the MIT President apologized sometime that Winter in a letter (and later in The Corporation&#x27;s yearly report).<p>--<p>Sources:<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.stanford.edu&#x2F;thedish&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;15&#x2F;100-years-ago-the-spanish-flu-hit-the-stanford-campus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.stanford.edu&#x2F;thedish&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;15&#x2F;100-years-ago-t...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mit.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;3-questions-archivist-nora-murphy-how-mit-experienced-1918-flu-pandemic-0505" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mit.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;3-questions-archivist-nora-murphy-...</a><p>[3] MIT Archives &amp; Distinctive Collections')
