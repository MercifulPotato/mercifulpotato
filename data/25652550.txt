But I was not praising things like Elementor, Divi, Beaver Builder, WPBakery, etc. I hate them all equally for various reasons. I meant that those third-party plugins filled a market need, and Automattic brought Gutenberg into the market many, many years later after they had established themselves. This caused detriment to users because they weren&#x27;t able to convert off of third-party editors easily or cheaply.')
