The things all the PHP tutorials of 2001 taught was &quot;glue strings together and it will do what you want&quot;.<p>That was the knowledge offered for us 13 years olds wanting to write a discussion board for our game groups. I think it is a lovely example of &quot;the simple thing should be the safe thing, and if you need more there should be ample warning&quot;. That was not the case of PHP 4.0.<p>Anecdote: the Swedish PHP book  (I recall there being only one) that most of us got taught the string building approach without any escaping. The oldest things I can find Googling now are from 2007 and are almost all safe, either through PDO or a safe mysqli interface.')
