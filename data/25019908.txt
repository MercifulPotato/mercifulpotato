This alarm clock is programmed according to an offset of solar events (for me the sunrise, but if you want something for noon or sunset that is possible). This recent DST was the smoothest transition in many years. Particularly because I was not beholden to a stringent work schedule. I was free to set my hours a bit more flexibly.')
