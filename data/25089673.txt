I guess you’re arguing that you feel safer that the manufacturer can’t remotely disable the car, but I don’t see how how a cell connection has much to do with a car having a deadly issue or not. It has to get fixed no matter what.<p>(Also, given how many cars are leased, and the increasingly long time of those leases…lots of people, in fact, do not own their cars.)')
