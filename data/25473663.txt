Granted we were a small graduating class, only 15, and it just some back water college, not a university. But our graduating ceremony was cancelled because literally none of us signed up for it. Most of us were just so sick of seeing that campus and everything about it. Even thinking about today makes me feel ill at ease.<p>Just seems as if everyone else I know seems to have some happy moment from those years. Never found anyone else that disliked their time in college and makes me wonder what made it so happy for others, and what was so different for my class specifically for us to hate it so. Only thing I can think of was that ours was the last class to be the last to be run through that specific program, but that&#x27;s the only thing particularly unique about it AFAIK.')
