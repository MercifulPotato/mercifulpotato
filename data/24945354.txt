A bunch of candidates run, if no one gets 50% then the top two vote-getters face off in a second round with no other options allowed.<p>Well, that is just plain two round system, it is pretty common and definitely better than FPTP. The bizzare outcome you describe may also happen with FPTP, you just need one candidate from party A and several candidates from party B. The solution is same as in FPTP system - each party endorses just one candidate.')
