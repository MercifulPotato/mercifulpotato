Usually CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) is a good choice.<p>You should use TLVs much the way math people use Greek letters. The same concept should in general get the same name across different contexts. When you&#x27;re working in a given area, you&#x27;ll tend to remember the binding from TLV to concept by sheer power of associative memory. When you come back to it, it&#x27;s not that hard to relearn. And of course, when in doubt, comment it.&quot;<p>If only there were some way to put, like, a comment <i>right inside the name itself</i> somehow. Almost as if the name of the thing could be a meaningful description of what it represents. But I guess that&#x27;s just a language design pipe dream.')
