So sync was disabled.<p>I once had an issue similar to this, and it turned out to be an issue with my profile. Once I manually deleted the site data the problem didn&#x27;t come back. They admit that this may be a bug and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find out it is, but regardless there are plenty of other options including ephemeral profiles that you can use by setting a policy. If they aren&#x27;t signed into sync, then I also suggest they disable syncing from the settings and the policy as well.<p>&gt; Since Mozilla doesn&#x27;t do anything similar when not signed into their sync service, this is plainly false.<p>They _just_ install Pocket and a bunch of other unrelated services and send your DNS queries to third-parties, as well as opting you into recommendations and telemetry.<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re not highly technical, you&#x27;re not entitled to privacy?<p>You don&#x27;t have to be highly technical. There are a lot of options for Google accounts to disable ad personalization, history, third-party access, etc. In fact, I find it much easier than almost every other company I come across. The documentation is easy to follow and is so easy my kids could do it. I&#x27;m all for privacy, but at the same time the rules need to be applied equally to all companies. Just attacking Google isn&#x27;t going to fix the issue, in fact it will make it worse by giving a politicized government the ability to go after anyone that they feel doesn&#x27;t represent their political goals.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s simple. Some of us believe that a base level of privacy is a human right. And the only entities capable of facilitating those human rights are governments.<p>We don&#x27;t live in a socialist society that believes that humans have fundamental rights to basic necessities. I&#x27;m all for privacy being a human right, but shouldn&#x27;t housing, healthcare, etc also be human rights? Google gives a lot away for free. Until we start addressing other issues, privacy as a human right will never be on the table and when it happens you can&#x27;t just apply the rules to one or two companies. It has to be equal.')
