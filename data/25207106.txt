Capricorn  is basically η with a looped tail and taurus  is gamma ɣ with a bigger loop. I&#x27;m pretty sure kids wouldn&#x27;t be able to write them by hand (neither would I), but they have the advantage that if you type their names on a phone keyboard, you just need to recognize the symbol and tap it. Maybe all that&#x27;s needed for Greek letters to compete with emoji is equal treatment by keyboards.')
