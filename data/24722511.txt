Something that cops already deal with - sometimes there are just assholes that piss off a lot of people. And because of those assholes there ends up being a lot of people searching for them. Trying to find where they live so they can throw eggs at their car or whatever. Most people don&#x27;t actually throw eggs at said car.<p>But hey, this person is pissing off a lot of people, what are the chances that someone does actually murder them? Well, higher than non-assholes. And now you have a murder investigation that may include adding suspects that just fucking hate the guy, but had in no way murdered them. But Google Searching for their address the day before may tell the cops opportunity, and motive isn&#x27;t hard to get shortly after. That kind of association is what cops will take to court and likely wrongly convict someone on.')
