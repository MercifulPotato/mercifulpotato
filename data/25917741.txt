Open, free for anyone to read (in a hack-the-finance-planet) sorta way.<p>You have people writing in-dept thesis&#x27; on which way a stock is heading &#x2F; what happened yesterday &#x2F; how to &quot;play&quot; the trade. Its clear <i>some</i> of the people are serious as they put hundreds of thousands up against their theory.<p>Along with this you get a bit of a stick-it-to-the-man feeling as well. I will shed 0 tears if a bunch of people on reddit bring multiple hedge funds down. Perhaps the entire finance world should be more open, equitable and accessible!')
