What else is there?</i><p>Not trying to centrally plan an entire country&#x27;s economy based on faulty proxies for something that cannot be reliably measured [1]. Central planning just makes it easier for the rich to siphon more wealth from everyone else while disguising it as &quot;helping&quot;.<p>For example, if we take your observation about quality vs. price for health care and education as true, and compare it to my observation about cars and computers, the general pattern is that the areas where quality vs. price is worst are the areas that are the most centrally planned, and the areas where quality vs. price is best are the areas that are least centrally planned.<p>([1] - The reason wealth cannot be reliably measured is that it&#x27;s subjective; the value of a good or service depends on who has it and what use they can make of it. This is the only reason wealth can be increased by specialization and trade in the firt place.)')
