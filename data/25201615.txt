IDEs are pretty snappy at showing you autocomplete as you type regardless of whether the language has a garbage collector. And performance - well, that’s what caching would be for, and an optimized compiler design that only needs to recompile changed code...<p>I would also point out the “auto” keyword in CPP likely saves folks a lot of typing ;-) I know it and similar inferences changed my mind on the whole static vs dynamic debate...')
