I don&#x27;t know; I don&#x27;t remember being lied to when I started using cloud services.  I think of cloud resources as being amazing and basically magical, but I know there&#x27;s a limit to the magic, and the rest is work.  People using (for example) AWS S3 should not be surprised that they still have to work to manage the naming, organization, access control, encryption, retention, etc. of their data, and they might encounter problems if they try to load a 100GB S3 object into a byte array in a container provisioned with 1GB of RAM.  But they are.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s human nature or if they&#x27;re being lied to by consultants and marketers.')
