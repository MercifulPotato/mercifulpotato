If that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing, you&#x27;re searching through the list of stuff they want to get rid of, so that&#x27;s a win for them even if you don&#x27;t buy anything (because it&#x27;s not like you won&#x27;t look through them next year; you said you&#x27;ve done it three times in a row already?)')
