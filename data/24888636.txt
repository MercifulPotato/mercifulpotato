I&#x27;ve been using Bing for probably 10 years on desktop and Google on my phone (because Android). Generally I&#x27;ve found that I prefer the Bing results to the Google results more often than Bing. I&#x27;ve honestly had the opposite experience (frustrated with Google results, so I switch to Bing) so I wonder how much of it is based on subconscious assumptions about which we assume is better?<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some site the obfuscates results and could probably answer the question a little more scientifically.')
