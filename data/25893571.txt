It will move to a different platform or, should the network of platforms using HTTP look black holes, where useful into goes in but little useful info comes out, will pivot to a new protocol.<p>The really important infrastructure is the hardware and basic protocols.<p>There’s no reason see the network “inside Twitter” as important. Highly visible, but it’s just one groups choice of what to store in a database.<p>Alternatives can be copy-pasted together in hours by competent groups.<p>Tech is so up it’s own ass these days because it’s measuring inside a few Petri dishes and ignoring the Internet as a concept in and of itself.<p>The internet is not FAANG and Silicon Valley. It’s the hardware everywhere and fundamental  protocols.<p>So, yes, the math is right. But the math applies at various scales. For as visible as Twitter and the rest are, they’re not in and of themselves a distributed global network of hardware and routing protocols. They’re black holes in a bigger universe.')
