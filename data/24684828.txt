We go there once a week with our bottles, get 5-7 liters worth (costs only 1â‚¬&#x2F;l, cheaper than in the grocery store). It keeps without problem for up to 8-9 days. You do need a good fridge though.<p>I could go on and on about the qualities of raw milk, the richness of flavor, the high percentage of cream (~6.5% in the case of our milk), beneficial bacteria and mineral content, but the point is that it keeps well enough for us to be able to buy it once a week.')
