Ditto Republicans.<p>For instance, in my state, official (legally recognized, meaning access to the ballot) parties are organized by legislative, county, and state wide. Depending on the whatifs, who&#x27;s got the real power changes over time and context.<p>And the intraparty Democratic fighting is far worse than the interparty stuff. IMHO.<p>(Though I&#x27;ve attended Republican events, having never participated in their orgs, I can&#x27;t compare. Though from popular press accounts, insurgents like the Tea Party, taking on their establishments, sounds comparable.)<p>Then we have all sorts of non partisan politics. Like interest groups, lobbyists, agencies, media, etc.<p>So while doupoly sucks, and PR would be so much better, our current system is not monolithic.')
