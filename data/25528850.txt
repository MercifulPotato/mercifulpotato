I honestly can’t express how truly depressing and miserable your comment is. Self deprecating to use another language incorrectly to “humble” yourself? Seems pretty obviously racist. It’s like saying “Ching Chong China virus” and calling it self-deprecating. Petty fucking gross.<p>Wish I had the confidence of a white person to never think about my affect on others... or what language can do. Let alone to get paid like one since I get to put up with ignorant shit like this on the daily.')
