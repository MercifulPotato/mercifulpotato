It&#x27;s because lock is polite way to say &quot;do not enter here&quot; and almost everyone respects that. If someone wants not to respect it, there are a multitude of YouTube channels showing how trivially easy it is to bypass it. But then, the legal aspect kicks in and punishments follow.<p>The same with stealing. It is trivially easy to steal. Moral code stops most people. Legal code punishes the rest.<p>Anything in our world can be &quot;so easily acquired&quot; if one does not care about laws and ethics. In that sense, the question posed in the original comment seems utterly bizarre to me. If anything that could be easily acquired were to be released for free, almost everything in the world should be released for free.')
