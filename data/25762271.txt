I&#x27;m pretty interested and excited about this project. Under &quot;Credits&quot;  the project states:<p>&gt;&quot;The design of JuiceFS was inspired by Google File System, HDFS and MooseFS, thanks to their great work.&quot;<p>Would you consider writing up a design doc for JuiceFS. I would be interested to know more about what specific implementation ideas you used for each of those if any, design choices and tradeoffs made, learnings etc. It would make a great blog post. Cheers.')
