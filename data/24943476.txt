Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[24944255], score=None, time=1604073047, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24943135, text='&gt; But if all reputable members of society decide not to associate with an idea...it&#x27;s losing in the marketplace.<p>This seems to highly misrepresent the situation.  Actually, the reality is all &quot;reputable members of society&quot; <i>who control a major publishing platform</i>.  So that takes the pool of people deciding from hundreds of millions (in the USA) down to like 3 or 4 individuals (depending on how final decision making power is distributed).<p>&gt; Free speech isn&#x27;t the right to have everyone listen to every idea. It&#x27;s the freedom to enter the idea into the marketplace of ideas. But the marketplace of ideas is as cutthroat a business as any other marketplace.<p>An example of this is getting deplatformed from the few major &quot;marketplace of ideas&quot; platforms.  Yes, one &quot;can&quot; &quot;just&quot; move to another platform, or roll your own, but framing this in a manner that overlooks the fact that <i>all other things are not equal</i> seems rather disingenuous, and this occurs extremely frequently on social &amp; mainstream media, which is quite concerning.')
