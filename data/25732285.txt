As in, do you know how absurdly <i>lucky</i> it is that people with a controlling stake in these payment processing companies happen to agree with you and aren&#x27;t in Trump&#x27;s pocket?<p>Imagine it were the other way around, and suddenly Twitter and Facebook just couldn&#x27;t use banks anymore, or cards.<p>Centralized control of money is too dangerous for everyone.

They were fine with Trump&#x27;s making up executive powers that don&#x27;t actually exist anywhere.
