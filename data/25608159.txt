That&#x27;s an argument for guidelines that don&#x27;t require explicit permission: let kids go any time they want, and they silently signal it by holding up 2 fingers as they get up &amp; go.<p>And how much valuable time is lost here, weighed against the extreme distraction a student has if they can&#x27;t go? Besides, once the student has raised their hand and been called on, the flow is already disrupted. Answering &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; is irrelevant at that point.<p>Do you have a proposal that both meets biological needs and doesn&#x27;t run the minor risk of disruption? Disruptions occur constantly anyway every time a student asks a questions when they don&#x27;t understand, even when most others do.<p>I simply fail to see how &quot;stop the flow of the lesson&quot; is either very relevant to unpreventable biological needs, or an unsolvable problem in its own right.')
