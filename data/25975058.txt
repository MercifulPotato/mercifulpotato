They were thinking about issuing shares.<p>I dunno, it seems like meme stocks are in that position because they&#x27;re small-cap companies facing significant headwinds and either got overshorted or have enough brand recognition that retail investors seem convinced they&#x27;ll survive. I&#x27;d rather not be in the position of facing the headwinds and hoping a bunch of suckers show up who will give me money.<p>What&#x27;s funny is this is pointing out big holes in the &quot;but it&#x27;s 150% shorted&quot; story. The retail buy&#x2F;sell order flow seemed pretty balanced on Thursday according to Citadel, so there isn&#x27;t much HODL. If the price holds for much longer, Gamestop can issue more shares, and holders of convertable debt are converting, likely selling the shares ASAP.<p>I guess they squeezed some shorts, some more shorts probably moved in, and some of the money goes to debt holders, and some might go to the company. Some of it makes for a good story, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if PE and hedge funds quietly come out ahead in aggregate.')
