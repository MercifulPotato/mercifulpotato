I&#x27;ve been reading the comments here with much interest but simultaneously also a sense of impostor syndrome, for I&#x27;ve been running my one-man SaaS on generic LAMP since 2005, and aside from adopting jQuery early on, I haven&#x27;t much touched any other piece of exciting tech that&#x27;s come out since.<p>My old and boring stack works just fine on the VMs that it runs on, and and continues to support me and my family financially with little to no downtime and decent work&#x2F;life balance.<p>Of course I&#x27;m aware of the cons of programming in PHP versus other languages, but after 20 years of coding in it, I like to think that my code isn&#x27;t all that bad.<p>Still, I&#x27;m reading some comments here and feel like I&#x27;m waaay behind the tech curve with my use of such an old stack, and am somewhat scared to admit it.<p>Your comment brought me relief :)')
