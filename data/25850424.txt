BLAST became  so common,  but was so poorly understood, that if you wrote a replacement for BLAST that was faster, you had to ensure that the output was identical to the human readable output of BLAST, and bug-for-bug  compatible, too.<p>BLAST  wasn&#x27;t really implemented as a library- it was based on a baroque toolkit and the underlying code was extremely complex to analyze.<p>There was no officially supported file format (other than the human readable output) so you had to write parsers.   The human readable output changed between versions.<p>The one good thing about BLAST was the stastical model- you really could trust the calibrated E-values.')
