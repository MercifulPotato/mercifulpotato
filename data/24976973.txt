For one, there were some on there I didn&#x27;t even know existed. Second, you might want to try out some different ones before you settle on the one you like. Personally I rather liked Micro, for instance, but now I&#x27;m definitively going to give Ox a go too.<p>I think the negative remarks come from people who are probably both very knowledgeable and experienced, but also entrenched in &quot;their&quot; editor, and perhaps they didn&#x27;t feel the blurb gave &quot;their&quot; editor the justice it deserves, while this isn&#x27;t an editor that purports to be the &quot;best&quot; out there, or even the most advanced.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve never been a fan of using the terminal for anything else than reviewing code, so Micro is enough for me. It has text highlighting and commonly known Windows-esque shortcuts. To compare this to Emacs, which I&#x27;ve given my best shot, it just turned out way too complicated for my needs, and there&#x27;s a ton of extra stuff to learn that I just wasn&#x27;t motivated for on top of learning to code.<p>Once I saw the high treshold for getting into Emacs, I just opted out. Perhaps it is better in many ways, but I was instead lured in by Sublime Text, and I&#x27;ve stayed there ever since. Is it &quot;better&quot;? IDK. It&#x27;s what works for me.')
