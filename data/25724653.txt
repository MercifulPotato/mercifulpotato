In fact I probably wouldn&#x27;t remember the exact name of the function and would&#x27;ve just &#x27;created&#x27; a new one: `Tuple&lt;int, int&gt; DivideWithRemainder(int dividend, int divisor)`. You can just write signatures for functions like that on a separate side of the whiteboard and invite your interviewer to tell you if they want to see any of them implemented.<p>I would advice this as a general approach -- split things into (reasonable) parts and implement them in order of importance. In one interview (Amazon) I ended up implementing every small thing I parceled out. In others my interviewers seemed to appreciate that we both care a lot about the `solution flow` and the `technically hard` parts and not at all about `DivideWithRemainder` or `import Math`.<p>I got offers from most of the places that I interviewed at.')
