In Europe many countries still have incentives to boost fertility.<p>It&#x27;s high time we give up on the fantasy of an ever growing population as a ponzi scheme to boost the economy and finance public spending. We need to face the reality that we ought to have at the very least a stable population and reorganise society accordingly.<p>In relation to developing countries, any healthcare-related aid should be conditional to implementation of birth control policies.<p>Globally we really should have a target to reduce population by a few billions if we want to all enjoy life in comfort (~Western country level) on a thriving planet.<p>Edit: Judging by the reactions, the penny has not dropped yet for some... Hopefully it will before it&#x27;s too late.')
