There are encrypted messaging apps out there that don&#x27;t rely on servers, like Jami, tox or Briar, the last of those three being the best one, in my estimation, as it uses Tor and can function on a mesh network, the only drawback being not having the ability to send media attachments.<p>There are good alternatives to centralized, corporativistic messaging apps (I include Signal here); we just have to be willing to look for them and make the switch.')
