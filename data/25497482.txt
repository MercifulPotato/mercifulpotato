After you&#x27;ve written enough lisp, you may go back to other languages but then you&#x27;ll really know why you use those.<p>There are essentially 2 possibilities:<p>- you need huge or specialized libs not available elsewhere: Python, Java, etc.<p>- you need extreme speed, binary size or memory control: C, Rust, etc.<p>For everything else, lisp will be better.')
