I can tell you that McDonald&#x27;s and Wendy&#x27;s both have&#x2F;had excellent fries but there were bad incentives for cooking them properly and having them fresh.<p>The fries need to be cooked for a specific time(well duh, but the sweet spot is less than a dozen seconds). They also cook better in small batches. The times are off for full baskets and perhaps they don&#x27;t cook well like that at all; you want the fries to be &quot;swimming&quot; on the basket.<p>Problem is the same as every fast food restro; the employees get antsy and don&#x27;t want to wait for them to cook all the way. Managers and employees alike think(or don&#x27;t think TBH) the customer would rather have their meal 20s sooner with undercooked fries. Same reason sandwich shops pull the sandwich before it has been properly toasted.<p>When I was younger and frequented these places I used to ask them for &quot;..fresh fries, cooked the full time. I don&#x27;t mind waiting&quot;. Go inside, the drive-through has bad quality incentives(wait time).')
