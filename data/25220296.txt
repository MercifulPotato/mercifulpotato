Your page is going to be hosted somewhere. Some registrar will need to maintain your domain. Your DNS records will be registered by someone. You&#x27;re going to be interacting with payment processors. You&#x27;re going to buying power from some utility company. Your spouse may be working in a brick-and-mortar location. All of those (and more) are vectors for attack for censors whether they be government or activists. They just need to label your speech as dangerous or evil or something ridiculous and publicly shame you, your spouse, your spouse&#x27;s employer and anyone that does business with you to see how little protection a new technical platform gives you.<p>We&#x27;ve gotten away with this up to now because of the meteoric rise of the internet, but it&#x27;s been figured out now.')
