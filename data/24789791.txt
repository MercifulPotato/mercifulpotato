Dang is doing an exceptional job in holding things together. And despite a slight downward trend in terms discussion quality, HN is still by far the best tech and other &quot;nerd&quot; interest forum. And the community as a whole self police each other. The vibrant and large number of active users, compared to a SubReddit, Dev.to and other site makes astroturfing HN really really <i>really</i> hard.<p>Anyone who have submitted anything on HN would know. Getting on the Front page isn&#x27;t an easy task at all. And <i>staying</i> on front page is even harder.<p>And Cunningham&#x27;s law doesn&#x27;t always work on HN.
