Item(by='contravariant', descendants=None, kids=[25645234, 25645384], score=None, time=1609851977, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25643654, text='Since memristance is just the charge-dependent flux I&#x27;m not sure you couldn&#x27;t get it by just throwing a resistor capacitor and inductor into a single circuit. In fact memristance is just the voltage divided by the current, which is <i>impossible</i> to be 0 for any circuit with some voltage. So by this definition almost any circuit has memristance.<p>Note that it&#x27;s not unfair to consider any circuit with nonzero memristance as &#x27;containing&#x27; a memristor, after all the whole point of fundamental circuit elements is that you can add them to model stuff like wire resistance and stray capacitance. However while you can&#x27;t create resistance, capacitance and inductance by combining any of the others you <i>can</i> have memristance by combining all 3 (technically you can create any of the 4 by combining the 3 others, but 3 of them can be built easily so those make more sense as fundemental circuit elements).<p>So while a linear memristor would be rather unusual, I don&#x27;t quite see what&#x27;s so fundamental about it as a non-linear circuit element.')
