But it&#x27;d be dishonest if I didn&#x27;t admit having concerns over safety we might not be aware of at the time this is administered that would only be known many months or years later.<p>That&#x27;s overridden by the fact that I lost one family member to the virus and another who survived it but is already seeing long-term effects in her lungs from when she had the virus. She was just hospitalized again for those effects. If folks have more info about measuring long-term impacts of a vaccine, I&#x27;d love to hear it for the peace of mind. Again, I&#x27;ll be getting the vaccine regardless, because of very clear long-term effects of the virus.')
