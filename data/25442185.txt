The TLD &quot;tt&quot; does in fact have MX records. But it&#x27;s a very rare case that a TLD does, and prohibited for any of the new TLDs.<p>For non-FQDN hostnames, it&#x27;s kinda pointless, as you can only use that on your own domain. So if you were to do that, just make up your own pseudo-TLD like &quot;.x&quot; with an alternate DNS system. You could even have it point to the regular DNS system through CNAMEs.')
