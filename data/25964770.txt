It&#x27;s incredibly expensive to build new plants, and they&#x27;re already doing this with no margin for profit, so they can&#x27;t just do that in the <i>hope</i> that the EU eventually gets off its arse and decides to buy the vaccine. I mean: the EU still hasn&#x27;t decided whether to even give the AZ vaccine to the most at risk people.<p>The timeline:<p>- The UK paid for research and development of a new vaccine.<p>- The UK pre-ordered X amount of vaccine.<p>- AZ began setting up facilities in the UK to manufacture X amount of vaccine<p>- Three months later, the EU pre-orders Y amount of vaccine.<p>- AZ begins setting up EU plants to produce Y amount of vaccine. If you check the contract, the EU specifically says that the plants must be built in the EU, and that AZ would need special permission to use UK plants, so of course AZ are not going to reserve extra capacity in the UK for this contract.<p>- The EU plants suffered problems ramping up production, in large part because the shorter schedule set by the EU.<p>The provisioning for the EU contract has nothing to do with the prior UK contract. \nThere&#x27;s nothing that &quot;stinks&quot; here, only poor planning on behalf of the EU bureaucracy and a sprinkle of bad luck. Had the EU not stipulated that the plants be built <i>in the EU</i>, AZ would have likely been able to provision more capacity more quickly. Had the EU placed their order earlier, there would have been more time for AZ to resolve the issues in the EU plants. Had the EU responded to the drop in production by asking for assistance from the UK, or by attempting to assist AZ, instead of throwing its weight around, I would have a lot more sympathy.<p>The EU, in its slowness to react, has actively harmed its member nations, and is now looking for a scapegoat (AZ) to blame to avoid the repurcussions.')
