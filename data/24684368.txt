I tried to explain this to a public official from an east cost town who was flying back from the Bay Area trying to &quot;learn the secrets&quot; of creating an innovation hub. When I explained this situation (non-competes are illegal, stuff you do at home is yours) to him he literally said &quot;That&#x27;s crazy! Why would anyone hire anyone if they knew they could walk out the door to a competitor, or even to start a competitor? We would never allow that in our town.&quot;<p>I tried to explain that it puts the onus on the company to adequately reward their employees with equity so that they want <i>this</i> company to be successful, not the possible other company. And it encourages management to be a better place to work than their competitors. Both things lead to better employee engagement and better results. But they couldn&#x27;t get past the fact that there was no issue with leaving a company and going into competition with it.<p>Ultimately I believe (but cannot back it up with any sort of data) that non-technical folks don&#x27;t appreciate how much crappy work is involved in starting from a blank sheet and coming up to being competitive with an already up and running company. But what ever the reason, the unwillingness to &quot;go there&quot; with this sort of protection time and time again has killed innovation. Even when an example that it works, and works well, has decades of history demonstrating that it does.')
