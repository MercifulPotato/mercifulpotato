Stock valuations are meaningless. Take Alibaba for instance. What exactly are you getting when you buy a share of BABA? Voting rights? Dividends? Liquidation value? Nope, none of that. You&#x27;re getting a meaningless piece of paper that hopefully everyone else agrees is worth something in the future.<p>How about Chewy. 30 billion market cap for a random ecommerce site running a multibillion dollar loss for 5 years? Sure why not. Or Quantumscape. 20 billion for a battery company with zero revenue that doesn&#x27;t even have a factory? Of course. Money is a complete fiction now. In this environment, if the investing class agrees that Bitcoin is worth $35k, then it is.')
