That is what the Financial Times graphs show that another commenter posted, and they very clearly show the excess deaths in 2020 vs previous years for Sweden (and many other countries).<p>What&#x27;s the point of the graphs in this post? I mean, 2020 isn&#x27;t even done yet, so the graphs literally tell you nothing about Covid because there are no previous graphs to compare to. So what&#x27;s the point of posting this, with this title, besides being deliberately deceptive?')
