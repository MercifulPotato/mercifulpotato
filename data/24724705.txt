Of course if you decide to use something like docker you will force yourself into a performance corner. This would happen with literally any piece of software. It&#x27;s not then valid to use that as a way of requiring a better cpu. No what you need is to get your development environment in order.<p>Btw docker is only standard for CI systems. Never would I advise anyone to actually use docker for local development let alone 10 docker instances at once. It&#x27;s just pure insanity.')
