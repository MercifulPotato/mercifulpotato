Just looked the model up and I see it&#x27;s not as old as I thought. It was about 12-13 years ago actually around 2007~2008.<p>I&#x27;m pretty certain I haven&#x27;t even tried MMS in any other phone since. With blackberries I used their messenger, with Android I used various apps, never MMS. I still use plain SMS occasionally.')
