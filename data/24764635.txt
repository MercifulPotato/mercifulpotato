Your average cop is also trained with a handgun as their primary, instead of a rifle as primary and handgun as secondary. Your average military personnel is more fit than your average cop as well. Not to mention the military doesn’t have jurisdiction inside the US to enforce laws. If you believe they are the same then how come military cannot arrest you (ignoring MPs near or on bases)?<p>Using your logic I can prove many different things that are pretty silly. For instance, since a gun can be used to kill people, and so can a pillow, the pillow must be an “assault weapon”.<p>I have a question for you, have you ever needed the police for anything?')
