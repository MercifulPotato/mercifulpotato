Between the massive years-long hype, delays and bad press about crunch time around the title, not to mention being the most lucrative time of year for a game release, it&#x27;s very likely that management egos were fully engaged in this release.  When that happens reality is no longer driving, or even on, the bus.  There may have been one or two brave souls who spoke up and when no good came as a result of speaking up (at best they were disregarded, at worst it was a career limiting move), everyone else tends to fall in line.  So when management holds their various last minute go&#x2F;no go meetings, people tend to nod their heads in agreement recognizing the futility of trying to point out the obvious.')
