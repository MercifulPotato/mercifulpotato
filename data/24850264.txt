It makes me feel really uncomfortable. So, I just leave it on.<p>Sometimes I just forget too. I accidentally terrorized a young couple at Joshua Tree last weekend, because I didn&#x27;t have my mask on, I was out climbing and in my &#x27;happy place,&#x27; and I completely <i>forgot there was a pandemic</i> and just wandered right by them and waved and said &#x27;hi.&#x27; It wasn&#x27;t until later that evening that I realized why they were looking at me with wide-eyes and edging away from me. So, I wish I had just left the thing on in that case.')
