Item(by='winter_blue', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607858070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25405659, text='&gt; Imagine a near future where speed limits are sent via radio then enforced by the car computer.<p>I think if a law were passed that forced people to adopt that, there would be a backlash, and then the speed limits would very quickly be increased as well — to a far more reasonable level. I would imagine highway speed limits would rise to 110 mph (177 kmph) or something, which is far more reasonable considering how safe cars are today, and <i>the sheer number of hours</i> it would save in commuting times.<p>(If a road heavily used by commuters changed its speed limit from 55 mph to 110 mph, you’d be cutting each person’s commute time <i>by up to half</i>. That would add up to million of hours of time saved in a large-ish city, and not to mention, less road damage due to the lower amount of time cars are on the road, and probably less energy usage once car manufacturers optimize their engines&#x2F;motors for maximum efficiency at the 110 mph point.)')
