I don&#x27;t know about that particular one, because (shockingly) I don&#x27;t own a Ferrari.<p>But second, that doesn&#x27;t matter. Most places do not have laws that prohibit children in the front seat of cars, only that they use appropriate child seats. Further, child seats are typically required for _children_, not just infants. IIRC, for example, in Texas, child seats are required for any child under the age of 8, unless they are taller than 4&#x27;9&quot;. It is totally reasonable for a 7 year old to want to go for a ride in their parents &quot;fancy&quot; car. It&#x27;s actually very responsible of this person to get a child seat properly installed in order to support that.')
