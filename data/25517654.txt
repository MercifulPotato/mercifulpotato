Best execution is a lot more complex than market vs limit. The normal metric for best execution is &quot;implementation shortfall&quot; which is the difference between the market price at the &quot;decision time&quot; (when the order arrives at RH is the best they can do here) and the executed price.<p>Poor execution leads to a lot of shortfall, good execution leads to a small amount of shortfall and in some cases even negative shortfall.<p>You can think about execution slippage as being the &quot;information impact&quot; of trading and a good broker will attempt to minimise this cost along with other transaction costs (eg fees etc).')
