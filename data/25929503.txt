She did, but she called my wife. (Has happened more than once. Has never happened &quot;the other way.&quot;)<p>I work much closer to our day care than my wife and have a more flexible schedule, so if one of our kids gets sick and needs to be picked up I have done the pick up 100% of the time. Yet 100% of the time they call my wife, who then calls me. Also, 100% of the time they are a bit surprised when I show up to pick up the kid.<p>This hasn&#x27;t caused us any harm, but I believe the phenomena is &quot;real&quot; and I could see scenarios where it does cause harm. It&#x27;s also true that some instances have mundane causes as others have pointed out here.')
