Item(by='mcguire', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606160918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25189403, text='&quot;<i>What is the next step, we either find a scientific way to measure the effects and then create laws if the effects are bad.</i>&quot;<p>There are two problems.<p>1. No (interesting :-)) questions have simple clear answers.  Sometimes, propaganda is good. Context matters, as do a lot of variables that are either prohibitively difficult to address scientifically or to legally control for effectively. (Let&#x27;s say that X (a form of media, say) is perfectly harmless unless you have a certain set of genetic values. Requiring a whole-genome assay before you could interact with X would be theoretically unlike banning X, but practically?) Further, there are plenty of things that I don&#x27;t like[TM], but which I wouldn&#x27;t care to make laws about.<p>2. The environment changes continuously. How do you decide what your personal take on X is, in the absence of concrete and final scientific data on the effects of X? Knowing the future is hard, by the way.<p>The area of inquire of the article, and of asking those questions, is moral philosophy, and it&#x27;s goal is to provide an individual with the tools to make decisions[1] in the absence of hard data and with the knowledge that other decisions are completely legitimate.<p>There&#x27;s no one here other than you talking about banning things. And, honestly, &quot;do what thou wilt until there is concrete proof of physical harm&quot; is a valid ethical approach, although I don&#x27;t know of anyone who subscribes to it and it has some poor consequences. (Are lootboxes and social media unequivocally bad? Good? Are the consequences such that legal action is required?)<p>[1] To any philosophers who wish to disagree: Fight me! I&#x27;ll immanentize your escutcheon, you cheese-headed babbadook!')
