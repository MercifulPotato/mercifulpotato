It&#x27;s literally 5x-20x of what a solid developer can earn in Europe. I mean, the best of the best (and I know maybe 1000 developers so not that small of a sample) I&#x27;ve heard is around $150K, a few over $100K and everyone else below $100K.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s other stuff - 30 (working) days of paid vacation, solid and cheap education, solid medical coverage (I consider $50 medical bill damn high) etc.')
