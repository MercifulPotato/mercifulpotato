It&#x27;s a religion to which the majority of the developed world appears to subscribe. It seems to be  losing adherents to disillusionment, albeit incredibly slowly.<p>The prevalence of views similar to yours are one of the reasons why I don&#x27;t foresee a positive future. I suspect society will continue down your suggested path of more technology and more resource consumption believing it to lead to some sort of salvation. I see it instead as the furtherance of human&#x27;s destructive tendencies which have only grown more potent with every increase in humanity&#x27;s capacity to effect its will via technological development.')
