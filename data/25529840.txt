That&#x27;s what happened in these 2 examples, and this mechanism is still active.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that this will work every time. I&#x27;m just highlighting that at Google this mechanism is particularly strong (and so the hate towards Google less understandable).<p>Of course new laws would be even more convincing, if only for those corporations where the self-control is weaker.')
