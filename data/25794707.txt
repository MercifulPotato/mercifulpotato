Function keys are abstract, useful for particular niche cases.  Done right, the touchbar seems like a better solution.  I&#x27;m glad they brought back a physical ESC, for sure, but I don&#x27;t think going back to function keys is actually a step forward.  It also seems like an un-apple thing to do.<p>I&#x27;d like more ports.  But I&#x27;m not sold on the idea of going back to an HDMI port, displayport, etc.  I&#x27;d rather see the world switch everything to USB-C than see Apple go back to one of each port.  I&#x27;d like to be able to hook up a half dozen monitors, or a half dozen network connections, or a half dozen hard drives, or ... you get the idea.')
