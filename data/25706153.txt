Shit got out of hand much like in the George Floyd riots, but to a much lesser degree. In spite of the relative magnitudes of the death and destruction in those events, the insane leftist media has somehow decided to paint the George Floyd riots as understandable at worst and freaking obligatory at best. At the same time that they paint the capitol building riot as an historic tragedy.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely batshit. It completely beggars belief that anyone can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t see it, yet here we are.<p>And THIS is the primary reason we&#x27;re seeing division in the nation today. It&#x27;s not the handful of radical racists. It&#x27;s not Trump&#x27;s stupid tweets. It&#x27;s the completely irrational and insane reaction by the left to anything that is not within their narrow and ever-shrinking Overton window.<p>So go ahead, make excuses. Tell me you&#x27;re the good guys and we&#x27;re the bad guys. It doesn&#x27;t matter anymore. As long as you continue blinding yourselves, this division will grow and eventually break this nation, probably sooner than later. Frankly, I don&#x27;t care anymore, and neither does half of America.')
