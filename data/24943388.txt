I have the Steam Controller and, while I&#x27;m aware it is an experiment, it&#x27;s a completely functional controller and in many ways significantly better than any other I&#x27;ve ever used, especially for MMOs. The biggest problem, imo, is that people simply refused to give it a try because it&#x27;s something new.')
