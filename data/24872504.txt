There&#x27;s a ridiculous amount of lines of code being executed to do the simplest of things. You do something like `a.b = c` and really `a` is a proxy so that setting `b` the setting gets tracked going through 100+ lines of code all of which has tracking structures that get setup and torn down between components. They claim this will make your life easier but when the facade breaks you end up having to design your entire app around the fact that `a.b = c` is not simple, it&#x27;s complex and so you have to avoid it as much as possible my piling on more complexity.')
