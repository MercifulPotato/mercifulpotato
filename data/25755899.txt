I would never object to a group of people who want me to work more efficiently and get a better financial deal.<p>Call me whatever you like, but I don&#x27;t want to suddenly find beef off the cafeteria menu, be forced to pay extra for parking because I am not driving an electrical car (or because I am driving at all instead of biking) or be told my project is cancelled because it helps the democratically elected US government and that I have to donate from paycheck to entities I disagree with to help them in goals that hurt me at a personal level because the media that they follow managed to portray them in a positive way.<p>I really don&#x27;t know who &quot;the rest of us&quot; you mean are, that they want to show their solidarity to, so I can&#x27;t comment on that part. Did you mean they like to show solidarity to software engineers in other companies? Because I don&#x27;t know how would they do that given their current direction.<p>Whatever little freedom we have left should be cherished at all cost because once we lose it, it won&#x27;t ever come back.')
