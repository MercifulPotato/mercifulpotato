Thats the facts.  Countries are simply not doing that.  Despite many motivations to do so.<p>&gt; you&#x27;d think the government would just give up trying to have control, it wouldn&#x27;t be worth the effort<p>And yet we see that the governments of the world are <i>not</i> successfully cracking down on the internet enough to shut down crypto.  Thats not happening.  Despite the fact that crypto is often used for illegal purposes.  And yet countries aren&#x27;t enacting authoritarian control over all of the internet to shut it all down.<p>We do not need to consider hypotheticals here.  Just look at the real world, right now, and all the illegal activity that happens using crypto, and yet we are seeing that the world governments are not willing to enact measures to shut it all down.<p>Apparently, it is not worth the effort to shut down that illegal activity, right now.  That is already the state of the world.')
