They upgraded recently (although the upgrade happened at roughly the same time as i left my job and took a step back from wikimedia so i dont have much experience with the new version).<p>I think Wikimedia struggles a lot with code review culture in general. Different people have conflicting ideas about what good code looks like. It used to be very nitpicky (i&#x27;ve had code rejected in the past for using (php&#x27;s) intval() instead of casting to int. I&#x27;ve also had code rejected for casting to int instead intval().) But that&#x27;s improved quite a bit with better precommit lint tools. The length of the feedback cycle is very long and sometimes feels like its mostly about who you know (e.g. the last patch i submitted i did on sept 9 for a decently serious bug. First actionable feedback (which was relatively minor things of the form use a constant named ONE_MINUTE instead of 60) was on oct 15. Thats kind of a long time to wait for code review imo). Anyways, its just not fun to contribute when code review is so unpredictable and long.<p>Hmm. Guess i got off on a bit of a tagent there. I do think gerrit has some usability issues, but i think that&#x27;s hardly the main problem.')
