Think about battery power, it isn&#x27;t going to scale linearly. If land costs are a big issue (and limitation) this is true. If wind and sun aren&#x27;t uniform, this is true. If the premise was true then we would have always only used coal because it is so cheap. You don&#x27;t have to eliminate the duck curve, but smooth it out. There&#x27;s also many other reasons to have a well diversified portfolio. It would be ridiculous to say &quot;only wind&quot; or &quot;only solar.&quot; I&#x27;m not sure why this argument is made with nuclear when we don&#x27;t do it in with any other source nor have we done it historically. It is just a non sequitur and a weird argument to make.')
