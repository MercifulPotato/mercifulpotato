My reasoning seems correct to me but a key premise was wrong, and I agree the proposal is much less onerous than I have painted below:<p>I personally know multiple startup founders worth $10-$20M on paper who made $120K&#x2F;year salary for years (or still are.) It’s hardly unusual, startup valuations are high these days, and VCs and the founders themselves want to reinvest in growth, not issuing distributions.<p>A founder owning 40% at a $50M valuation would feasibly have to double his salary to $240K to afford the $80K&#x2F;year wealth tax, after paying income taxes on the salary increase in California.<p>That’s realistically one employee they no longer have the cash flow to hire. A $50M startup may have something like $2M ARR, so if they don’t want to burn investment funds, they could support maybe 8 employees at their ARR level. Knocking out one employee at that size is significant.<p>Or you could say they should get VC to support hiring more employees. Now the wealth tax is indirectly impacting the founder&#x27;s equity—forcing you to sell your company.<p>We can argue whether they should be forced to liquidate a portion yearly for taxes, but let’s not pretend everyone worth $20M on paper can light $80K cash on fire yearly without consequences.')
