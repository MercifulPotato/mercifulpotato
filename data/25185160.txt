Facilitating a robbery is illegal. Facilitating actions of a political group, as long as it is within the framework of a law, is called &quot;living in a society.&quot; Your second example reduces to the following: &quot;is it legal to sell materials to facilitate lethal injections?&quot; If no, then it is a matter of criminal justice, not politics. If yes, the political actor is the group committing the lethal injections, not the group selling materials.<p>The kind of extreme &quot;guilt by association&quot; you derive cannot be considered a part of the political in terms of conscious action precisely because &quot;the political&quot; encompasses normal function of the society. Criminal activity, on the other hand, is not considered a part of normal function of a society, hence one can assume that everyone who &quot;knows&quot; a criminal but doesn&#x27;t turn him in is also a criminal. In other words what you&#x27;re doing is you are criminalizing normal para-political association---a  characteristic of individuals with a totalitarian mindset. As a non-American, I have to say I am stunned to observe this attitude in the US.')
