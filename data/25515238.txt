Email isn&#x27;t secure, and anyone could send an email pretending to be you. If there are irreversible consequences to cancelling, such as deleting personal data held on the service, not only would it be irresponsible to accept an unverified email message as a cancellation request, it could actually be illegal in various places (under the GDPR, for example).<p>Not providing a straightforward cancellation option via a website where the customer&#x27;s identity has already been confirmed using their normal credentials is a different matter entirely.')
