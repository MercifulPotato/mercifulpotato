Crap content happens to be what drives engagement, so hosting crap content is a large part of Facebook’s business model.<p>You’re speaking with a pretty authoritative tone there as though you’re absolutely sure that Facebook has had a change of heart and only wants to host quality content, and there’s no other reason why the pages were removed. Do you have some sort of proof for that, or are you just speculating? If you’re speculating, don’t you think it would be a good idea to match the tone of your post to your true amount of confidence  in what you’re saying, so as not to misinform people who might read your comment?')
