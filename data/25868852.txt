So weâ€™ve made the difficult decision to close down Loon.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand - wasn&#x27;t the whole premise of Google X and their &quot;Other Bets&quot; that &quot;Google has deep pockets. Let&#x27;s use this to explore radically big ideas, that are ahead of their time, and let the world catch up to them?&quot;<p>Bringing &quot;abundant, affordable Internet access, not just to the next billion, but to the last billion&quot; is clearly an investment. You bring them the internet. You spur them to achieve great things. Then you reap the financial rewards.<p>But that&#x27;s not a 10-year plan, that&#x27;s a 20-50-100 year plan. But, there&#x27;s no reason to think that Google couldn&#x27;t think like a 20-50-100 year company if they tried.<p>So what happened? Did they really think that they were going to make money from the poorest 1B people on the planet BEFORE they brought them ubiquitous internet and helped them use that internet to improve their quality of life?')
