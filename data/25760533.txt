NOT NOW SNAKES!<p>j&#x2F;k that is really cool, though the following quote made me a little sad:<p>“We may not have observed the behavior in the wild because we’re barely observing the animals in the wild.”<p>That reminds me of Attenborough talking about how there aren&#x27;t really many truly wild places left in the world.<p>That makes me wonder, how much of even, for example, Goodall&#x27;s study of the chimpanzees just 60 years ago was really studying them in the &quot;wild&quot;?<p>Maybe this is why I am drawn to videos of extreme deep see creatures, because that does seem to be still wild (for example, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=anDIlMVgNwk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=anDIlMVgNwk</a> ).<p>Edit: I just wanted to point out that I realize that part of the motivation for the quote is just because of the difficulty of observing the secretive snakes in the wild and not because they don&#x27;t exist in wild places anymore -- it just sent me down a little tangential rollercoaster of emotion. That&#x27;s all.')
