Every platform has a shortcoming and claiming it&#x27;s ahead of the game is a biased stance. The M1 specs may be impressive now, but the same can be said of every &quot;new&quot; SoC chip.<p>&gt;... linux port will always be a shitty experience...<p>People who really love Linux and FOSS actually prefer to tune their environment to their expectations. The weeks of tinkering is part of the hacker mindset that is slowly eroding, and I&#x27;ll take the weeks long config experience over a locked environment.<p>To sum it all, Linux and consumer open systems have a different target audience from Apple. Apple users are like car lessees, they just want to hop in and drive their car until the lease is up. Linux users are like the mechanic working out of their garage who drives a hodgepodge vehicle they pieced together. To say that the Apple experience is better is just hype, and calling the personalization&#x2F;optimization process &quot;shitty&quot; is closed-source&#x2F;closed-minded view.')
