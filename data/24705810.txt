Our borders are mostly just arbitrary lines drawn based on who had the best military at a particularly pivotal time in history for that region.<p>Given the diversity of thought and values across the US, I expect I have more in common with a lot of people who are not US citizens, who live in other parts of the world, than huge swaths of America.  Maybe I <i>want</i> more people in this country that share my values.  I&#x27;ve never really thought about immigration in these terms before, but this question has prompted some tangential thoughts about it.')
