So you can do something like run `vim [CTRL+t]` to quickly find and open any file you want, or `cd [CTRL+t]` to switch into some deeply nested directory.<p>Even inside of WSL 2 with a 6 year old workstation on a first generation SSD it takes ~3 seconds to index 190,000 files and once that index is built, narrowing down results while typing is close to instant when using ripgrep as FZF&#x27;s search back-end.<p>The amazing thing about all of this is it&#x27;s dynamic. There&#x27;s no having to create aliases or pre-defined directory structures. I only discovered CTRL+t from FZF a few weeks ago but once I did it was almost as good as discovering CTRL+r for the first time.')
