It&#x27;s the first argument I&#x27;ve heard against mmWave that has some merits.<p>Just found a paper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecfsapi.fcc.gov&#x2F;file&#x2F;1210030663890&#x2F;The%20human%20skin%20as%20a%20sub-THz%20receiver%20%E2%80%93%20Does%205G%20pose%20a%20danger%20to%20it%20or%20not%20(1).pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecfsapi.fcc.gov&#x2F;file&#x2F;1210030663890&#x2F;The%20human%20ski...</a><p>&gt; The results obtained from the simulation work were verified in series of in vivo experiments conducted on a number of subjects in the W-band (75–110 GHz). It was shown that the reflection coefficient of their skin strongly depends on the physiological stress of the subject (Feldman et al., 2009, 2008). In the experiments, the palm was held steady by a stand that was placed at fixed distance from the horn antenna connected to the input of the Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). The measurements were carried out using 13 subjects, both male and female, all were in the age group 20–30 and had given their informed consent.<p>Wow, you can use a VNA to measure <i>that</i>?')
