A website that doesn&#x27;t take action on hate speech is allowing and condoning hate speech.<p>&gt; Calling a completely apolitical stance political is sort of like calling Atheism a religion. It&#x27;s arguably correct but it&#x27;s really the absence of religion.<p>We&#x27;re not talking about apolitical stances like &quot;I like chocolate.&quot; We&#x27;re talking about hate speech, which is implicitly political.<p>&gt; Also, I think your whiteboard with a swatstika analogy demonstrates the shortsightedness of this sort of &quot;inaction is endorsement&quot; line of thinking. What about a candidate who&#x27;s family was personally affected by the Holocaust and is so mortified to see the swatstika that they are too uncomfortable to even do anything about it?<p>Isn&#x27;t this just even more evidence to suggest that an employee not taking action is an action itself?<p>What-aboutism is great, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter in this context, right? &quot;What about a candidate who&#x27;s blind&quot; etc etc. I defined a hypothetical scenario to prove a point in response to the above hypothetical scenario.')
