And a plug-in is not something you plug your guitar into to make enough noise for 300 people. &quot;A plug-in sounds like a $600 speaker&quot; makes almost as much sense as the title; by the sound of an <i>amp</i> people often mean the sound of the <i>combo box</i> which houses an amp and a speaker.<p>-If this emulates a <i>particular</i> amp, the title should say which one<p>-If it does a good job at emulating a particular amp, where&#x27;s the side by side comparison? The video demo only shows the plug-in.<p>-There are plethora of guitar amp plugins. What makes this one any different or better?<p>-What&#x27;s the significance of deep learning here?
