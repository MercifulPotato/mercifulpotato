I thought it was great.<p>5 has issues because it was about too new of a phenomenon (tried to pull in the NYT&#x27;s journalist making up stories which had happened a year before). The rest of the stories backing the seasons were about well digested topics they could be quite sage on. I actually really like season 5.<p>Also the wrap up to the series (the outtro) is amazing end to a series IMHO.')
