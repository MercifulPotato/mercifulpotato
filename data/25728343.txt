It&#x27;s perfectly acceptable to make &quot;I like it&quot; or &quot;it works for us&quot; choices.<p>I do believe, very very mildly, that there&#x27;s a strain of thinking among the tech crowd that glorifies this Spock-like emotional detachment and I&#x27;m-so-rational mindset. Two issues, actually:<p>First, such a mindset is neither possible nor would do much good. There are stroke victims that survive with full mental capabilities with regards to logical reasoning but entirely devoid of emotions. These patients can still ace the SAT, but they fail spectacularly at daily life. As it turns out, you just cannot decide on a doctor&#x27;s appointment without emotions. They&#x27;ll spent hours vacillating between two good choices. \nEmotions are incredibly well-tuned heuristics that cut down your mental load to manageable levels. As any part of being human, they are sometimes ill-fitting for modern times: there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to make me flinch when I spill hot coffee over my hand. But mostly they just work.<p>Second, it&#x27;s slightly annoying when people deny that they are subject to emotions, and it gets up to Ryanair-levels of discomfort when they announce that it makes them superior to all those emotional  social science majors, illogical politicians, women &quot;throwing a fit&quot;, superficial designers etc. If I got a KDE theme every time someone accused Apple users of being blinded by eye candy, I&#x27;d still be left with only half of what Kubuntu ships.<p>But Rust is cool.')
