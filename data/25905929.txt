Of course, this opens the debate as to which material conditions are desirable, but I&#x27;d say the possibility of not needing to work yet having your basic needs met is the main lodestar, the one aspect that would fundamentally change the nature of human life.<p>In this case, it is clear that some human activity would cause a dramatic fall in our material conditions if not performed. Food and energy producers, raw material extractors and processors, doctors, waste disposers, builders, grocery store clerks and so on... Even if we take into account the wastefulness of our production, it is still the case that they would be sorely missed, and their sudden absence would bring about total collapse. We both consciously and unconsciously recognize this, as evidenced for instance by all the &quot;essential worker&quot; designations that have followed the pandemic in various nations.<p>Comparatively, if all ad-tech workers, corporate lawyers, high-frequency traders and other such professions disappeared tomorrow we would collectively be hard pressed to notice unless it were pointed out to us. The skimming aspect is much clearer and obvious in their case, even if it&#x27;s still an inevitably fuzzy boundary that could be argued about indefinitely.<p>We could also make an argument referring to entropy and there being no free lunch but like solipsism it would be both technically true and useless at the same time.')
