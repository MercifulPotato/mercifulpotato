I live in Austin and for years watched as they slowly built out neighborhoods, waiting for them to come to mine. Eventually they did, and a guy went door to door asking for a $10 deposit as a way of gauging interest. For a year they trenched and installed underground lines.<p>Just as they did it in front of my house, Google announced they were no longer expanding their fiber network. Now there are three orange cable butts sticking up from the ground at each end of the block, lashed up to telephone poles but not connected to anything electrically.<p>But I&#x27;m glad the people a couple blocks over from me are getting 2Gbps service while I suffer with Spectrum cable internet.  Oh, they recently refunded the $10 they collected a couple years (or more) ago.')
