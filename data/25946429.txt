Short sellers ought to make bank on it.<p>And then comes WSB and offers a different reason: Buy a couple of shares and hold just to punish the short sellers. It&#x27;s irrational in the market sense, but it&#x27;s <i>completely rational</i> from an internet mob sense. They&#x27;re not out to make money, which is the normal rational decision-making process that all the big players are accustomed to. This mob is out for <i>blood</i>, and they&#x27;re doing it for shits and giggles. Of course the big market players are upset, because the mob has money and are wielding it &quot;wrong&quot;!')
