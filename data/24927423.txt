False flags (in the form of routed connections and much more) are extremely common in cyberwar and among cybercriminals, naturally. But can you name a time US law enforcement or military fucked up and fell for a &quot;cyber false flag&quot; [1], and mistakenly took action against the framed party? It may have happened, and I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked, but I haven&#x27;t actually seen a publicized case of it.<p>From having some knowledge of some investigations like these (though not on behalf of any government), the investigators and forensics experts are constantly asking themselves &quot;is this a false flag? is this piece of evidence deliberately planted, or an actual mistake?&quot; Investigators obviously want to get the right people and not get the wrong people. And in the case of nation-states, they also have classified information they can use (like from NSA global spying, etc.).<p>[1] (I shudder at the term &quot;cyber&quot; as much as anyone else reading this, but that pretty much is the official term the government uses.)')
