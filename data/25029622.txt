Now if all participants would cooperate the cake could be made to grow. But this will afford people to not take as big of a piece as possible for a while. And because nobody trusts each other, every participant instead focuses instead on keeping the future pieces at least as large as they used to be which means taking relatively speaking an increasingly large chunk. And that&#x27;s not sustainable so everything breaks down at some point and wars start over getting something from the cake.<p>Same shit with carbon emissions, now fishing and soon water.')
