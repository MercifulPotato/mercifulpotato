No one is saying that our current animal trials are optimal, one of the professors in the news article I linked is quoted as saying the exact opposite &quot;The animal models used to understand the safety and efficacy of drugs are flawed&quot;.  It just is the case that retraining, to draw analogy to computational models, our model animal is not free because the evaluation of its performance after that change is much more complex and expensive than an ROC curve produced from labeled data.')
