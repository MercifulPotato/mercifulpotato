I worked on a carnival ship until the pandemic and I don&#x27;t know where you pulled this answer out of, but it plain old wrong.<p>The reason they can&#x27;t leave is simply the American authorities won&#x27;t let them leave the ship in order to prevent them from staying in the U.S and potentially finding a way to get a job there (legal or illegal). There wasn&#x27;t a person on board who couldn&#x27;t leave the ship because of documentation in normal circumstances, but with the virus happening, Carnival shit their pants and were blocked from having anyone leave for the aforementioned reason.')
