I may produce some evidence but you say it is manufactured. In such case how can I convince you you should open your mind to the possibility that the evidence is real?<p>I think one way might be to get the person to question their reasons for why they believe them, why not as well believe something else?<p>In such a case an honest and open-minded person might say hey maybe I believe what I have believed so far because that is what I WANT to believe. Say I believe Trump won the election. Maybe I believe so because I want to believe it is true.')
