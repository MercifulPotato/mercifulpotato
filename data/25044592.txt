I was able to get through to the original Latin text [1]. It is ambiguous.<p>Dani loca ultra Scaldem populantur. Vulgus promiscuum inter Sequanam et Ligerum inter se coniurans adversus Danos in Sequana consistentes, fortiter resistit; sed quia incaute suscepta est eorum coniuratio, a potentioribus nostris facile interficiuntur.<p>Which translates roughly as follows. (I&#x27;m not a medieval Latin scholar so some meanings may be off.)<p>The Danes plunder the areas beyond the Scheldt River. The common people between the Seine and Loire, allying themselves [or: conspiring] against the Danes residing on the Seine, fight strongly; but because their alliance [or: conspiracy] was undertaken without care, they are easily killed by our more powerful [troops].<p>It does not say explicitly whom the commoners were fighting. The word used for their alliance also means conspiracy and can be quite negative.  It&#x27;s the same word used in the phrase &quot;Conspiracy of Cataline.&quot;<p>p.s. It&#x27;s mind-blowing what you can find on the Internet.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dmgh.de&#x2F;mgh_ss_1&#x2F;index.htm#page&#x2F;452&#x2F;mode&#x2F;1up" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dmgh.de&#x2F;mgh_ss_1&#x2F;index.htm#page&#x2F;452&#x2F;mode&#x2F;1up</a>')
