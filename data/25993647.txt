TLDR: Unless the user experience&#x2F;accessibility&#x2F;hosting experience is improved, I just couldn&#x27;t suggest anyone use it.<p>Last time I really dug in the user interface and accessibility concerns were not great.<p>I understand the idea was more about the data handling, and that anyone could produce something based off the framework but I had all sorts of issues with the login tokens&#x2F;usability. (ie, if you logged in with the wrong cert it didn&#x27;t have an easy way to clear it, and would &#x27;log in&#x27; to an error page. ect. )<p>as far as I can tell, each pod&#x2F;data host can run different versions of solid, so your experience may vary between them.  You can self host as well.<p>I&#x27;d have to dig in again to see if things have gotten better, but I don&#x27;t have time at the moment. \non quick look, some of my data sites are no longer working. oh! link says it was shut down in oct. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.w3.org&#x2F;Archives&#x2F;Public&#x2F;public-solid&#x2F;2020Oct&#x2F;0005.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.w3.org&#x2F;Archives&#x2F;Public&#x2F;public-solid&#x2F;2020Oct&#x2F;00...</a><p>That said, the community was pretty nice and willing to answer questions.<p>Maybe things have improved?<p>I was hoping that maybe they&#x27;d start using DAT as well, because it seemed like it might be nice to dovetail with some of the beakerbrowser&#x2F;distributed web stuff going on. re @pfrazee')
