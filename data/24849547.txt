Item(by='zozbot234', descendants=None, kids=[24853425], score=None, time=1603298734, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848130, text='&gt; &quot;items in group A which are linked to group C via linkages to items in group B&quot;<p>Relational databases are actually quite convenient for such cases because you can model each &quot;group&quot; of items via a database table, including potentially an associative table which provides &quot;linkage&quot; between items in the database. Graph-based models are generally more limited than that, e.g. RDF and SPARQL are limited to simple triples which link a &quot;source&quot; and a &quot;target&quot; entity (both of which are essentially non-typed) according to a fixed &quot;predicate&quot;. You can sort of materialize triples and endow them with extra information, but it gets clunky.')
