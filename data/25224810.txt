I see a &quot;back to previous page&quot; button but also an &quot;ignore this warning and continue&quot; button. In addition to providing the ignore button, they also put the URL up front and center, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s impossible to figure out how to get to it yourself.<p>I doubt they are flagging the lawsuit specifically. They are most likely flagging the URL <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;defendingtherepublic.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;defendingtherepublic.org</a>, which is <i>not</i> filing lawsuits on behalf of voters, but rather on behalf of Sidney Powell (it literally says &quot;Sidney Powell&#x27;s Legal Defense Fund&quot;) who is Michael Flynn&#x27;s attorney and a former member of President Trump&#x27;s legal team [1]. This website is not an unbiased source of information and a lawyer has no incentive to present any information that would weaken their client&#x27;s case.<p>Considering Twitter has decided that flagging the President&#x27;s own tweets is acceptable policy, it is not surprising at all that the same thing is happening to his surrogates.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;22&#x2F;trump-campaign-sidney-powell-legal-439357" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;22&#x2F;trump-campaign-sidn...</a>')
