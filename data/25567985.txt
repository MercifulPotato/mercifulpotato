This is really helpful. I am aware that Tuchu&#x27;s current strength mostly (and in many cases solely) lies with identifying sentences that summarize, not sentences that explain a concept or convey crucial detail. In that sense the claim of &quot;highlighting the important parts&quot; may indeed be a bit bold.<p>In my opening post I said that doing your own reading is still a requirement, but it might be good to also mention this on the site â€” at least until I find a way to improve the algorithm. One way could be leveraging pre-trained word embeddings, but this would require a server or downloading a large blob to the user&#x27;s device beforehand. In any case Tuchu wouldn&#x27;t be as fast that way.')
