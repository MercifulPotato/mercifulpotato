Too few, and you run the risk of not providing a solid base to teach the subject matter.<p>Its overall a good blogpost in any case.<p>--------<p>One more &quot;criticism&quot; (but not really).<p>&gt; Rule #2: Whenever we need to choose a variable based on control flow, we use the Phi function (Ï†) to introduce a new variable based on our choice.<p>You might actually benefit from a more complicated example here, rather than the simpler example you chose.<p>A do-while loop:<p><pre><code>    int x = 0;\n    do{\n      x = x + 1;\n    } while (x &lt; 100);\n</code></pre>\nThis has always been the hardest thing for me to understand, with respect to #2 and SSA in general.<p><pre><code>    int x_0 = 0;\n    do{\n      x_1 = phi(x_0, x_2);\n      x_2 = x_1 + 1;\n    } while (x_2 &lt; 100);\n</code></pre>\nOn the one hand: choosing simple-to-understand examples is helpful to the reader, because they&#x27;re simpler to understand. On the other hand, smacking the reader with the most complex case may suddenly spur inspiration and the ability to understand the whole problem.<p>I guess its a style choice. But something to think about...')
