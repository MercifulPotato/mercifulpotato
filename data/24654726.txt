It was ~ 20 years ago, but laws change from time to time.<p>Not so funny is when I had to go to the police section, take such a &quot;clean bill of criminal record&quot; from one office and give it to another policemen at the next office 5 meters away. It was the third time that month because I needed some certificate that had cascaded  requirements to have other certificates that also depended on this bills and each required a separate bill in the list of documents.')
