I know there are a ton of details I don&#x27;t know about for why the phone system is the way it is. It&#x27;s over 100 years old and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot of cruft.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to pay a local carrier for a data connection using their infrastructure. What I&#x27;m imagining is an app that lets me get a local phone number anywhere. Calls and texts to that number ring and show up in the app. If I move to a new place, I just get a new SIM card for data and create a new local phone number in the app.<p>WhatsApp is almost this, except it doesn&#x27;t manage any of the phone numbers, and I&#x27;d really prefer to use something that I can pay for that isn&#x27;t owned by Facebook. I&#x27;ve taken to giving people in Hong Kong my US number as well since that&#x27;s what is tied to my WhatsApp account and there is a 90% chance that if anyone here is going to try to contact you, they&#x27;ll do it through WhatsApp.')
