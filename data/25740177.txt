A century after inventing quantum mechanics, physicists still squabble over what, exactly, it tells us about reality.</i><p>I think his question is a little loaded - it&#x27;s a clich√© that &quot;nobody understands it&quot;, and I&#x27;m sure there are physicists who would bridle a little at that being true.<p>His following claim (disputes over what it tells us) - while  true - is not quite the same thing, so the argument is flawed in that regard, but not because of a problem learning maths.')
