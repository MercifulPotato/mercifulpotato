Which means you need light houses.<p>Also when you submit a bug, I&#x27;m pretty sure it uploads the state of the SLAM map, which would be impossible if they didn&#x27;t have the legal cover.<p>Now thats not to say that if they had the tech they _would_ use those bits of information. However they don&#x27;t because they really don&#x27;t have the tech yet.<p>Firstly the features that the oculus extracts from the SLAM cameras really arn&#x27;t great for room mapping. Well, the cameras are fine, the feature extractor isn&#x27;t. it works short term, but not for long term, or dense reconstruction.<p>Secondly, streaming 4x slam cameras at 60hz isn&#x27;t trivial in a lab, let alone on with a battery on wifi on a generic internet connection.<p>Thirdly, facebook dont have anywhere near enough GPUs do the required classification&#x2F;mesh generation&#x2F;segmentation etc.<p>Finally there isn&#x27;t a RGB camera.')
