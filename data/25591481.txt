With null_resource the file is created after plan, during apply. To workaround this I tried to provide something else to bundle hash sum (like hash sum of source files, not bundle), but the value that TF keeps in the state is the one returned from AWS Lambda API, not the one you supply it; so it causes resource update on every apply, this is not what I wanted.<p>Your comment made me think of trying to skip bothering with Lambda’ hash sums and use custom refresh triggers instead, initiated by null_resource. Will do after holidays.')
