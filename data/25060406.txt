The infrastructure of our cities is such that self-sufficiency and community preparedness are the best paths towards surviving a disaster. For example, Houston (my home city) can&#x27;t have an effective hurricane evacuation. There&#x27;s simply too many people with too few paths out, and this a city that if you zoom out looks like a spider&#x27;s web of freeways.')
