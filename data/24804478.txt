The user has to artificially restrict the fundamental utility of the product or else be subject to legal penalties.<p>I don&#x27;t see anything fundamentally wrong with this. If anything, I&#x27;m for it because it incentives the manufacturer to make effective products. The more effective their mouse trap is, the more money they make. Sounds like a good thing to me. It&#x27;s not any different than unreal engine&#x2F;unity charging you a % of your game&#x27;s revenue as royalties.')
