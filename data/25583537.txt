This just happens to be the number for that particular vaccine.<p>&gt; 10 in 200,000 deaths is better than 1 in 100<p>The 10 could have been fine without the vaccine. Who knows, it&#x27;s just speculation; maybe they had pre-existing conditions, maybe they did not. But comparing numbers like this knowing that the 10 in 200,000 are drawn from a <i>different population</i> from the 1 in 100 is being disingenuous.')
