It&#x27;s not like having a stuffed nose or just being less sensitive to smell. For me I could breathe just fine but could not smell or taste anything, literally zero. Even very strong smelling things did nothing for me, and food had zero taste. It&#x27;s a very unusual experience and I think a dead giveaway that you had the virus (it appears near the end of an infection typically).')
