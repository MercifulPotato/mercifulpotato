It mostly works well for the things I use it (push messages, maps, exposure notifications seem to work too). Some apps behave a bit weirdly if the try to access specific API&#x27;s, like Google Pay. So it definitely isn&#x27;t fully functional, but works well enough for many use cases. There is also a LineageOS+microG fork, which makes trying it out a lot easier.<p>The way it works is that it pretends to be Google Play Services, so it isn&#x27;t transparent to the apps. Not sure if the apps could figure it out it isn&#x27;t running on the real deal.')
