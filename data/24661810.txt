Is that a thing? For each additional character in the input, it must compare against 5 values. Or would it be O(n) because it scales linearly?<p>Thanks in advance. I&#x27;m a front end engineer and this is my weakest area but I&#x27;m keen to learn. I&#x27;ve studied this before but I use it infrequently and it doesn&#x27;t stick.')
