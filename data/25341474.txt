Proof: during the Cold War, both sides had about equal militaries. Or, at least, equal for all practical purposes, i. e. killing everyone and everything 20-times over.<p>And yet it were eastern regimes that had to build walls to keep their citizens from stampeding westwards. Nobody in West Germany was prosecuted for watching the East German TV channel. Not just because it wasn&#x27;t illegal, but mostly because it was done rarely, and mostly ironically. The reverse landed quite a few people in jail.<p>Judging by peoples&#x27; actions immediately after the fall of the wall, they weren&#x27;t afraid of anything American. Or else it&#x27;s hard to explain how about half of them used their first trip across the border to get a Big Mac.')
