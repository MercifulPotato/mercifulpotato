Well, I can&#x27;t really argue with that beyond that my standards on perfect might be different.<p>I think some of the best voices they have are characters like Twilight, she shows a ton of promise. But as it stands right now, I would still at least hesitate to use Twilight&#x27;s voice in a project unless I didn&#x27;t have other options. Chrysalis&#x27;s voice is good, but again, is an exaggerated cartoon character with a large amount of inflection. I would not use her voice in her current state without a lot of post-processing. Someone like the Spy I would consider to be unusable, it sounds to me like the character needs to clear their throat or something, it&#x27;s got a lot of strange artifacts. I definitely would consider the 10th Doctor unusable, even for just a hobby project or a voice assistant.<p>But... I don&#x27;t know, maybe this is subjective. I can&#x27;t just tell you that what you&#x27;re hearing is wrong, if you like the results then you like the results :)<p>And again, I don&#x27;t want to detract from how impressive they are. They are incredibly impressive, particularly because of how characters like Chrysalis emote. Extremely promising. But I still think there&#x27;s a difference between &#x27;impressive&#x27; and &#x27;believable deepfake&#x27;.')
