They were very clearly not calling for summary execution with the phrase &quot;arrested, tried, and if convicted&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if the punishment fits the crime either.  If I say convicted jaywalkers should get the death penalty, I am not calling for summary execution.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if I accuse them of the wrong crime either.')
