Which it doesn&#x27;t. At best, this is confusing, suggesting that Postgres = PostgreSQL. Postgres became PostgreSQL ten years later, once SQL was added, replacing PostQUEL. The elided details allow for different interpretations, including the wrong one, that SQL was there from the beginning. Also, the tone of the text you quoted suggests that Stonebraker learned his lesson, and just went to SQL for the Postgres project, which he definitely did not do.')
