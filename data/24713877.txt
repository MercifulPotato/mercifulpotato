When large companies make gains from &quot;economies of scale&quot; it&#x27;s almost always because they&#x27;ve attacked margins, usually by wielding enough power they can convince suppliers to make less money, sometimes by replacing other parts of the vertical market by doing things in house.<p>If you think about the tech giants, they&#x27;re not making gains by automating more production. They&#x27;re buying up fiber, building their own chips, creating their own shipping companies, etc. They are big enough to alter most markets in ways that are favorable to them.')
