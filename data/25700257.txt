Please don&#x27;t read this and repeat the opinions posted here. A lot of what the author says is just plain wrong and shows a misunderstanding of basic functional idioms.<p>For example: &quot;Functors are basically an Object with a internal state changing method in typical OOP terms.&quot; Uh, no. Functors are stateless, with a well defined semantic. This is nothing like an object with internal mutable state, with instance methods that mutate it in god-knows-what-way.<p>There are a lot of mischaracterizations like this in the article.')
