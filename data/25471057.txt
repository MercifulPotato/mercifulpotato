While it is clear both games have different priorities in terms of writing and activities but they both have a similar heart. I think Cyberpunk puts a lot more points into atmosphere and worldbuilding than DX ever did, personally.<p>And nonlethal options are presented to you as part of the tutorial. I agree that lethal&#x2F;nonlethal doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference, but if you do stealth and melee combat from the start you have a path for nonlethal that will get you all the way through the first major mission. From there it&#x27;s relatively easy to acquire PAX mods that turn any gun nonlethal.')
