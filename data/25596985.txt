That&#x27;s not a meaningful category list.<p>&gt; These core mechanics work.<p>They work like a water-filled car coasting downhill. It looks like it&#x27;s water-powered (or JIRA-powered) but it&#x27;s just the gravity well of &quot;looking busy&quot; for the most part.<p>Maybe the in-car water fountain could be considered water-powered in practice, but that&#x27;s a derail. Management gets approximations from JIRA because that&#x27;s what they want, but JIRA doesn&#x27;t provide it. A tool with a dependency graph could do much better.')
