Item(by='stochastimus', descendants=None, kids=[25754700], score=None, time=1610487628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25753898, text='Yeah, my experience so far has been that if I just pile a bunch of logs in there, if it&#x27;s not given salient lines, the language model tends to either rat-hole on some particular detail that&#x27;s irrelevant, or else construct a non-factual narrative. But, when Zebrium did the picking of these lines autonomously and GPT-3 summarized them, we see a meaningful summary. Having said that, I would also like to get GPT-3 more and more savvy with larger and larger log-based prompts, and I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s possible with some tweaks to the prompt and some finetuning. I&#x27;ll keep the blog posted as we do more experiments.')
