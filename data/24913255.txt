Ex: One 50-300 person place I worked at had a much higher rate of chinese &amp; jewish people than other typical tech companies for example.  It started because the first staff members were of those groups, and then they reference more people from those groups and it creates a network effect. I was a recruiter hire so I wasn&#x27;t part of the trend. Companies only start reverting to the mean once they get so big that the reference network effect is too slow.<p>If the ethnic clusters have bad english, you then start getting language and cultural comfort effects and people not of the ethnic group have a much harder time getting hired.')
