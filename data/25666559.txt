Item(by='nkurz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609986659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25666150, text='&gt; it&#x27;s pretty clear that the M1 would not perform as well if its decoders were as narrow as current x86 cores<p>This would imply that it&#x27;s able to sustain ILP greater than 4 (or maybe 5 with macro-fusion).  Does it actually manage to do this often?  If so, that&#x27;s really impressive.  I was guessing that most of the advantage was coming from the improved memory handling, and possibly a much bigger reorder buffer to better take advantage of this, but I&#x27;m happy to be shown otherwise.')
