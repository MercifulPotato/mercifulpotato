The primary issue that stopped me was the different executable file formats.<p>I never took it anywhere, but I think the way to go would be a &quot;polyglot&quot; script that could be interpreted by different script engines (sh&#x2F;bat) that would then pick the correct executable for the given OS. This would require the user to change the file extension as well as download multiple executable files so I don&#x27;t necessarily like this solution from an elegance stand point.')
