But exterior doors in my area tend to have big glass panels on them.&quot;<p>Locks, sure. But those don&#x27;t mean much if you have doors and door frames made of wood and they aren&#x27;t either extremely heavy or reinforced.<p>&quot;Are they bringing a ladder as well?&quot;<p>A ladder or chair from your own home should work fine. You might be suprised at how often burglars use tools they find in the target house.<p>&quot;Because then you would know exactly where they are and you could escape more easily.&quot;<p>Not if they&#x27;re making entry to the attic right outside the room you&#x27;re in so they can work on that and watch the door.<p>You&#x27;re really derailing the entire conversation with trivial what-ifs that aren&#x27;t even related to the original point. None have offered any evidence refuting the point that if someone wants beat you to death, the police will be too slow to save you.')
