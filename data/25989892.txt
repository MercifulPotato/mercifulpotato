And since F# doesn&#x27;t force you to do that even when it is a bad idea, things are quite nice.  When mutating state is the simpler thing to do, you can do it.<p>Where things can get weird is when you start passing partially applied functions to other functions, and then you use type inference on function signatures on top of that. Glancing at the function signature its completely opaque what is going on.  Hopefully you aren&#x27;t in github and have working code lens and then you get a type signature to help, but it gets very verbose and confusing, and is still hard to reason about, for me anyway.<p>A thing I find helpful with F#,  no matter what style you use, is always type out the types in function signatures.  Yes this has downsides occasionally when a refactor might have just worked without adjusting types through a chain of functions, but I think it is a net win for productivity.')
