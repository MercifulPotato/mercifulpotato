When there&#x27;s a cycling path you&#x27;ll at least know where they will be coming from.<p>The solution to that problem is not putting cyclist and cars on the same road, we&#x27;ve tried that and it&#x27;s worse. The solution is separating bike and car infrastructure so that there are as less as possible crossings between roads and cycling paths.')
