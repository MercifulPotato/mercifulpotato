Yes it&#x27;s cheap. Yes it doesn&#x27;t last a lifetime. Yes it needs a lot of wood. Yes it&#x27;s highly optimized.<p>It&#x27;s mass production without the opportunity to posture about your means. It&#x27;s also often a complicated and confusing experience to put together if you don&#x27;t heed the instruction booklet carefully.<p>Personally, I think IKEA&#x27;s instructions are <i>dramatically</i> better than the norm. An exploded engine diagram is a common approach from other vendors.')
