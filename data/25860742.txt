I never stared for long... maybe 5-10 seconds at most, but staring at nuclear fission occurring is truly an awesome experience.<p>There&#x27;s no Cherenkov radiation emitted, so you&#x27;re just staring through glass at a bunch of metal, but you still know its occurring... and that was enough for me.')
