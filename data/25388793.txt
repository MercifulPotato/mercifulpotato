With the press of a button it will switch my 32&quot; 4K monitor&#x27;s input to the &#x27;other&#x27; device as well as my apple bluetooth keyboard and trackpad.<p>It connects to both laptops through bluetooth and has a LiPo battery making it completely wireless. I 3d printed an enclosure that lets me mount it out of sight underneath my desktop (think up-down controls for a standing desk).<p>This lets me easily switch between computers through the day without plugging in&#x2F;re-pairing&#x2F;etc.<p>It&#x27;s still needs a bit of refinement but overall, it&#x27;s quite nice and makes switching devices painless.')
