At that point, as I said above, specific rent amounts and wage amounts become irrelevant.<p>You need to focus on: what will genuinely help them? Drug treatment? Mental Health treatment. A lifetime of free food and housing etc and the removal of any obligation to contribute to society forever?<p>I say none of this ironically. When someone simply can’t work, and no one else voluntarily want to take care of them, we have to figure out what to do. And how to distinguish between fakers and real. And between temporary and permanent. Partial and complete.<p>At that point there are so many issues, putting high rents and low wages in is literally a distraction.')
