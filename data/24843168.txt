Governments aren&#x27;t omniscient.  If a government is bad, stupid, or just mistaken in what the right policy is, it&#x27;s better if that doesn&#x27;t affect the whole country.  And if there&#x27;s another state right beside it that does better, the first state can see that other policies work better and <i>might</i> get their act together.<p>But if it was the federal government, it would affect everyone, not just one state.  Also, there wouldn&#x27;t be 50 examples for them to pick the best from.  (There are other countries, but their circumstances tend to vary more than the circumstances between states, so it&#x27;s easier for naysayer to argue that the example doesn&#x27;t really apply.)')
