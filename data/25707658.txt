Item(by='rglullis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610243151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25707559, text='&gt; visas cost structure.<p>I know. <i>I don&#x27;t care</i>. This is Homo Economicus talking. 3% or 0.03%, it&#x27;s another entity that gets into the relationship and <i>changes</i> the social dynamics of the relationship.<p>Shut up, Economicus!<p>&gt; Then there’s bitcoins $10 fee or $100 if you factor in the socialized cost of block reward. (A better system doesn’t have to lie.)<p>Oh, did you see the part about Raiden, which uses layer-2 to bring near-zero-fee, instant transfers? Not to mention that if you are making transfers inside the hub, then the cost is <i>actually</i> zero?<p>P.S.: in case you want to argue Visa lets users get their money back. My response will involve Kleros [0] and how that can (will?) become a cheaper and more efficient system to settle disputes.<p>P.P.S: Do understand that you are trying to make an argument using quantitative issues when the whole reason you have so many people working on crypto is due to &quot;qualitative&quot; characteristics in the status quo that we want to change. You are arguing over the sound quality of the PSTN network while others are figuring out solutions to the problems that will lead them to building the Internet. Yeah, we know making a digital phone call over 9600 baud is kind of stupid when you are already have an AT&amp;T line. The point is that we want to get rid of AT&amp;T altogether.<p>The examples I gave &quot;could&#x27;ve been solved by some Visa offering&quot;? They could, but we want to get rid of Visa - or at least to have an alternative to it. Much like we want to have an alternative to governments that grow ever-larger and ever-less-successful in working for its people. Are the first implementations going to be objectively better than the status quo? No, of course not. <i>Can they be objectively better?</i> I don&#x27;t see why not, so why not work on it?<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kleros.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kleros.io&#x2F;</a>')
