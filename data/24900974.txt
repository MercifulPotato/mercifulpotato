In a small company, interviewing with your potential boss, I think being upfront and honest is worthwhile and a good litmus to see how they respond to that.<p>In a very large company where you are negotiating with a dedicated HR recruiter, it&#x27;s a very different process. They will never ever talk to you again after you sign on the dotted line, and have a very different, very narrow set of parameters to work within - and may indeed have expectations that go with that focused role: i.e. a team lead would expect you to be upfront and productive; but a car salesperson or a real estate salesperson would <i>expect</i> you to haggle and negotiate. Not saying I like that, or that I enjoy the prospect or process, but it benefits to be cognizant of the nature of process and expectations.')
