This is a must by now, since everyone who signs up will expect some sort of confirmation of their transaction.”<p>These emails invariably waste my time. They repeat what the website already told me when I signed up. If I sign up for your SaaS, I expect your site to tell me what I need to know about what I can and should do next. I don’t want an email.')
