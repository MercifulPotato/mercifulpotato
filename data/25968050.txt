Last time I checked their e2ee was still not quite ready to deserve that name[1]. is it a solved problem now and is crypto used in matrix now truly e2ee so that it can be comparaed to Signal. Maybe I&#x27;ve missed the research papers suggesting otherwise but it seems comparing Signal w. Matrix is <i>apples and oranges</i> (even when just talking about e2ee and ignoring the centralized&#x2F;federated aspects of the 2 technologies)<p>what is the actual state of matrix e2ee today? (or is that question silly because it depends what the individual matrix clients chooses to implement).<p>I&#x27;m extremely excited about having a federated e2ee messenger, however as a &quot;Lawful-Intercept&quot; realist, I don&#x27;t have a lot of hope that it will not get forced to comply with current EU regulation proposals, that prevents Matrix from fulfilling its promise as fully e2ee. (e.g. the future that we&#x27;re heading to in the EU is the same as 5&#x2F;9-eye countries: there will be a &quot;legal&quot; way of encryption and another one that is illegal, all depending if access can be given to 3rd parties &#x2F; LE...)<p>[1] (Sad) state of E2EE in Matrix clients (from 2018): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9avyen&#x2F;sad_state_of_e2ee_in_matrix_clients&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9avyen&#x2F;sad_state_o...</a>')
