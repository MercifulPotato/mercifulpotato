Or maybe history has given us enough analogies, even for this different age?<p>The same things that make the Asian peoples compliant with societal restrictions and &quot;big government&quot; might also leave them vulnerable to being led astray by those same governments, or tolerant of dictatorial actions.  (and not just singling out Asian cultures here -- any authority-respecting people)<p>The same traits that make Americans uncooperative with government mandates might be a great protection against unreasonable actions of a tyrant.  Or it could be a very bad weakness in a complex, connected economy.<p>After reading Jared Diamond&#x27;s idea about the nature of cultural traits in Guns Germs Steel (though he didn&#x27;t phrase it that way exactly), I think of that often when these things come up.  A country&#x27;s culture, ethos, political system (quite independent from individual behavior, as individuals quickly get absorbed into national behavior) determines a lot of how they survive or resist, or adapt.<p>The question is whether they have the right combination of traits to get them through the slew of challenges in aggregate, over time, that life throws at them randomly, to succeed in the long run.')
