They&#x27;re building factories around the world as fast as they possibly can to massively scale up how many cars they can produce each year.<p>Toyota produce the same number of cars they did 10 years ago, and their stock price is the same as it was 10 years ago. Yes, Toyota make an insane number of vehicles and make profit doing so, but chances are they&#x27;ll be doing basically the same thing 10 years from now.<p>The article says Tesla&#x27;s Revenue grew 28x in 10 years from 100M to 28B. The market is hoping&#x2F;predicting&#x2F;betting that will be the same in the next ten to roughly equal VW and Toyota at 280B by 2030. The ten years after that might see similar growth too..')
