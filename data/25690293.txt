It&#x27;s likely integer multiples (if not an entire order of magnitude) higher.<p>e.g., the replacement cost of a control board in my furnace is around $800, IIRC. I could probably build it for about $30 in parts (ignoring the software in the microcontroller). However, to someone who&#x27;s evaluating buying a new furnace vs. repair, that $800 is a hell of a lot cheaper than a new furnace.')
