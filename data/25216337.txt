At the same time, academia could be a dead-end too. Many schools stopped hiring new professors this year, and I don&#x27;t think things will get better at least for the next 4-5 years. Plus, there&#x27;s so much pressure from inside academia that sucks the joy out of any course I take or any research project I take on. Just in my program, 4 people have quit in the last 4 years due to the amount of ridiculous workload and expectations (the qualifier exams being the major one). So I&#x27;m thinking about options outside academia, but the greatest fear I have is most skills I&#x27;ve learnt are useful for research and an academic career. Has anyone here experienced quitting from a graduate program? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome those?')
