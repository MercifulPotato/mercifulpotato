I came here with idealistic notions of what Sweden was supposedly like (also encouraged by the myths perpetuated by many expat Swedes that I met), and became disillusioned with the reality pretty quickly.<p>Now I hate living here but it’s too difficult to leave with a Swedish wife and kids.<p>I’d say three-quarters of the people that I’ve known through the years who moved here like me, have left by now.<p>Also I wish people wouldn&#x27;t constantly be lumping together all the &#x27;Nordic&#x27; countries as though they were an interchangeable entity. They have similarities and share similar languages, but the cultural differences are much greater than outsiders appear to think.<p>In the case of &#x27;friluftsliv&#x27; the Norwegian concept is way more generally about hiking in the wilds. (Affluent) Swedes do often spend their summers in a cottage out in the country, but in my experience this involves a pretty static existence in rural surroundings, and physical activity is mostly restricted to going to whatever beach is nearby (either on the coast or an inland lake). I love walking or cycling in the countryside and I&#x27;ll rarely meet anyone doing the same unless they&#x27;re walking their dog close to their house.<p>When I was in Norway it seemed like way more people were interested in putting on a knapsack and heading deep into the forest.')
