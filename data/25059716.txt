We are a fintech company and the positives we have adopting it outweighs the negatives.<p>We use Lagom framework to implement CQRS+ES over Akka Actors and related technologies. There&#x27;s enough guardrails&#x2F;guides within the Lagom framework and documentations that it&#x27;s hard to screw up too badly. And IMO I think the different pieces fit together very nicely!<p>Overall the tradeoffs in system complexity vs scalability isn&#x27;t too shabby.')
