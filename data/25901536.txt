And your post is your bias showing through. That&#x27;s OK though. That&#x27;s how opinions work. A post on HN that isn&#x27;t a strict statement of fact is always going to be affected by the posters biases. Discussion forums simply couldn&#x27;t work otherwise.<p>Saying someone is biased is not a damning indictment of how terrible they are. It just means they&#x27;ve been affected by, and formed opinions based on, what has happened to them.<p><i>It&#x27;s also ridiculous to state that a crash wouldn&#x27;t impact their business.</i><p>If you just ignore the &quot;significantly&quot; bit, sure.')
