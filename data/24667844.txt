The pressure to be generally successful and support their immediate family is hard enough on anyone, but adding onto that the pressure to be able to care for your parents when they&#x27;re old is even worse.<p>I&#x27;m not saying people shouldn&#x27;t care for their parents, or that people shouldn&#x27;t live in multi-generational households, but humanity really needs to figure out how to care for our older members without requiring huge sacrifices from their children.  Some countries have mostly figured this out with strong social safety nets, but many... have not.  And beyond that, we shouldn&#x27;t have to rely on a social safety net.  Increasing income inequality makes it harder and harder for people to build enough wealth during their lives so they can retire comfortable, or even at all.')
