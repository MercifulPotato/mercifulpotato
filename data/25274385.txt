Who&#x27;s going to pay for all that when often existing ones are barely maintained?<p>Now cities could have more skyscrappers to house more people as well... but there is a lot of NIMBY involved as well, it&#x27;s a complex subject.<p>I&#x27;m not opposed to Airbnb as long as they are subject to the exact same standards and laws as hotels, in dedicated buildings for instance. Obviously, very little hosts would want that.<p>Airbnb&#x27;ing an appartement can drastically affect the quality of life for neighbors as well.')
