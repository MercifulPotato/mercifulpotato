I guess on Linux is can vary a lot more on the setup.<p>So yeah for Octave you need to know what Octave does with the data afterwards. If it&#x27;s saving a matrix to a PNG say, it could assume the matrix is linear and convert to sRGB which would be a good choice if it also supported say OpenEXR files. However it could also just take the values raw, assuming you&#x27;d convert the data to sRGB before saving. Or even allow you to specify the color space in the iCCP chunk, which would give you more power.<p>Again, what it actually does is something that needs to be looked up.')
