Also, gutting federal agencies like the EPA, silencing reports from national labs which were critical of the coal industry, and installing Dejoy as head of the Postal Service who immediately had mail equipment destroyed directly before an election which was known to most likely have large amounts of mail in ballots. Not to mention Dejoy has large stock in companies that would profit from the destruction of the Postal Service.<p>Edit: forgot to say numerous people close to him and his campaign have gone to jail. Steve Bannon, Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone...etc.')
