Flat chronological versus threaded versus a &quot;one-level nest&quot; model.  Upvoting, downvoting, flagging.  Being able to directly reply to someone.  Anonymous by default versus usernames versus sockpuppets versus anon-by-request-to-moderators versus &quot;tripcodes&quot; and so on.  Does sorting exist, and if so, what is the default?  And then the impact of upvotes and downvotes on that.  Up&#x2F;down versus favorites and bookmarks, favorites versus karma.  Everything2 and the long-vanished &quot;XP Pack Rape.&quot;  The ease of account creation versus the ease of duplicate account creation.<p>My suspicion is that, even more than moderators, nice FAQs, and such, these can influence the forum experience the most.')
