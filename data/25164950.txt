But if those boards are made in such small quantities that they&#x27;re being hand-stuffed, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see an errant resistor somewhere. Maybe the human pick&amp;place was distracted and picked from the wrong reel, or 100 resistors were dumped into a bulk tray and there was a 400ohm resistor on the bottom of that tray or any number of scenarios.<p>I&#x27;ve seen so many assembly errors in my time that I&#x27;m pretty sure it was something like this that happened.')
