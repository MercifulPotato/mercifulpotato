Because they use resources?  Well, it takes resources to fix things as well. \n Having kids would only be bad if they used more than they contributed.  Make them a net gain for society.  Raise them to be resourceful and educated and a force for good.  Doing that has a far greater benefit to our civilization and environment than not having any kids at all.  We need the next generation (and this one) to fight for the necessary changes.<p>If everyone who was worried about climate change made their contribution by not having kids, then the next generation is just going to be all kids raised by climate deniers.  If anyone should be having kids, it should be the ones who are worried about the future!')
