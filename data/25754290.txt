Then I manually &quot;clear&quot; the entries. Review. Commit. (You can also use a tag for reviewed transactions if you already use ledger&#x27;s &quot;cleared&quot; indicator for something else).<p>For the best results, I have 1 journal per bank account. So I have different training data for each bank account.<p>There&#x27;s no confidence threshold. When there is a new type of transaction is encountered, the guesser will chose the account with the highest probability.<p>The guesses are made based on the words found in the payee (and date). Unknown transaction have generally a few known tokens. Example: &quot;INCOMING TRANSFER FROM NEW_CLIENT&quot;... The classifier will probably classify that entry as &quot;Incomes:OurLargestClient&quot;. In that case I have just to fix that entry to change the client, all the rest is good, it still saves a good amount of typing.')
