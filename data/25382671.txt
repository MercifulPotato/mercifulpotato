That’s ok, we get value from plastics, so you’re right in that we can just better manage the plastic problem and have less of a problem. but the plastic problem, even if reduced, still scales with net plastic creation.<p>I can agree with you fully, and still think it’s a good idea to reduce plastic creation.<p>i’m curious why you don’t think it’s a reasonable value to also reduce plastics? if we tackle from both sides it’s even more effective.<p>(btw sorry i cannot give you what you want in terms of rigorous scientific proofs, i’m a philosophizer)')
