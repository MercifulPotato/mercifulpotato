Everything was all fine until the other day I did some cleaning on my desk and put my printer on the floor for 15 minutes. Since I put it back on my desk, it has been complaining that the cartridge is close to being empty, whereas it should be at about 70%. I removed the cartridge and put it back but nothing changed. In light of the post, it may be interesting if anyone else had a similar issue with either the original or the 3rd party cartridge.')
