Take reinforcement learning (RL) for example: the rewards are arbitrarily constrained to be real numbers (or rational numbers). But why? There is a rich variety of RL environments one can construct using non-real number reward systems, and there&#x27;s nothing special about the reals (or rationals) that suggests any connection to RL. The real numbers, recall, are the unique complete ordered field. What do complete ordered fields intrinsically have to do with reinforcement learning? Nothing, as far as I can tell (if there were some such connection, it would certainly be interesting to professors of real analysis).<p>As you point out, surreal numbers do a great job of tying together many different number systems, and that&#x27;s inherently appropriate for studying generalized reinforcement learning where rewards come from many different number systems.<p>I wrote a whole paper on this topic: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philpapers.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;ALETAT-12.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philpapers.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;ALETAT-12.pdf</a>')
