You can&#x27;t contract away criminal liability. If there were child porn found on a sub-reddit for instance, the executives are liable. So you have to work overtime to make sure that stuff isn&#x27;t on your servers. Or if it is, that you are reporting it in a timely fashion. A situation where a video with 10 views that was on your server for 1 day before you reported to law enforcement will be looked at very differently than dozens of videos, with thousands of views, that were all on your site for an average of 3 months before being reported to law enforcement.')
