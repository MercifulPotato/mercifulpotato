Item(by='unnouinceput', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601733750, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24671087, text='Bug reporting should be about facts, cold hard ones and not about feelings or comments. Stay on topic, explain what you did and if you also link to a video showing the bug occurring don&#x27;t comment during video. Just show the steps to reproduce it. Or if the bug happens on a particular architecture then also show that one as well and that should be the end of it. The developer needs info how to replicate it not reading a novel or entering a debate. I hate stuff like cheesy comments or mean ones. KISS is paramount in this case.')
