That meant use of the Firebase databases and splitting everything out into lots of microservices. Ironically this actually caused scaling issues (even with the very small scale we have at the moment) because the lack of query flexibility in the database meant downloading entire collections in order to provide the necessary functionality.<p>We&#x27;ve since moved (almost) everything over to postgres and merged a lot of the microservice together. And while we&#x27;re still running on heroku, we could probably run on Raspberry Pi if we needed to.')
