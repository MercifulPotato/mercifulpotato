Item(by='LeonenTheDK', descendants=None, kids=[25009705], score=None, time=1604684443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25003190, text='IMO part of the quality here is these docs are generated from comments in the code. All you have to do is document your functions and modules properly, run a command, and you have an entire set of docs.<p>It reminds me a lot of JavaDocs, although I never used them extensively. I&#x27;m also not very aware of how documentation looks in the Python world.<p>Another interesting thing is the code examples. You write them in the comments as &quot;Doc tests&quot;, and they are run and tested like normal tests. This means that all the code snippets are up to date with the latest version of the project (as long as you do test!).<p>The best part, also imo of course, is that it all works out of the box.')
