Stop focussing on the specifics of this case, that&#x27;s not relevant to my argument.<p>Seriously? You blame me for using the very example <i>you</i> brought up in the first place? Well, that&#x27;s a new low.<p>&gt; A shift in society. That is my point. Historically free speech was seen as an ideal to strive for. Now it&#x27;s considered a bad thing.<p>Again, <i>that&#x27;s not free speech</i>. Whether Twitter or Facebook or a random IRC channel lets you post there has nothing to do with free speech.<p>It has to do with their own internal policies, but they&#x27;re not the government, and never have been.<p>Freedom of expression includes the right to pornographic images, but that never stopped Apple and Google from banning such apps; they always had a number of different limits on their app stores. Sure, they&#x27;ve probably changed a bit over time. That...basically always happens with services, especially when they scale up. What works when you&#x27;re small doesn&#x27;t always work when you&#x27;re big.')
