Item(by='a_square_peg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607077851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298574, text='I think we&#x27;re increasingly losing the art of making and taking ownership of technical decisions that correspond to the level of the position and the job title. When the author says that &quot;technical skills have definitely sharpened up by practicing Hackerrank-style questions&quot;, I would actually say that senior engineers practising online problems would have added value no more than getting better at Sudoku. I&#x27;ve been frustrated by senior software engineers who have strong opinions and can talk hours about the choice of text editors but then magically disappear when it comes to making project-critical decisions with millions of dollars on the line.<p>I think this is reflected in the hiring process also - no one wants to be responsible for bad hire so it becomes a group-think exercise where each applicant has to get thumbs up from half-a-dozen interviewers. This will inevitably drive mediocrity and I&#x27;m sure this also structurally weeds out any candidate who can become a threat.')
