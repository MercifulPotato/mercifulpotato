Item(by='hairofadog', descendants=None, kids=[25922282], score=None, time=1611702038, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25920894, text='&gt; Clinton “won” the popular vote with a lower total percentage than Kerry lost the popular vote in 2004.<p>I sincerely don&#x27;t understand why &quot;won&quot; is in quotation marks – I <i>think</i> you meant to say &quot;the popular vote isn&#x27;t something that can be won since we have the electoral college&quot; – and if that&#x27;s the case, let me clarify that what I mean is that she received a significantly higher number of votes than Trump did.<p>&gt; The 2 point margin between Trump and Clinton was less than the margin between Bush and Kerry in 2004.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the point you&#x27;re making here.<p>&gt;&gt; There was ample evidence of the malfeasance being complained about in the 2016 election\n&gt; Not in 2017 there wasn’t.<p>Russian hacking was discussed prominently during the presidential debates in 2016, so I have to disagree with you on that point.<p>&gt;&gt; The people who complained of a &#x27;stolen&#x27; election in 2016 were pushing for reforms\n&gt; So were many of the people objecting to the 2020 election<p>That may be true, but I haven&#x27;t yet heard a good-faith argument for reforms (or in fact <i>any</i> argument for reforms) from people objecting to the 2020 election, nor any sense of what those reforms would be aside from things that could also be described as voter suppression and demands to reverse the outcome of the presidential, but not the down-ballot, elections. Maybe my sources are bad.')
