Not to mention that if the service is indeed critical, you&#x27;re not rolling out a deployment to every production server at once (or you&#x27;re low enough scale that it doesn&#x27;t matter). Either way, easy enough to roll back a bad deploy before things get hairy regardless of architecture.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure what kind of internal CRUD tools you&#x27;re writing, but &quot;malicious input&quot; doesn&#x27;t really seem likely to come from your coworkers.')
