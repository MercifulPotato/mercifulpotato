Yet seemly he still paid close attention to the company even after retiring.<p>Right now the children of the last CEO that theoretically own Nintendo biggest share block, but seemly nobody is sure of that, only information I found is that seemly one of them sold the shares to Nintendo itself (thus increasing the shares the other members had of Nintendo, percentage-wise).')
