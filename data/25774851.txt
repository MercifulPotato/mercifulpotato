I started with very low salary, and I’m about to start a new job in next month and be at the very top (7k euro net, monthly).<p>TBH I do not need that kind of money. I do it for new challenges that come with it. I live with my partner, we both had our higher education for free, we plan no children, and we both have 80k euro in our saving accounts.<p>Why would I need to earn more? I would prefer to pay more taxes so everything is growing more evenly - less poverty = less crimes, more happiness.<p>Just my $0.02')
