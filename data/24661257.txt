It increases developer time.<p>2. It increases the number of bugs of the system as it increases enormously the different possibilities.<p>We have systems that actually meta program with Lisp our hash tables with different degrees of complexities.<p>It is already programmed, the designs already debug. And even then for most of our hash tables we just use the minimum level of complexity, that is having a memory that is 10 to 20 times bigger than the elements on the hash and just have one or two collisions for the entire set.<p>That way the code is way easier to understand, and the memory differences are just negligible(compared to the total amount of memory the program needs), if sets are well designed.')
