I&#x27;ll speak with my youngest brother and ask him of his account has been restricted. If so... there needs to be an override of some sort. Blanket bans based on age are not the smart way of going about solving the problems TikTok faces. I don&#x27;t have a better solution, but I know this one makes me mildly uneasy.<p>For context, I&#x27;m a professional content creator whose main platform and audience is TikTok. I&#x27;m a legal adult now, but wasn&#x27;t when I started. There are a lot of mature 15 year olds using TikTok responsibly and creating great content--they shouldn&#x27;t need to lie about their age to continue doing that.')
