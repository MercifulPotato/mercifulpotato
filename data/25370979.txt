You can spend your life on YouTube watching cat videos, no conspiracy theory in sight. Nobody can force you to watch their video on YouTube. So nobody has a megaphone in YouTube. Only YouTube itself has the megaphone, they can choose what to push to people.<p>It is NOT TV where you have a single stream that everybody watched, and if you insert shit, everybody watches it.')
