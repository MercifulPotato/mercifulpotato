For a lot of kids and makers in developing countries dip packages and veroboard are the only economically feasible gateway to start to make electronics.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why everybody is struggling to accept this. Perhaps it is just a failure to appreciate the economic lottery of where in the world we are born.<p>To me it is sad that there are kids out there who would stop their curiousity just because of economic barriers, I hope AVR&#x27;s dip packages continue to be produced for a long time to come.')
