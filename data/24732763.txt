Item(by='mattivc', descendants=None, kids=[24734159, 24735090], score=None, time=1602267414, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24714990, text='I recently got a reMarkable 2 tablet( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;remarkable.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;remarkable-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;remarkable.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;remarkable-2</a> ), and I am absolutely loving it.<p>I have for along time carried around notebooks for note taking and journaling, because I felt the process of handwriting improve my experience of organizing my thoughts. But it was cumbersome and I ended up carrying multiple notebooks for different purposes.<p>Since I got the reMarkable 2 tablet it has replaced all my notebooks while retaining all the benefits of handwriting. With the added bonus of much easier organizing, backup and being able to view the notes on other devices.')
