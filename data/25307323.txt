It&#x27;s still worth washing your hands when you come home and take off your mask since it&#x27;s easy, but it&#x27;s not going to make much of a dent in the R0.<p>Other sort of masks actually do make a dent in R0.  A cloth or surgical mask doesn&#x27;t provide the level of protection a N95 mask does but they do seem to provide a protection factor of 2 or 3.  Nothing you could call safe but enough to reduce the R0 of the disease very significantly if everybody used them.')
