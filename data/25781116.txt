That is indeed very wrong, and the statement above is directly related to the insinuation I was responding to.<p>Please state your insinuations out loud. Then get fucked.<p>Edit:<p>&gt; <i>EDIT: Seems I can&#x27;t reply to Ori directly so here it is: No I&#x27;m not insinuating you&#x27;re a Nazi sympathizer. I wouldn&#x27;t. If I thought you were I&#x27;d come straight out with it.</i><p>Great. You&#x27;re implying something you don&#x27;t even claim to believe. Take some responsibility for your words.<p>If you think the accusations are &quot;ridiculous&quot;, why are you doing your best to amplify them?<p>You are being incredibly slimy.')
