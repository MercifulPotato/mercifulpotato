Software is a lot more open, without hard requirements for a degree and without oversight bodies. Maybe this is because it&#x27;s a much newer field, maybe it&#x27;s because the industry has been consistently growing for the past couple of decades and putting hard barriers to entry would have slowed down that growth. Whatever the reason is, I&#x27;m glad that we aren&#x27;t at accountant-level yet.')
