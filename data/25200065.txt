That said I wonder how the data is structured in their DB, how messy it is, how complicated a post can I make to foil their parsing.<p>There was a rumor back in college when we cared about social clout that the handful of people you see on the Friends list on your profile are the people who most recently&#x2F;frequently check your profile (i.e., viewing someone&#x27;s profile is already an interaction metric for FB). This trained me to <i>not</i> visit other people&#x27;s profiles. To this day (when that list is just &quot;most recent friends added&quot;), I visit profiles very rarely and only if there is really something I want to check.<p>It&#x27;s not so baseless either. Of course this might be some bias or another working but there was a time I fell behind certain commitments to a Dev Group I was helping organize and poof, the friends list on my profile started to show my co-organizers. Felt like they were checking on me, on why I&#x27;m behind my stuff, why I was taking time to echo replies. I was just busy; sorry it happens. :)')
