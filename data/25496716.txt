I didn&#x27;t exercise the options at the time (hindsight is 20-20).<p>The startup is doing well - it recently raised ~$300m at a ~$3b valuation, but my options expire in Dec 2023 and I&#x27;m growing increasingly concerned that they won&#x27;t have a liquidity event before then.<p>If I exercise my options before then it will be taxed as income which could leave me owing &gt;$100k in taxes to the IRS - but if the company hasn&#x27;t yet had a liquidity event then I can&#x27;t sell the options to pay that.<p>Seems like a ridiculous situation for early employees&#x2F;advisors to be placed in.')
