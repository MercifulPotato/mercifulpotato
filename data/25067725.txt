Blog post author here.<p>I agree that tests are super valuable for many things, but it isn&#x27;t enough here – at least not with the way my team writes tests.<p>(Our) tests wouldn&#x27;t catch unused CSS classes or i18n keys.<p>(Our) tests wouldn&#x27;t catch an unused method that is unit-tested. The unit test would happily pass because the unused method is still around and does what it should… in a vacuum.<p>Tests are great for catching live code that was incorrectly removed, but I&#x27;m not sure how they would help catch dead code that was incorrectly left in – but would love to hear more about it :)')
