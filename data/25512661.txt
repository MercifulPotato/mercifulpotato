And there would still be investors bringing some pressure. They also didn&#x27;t ask you if you agreed to run the business like a &quot;lifestyle business&quot;, they directly ask you to leave. That sounds like a made up excuse.<p>You probably can&#x27;t work together anymore now, but you both seem to think the business can be profitable, so if you decide to leave you should be compensated for what you built.<p>Don&#x27;t rush the decision.
