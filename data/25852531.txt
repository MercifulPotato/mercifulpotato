Pick any 6 random games on Steam and see if you find 2+ of them moderately enjoyable.<p>There really is just a lot of crap out there, and not everything is meant for everybody.  Also over time gaming has become more mainstream which means more people interested solely in money, a larger audience for more niche genres, as well as half-assed hobby projects since Steam Greenlight (which is now Steam Direct) have cropped up over time.<p>I get the gist of your argument and there&#x27;s something to be said for just trying something new and enjoying it.  But your argument is roughly equivalent to &quot;buy a plane ticket anywhere in the world and enjoy your 1 week vacation!&quot;  Chances are most people would prefer Paris, France to Paris, Texas.
