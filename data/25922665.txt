I think the frustration lies in part with an awareness that these problems exist, and that the system proceeds as if they don&#x27;t, and the way the problems manifest in public policy-type discussions is distorted (for instance, in the US, it tends to manifest in these anti-science versus pro-science positions, as if science is nobel and pure all the way down, or fraudulent and flawed all the way down).<p>Maybe it&#x27;s like that in every field, but it&#x27;s frustrating to see documentation of the problems, know that everyone knows about them at some level, but nothing is done about them, and everyone goes on as if the problems don&#x27;t exist. It&#x27;s going to take a lot of massive change, like at the level of congressional intervention or something, and once it does, there won&#x27;t be any restitution or anything. Everyone who benefited still benefits, there&#x27;s no correction, nothing.')
