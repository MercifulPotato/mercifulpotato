Pinterest uses rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; on external links, which severs any value the links have for SEO.”</i><p>I almost didn’t read the article when I saw your comment, but I’m glad I did.<p>You’ve misunderstood what he said. There are two ways to parse the quote you claim is false.<p>1. &quot;Pinterest as a source of inbound links [that enhance of your site’s rank on Google]&quot;<p>2. &quot;Pinterest as a source of inbound links [that delivers valuable traffic from a highly visible site like Pinterest]&quot;<p>The 1st interpretation is easy to arrive at if you are reading the article with a how do I improve my rank on the SERP?, aka SEO mindset.\nThis interpretation cares about improving domain authority.<p>The 2nd interpretation comes from a growth marketing mindset. Essentially, it seeks to answer a different question: how do I grow my referral traffic using well-placed pins on a high traffic site like Pinterest? This interpretation doesn’t care about domain authority, it cares about delivering more referral traffic to your website, increasing the likelihood of some of them converting into paying customers.<p>The article was clearly about the 2nd as is clearly evident from the last sentence of the section where the quote was lifted from:<p>“So, getting good at Pinterest doesn’t just help improve your Pinterest referral traffic, it can also improve your traffic from places like Google!”<p>This was an excellent article!')
