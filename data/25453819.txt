Not just because that episode is so emotionally devastating or because the review does justice to that and is emotionally devastating too, but because of this bit:<p>&gt; I said “Jurassic Park” is manipulative, and I stand by that; the way the episode exploits its flashback structure to build to the most devastating possible conclusion is about as subtle as that Sarah McLachlan SPCA ad. Acknowledging this isn’t the same as criticizing it, though. Manipulation fails when it becomes noticeable, and when the audience resents the efforts made to drive them towards certain feelings. [...] Clumsy manipulation reveals a certain unearned arrogance, even contempt; look how easy it was for me to trick you, how vulnerable you are to control. This episode is more about empathy, and that ending — that uncompromising, agonizing ending — has no contempt in it. Just the knowledge that these things happen, and that we have to live with them.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tv.avclub.com&#x2F;futurama-jurassic-bark-crimes-of-the-hot-1798184247" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tv.avclub.com&#x2F;futurama-jurassic-bark-crimes-of-the-h...</a>')
