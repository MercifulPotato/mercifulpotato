And either I got stuff already on my bookshelf or sphere of reference[2], or a lot of Calvin and Hobbes (seriously every result had at least one, sometimes several), or children’s books, or adult comic books. Which I guess is by some definition the opposite of adult novels. But a fun and interesting tool to play around with either way.<p>[1] Underworld, Blood Meridian, The Bluest Eye, Milkman, Pale Fire, Borges, etc...<p>[2] Chekhov, Ursula Le Guin,  Proust, Umberto Eco, etc.<p>Edit: I scrolled down and read the creators summary of how the search works. And now believe my results really nailed his description: rarest but highly rated by readers of the same books. Which also explains all the Calvin and Hobbes, which I think have a universal appeal.')
