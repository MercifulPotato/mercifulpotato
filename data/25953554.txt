My main goal is going to be just to read pdfs&#x2F;ebooks on it, though note taking will be nice I&#x27;m torn between ReMarkable 2 and Onyxx Boox Note Air&#x2F;3 (sadly I don&#x27;t think I can justify the Lumi). Do any of y&#x27;all have experience with either&#x2F;both? Is there a different brand y&#x27;all&#x27;d recommend?<p>Really, all I want is e-ink, frontlighting and some good battery life.')
