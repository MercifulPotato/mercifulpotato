Item(by='bfgoodrich', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607370470, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25336079, text='I stated a general sentiment of the trends in web development, where there is an <i>extraordinary</i> amount of work to effectively reinvent the wheel, and then to uninvent the wheel and herald why using a cube is superior, until eventually you herald the wheel again. It&#x27;s bizarre.<p>The work product of teams chasing each of these innovations is virtually unchanged, decade over decade. Which is exactly why you see a circular procession of revolutions, each displacing the last to the dustbin of history, while empirically offering nothing unique.<p>Clearly there are a lot of people that empathize with it. There is nothing &quot;baseless&quot; about that, however uncomfortable some find it.<p>Bizarre that you claimed that my comment was an &quot;ad hominem&quot;, when your own reply included multiple personal attacks and mine included none. They (you?) <i>literally</i> tried to discount my comment by contriving a strawman that if this application and management of CSS is trivial, therefore I&#x27;m saying that design is trivial. That is absurd, and is completely orthogonal.')
