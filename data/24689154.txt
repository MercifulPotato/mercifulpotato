Some of the language in this article is kind of demonstrative of this.<p>&quot;* This method of conservation aims to let large areas of land return to wilderness â€“ in other words, a state of zero human intervention.*&quot;<p>This is quite clearly hopelessly idealistic. Robust ecosystems that sustain macrofauna are achievable (and necessary, IMO) but &quot;untouched&quot; is not. That sort of idealism is not a problem, but it does set up some issues in terms of getting everyone on board.<p>Large grazers, bears, wolves, even lynx come into conflict with humans. This is reality. That conflict can be managed and mitigated such that we coexist, but we need to develop a models and cultures that allow this. Scottish farmers don&#x27;t want wolves. They&#x27;re not going to come on board with a naive effort. Even lynx are a tough sell, but it&#x27;s a better place to start than wolves.<p>I&#x27;m actually optimistic though. Despite some naive gaffs (especially in the UK &amp; Germany), there&#x27;s a genuine public interest growing. Birds of prey are back. Cyanide is a cultural faux pas.<p>We should look east and west for ideas. Eastern Europe, and obviously Russia have a continuous culture of coexisting with large and potentially dangerous animals.  Americans and Canadians have had some great successes reversing exterpations.<p>George Monbiot has been very influential, and I like his book, but he is a hard liner. He draws heavily on the Yellowstone wolf reintroduction. That&#x27;s a fine example, but I think it has led to an overly idealistic perspective. A large, pristine and remote park isn&#x27;t the only way and its probably unrealistic in most of western europe.')
