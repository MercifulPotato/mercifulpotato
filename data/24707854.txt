No explanation required. I was thinking there wasn&#x27;t much of an IPC increase over the last half dozen years or so, but there&#x27;s absolutely been one over that long.  Though really it&#x27;s funny how little it&#x27;s still increased - in 1996 we were just getting Pentiums at 150 MHz, and I don&#x27;t think anyone would argue those are anywhere near comparable.')
