A society that doesn&#x27;t police itself is anarchy, and that really isn&#x27;t helpful for any civil discussion or learning. While there should be no rules in private between friends etc, public forums need restrictions in order to have some level of functionality without descending into flamewars.<p>The hill I&#x27;d really worry about with free speech is when punk hacker types turn on encryption, the current ultimate guard ensuring free speech.<p>Edit note: I&#x27;m not pro the twitter blocking of the article, especially not in DMs as some have noted is occurring. I&#x27;m just slightly disillusioned to unlimited speech on the internet superhighway thanks to trolls, flamebaiters, frauds, and more.')
