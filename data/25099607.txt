I might be willing to spend ~1K on this but only if it exactly fits my needs, and even within just my current residence the window sizes and ceiling heights are dramatically different from room to room.<p>Speaking of which they should offer an ORI configuration where the back office wall is open to an exterior window so that it is more suitable for a corner room with two exterior walls.')
