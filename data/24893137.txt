Item(by='comex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603690992, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889048, text='The email didn&#x27;t say &quot;thanks for the meeting with your father&quot;; it thanked Hunter for &quot;inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father&quot;, wording that leaves it ambiguous whether the meeting had already occurred or was in the future.  This is important because, even if it is authentic, it does not necessarily contradict Biden&#x27;s claim that (according to his schedules) no such meeting occurred.')
