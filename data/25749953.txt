Absolutely call those people terrorists.  But, as boredumb said, don&#x27;t call half the country that just because they voted for Trump.  They aren&#x27;t.  (In the exact same way as you don&#x27;t call all BLM supporters terrorists or vandals because of the actions that happened at some of their protests.)<p>There&#x27;s an extreme fringe.  Don&#x27;t identify the mainstream of the same movement with the fringe.')
