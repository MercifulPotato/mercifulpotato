Having different forms of declaring literals, in my eyes simply &quot;litters&quot; the language.<p>What Arturo does instead is use simple strings... And the interpreter internally tries to make out what they are automatically.<p>For example: the &#x27;do&#x27; function can take pretty much anything. If it is a block, it executes it. If it is a string, it executes it too - but depending on what it is. If it is a url, it executes the remote script. If it&#x27;s a local file, it executes the file. If it&#x27;s Arturo code, it executes it as Arturo code.<p>The interpreter identifies what it is automatically. Why have different data types for that, pre-built in the language?')
