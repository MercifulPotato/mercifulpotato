Every new evolutionary competition edge a species receives is followed by an &quot;invasion&quot; phase where their newfound superpower allows them to take over for a few hundred thousand generations.<p>&gt; If taking a species to a different island where it is not native to is bad enough, creating specific ones which have never existed anywhere ever is a major ecological disaster waiting to happen. This should not even be a discussion...<p>Actually, it should be a discussion, because the above argument is a false analogy. Invasive species are problematic because the surrounding ecosystem cannot curb their spread and out-competition of preexisting species. Modern crops don&#x27;t have the capability of surviving outside of a human cultivated environment. Left to their own, they&#x27;d be choked out by weeds and changing soil conditions. Now if someone were to attempt to make a weed-proof AND bug-proof crop that can ALSO survive and thrive in non-cultivated terrain, THEN I&#x27;d be worried.')
