Is there even a legal expectation that there <i>aren&#x27;t</i> cameras doing this kind of thing all the time? In most places in the US I know there isn&#x27;t a right to privacy within a public space. If I as a shop owner put up security cameras in this same fashion in most of the US this wouldn&#x27;t be against the law.
