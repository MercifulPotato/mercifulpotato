For example, the Konqueror web browser exposed functions to open tabs, navigate to URLs... instant messaging applications allowed you to query your contacts&#x27; online status, send a message, the music player would let you control the playlist, etc.<p>It then (IIRC 15 years ago) became deprecated in favor of DBUS, but I remember it was not as straightforward and simple to use as DCOP was, and also the applications, at least by the time, weren&#x27;t supporting lots of useful operations with DBUS.')
