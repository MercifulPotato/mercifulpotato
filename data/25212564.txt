Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[25212959], score=None, time=1606329279, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25210956, text='&gt; The reality is most political conservatives align with immoral and&#x2F;or factually incorrect ideas, therefore they&#x27;re rejected and filtered out because they attract anti-intellectuals that you can find on any youtube comments section about the coronavirus.<p>I think it is important to note that there is nothing inherent in conservatism that leads to this. Conservatives are not dumber or more gullible than liberals.<p>It is just an accident of timing that has resulted in conservatives <i>currently</i> being more likely to fall for such stuff. With just one change 12 years ago, it would be liberals far more than conservatives embracing fact-free conspiracy theories today. In another few years, it may go the other way.<p>Social media got big enough that a lot of people started getting most of their news that way. More and more people stopped noticing the difference between actual news items in the feed, sponsored items in the feed, opinion pieces in their feed, comments on stories the haven&#x27;t seen from friends, and satire in their feed.<p>Two things arose to take advantage of this.<p>One was governments. They started state sponsored operations that made fake accounts to post material on the social media of countries they were not friendly with.<p>The other was content farms that generated a bunch of low quality content cheaply, and make money from ads.<p>Both of these concentrated on content that would be divisive. For the state sponsored material, governments know that just posting a bunch of stuff that extols their government or directly attacks US policies against their government would not help them. That would be caught and called out.<p>By concentrating on things that would be divisive they hoped to at least distract the US government by making it have to devote more time to dealing with domestic issues.<p>For the content farms making money from ads, divisive content gets more eyeballs which means for ad revenue.<p>This started seriously happening during the Obama administration, and so the foreign governments and content farms pushed material aimed at encouraging conservative conspiracy theories because Obama was a liberal.<p>If McCain had won in 2008, it would have been liberal conspiracy theories that got pushed.')
