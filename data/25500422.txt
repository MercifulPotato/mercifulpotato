You will never have a verbal conversation on any issue of interpretation that will convince someone with facts outside of a courtroom or an conference room...period.  You <i>can</i> have a written exchange that is fact-based and that may address the impact such ideas have on those you both care about.<p>Who knows, maybe they have a good point or two.  And you probably do too.  If you get past two online exchanges and are both interested, then maybe a verbal conversation in order.  Or just agree to disagree.  You <i>will</i> have more information as to whether this will ever affect those you both care about.<p>If it’s a family get-together in a formal setting, say a dinner table, you can remind everyone about the ban on discussing money, politics and religion.  You do <i>have</i> such a ban, I assume.  Take out the air horn that you carry for such occasions and place it prominently on the table.  Start the conversation with something like “So, did you hear the Pope was caught shoplifting the book <i>How to Hack Voting Machines for Fun and Profit</i>” to lighten the mood and then ask a question to get the conversation on family matters..a new baby is always a go-to.<p>Keep the air horn out unless Grandma or a thundering herd of aunts ask you to put it away.  Believe me, everyone will appreciate your gesture.  It’s jokey and serious enough to be effective.  Depending on the family, maybe silly string would work, but it might get on the turkey.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Silly_String" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Silly_String</a>')
