In laptops, 4 cores are now standard, and if you can gen one of the AMD 4000U CPUs, 8 cores with good single-threaded performance are relatively cheap. Same thing on desktop, you can get 20%+ more performance by upgrading the CPU.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s not the same as 486 vs Pentium, but the Ivy Bridge-era CPUs that were used for such a long time are now equivalent to low-end CPUs, it&#x27;s no longer universally better to get an old i7 vs a new i5. That said, if you&#x27;re happy, there&#x27;s no reason to upgrade.')
