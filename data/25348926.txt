Item(by='yetanotherjosh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607450198, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25327413, text='&gt; you should do things uniformly, since the linked list has a uniform structure<p>Except that it actually isn&#x27;t uniform, is it? A linked list has three kinds of nodes: the first node (to which nothing points), the middle nodes, and the last node (whose next pointer is null). Nulls vs populated values really do change the shape of data. Any code to handle a list needs to be well aware of those three cases, even if there&#x27;s no IF statement for them. I would argue that having code that is organized around these actual differences is better than trying to normalize those differences into a single thing, at which point those meaningful differences risk being overlooked in code maintenance. At a minimum, this kind of code needs to really clearly explain why it is doing what it&#x27;s doing in comments, and how the multiple cases are handled in the streamlined solution.')
