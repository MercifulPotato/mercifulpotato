I believe you can select the OS on Lenovo&#x27;s website while placing an order. So you can hit the ground running with Linux.<p>Alternatively Dell XPS offers Ubuntu out of the box as well. But I prefer Thinkpads since XPS has only USB-C ports like the Macbook, requiring you to carry a dongle around.')
