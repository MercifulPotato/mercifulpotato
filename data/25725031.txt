Item(by='Silhouette', descendants=None, kids=[25725487], score=None, time=1610343590, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25723812, text='The thing is, I don&#x27;t think the complexity is even close to the same in the two cases.<p>AWS and similar services are an abstraction over hardware, software and networking all at once. There are well over 100 different services available on AWS alone. Just to get a basic configuration up and running, someone new to the system has to figure out which of those services they actually need, which is a barrier in itself given the obfuscated names they have.<p>Then you have much the same network and security details to set up as you would have for on-prem or colo infrastructure, but now with lots of non-standard terminology and proprietary UIs, which are so cumbersome at times that an entire generation of overcomplicated &quot;orchestration&quot; tools has been developed, each of which typically adds yet another layer of leaky abstraction.<p>Hopefully some time before this all happened you tried to work out what it was going to cost, and maybe you were close or maybe you are in for a nasty surprise because those handy managed services cost several times what the equivalent server + software would have cost either running on real servers or just on cloud VMs.<p>And if you fall back to that latter case as your safe default, you still get all the same issues to deal with as you would have had on your own servers and network, except that now you need to figure out what is really going on behind all those virtualised systems and quasi-geographical organisation layers before you can tell whether one unfortunate event could take down all the instances of any vital services you need.<p>In comparison, literally every small business I have ever worked in as a tech worker has had several people at the office who were perfectly capable of buying a switch or firewall or router and spending the few minutes required to configure it or buying a server and installing Linux&#x2F;Windows and then whatever server software it needed again very quickly. Cloud systems can make it faster to deploy new hardware and connectivity, because you save the time required for all the physical steps, but after that the time and knowledge required to get a small network&#x27;s worth of equipment up and running really isn&#x27;t that great. After all, we used to do that all the time until the cloud hype to hold, and it&#x27;s not as if that has suddenly stopped working or all the people with that knowledge suddenly left the industry in the past 5 years.')
