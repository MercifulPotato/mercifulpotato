Getting people in one place, explaining and enforcing the rules, collecting member info, and interacting in a scalable personalized way takes a huge amount of time.&quot;<p>If the landing page could make me feel that and show me how you solve those problems, and why discord or slack won&#x27;t, I&#x27;d be more convinced.<p>Would be good to know who it&#x27;s for. Do I get my existing community and move it over to you because I&#x27;m fed up of Slack. I come with a laundry list of pains. I have the people I just want to have an easier job moderating?<p>Or for a newbie to building a community that has no members yet who wants to find their audience. My problem is how to I get people to find me, what do I set up to make it entertaining and keep them coming back, etc.')
