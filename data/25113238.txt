The issue with HIV is that it&#x27;s a retrovirus. It uses both reverse transcription and inscription enzymes to change your DNA.<p>A vaccine works to stimulate your immune system&#x27;s &quot;memory&quot; that&#x27;s evolved for treating infections. (That can be anti-bodies, but it&#x27;s more complex .. also involves memory T-cells, the complement system, etc.)<p>When the same virus comes it, it will infect cells, but your body is much more prepared to handle it. The trouble with HIV is that it&#x27;s the initial infection that can slowly inactivate an immune system over 2~5 years (not everyone though. Some people have HIV and never develop AIDS; known as Long Term Non-Progressives).<p>A vaccine wouldn&#x27;t help at all with HIV. Keep in mind, the HIV rapid test checks for the presence of antibodies.')
