There are three main ideas as to why language-learning ability declines at 18: social changes, interference from oneâ€™s primary language and continuing brain development. At 18, kids typically graduate high school and go on to start college or enter the work force full-time. Once they do, they may no longer have the time, opportunity or learning environment to study a second language like they did when they were younger. Alternatively, it is possible that after one masters a first language, its rules interfere with the ability to learn a second. Finally, changes in the brain that continue during the late teens and early 20s may somehow make learning harder.</i><p>Learning a language is like learning the violin, it&#x27;s a &quot;10,000 hours&quot; thing and there&#x27;s just no way around it.<p>Interference from your primary language is merely a minor issue and easily overcome if you want to. It does take some extra effort, but it doesn&#x27;t prevent you at all.<p>And the idea that your brain changes, I just don&#x27;t buy. Otherwise I don&#x27;t believe I could have become totally, 100% fluent. Because I was terrible at languages in classes at school. But in Brazil, I literally felt like a child again, learning to speak and communicate for the first time. It was a feeling my brain hadn&#x27;t had since I was 3, 4, 5 years old. All the abilities to pick up a new language were still there, intact 100%.<p>But it&#x27;s true, unless you&#x27;re spending <i>all day long</i> in the language, you&#x27;re not going to get the hours in. Of my ex-pat friends in Brazil, the only ones who became truly fluent in Portuguese were either doing their PhD there (totally immersed) or their day job was in English but they had a Brazilian boyfriend&#x2F;girlfriend who didn&#x27;t speak English -- and in both cases, it still takes 2-5 years.')
