Are you also afraid of repercussions inside your own country if you call them out?<p>I am, regularly and to anyone that will listen. And no, I live in a western democracy, so I&#x27;m not afraid of the repercussions here for doing so. Please stop your unfounded ad hominem attacks. But for the moment I would like to avoid this whataboutism - if a thread pops up criticizing the transgressions of the US rather than Russia, such as is the topic of this one, then I&#x27;ll gladly participate there too.')
