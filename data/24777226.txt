Item(by='UncleMeat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602687536, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24774762, text='&gt; Instead of having to get one person, who knew literature, to believe in his work, an author has to convince a whole committee of people.<p>I think that the &quot;one person who knew literature&quot; system is largely a myth. People who &quot;know literature&quot; often resort to promoting the same canon and authors of the same background. I&#x27;d wager that a random lottery would produce a more interesting, dynamic, and varied list of books than one curated by a single expert.<p>If you truly want unrestrained creativity, then organizations like NEA need orders of magnitude more funding so they can throw cash at people trying to make something new. That will produce wild, interesting, and experimental works. But it won&#x27;t produce Mad Men or other kinds of works that promote polish over boundless creativity. It is a trade off.')
