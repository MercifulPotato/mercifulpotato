I take that as an example of accidental imbalance though, not deliberate game design. I seem to recall the developers even saying something like &quot;yeah, we realized it was broken, but thought it was funny&quot; (not a direct quote.<p>I guess my viewpoint assumes that gameplay is legitimately &amp; deliberately balanced. I suppose this is much harder in videogames with game characters having different skill sets. It&#x27;s much harder to evaluate whether or not there is balance between them than, say, Monopoly: Everyone starts the same there-- the dog isn&#x27;t any better off than the thimble. (Though I usually play as the dog, and pretend the thimble is a fire hydrant as I pass it by &amp; do what dogs do... I may not be very mature for my age. It makes my kids laugh though)')
