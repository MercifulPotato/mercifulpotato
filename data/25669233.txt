You can turn down the refresh rate, to say 10Hz or something, but it still has to use the discrete GPU. The cooling solution simply isn&#x27;t handled to deal with it, as they have crammed as much processing power they can into the ultra-light chassis.<p>Meanwhile you can play World of Warcraft whilst drawing just 25W of power TOTAL on the M1 (estimate, I don&#x27;t play WoW anymore). This is while the Intel Mac is drawing 70-100 Watts from the socket for just rendering a window to the secondary display.<p>It&#x27;s got to the stage that I prefer to use my 13 inch M1 over a top of the line 16 inch provided by work. When M1 finally supports docker, I might even consider not using the 16 inch at all. It crashes due to thermals about twice a week due to the constant high temperature and eats through batteries!<p>If anyone has a solution to this, I&#x27;m all ears, but it feels like every nay-sayer of the M1 is dismissing just how many compromises Intel based laptops (not just Macs) have. I had just as many issues with the Dell XPS, where even basic video games would become unplayable after 15 minutes due to CPU throttling down to 0.8 Ghz.<p>The M1 has been the first laptop I have been truly happy with as a desktop user.')
