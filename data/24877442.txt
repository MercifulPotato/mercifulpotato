But with this move I&#x27;ll be switching over to an Apple One subscription once available later in the year.<p>Google Play is simple, clean with syncing that just works everywhere I need to access it with a simple checkmark to specify which playlists I want downloaded that worked well in offline mode. Now I&#x27;m being forced into using a new music web, mobile &amp; car play apps which prioritizes music videos? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>I don&#x27;t know which bean counters are responsible for this decision but I can&#x27;t imagine the cost of maintaining a skeleton crew to upkeep a frozen service would be more than the irreparable harm done to its millions of customers being forced to a use a service they don&#x27;t want to, who&#x27;ll be using it as an inflection point for deciding which Service they&#x27;d prefer to use instead.<p>I&#x27;ll still be keeping the ad-free YouTube for the near future, but it went from being indispensable to being the next subscription on the chopping block if my time on YouTube wanes further. I&#x27;m already spending more of my time on Twitch, that if the move to Apple Music is well received by the family I&#x27;ll be leaving Google Play entirely over this.<p>You can also bet my trust for investing in using new Google services is also shot at this point, I&#x27;d rather put my time and resources into a customer focused alternative than the disregard Google has shown its long time customers, time and again.')
