Generously, one could call it barely documented; the majority of the useful and correct documentation I found was on Mesa contributors&#x27; blogs, and there were still edge cases in the API that were getting ironed out in the 5.9 kernel release.<p>I haven&#x27;t needed to write against EGLStreams, but I might give it a try to see if it&#x27;s as much of a pain or not; from the 1-page overview on the nvidia docs, I suspect not -- it sounds quite similar to the VK_KHR_swapchain extension.')
