Very likely the dev had that pattern down as a reflex. There was no consideration on their part because they already knew a solution that worked. They could move on to the other problems or requirements.<p>As another poster elsewhere said, the annoying thing is only the single implementation for the interfaces, and no real code that makes use of the abstraction. It only really alleviates other devs from asking &quot;where are the interfaces for these classes?&quot;')
