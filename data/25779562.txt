Item(by='medium_burrito', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610646731, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25778635, text='Exactly, there is a massive amount of money, and tons of fear.<p>There has been an epic increase in gun, ammo and armor sales this year to people of all political persuasions. Gun folks are bad with this anyways due to the political cycle and ammo shortages and bans of various types of items, but there is a genuine shortage where people who are afraid of riots and violence in their cities across the US have been buying up anything and everything.<p>Not every city got looted, but a lot of major downtown areas did, and the police in a number of cities are going through real attrition, to the point where a lot of crime will just not be dealt with. Not to mention it will be extremely difficult to hire more police officers after they spend a year demonizing them and forcing them to deal with riots that they effectively are not allowed to stop (especially Seattle- where I live- and Portland).<p>Now, I have a different theory with a lot of the tactical shit. I think a huge amount of it it is hypebeast&#x2F;instagram-driven fashion for a large segment of young American men with disposable incomes and no bars and sports open. Cosplay, if you will- and it&#x27;s openly admitted.<p>PS: Assholes who are buying all the .22LR, please stop&#x2F;go for a different caliber. Some of us like target shooting and want to continue our hobby.')
