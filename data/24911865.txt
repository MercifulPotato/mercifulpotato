Copying a comment from reddit:<p>&gt; PD has certain charging ‘profiles’.<p>&gt; For example Apples 30W USB-C charger can work at:<p>&gt; 15 watts (5 volts @ 3 amps), 27 watts (9 volts @ 3 amps), 30 watts (15 volts @ 2 amps), and 30 watts (20 volts @ 1.5 amps)<p>&gt; The MagSafe puck supports none of those for some reason. So it drops down to ~5W which is a safe backup amount for most devices.<p>&gt; The new 20W charger appears to have a new profile it supports for the full 20W, which so far seems to be unique to that charger + MagSafe combo. It’s... messy.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleinsider.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20&#x2F;10&#x2F;27&#x2F;magsafe-15w-fast-charging-restricted-to-apple-20w-adapter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleinsider.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20&#x2F;10&#x2F;27&#x2F;magsafe-15w-fast-...</a>')
