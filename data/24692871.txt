If you pick a good starting point (big market, competitive differentiators, etc.), and spend years at it, you&#x27;re bound to have some success. Just due to the sheer fact that you&#x27;re willing to commit more of your lifetime to solving that problem than anyone else is. That&#x27;s what worked for us at least<p>This is what my thinking has shifted to as well. Play long term games instead of trying to make a quick buck.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to do something very innovative, I understand why the lean startup method is advised so you don&#x27;t waste a lot of time. But if you&#x27;re going into an existing market, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the best approach.')
