Item(by='awb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604605789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25000367, text='Yes, some states had big polling errors, while others like GA and AZ were reasonably accurate. But the model doesn&#x27;t care if the polls are off in FL by 0.1% or 10% because it&#x27;s a winner take all scenario. So while large polling errors are surprising, they have the same exact impact as a small polling error in a close race, which isn&#x27;t surprising. But people like to cherry pick and say &quot;how did you get X so wrong?&quot; rather than &quot;how did you get X&#x2F;10 so right?&quot; In fact, Trump might only end up winning 3 &quot;upsets&quot;: FL, NC and ME-2, but they were all under 2% difference in the polls, so no one is shocked to see Trump win there. WI and MI would have been much bigger upsets, but that didn&#x27;t end up happening and a 20k vote win is as good as a 2M vote win in the EC.<p>The 10% odds come from the path to 270. Here are the 9 states &#x2F; districts that polled within 2% pre-election (considered toss ups): NE-2, AZ, FL, NC, ME-2, GA, OH, IA, TX. Even if Trump won all of those, he wouldn&#x27;t get to 270. Using 50&#x2F;50 odds for all 9 toss ups, Trump only gets a clean sweep 11% of the time. He would then still need another state like PA, WI or MI to get to 270. That&#x27;s why Silver said that Biden&#x27;s chances are so high, specifically because Biden could overcome a 2016-level polling error in every toss-up state and still win. In fact we saw 2016-level polling errors in some battleground states, but not all.<p>Another way to view it, is you have a 1&#x2F;6 (16%) chance of rolling a 1 on a 6-sided die. Even if all 53 states and districts were projected at 84% confidence, and rolling a 1 meant &quot;upset&quot; and rolling 2-6 meant &quot;polls were accurate&quot;, you&#x27;d end up with 8-9 states resulting in upsets! 84% confidence still means a lot of surprises. Their final FL prediction was only 69% confidence. Also, confidence intervals aren&#x27;t linear, meaning that a 95% confidence anticipates <i>half</i> as many upsets as a 90% confidence interval. That +5% means -50% upsets, so 69 or 84% confidence is really not as sure a thing as it might sound.<p>So, yes it&#x27;s worth re-examining why polling was very accurate in AZ &amp; GA but very off in TX &amp; FL (specifically Latino&#x27;s in Miami). But a 10% chance was not crazy IMO given how easy it was for Biden to overcome even huge polling &#x2F; vote disparities in multiple states and still win.<p>Again, those who disagree are free to get great odds in the betting markets.')
