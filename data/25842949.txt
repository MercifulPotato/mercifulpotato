Item(by='snoshy', descendants=None, kids=[25843000, 25843138], score=None, time=1611121658, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25842628, text='This entire saga is both typical and odd in that it has elements of truth that have been exaggerated by all sides involved.<p>It&#x27;s typical in that high level leaders in China that don&#x27;t follow the party line just-quite-closely-enough risk major consequences.  It&#x27;s also typical that in order to get to such a level of influence, a high level leader in China clearly understands the stakes and proposition at hand.  It&#x27;s further also clear that given the lack of meaningful options, any such leader would be forced to stay within the boundaries.<p>What&#x27;s odd about this is that Jack Ma clearly must understand the consequences of what he said to regulators that day [1].  It&#x27;s also odd that he misjudged their response so drastically.  He clearly didn&#x27;t spend all of this time building the empire that is Ant without having regularly seeing reactions from individuals of this body and even more powerful figures.<p>That a lot of Ant&#x27;s fundamentals in financial health were questionable isn&#x27;t really widely disputed as far as I can tell.  The stated goals were optimistic but admirable as well: give loans to literally the guy on the street that needs it most and use data to figure out if you made the wrong choice en masse.<p>But regulators appeared to be onboard right up until this public moment.  So why now?  What was at stake when all appeared to be smooth sailing already?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ULORUT2Ckw4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ULORUT2Ckw4</a>')
