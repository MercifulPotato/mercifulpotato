In some cases it&#x27;s justified for obvious reasons: rough environments with less infrastructure (bush, outback..). In other cases it is for softer reasons: a big camping culture, having a big car being a social status, towing your boat&#x2F;jet ski etc.<p>Also a few other points to consider:<p>_ Australia enjoyed economic growth for a long time and Australians are rich.<p>_ Fuel is cheap. According to www.globalpetrolprices.com right now a liter of gasoline is 0.74 euros compared to 1.33 for France<p>_ The road infrastructure is more favourable for big cars than in Europe (big&#x2F;plenty parking spots in most towns in Australia).')
