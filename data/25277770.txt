Item(by='ageofwant', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606925755, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25277463, text='Most all modern agricultural produce are modified way beyond &quot;natural&quot;. There is very little &#x27;natural&#x27; about a plowed and fertilized field. And the produce being grown there has been selected and modified and optimised way beyond what you would find in nature in reaction to &#x27;natural&#x27; selection bevery and pest pressure. So &#x27;lab meat&#x27; is just progression on this. Dunno why you would arbitrarily skip fad &#x27;lab-meat&#x27; but the rest, which is as &#x27;natural&#x27; as that is ok...<p>Dunno, seems stupid to me.')
