For one thing, tactics and calculation for sure will be varying considerably between players of different skill levels.  For me, it can take forever to calculate 3 moves ahead because I lose my place as I go.  I think for good players, they can see it almost instantly, subconsciously.  And I think that is where the chess prodigy comes in.  From the beginning, the chess prodigy probably gets their subconscious in tune with moving the pieces and can see tactics and N moves ahead almost instantly.  I&#x27;m curious to see how much better that gets for me over time.  If I practice a bit every day, how fast will my calculation get?  It&#x27;s probably logarithmic but still... Anyone have experience getting good (~1700 or &gt;) as an adult?')
