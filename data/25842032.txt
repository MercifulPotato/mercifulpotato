Few people are idiots. Most people are just as smart as you are.<p>More likely, these people fundamentally aren&#x27;t looking at the situation like you are. Probably, they don&#x27;t care what you, or the police, or the FBI, or anyone else, think about what they&#x27;re doing and don&#x27;t care how they&#x27;re being tracked.<p>They don&#x27;t feel the need to hide.<p>It&#x27;s comforting to think &#x27;nah they must be idiots&#x27; for not hiding... but maybe more concerning to realise they could be right about not needing to hide.')
