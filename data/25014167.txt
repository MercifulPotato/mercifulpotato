If you buy a computer with Windows it is completely normal that you still get your updates from Microsoft, even if your computer is built by a company that may no longer exist by the time you install the update.\n(That&#x27;s not to say Windows and Microsoft don&#x27;t have their own security issues - but the idea that &quot;we provide an OS and we add a middle man for OS updates that by all experience doesn&#x27;t do his job&quot;  is a good model is at this point preposterous.)')
