They didn&#x27;t start that partnership with that understanding but they did continue it and they certainly have the means to drop that supplier in favor of a supplier that didn&#x27;t use child labour... changing suppliers is expensive in terms of having a steady supply line and in terms of having a cheap supply line - delaying dropping them for a month or two while you line up some alternate manufacturer because of up-stream dependencies is probably acceptable but they had the money to fix this pretty quickly - certainly more quickly than three years down the road.')
