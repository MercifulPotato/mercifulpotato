Hydration and exercise are huge factors.  I&#x27;m not sure how common it is now, but construction workers in hot climates were often given straight salt tablets to swallow in the past-- with as much water &amp; exercise as they get, it&#x27;s actually necessary to prevent Hyponatremia.  They&#x27;re probably more into energy drinks these days.<p>Anyway, the person I was thinking of also seems to take in less fluids and get less exercise than I do on average, further compounding the difference for us in particular.  That&#x27;s part of why I mentioned our case, it&#x27;s more extreme the closer you look.')
