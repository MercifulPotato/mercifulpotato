Maybe peloton will open that up at some point, it would bring it a new market. I have a bike on a wahoo kickr core and it’s great, and I don’t have space for a dedicated bike. If I did, I’d totally go for one of the newer all-in-one bikes (easier, less hassle) and peloton is interesting if it can do the same things as that hardware.')
