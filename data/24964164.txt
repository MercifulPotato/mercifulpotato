Liberalism is hardly sufficient, but it&#x27;s necessary.<p>(Another way of putting this: Orwell is not an accelerationist. You can see from this essay that he&#x27;s quite concerned with the material conditions of the working class in a realistic way, and the idea that they should get worse so that the people will revolt is neither convincing nor appealing to him.)')
