It’s just not technically possible, wood is not a suitable material for a structure that’s subject to stresses required. You’d need to add extensive steel skeleton structure to support it, and even then you’d be fighting constant leaks, and risking sinking at high seas.<p>Wood works great for constructing large buildings, but ships are not like buildings: unlike them, they are subject to large dynamic stresses. That’s why before widespread structural steel in 19th century, wooden ships were tiny. Mayflower was less than 30 meters long. They didn’t build it larger because they lacked lumber, they did it because previous attempts at larger ships tended to break apart at sea.')
