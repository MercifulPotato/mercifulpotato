In reality the numbers say Germany is actually much better, and it&#x27;s 84 million people that you are now excluding from the analysis.<p>Picking other individual countries is a poor analysis. Take the whole EU or another group that&#x27;s comparable to the US. Otherwise the same can be done for US states. But you were also given numbers for those that showed the opposite and doubled down. You already have a conclusion are are making the data fit.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also irrelevant that Czechia did well in the first wave. This is about who is doing worse right now as measured by actual humans dying. The reasons don&#x27;t matter.<p>It&#x27;s not irrelevant in the context I used it. Which was to explain how you were cherry-picking a very specific case.')
