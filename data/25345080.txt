And got a reimbursement about a year later because of technical problems. Because I really liked them I bought them again and the price then was about 180€.\nAnd I’d say the M4 don’t add so much to warrant the difference over the M3 at their current pricing.\nIn any case, Apples product will never see deals remotely close to this. (Maybe 50€ off if the stars are perfectly aligned)')
