You could configure a Pi to boot directly into Squeak and it would be the spiritual successor to that kind of environment.<p>There are also other good educational alternatives that aren&#x27;t entirely immersive but run well on the Pi (Scratch, Python&#x27;s Turtle module, Mathematica and its interactive notebook (free on the Pi), etc.).')
