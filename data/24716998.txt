Fixing environmental problems from mining also doesn&#x27;t require global coordination.<p>Global warming on the other hand threatens the whole biome and stopping the release of CO2 doesn&#x27;t stop global warming once tipping points are reached. You also need global agreement to meaningfully do something about it.<p>(You also have to keep in mind that fuel for ICEs doesn&#x27;t magically appear. Extracting oil and transporting it isn&#x27;t particularly good for the local environment either.)')
