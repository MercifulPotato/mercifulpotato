Item(by='black6', descendants=None, kids=[25799824], score=None, time=1610767919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25799010, text='&gt; We should all be seeing the same images of overcrowded hospitals<p>Yes, like the picture of the Italian ICU which was dishonestly placed in reports by US journalists to show overcrowded, chaotic American ICUs.<p>&gt; Americans have suffered far more during the pandemic than any other country<p>4.2% of the global population and a 20% share of the world&#x27;s infections and deaths. How does that add up, especially when compared to countries like India and Nigeria which have higher squalor and population density (not to be demeaning) but much lower incidents of infection and death? The US has not implemented fewer precautions than the rest of the world (indeed some states have instituted some of the most onerous mitigation tactics) yet it is faring the worst? The numbers and tactics do not add up.<p>&gt; How is it possible for the most modern society in the world, with all the evidence right at our fingertips, to be so misinformed?<p>Because so much of this &#x27;most modern society&#x27; gets its information from the same 6 corporations through a telescreen instead of walking out and experiencing it firsthand.<p>&gt; In the case of Bill Gates, he came out as a vocal supporter of public safety measures that were especially loathed by Americans who felt it encroached on their civil liberties.<p>Bill Gates is unaffected by government forced shutdowns of private industry. He can slink away and live for the rest of his life on what he has in the bank and market. The average American can&#x27;t come up with $400 to cover an emergency expense, and you wonder why so many people don&#x27;t like being told they aren&#x27;t essential? They get a $600 pittance while the vast majority of the CARES act got routed to corporations to keep up their bottom line.<p>I could pick this misinformation apart further, but it&#x27;s not worth my time and keystrokes to piss into the wind.<p>Wat je zegt ben je zelf met je kop door de helft.')
