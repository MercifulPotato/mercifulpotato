While certainly far from proven, the Black Sea Deluge Hypothesis[0] posits the possibility that the &quot;Great Flood&quot; story, which is part of many ancient traditions (and long predates Abrahamic[1] religions) <i>may</i> be from an oral tradition recounting a flood occurring at the end of the last glaciation in Eastern Europe and Western Asia.<p>While that story certainly isn&#x27;t anywhere near 100,000 years old, if true, it does add credence to the stability of oral traditions over long periods of time.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Black_Sea_deluge_hypothesis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Black_Sea_deluge_hypothesis</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Abrahamic_religions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Abrahamic_religions</a><p>Edit: Clarified hypothesized location of the Black Sea Deluge.')
