Item(by='Escapado', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611761666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928566, text='As someone who is currently making a living as a frontend dev I feel you - however for anything more visually advanced and everything less standard (and I understand that it is debatable whether that should be done in the first place) it&#x27;s often quite difficult to achieve a certain visual effect in all the other gui toolkits I have tried (QT, PyGtk). Often image-blending modes, configurable shadows, animations (especially on those properties) and dynamical effects either are not available at all or not as simple to set up as I am used to. Nevertheless I&#x27;d like to be educated which framework would be a good fit for building your typical animation rich dribbble&#x2F;behance design with glassmorphism shadow magic and whatnot without writing custom shaders. Maybe Flutter?')
