Some do blame the loss of the gold standard, but the leading theory is the OPEC oil crisis.   Others blame market regulations, the EPA was passed in 1970; the late 60s and early 70s saw many financial and environmental regulations passed.<p>I like the oil price theory.   The period of growth was a period of massive decline in the price of energy.   We&#x27;ve since had 50 years of stagnation in energy prices.   But that looks to be breaking now.   If solar energy &amp; battery prices continue to decline the way they have been, we could see energy prices decline at a rate reminiscent of Moore&#x27;s law.<p>And energy is a <i>massive</i> component in the price of almost everything we consume.')
