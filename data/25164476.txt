Visual Studio Code integrates automatically, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve got a Linux &#x27;Window&#x27; open.<p>And when I want to switch off I&#x27;m back in Windows for a full gaming environment etc.<p>I&#x27;m completely switched over to full-time Windows now. Maybe not a good thing, but it sure is convenient.')
