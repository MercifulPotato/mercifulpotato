If I chose to build an impenetrable fortress in which to live, and the police wanted to stealthily bug it, they’d have to figure out how to do it, and if they couldn’t get in, tough shit. Or they’d have to ask me nicely or someone else to give them what they wanted.<p>Furthermore, I don’t think they could really require my hypothetical fortress builder to intentionally build in weaknesses into each fortress they built so that they could get in “just in case”.')
