Is it possible that herding millions into offices [of various quality] had no major impact on mental health? Yet it&#x27;s called an apocalypse when opposite becomes a trend.<p>One&#x27;s &quot;mental health apocalypse&quot; is another&#x27;s relief from pressure. If you often hear one angle maybe it&#x27;s now becoming a chant rather than rational discourse.<p>Maybe we can do better than approaching this from that one specific angle, and consider both as valid options. Leave the people with choice, and let them pick whatever is best for them. [1]<p>[1] My anecdata shows most people given the choice pick their homes or places they like over the office, and offices nowadays are almost empty. But obviously it&#x27;s anecdata, doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;everyone&quot; wants it that way (they don&#x27;t) and YMMV.')
