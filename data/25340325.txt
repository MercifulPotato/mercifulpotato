The runner was a wild-<p>eyed, sun-blackened man Lynch called Hariy, a rope-muscled<p>apparition who came cycling in from the direction of Tucson<p>on a sand-scoured bike with balding lug tires and bone-yellow<p>rawhide laced around its handlebars. Lynch led Harry across<p>the parking lot. Harry was singing to himself, a strange sound<p>in the enforced quiet of the site, and his song, if you could<p>call it that, was like someone randomly tuning a broken radio<p>up and down midnight miles of dial, bringing in gospel shouts<p>and snatches of twenty years of international pop. Harry had<p>his bike slung across one burnt, bird-thin shoulder.<p>&quot;Harry&#x27;s got something for you from Tucson,&quot; Lynch<p>said.<p>&quot;You two know each other?&quot; Turner asked, looking at<p>Lynch &quot;Maybe have a friend in common?&quot;<p>&quot;What&#x27;s that supposed to mean?&quot; Lynch asked.<p>Turner held his stare. &quot;You know his name.&quot;<p>&quot;He told me his fucking name, Turner.&quot;<p>&quot;Name&#x27;s Harry,&quot; the burnt man said. He tossed the bicy-<p>cle down on a clump of brush. He smiled vacantly, exposing<p>badly spaced, eroded teeth. His bare chest was filmed with<p>sweat and dust, and hung with loops of fine steel chain,<p>rawhide, bits of animal horn and fur, brass cartridge casings,<p>copper coins worn smooth and faceless with use, and a small<p>pouch made of soft brown leather.&quot;<p>-W.
