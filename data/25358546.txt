But there is an important use case you&#x27;re leaving out: Developing and testing software for running on RHEL. You probably don&#x27;t need to purchase RHEL licenses with enterprise support just for running on your development machines.<p>The point of CentOS is (or was) not to just be a free, stable, rpm-based linux distribution. The point was to be bug-for-bug compatible with RHEL.')
