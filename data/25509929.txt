And it’s reasonable and appropriate—and not at all a sign of white insecurity—to point that out.<p>For my part, the worst sort of person in this discussion is the white person who puts on a facade of wokeness or racial sensitivity without admitting the possibility that the world isn’t, as it were, black and white.')
