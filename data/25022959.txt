This is back in 2013. While I accepted the offer thinking it will suffice I was living hand to mouth. I was spending my energy fighting with budgeting and spending my energy trying to save up while other with settled backgrounds were fine. In the end I lost my motivation and ended up leaving for a higher paying offer in 9 months. \nI have no sympathy for any of these low paying companies. They should pay what an engineer deserves. Itâ€™s pure exploitation and I walked right into it.')
