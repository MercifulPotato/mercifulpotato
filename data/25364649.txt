Leave that to the lawyers :)<p>As a voter&#x2F;citizen it would be great if we had reasonable expectations about our what these services <i>are</i> and how we should set our own expectations for censorship. The platform&#x2F;publisher spectrum is an easy jumping off point for a casual discussion.<p>Where is &quot;Youtube&quot; on this spectrum? What stops Youtube from marking all content associated with a particular religion&#x2F;political party&#x2F;national origin &quot;otherwise objectionable&quot;?<p>Many questions. I can state that as a citizen I view Youtube as a platform that should take a minimal approach to censorship. I view the attempts to control what the &quot;plebians&#x2F;proles&quot; believe as excessively paternalistic and likely to be unhelpful. If the censorship causes these people to visit more radical sources of information then who is to blame when they get further radicalized? At least Youtube has washed their hands of the situation.')
