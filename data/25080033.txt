Until it does it will not budge the numbers. It just won&#x27;t.<p>The real apologism here comes from the Linux community, who believes that by virtue of existing, and not being an Apple or Microsoft project, it should be widely accepted in spite of being a distant third in usability. Linux needs to step up its game or it will forever remain a distant third. The general public does not care about &quot;free and open source&quot; -- heck they barely care about privacy at all. That&#x27;s just us, the HN crowd.<p>I love Linux in theory, I use it a lot, but my daily driver is macOS. Frankly it likely will remain so even as I transition to being an Android engineer in the coming months.')
