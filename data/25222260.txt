AUR integration is really nice as well.<p>Does anyone have experience with xmake and can offer some perspective on how well it works?  CMake not really working on windows without MSVC and MSBuild is still a pain point; I&#x27;ve been bugged by it for a long time but without a viable, cross-platform alternative.<p>How well does it scale?  It looks easy enough to start with, but I&#x27;ve been bitten before by tools that are easy for trivial examples and don&#x27;t work well for larger projects.  Ugly as CMake might be, it works pretty well for big stuff.')
