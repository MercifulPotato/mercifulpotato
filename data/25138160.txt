This does NOT include the cost of acquiring development hardware, which usually sets you back  $1000 at most. 30% is actually the industry standard; Steam takes 30% and Epic Games takes 30% for smaller titles.<p>Regarding your comment on captive platforms, I think there&#x27;s a bit of a difference between a home console and a smartphone. A home console is considered a luxury item, while a smartphone has quickly become a necessity in today&#x27;s connected world.<p>For home consoles, market competition is fierce. Not only is there Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, but there&#x27;s also the PC gaming market, which includes devices in a variety of form factors. There&#x27;s also multiple storefronts. You can buy console games from physical stores, in which case physical retailers take a cut, purchase Steam keys from other vendors, trade physical games, etc. In summary, there&#x27;s a lot of ways to acquire your games.<p>In contrast, smartphones are seen as a necessity by many, and there are really only two options: Android or iOS. Each has a dedicated storefront that captures almost their entire user base. This gives Apple and Google a LOT of power over what people can run on their devices, and it practically gives them a guaranteed source of income. I can see why people&#x27;s attitudes are different towards the Apple&#x2F;Google duopoly, and that few people are complaining about Nintendo&#x27;s monopoly on the eShop.')
