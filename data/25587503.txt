This is a marketing gag.<p>I am not a virologist but not far away from it. It is well possible that the virus escaped from a lab. But never claim maliciousness for something that can be easily explained by stupidity. When working with Chinese in the lab I experienced them as never working very clean (e.g. with radioactive stuff).<p>&quot;There is some weak evidence regarding lax security and procedures at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.&quot; No, there is actually strong evidence.  \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;14&#x2F;state-department-cables-warned-safety-issues-wuhan-lab-studying-bat-coronaviruses&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;14&#x2F;state-dep...</a><p>This alone shows the guys don&#x27;t know what they are talking about.<p>There is no evidence that the virus was artificially altered (But absence of evidence is not evidence of absence).<p>This being said, it seems to me that Corona COULD be used as a weapon. China is coping much better then the EU or the US with the virus. We know this now. How about 3 more viruses in the next three years? Will the west survive this? While I STRONGLY believe that China is not really to blame for the outbreak, I am sure the development has raised eyebrows in China.')
