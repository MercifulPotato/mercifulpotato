I’m quite sure no employee is involved in any of this, and computers handle it end-to-end.<p>Banking in the UK is actually quite reasonable - largely because companies like Monzo have pushed it forward.<p>It’s a constant surprise to me quite how _bad_ banking in the US is in comparison though - and most of your points seem to reflect how US banking works rather than UK banking - as indicated both by the spelling of “cheque” and the notion of using them in the first place.')
