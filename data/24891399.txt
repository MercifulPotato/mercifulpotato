The cost of living has been too high here for ages, and the prices distort both our society and the economy. It&#x27;ll be rough for speculators, but in the medium term everyone will come out stronger.<p>After the pandemic, we&#x27;ll have the chance to see real businesses start here that don&#x27;t rely on giant checks from VCs for viability; new restaurants will see more opportunities to take risks, as the cost to rent will collapse; and we&#x27;ll end up with people moving here who want to live here, not those who despise the city but feel compelled to move here in pursuit of the almighty dollar.<p>I encourage companies to continue to support remote work. And, if you do hate the city, please leave, move to Boise, and let people in who will appreciate it.')
