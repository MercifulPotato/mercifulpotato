Ultimately, we lose either way - either traditional media remains entrenched, or it remains prohibitively difficult for all content producers (especially smaller, independent ones) to effectively produce content in a way which is not cost-prohibitive. Maybe the code being considered should be reconsidered - but that does not seem to be up for question.<p>Still, I hope Australia calls Google’s bluff, because this style of negotiation should send chills down the spine of people who support a democratic society. It is purely in bad faith - it is not a fair negotiation of one party with enormous bargaining power makes this kind of ultimatum at the first hurdle. Also, despite Murdoch’s media empire being behind legislative efforts here, even the ABC is behind it. I take Aunty’s opinions on these kinds of things quite seriously, and if they think this action from Google is damaging, I am inclined to agree.')
