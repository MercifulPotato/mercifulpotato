Once a given organization takes over 51% of a given market, their revenue begins to be taxed. This tax is then used to either fund public R&amp;D or consider that to be a tax credit evenly distributed (somehow) to their competitors.<p>Non voting control of the market doesn’t count (so for example, if intel bought a bunch of AMD shares and didn’t use them to vote, that would be okay)')
