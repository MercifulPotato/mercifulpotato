Oh and my studio microphone is also &quot;old&quot; usb. And my keyboard&#x2F;mouse. And my phone cable. And my expensive Corsair flashdrive. And my Seagate external hdd. And my memory card reader (I have 7 memory cards for different cameras). I can go on.<p>I&#x27;m not going to daisy-chain stuff. I&#x27;m not going to buy a dock (just another thing on my desk and take up another power socket, and more LED&#x27;s burning nonstop). I&#x27;m not going to buy dongles to convert from one spec to another.<p>And no, I&#x27;m not going to convert everything to wireless. \nI have 1gbps fibre where I live, with a Asus router&#x2F;modem sitting ontop of my PC, hooked up with 1gbps Ethernet cable. The 5GHz wifi is unstable if you don&#x27;t sit in clear line of sight. I have a USB-3 to Ethernet dongle for my laptops but the fastest one achieves 800mbps and chows about 10% cpu when downloading something. ~2016 MacBook air gets 600mpbs with the same dongle.<p>Apple could&#x27;ve fix their port&#x2F;dongle&#x2F;dock mess this time around but chose not to.')
