I see this kind of reporting in all news outlets, especially non-MSM. It&#x27;s cheap and trivial to write an article that highlights some comments from four people with 15 twitter followers a piece, and claim that &quot;People are saying&quot;.<p>You even hear the POTUS frequently use &quot;people are saying&quot; and then quoting whackadoos from Twitter. Can we really hold MSM to a higher standard than the president of the free world?')
