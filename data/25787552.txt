There have been some empirical studies on it, but it’s still something people often get rather opinionated about. There is a reason though that a small ensemble can play to the beat of something like a drum, but a large ensemble like an orchestra can’t. There’s plenty of writing about how orchestras lag behind conductors and how different sections of orchestras have to take their timing queues differently depending on where they’re situated.<p>10ms is what I was always told was the generally accepted threshold after which a musician start to experience increased difficulty as a result of the latency. Which largely aligns with my own experience with audio latency. From there the difficulty just keeps increasing, and the performance quality keeps degrading until at some point the musicians and the audience gives up.')
