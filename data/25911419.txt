You fill in your ballot on the machine, which has clear visual feedback as you go along and helps with procedural things like &quot;pick up to 2&quot;.<p>When you&#x27;re done, the machine prints a paper ballot and asks you to inspect it.  You then click OK on the machine, take the ballot from your booth over to a separate counting machine, and deposit it there.<p>It&#x27;s really quite pleasant, there is a strong audit trail, and the machines afford a wide variety of assistive options (large font, headphone jack for audio, different languages, etc)<p>Also I had the option to get a printed ballot and fill it out witih a pen if I wanted to.')
