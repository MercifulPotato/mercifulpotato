Imagine if for some reason everyone in the trial received the vaccine on a rainy day (maybe it occured in Seattle during a bad patch of weather). The vaccine shows immunity, but we can only be sure for a population that got it on a rainy day.<p>Now we&#x27;re distributing the vaccine, but the bottleneck is that we have to keep waiting for rainy days. It&#x27;s especially bad in Arizona and Nevada. Is your contention that we keep the rainy day requirement? Even when all are scientific and empirical priors tell us that the effect is de minims.<p>The example is kind of silly, but it makes my point. There&#x27;s literally countless number of factors that go into any trial. There&#x27;s no possible way that the way treatment is deployed in the field will exactly match the way it was tested. Yet doctors, scientists and public health experts use judgement and empirical priors to determine when and where we can relax the requirements.')
