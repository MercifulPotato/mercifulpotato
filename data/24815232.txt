That can be a sound investment because when they do turn a profit, it&#x27;s torrential.<p>Take Facebook. How could anyone possibly bootstrap a social network circa-2006? You have no eyeballs, so you can&#x27;t advertise (if the Social Network is anything to go by, they tried that unsuccessfully). You have no product, so you can&#x27;t sell anything directly. At best, you could do software consulting work - but then someone who <i>is</i> well-funded overtakes you easily, and given the &quot;winner takes all&quot; nature of social networks, you&#x27;re dead on the vine.<p>Likewise, even when they do take VC, the next stage isn&#x27;t necessarily &quot;profit&quot;. If you can spend $1 today to generate $1.50 in revenue tomorrow, versus spending $1 today to (maybe) generate $15 in 5 years&#x27; time, VCs will prefer the latter.<p>For all intents and purposes, VC-funded startups <i>are</i> in an different industry from your average IndieHackers project. The former are racing the VC clock, so a lot of their time is spent playing the valuation game. The latter has the luxury of focusing on customers and small, sustainable growth. But that also means you&#x27;re unlikely to see the next search engine or social network on IndieHackers.')
