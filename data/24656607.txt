True but like... you also can have way lower expenses for housing... and if you move to a state with no income tax, you might not even lose almost any net income.<p>It&#x27;s easier to think of your &quot;total compensation&quot; without taking into account cost of living.  Lots of people (esp tech folks) don&#x27;t have a personal budget and don&#x27;t keep track of their costs &#x2F; expenses in nearly the same level of detail that they keep track of their income.<p>The conventional wisdom on HN (for people who aren&#x27;t going to be founding companies) is that if you join bigco FAANGs and bounce around among them for 20-30 years, you&#x27;ll end up with way higher expected net worth by retirement than if you play the startup lottery.<p>Part of this is because of the power of compound interest.  You can get that engine started in your early 20s and pour a lot of your &quot;spare&quot; money into it, especially you don&#x27;t have kids yet.<p><i>This same argument</i> applies to lowering your costs.  If you live in SF, you could easily be paying $40k&#x2F;y in rent or $100k&#x2F;y on a mortgage.  If you buy in a small town with 90% of a bay area comp package, you could be plowing all your housing savings into the compound interest machine.<p><i>edit: $&#x2F;y instead of $&#x2F;mo</i>')
