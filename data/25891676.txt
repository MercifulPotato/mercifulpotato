For one thing if you view the university as trying to train people towards being researchers (or even employment) then collaboration and socialisation matter a lot. For the actual learning I think socialisation with one’s peers (a prerequisite to having good discussions about the subject with them) is crucial because it is the fastest way to get feedback. It also can provide inspiration for alternative approaches, motivation, or a tip to get unstuck. A book, lecture or grade can’t do any of those things. Office hours or other expert feedback from teachers may help somewhat but it’s different from the kind of camaraderie one will develop with fellow students.')
