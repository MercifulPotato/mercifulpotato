Item(by='lelandbatey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603486798, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24872911, text='The actual content of the legal argument being made by the RIAA in this and\nassociated documents is lying by omission at best, and arguably is straight up\nperjury.<p>The only _concrete_ circumvention they level at youtube-dl is that it\n&quot;circumvents YouTube’s rolling cipher&quot;. I looked into this more, and before I\ngo into how totally bulshit it is that they&#x27;ve apparently conned judges into\nbelieving this, you should read their full accusation (or just read the full\nDMCA letter from the RIAA):<p><pre><code>    For further context, please see the attached court decision from the Hamburg\n    Regional Court that describes the technological measure at issue (known as\n    YouTube’s “rolling cipher”), and the court’s determination that the technology\n    employed by YouTube is an effective technical measure within the meaning of EU\n\n    1 See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ytdl-org&#x2F;youtube-dl&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;README.md#readme.\n\n    and German law, which is materially identical to Title 17 U.S.C. §1201 of the\n    United States Code. The court further determined that the service at issue in\n    that case unlawfully circumvented YouTube’s rolling cipher technical\n    protection measure.2 The youtube-dl source code functions in a manner\n    essentially identical to the service at issue in the Hamburg Regional Court\n    decision. As there, the youtube-dl source code available on Github (which is\n    the subject of this notice) circumvents YouTube’s rolling cipher to gain\n    unauthorized access to copyrighted audio files, in violation of YouTube’s\n    express terms of service,3 and in plain violation of Section 1201 of the\n    Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §1201.\n</code></pre>\nSo that&#x27;s what the RIAA is saying that youtube-dl is doing. However, they&#x27;re\nreferencing a document that I _presume_ was attached to their original email,\nthe document from the Hamburg Regional Court, but we don&#x27;t have that email, as\nGithub didn&#x27;t publish that document for us to see.<p>So I went looking, and it turns out that the RIAA has used this exact same\nexcuse to go after some other people, their documents are available, and we can\nsee more of what they wrote. I&#x27;m referencing this[1] document which I found\nthrough this[0] blog post about a 2016 case where the RIAA went after an online\nservice called TYMP3. Here are the links, and here&#x27;s what the RIAA said:<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20160927&#x2F;17062135646&#x2F;can-someone-explain-to-riaa-that-sopa-didnt-actually-pass-it-doesnt-seem-to-know-that.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20160927&#x2F;17062135646&#x2F;can-s...</a><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;3114545&#x2F;YTMP3-Complaint.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;3114545&#x2F;YTMP3-Com...</a><p><pre><code>    &lt; The following is found on page 8 of the PDF linked above &gt;\n    39. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege as follows:\n    YouTube has adopted and implemented technological measures to control access to\n    content maintained on its site and to prevent or inhibit downloading, copying,\n    or illicit distribution of that content.  YouTube maintains two separate URLs\n    for any given video file: one URL, which is visible to the user, is for the\n    webpage where the video playback occurs, and one URL, which is not visible to\n    the user, is for the video file itself.  The second URL is generated using a\n    complex (and periodically changing) algorithm - known as a “rolling cipher” -\n    that is intended to inhibit direct access to the underlying YouTube video\n    files, thereby preventing or inhibiting the downloading, copying, or\n    distribution of the video files.\n\n    &lt; further down, on page 12, they lay out their accusation &gt;\n    Among other things, Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis\n    allege, that YTMP3 employs a means to circumvent the YouTube rolling cipher\n    technology described above, and other technological means that YouTube employs\n    to protect content on its site.\n</code></pre>\nSo, let&#x27;s go see what the Youtube-dl source code actually is doing. The tl;dr\nversion is that youtube does some slight rearranging of the characters in the\nURL of the remote resource, but they also supply you with the JS code to\nun-arrange that code into the actual working &quot;signature&quot; which you can use to\nrequest the video from youtube. So youtube-dl downloads the rearranged URL, and\nthe JS that youtube provides, and uses a Python implementation of the JS\ninterpreter to run YOUTUBE&#x27;S OWN JS THAT YOUTUBE SENT US IN CLEARTEXT TO FIGURE\nOUT HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE VIDEO. See the source code (hosted on gitlab for now,\nhopefully that stays up):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;HacktorIT&#x2F;youtube-dl&#x2F;-&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;youtube_dl&#x2F;extractor&#x2F;youtube.py#L1399-1418" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;HacktorIT&#x2F;youtube-dl&#x2F;-&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;youtub...</a><p>So to summarize, youtube creates two URLs: one that&#x27;s a public video URL, and\none that&#x27;s the URL to the actual video content. The URL to the video content\nchanges on a rolling basis, and is slightly rearranged. All that&#x27;s true.\nHowever, what the RIAA is avoiding saying, and which completely changes the\ncontext of this discussion is:<p>YOUTUBE SENDS YOU BOTH URLS IN CLEARTEXT, AND INCLUDES THE CODE FOR HOW TO\nDOWNLOAD THE VIDEO, SO YOU AND YOUR WEB BROWSER CAN DOWNLOAD THE VIDEOS WITHOUT\nUSING ANY ENCRYPTION&#x2F;DECODING.<p>So when a judge asks &quot;how is it that you&#x27;re getting around this &#x27;rolling\ncipher&#x27; to access the video?&quot; all you have to say is <i>&quot;Youtube told me where to\ndownload the video, so I followed Youtube&#x27;s instructions and downloaded it from\nthe URL that Youtube gave me.&quot;</i><p>Frankly, I&#x27;m amazed that any judge, or any lawyer, would ever lay out or\n<i>believe</i> such <i>bare faced lies</i> as is being spouted by the RIAA in this\ndocument.<p>FUCK THE RIAA')
