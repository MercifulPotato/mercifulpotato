It wouldn&#x27;t air anymore outside of re-runs (which rarely happen for cancelled series), and new content was designed to fill the space.<p>The whole freaking point of Netflix is that I can watch any item from their entire catalog at any time I&#x27;d like.<p>That includes all of those cancelled shows.<p>So as a user, I&#x27;m left in a really weird spot.  I want the content that was cancelled, but I&#x27;m much less likely to watch a story based show if I know it was canned and will never be finished.<p>Basically - I&#x27;d argue strongly that Netflix is (intentionally or not) drastically undermining the long term value of their catalog by not allowing shows to conclude.<p>That&#x27;s not to say they should fund a show forever, (it&#x27;s still a business) but it does mean the intelligent thing to do would be to fund out some sort of conclusion or ending to those cancelled series.<p>A 2 season show with a 6 episode &quot;conclusion&quot; instead of a season 3 - That&#x27;s something I would probably pick up and watch: I know it&#x27;s a complete story and will have some sort of resolution (good or bad).<p>A 2 season show that was canned on a cliffhanger?  Will NOT TOUCH. Fuck that. Doesn&#x27;t matter how good it is, doesn&#x27;t matter how much I like the genre - It&#x27;s not a product, it&#x27;s an unfinished waste of time.')
