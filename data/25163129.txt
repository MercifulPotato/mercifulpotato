It seems very interesting though, I am not knocking the project at all.<p>So, I write code that compiles to WASM, and then pass that code as a process to Lunatic? Is this pattern intended to be a generation beyond microservices&#x2F;containers, where rather than writing a &quot;service&quot; that gets put into a container and then managed by a container orchestrator, you&#x27;re creating processes that get managed by a process manager? To get rid of the container overhead? If that&#x27;s true, isn&#x27;t it just all turtles because Lunatic will have to run out of containers (and presumably those will have to be managed&#x2F;orchestrated)?')
