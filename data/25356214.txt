On the other hand I&#x27;ve definitely dealt with corporate lawyers pretty much interpreting it exactly as I outlined. And by that I mean they issued a blanket ban on any single line of code licensed under GPLv3. For GPLv2 the verdict was use with caution and MIT&#x2F;Apache 2.0&#x2F;Eclipse&#x2F;BSD&#x2F;etc. were generally fine provided the code was licensed properly and clearly (some projects fail this test). This was Nokia around the time they were in the courts with Apple, Qualcomm, Microsoft, etc. regularly on all sorts of IP issues and at the same time they were putting together a Linux based phone platform. In other words, they weren&#x27;t amateurs; like us.<p>As far as I know most fortune 500 companies would probably have similar reservations about these licenses (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong). Companies like TerminusDB  switching license because &quot;sufficient lawyers have advised teams to be wary of GPL&quot; probably means that they were loosing lucrative deals with big customers because of the license. Hence the switch. I think dual licensing as a viable business strategy is pretty much dead at this point. An overly restrictive OSS license is a hard sell for a SAAS business in a competitive market with alternative solutions.<p>Legal interpretations are not an exact science of course but there&#x27;s enough language in these licenses to cause raised eyebrows for lawyers and probably not enough court cases to argue one way or another definitely. That equals a lot of uncertainty and corporate legal departments hate that sort of thing. GPLv2 has had some exposure in courts over the years so lawyers are more comfortable with it at this point and know how to limit and contain its infamous viral nature.')
