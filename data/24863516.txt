BLM is not alone in being controversial in some of it&#x27;s positions. Lots of other advocacy groups (Autism Speaks for instance), have a polarizing affect on people. I think it is better to avoid these ethical dilemmas in favor of cooperation. It is easy to condemn and exclude based on ideas, it is much harder and more worthy to find ideas we all agree on and build useful things for everyone.')
