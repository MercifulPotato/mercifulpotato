Fatigue. Brain Fog. Breathing issues. It seems like there is another disease going around and no one is talking about it.<p>It feels great to see someone else with a similar experience.<p>As someone with a history of anxiety with somatic symptoms, I deal with this stuff, even digestive weirdness. How many times over the course of the pandemic have I felt like I can&#x27;t breath?<p>I&#x27;m keenly aware of my mental health and how it affects me. I know that there are certain states of mind&#x2F;dispositions that I need to assume in order to feel stable.<p>In normal times, I go about life and forget about my anxiety because my daily routine is a good distraction.<p>Maybe this isn&#x27;t obvious to people without anxiety, but it&#x27;s clear to me that way too many people are inhabiting unhealthy relationships with danger, fear, anxiety, etc.<p>And it&#x27;s sad cause it seems like politics and technology is trapping people in that mindset.<p>I&#x27;m frankly sick and tired of the people condemning others as though it&#x27;s immoral to not be afraid of COVID. You can understand COVID is potentially dangerous while not really worrying about it.<p>This is an essential technique for people with anxiety if they ever want to lead a normal and healthy life, but the zeitgeist is full on fire-and-brimestone moral righteousness and preaching if you&#x27;re not absolutely consumed with fear and anxiety over a virus that almost all people survive.<p>I don&#x27;t want to say &quot;long COVID&quot; isn&#x27;t real especially since there so little understanding about any of this, but I would say it&#x27;s more likely than not that many people are predisposed to somatic symptoms of anxiety, power of suggestion, etc. especially when large segments of the population are trapped inside for long periods of time and deprived of social activity.')
