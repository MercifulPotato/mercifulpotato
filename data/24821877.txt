Eufy robot vacuum, Eufy stick vacuum, and an inherited Kirby. The robot vacuum does a great job, and the stick vacuum is so versatile for both spot-cleans and doing entire floors. The Kirby is the heavy-duty one. Does a great job on carpet, and it had a carpet shampooing attachment that is great to do for spring cleaning.')
