Item(by='hilbert42', descendants=None, kids=[25974523], score=None, time=1612048280, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25971037, text='This is an excellent article; as always, Cory Doctorow succinctly and perceptively cuts to the core of the matter.<p>From my own observations over recent years, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that the IP, copyright, patent and DRM issues that Doctorow discusses in this article are even worse than he has let on about (perhaps he&#x27;s worried about overly frightening the horses and or is worried that his opponents would attempt to discredit him if he spilled all the beans).<p>In Western countries and especially the US, the field of software and so-called IP has become so monopolistic and proprietary—and ordinary users so disempowered from the consequences thereof that they&#x27;re having not only a serious negative effect on productivity and the national economy but also they&#x27;re dysfunctional to the extent that they even threaten national security.<p>Much software development is technically moribund (or it&#x27;s more of the same).  Time limits me to cite only one example here—the multiple, never-ending security breaches that we see day-by-day—breaches that we&#x27;re never able to manage properly or get on top of—or engineer our way out of.  (There, too, are dozens more examples.)<p>Whilst Western corporations maul both one another as well as poor long-suffering users over IP licenses, copyright and patent disputes that are, by nature, intrinsically trivial, China&#x27;s &#x27;command&#x27; economy is able to bypass all that nonsense and move on regardless—for the Chinese, it&#x27;s IP be damned, and it&#x27;s patently obvious that that attitude is benefiting them mightily.<p>China pays lip service to international copyright law but behind the scenes it does the exact opposite despite the fact that everyone knows it.  As we&#x27;ve seen over the past 30 or so years, China has stolen more Western IP than would fill many a volume of old-fashioned telephone directories and all that Western countries have ever done in response is to make token complaints and objections which never amount to anything more than a kowtowing whimper.  Clearly if you&#x27;re big and frightening enough, no one&#x27;s game enough to complain (or do anything) about the fact that one&#x27;s ideas were stolen).  To make matters worse, the West even has the utter damned hypocrisy to buy manufactured product from China that was made using this pirated technology!  <i>(It all reminds me a bit of Neville Chamberlain and the appeasement of Hitler.)</i><p>It seems to me that unless the West (and again, especially the US) pulls its collective head in over this IP nonsense and dismisses most of it—all the unfair stuff—then China Inc. will continue to gain an even further technological march upon us.<p>To catch up to China&#x27;s manufacturing technology and output, the US and other Western nations need to adopt a capitalist command economy (à la China&#x27;s and along the lines the US implemented in WWII).  Even the Chinese have never equaled the heights the US achieved in manufacturing during WWII:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_aircraft_production_during_World_War_II" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_aircraft_product...</a><p><i>&quot;William S.

Post COVID-19, it&#x27;d make sense to implement such a scheme to rebuild the economy.<p>Right, it&#x27;s only a pipe dream—we no longer have people of sufficient aptitude, caliber and with <i>solid ethics</i> of the likes of FDR, Harry Hopkins, Vannevar Bush (FDR’s top science advisor), Fredrick Terman, LTG Leslie R.
