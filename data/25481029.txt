Here in deepest Republican middle America mask wearing by _staff_ in supermarkets is universal. Customers around 90% if you count &quot;nose-slingers&quot; as non compliant. Pretty much nobody just swanning around with no mask these days. Costco has heavy mask enforcement -- they will hunt down and eject anyone with their nose out.<p>Where masks are not worn here is in smaller family owned businesses. Some have notices requiring masks on the door, some (many) do not, even though it&#x27;s a state mandate.<p>Since this is the US, we have no public transport so I can&#x27;t comment on that.')
