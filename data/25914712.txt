I have been following them for the last few years and my point is that they don&#x27;t always win. Before 2020 (where every stock market on earth started giving huge profits) they were mostly known for their losses. In fact the only WSB stock still worth buying is TSLA. Everything else is pumped, dumped and gone.')
