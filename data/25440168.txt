Twitter is trying really hard to make it impossible to curate your feed. They started jamming &quot;follow topic&quot; suggestions into mine recently, which appear to be random tweets from angry video game nerds I don&#x27;t know or care about. I had to write my own script to remove them from the page since there seems to be no way to do it through Twitter&#x27;s own settings.<p>I really wish they&#x27;d let me keep it to just the people I follow, and the things they like and retweet. I don&#x27;t want to see anything else.')
