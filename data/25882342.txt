I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but Oracle has changed the license for &gt;11 that also gives me pause. I&#x27;m also very unhappy with Java&#x27;s feature bloat: the JVM spec and JL spec used to be small and comprehensible, circa Java 5. Now they are both like 800+ documents. This dilutes Java&#x27;s single greatest strength, which is a well-written, implementation independent specification. No other high level language has this. Python&#x27;s specification, for example, is &quot;read the CPython code&quot;.<p>JavaScript + DOM (especially ES6 in modern browsers) has fulfilled the WORA promise on the client, and apart from a vast library of OSS libraries, I don&#x27;t think Java is particularly distinguished at server-side. Spring? Django? Rails? Express? I mean, who cares at this point? They are all just processes that bind to a port and handle HTTP requests, with more-or-less the same trade-offs and dev experience. The biggest distinction with DX is &quot;IDE vs text editor&quot;, not language&#x2F;framework.<p>I agree that Rust is a very exciting language, as is the general trend toward Clang&#x2F;LLVM for new native languages. It seems we might finally be able to have our cake and eat it too. We&#x27;ll see!')
