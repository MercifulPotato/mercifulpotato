I&#x27;d assumed that a list like this comes from posts in various communities that then get buried and are eventually very hard to find again.<p>Stuff like the city-generator I&#x27;ve seen in game dev circles, but things like tooll.io don&#x27;t seem to have been advertised much the authors. Googling it led to some youtube videos and some posts on places like reddit&#x2F;hn with little traction. It&#x27;s stuff like this that I would have no idea on how to find it.<p>I&#x27;d love to see the other list of all the projects you have even if they&#x27;re just links in a txt file.<p>Keeping curated lists like this seems to be growing more important given how search isn&#x27;t what it used to be 10 or 5 years ago - things seem to get deleted, or buried under so much more new information.')
