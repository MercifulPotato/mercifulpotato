Unless you can reduce the humidity from &quot;a lot&quot; to &quot;basically nothing&quot; and lose only a couple of degrees in the process (highly unlikely, completely impossible if your method consists of opening windows&#x2F;doors in the winter) it is going to cost more energy to vent out the humidity and heat dry air than it is to just heat the humid air that&#x27;s already near temp.<p>Just because a rental contract includes a clause doesn&#x27;t make the intentions of that clause consistent with reality.')
