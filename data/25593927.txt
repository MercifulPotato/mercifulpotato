The schools all suck where we could theoretically afford a total rebuild project home, at the very top of our price range.<p>Went to Buda to see what suburban life would be like, and it was my own personal hell. 6k sq ft lots for miles on end, everyone crammed in on each other snagging their tiny slice of the American dream. No tree coverage - summers there would be absolutely awful.<p>With 0 signs of climate change slowing buying a house in Texas feels like a gamble on a 20 year timescale. Austin is a lovely city in many ways, but when I think in 20 year increments I don&#x27;t see this growth being sustained, I think there will be an exodus out of Texas and other southern states for cooler climates within my lifetime.<p>Taking my family back to where I grew up - Grand Rapids Michigan area. Winters aren&#x27;t exactly fun, but it&#x27;s a simple thing to get warmer - you just bundle up. Summer heat there is no escaping without air conditioning, there&#x27;s weeks on end where you really can&#x27;t go outside.')
