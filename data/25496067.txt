(That&#x27;s an interesting lesson in itself).<p>It was in a VM, so rather than remount read-only, I snapshotted the VM drive, then rebooted to perform recovery, confident I could try out things non-destructively by reverting to the snapshot.<p>Used <i>ext4magic</i> to undelete, and that tool did a really great job.  Some files ended up with contents that should have been in other files, so it isn&#x27;t perfect.  But it was a project with only a few files, so I was able to reconstruct it easily enough because all the contents were at least recovered.<p>Did something similar for a customer a few years ago who had wiped a significant directory on a live system.  That was on a RAID-1 (mirrored).<p>Rather than remounting read-only, to allow production to continue I detached one of the mirrored drives to preserve it for safekeeping, while allowing operations to continue using the other drive.')
