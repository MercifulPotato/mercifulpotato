This enables browsing over SSH when you have low bandwidth.  The heavy internetting is done on the <i>remote</i> machine (like a cloud VM for example) using blazing fast data center internet.  A personal example may explain why I love this.<p>For several years I lived in rural Alaska where the fastest internet one could buy was $120 a month (I think) and a blazing 512 Kbps.  I was a developer (working remotely) who&#x27;s shop had adopted Docker, and it literally took more than 24 hours sometimes to download a docker image.  By necessity I switched to having my whole development environment on a cloud VM.  The Cloud VM had gigabit connection so docker downloads were blazing fast.  All I needed to send across the wire was a tiny bit of text.  Mosh was an absolute life saver by the way.  I once flew from Anchorage to Salt Lake and had the <i>same mosh session</i> pick up like nothing had happened thanks to roaming abilities.<p>Browsing heavy (i.e. modern) websites was often very difficult too.  With high latency and a lot of heavy Javascript sites requiring 10 MB or more, it was a nightmare.  I occasionally went up to Eagle Alaska, where internet was even <i>worse</i>.  The nearest cell tower was a 4 hour drive away, and the only internet was at the &quot;library&quot; or a crappy satellite link (that far north satellites get less useful).  A tool like Browsh is a life line to people in situations like that.<p>In related news, when people talk about the merits of developing with just Vim vs. an IDE, I also recount the same story.')
