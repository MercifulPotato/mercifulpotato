I just wiped it and reinstalled since only the root filesystem was hosed (separate home filesystem thankfully wasn&#x27;t affected) and this box was already fully managed by ansible so I just rebuilt an exact replica of the same system in place. (In hindsight, no, I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t use that opportunity to switch to XFS.)<p>Also, I&#x27;m going to somewhat mirror sibling comments: Even if the hardware <i>is</i> faulty, that should produce a filesystem with explicit checksum errors, not an unreadable filesystem. There <i>is</i> certainly an upper limit to what it <i>could</i> catch, but you&#x27;ll have to forgive my skepticism that only one of the 2 filesystems on the system was affected and only after months of use, and <i>then</i> the corruption was so complete that it couldn&#x27;t even tell me what was wrong and <i>try</i> to fix it.')
