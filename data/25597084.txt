I would try something like this: &quot;Mom, I&#x27;m not going to argue with you about whether COVID is real or not, how serious the risk is or not.  What I want to do, is discuss how to handle your affairs, should you go into the ICU or die.  Is your will in order?  Which hospital do you want me to take you to (knowing that some are filling&#x2F;full)?  Do you have a burial plot picked out?&quot;.  Make a last-ditch effort to shock them with the realities of how seriously you are taking things, how matter-of-factly you are preparing to deal with their likely illness or death.  Don&#x27;t make it a political debate, and just tell them, if you do things your way, I want to know how you want me to deal with the aftermath.<p>It probably won&#x27;t work, but I would say do your best to make them confront the likely consequences of their choices.  And you could also try to show them more articles like these [1], [2], or [3], though I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve probably already tried.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.yahoo.com&#x2F;im-doctor-tried-plan-extremely-204117155.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.yahoo.com&#x2F;im-doctor-tried-plan-extremely-204117...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;31&#x2F;judging-patients-covid-19-decisions-comes-easier-than-it-should&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;31&#x2F;judging-patients-covid-1...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;science-news&#x2F;how-talk-your-friends-family-about-covid-vaccines-wearing-masks-n1250631" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;science-news&#x2F;how-talk-your-f...</a>')
