That means in the time it takes to seek to page in a page, you could read about 1MB worth of data. That should make that order of page size <i>vastly more efficient</i> for paging in data than tiny 4kB pages, from an HDD.<p>From an SSD, sure, the seek penalty is much lower so things should skew in favor of smaller reads.')
