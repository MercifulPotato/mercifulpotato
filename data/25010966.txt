BigQuery already lets users train models using a simple SQL query. AutoML makes simple ML tasks as easy as run and verify accuracy and run again. Of course, a basic amount of knowledge is still need to avoid common pitfalls - unclean data, overfitting, etc. Perhaps this will just mean data scientists can produce better work with the same amount of time. It doesn&#x27;t seem like a good use of everyone&#x27;s time to have to know so much cutting-edge research to solve run-of-the-mill business problems. Hardly any other area of CS requires that.')
