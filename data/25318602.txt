Do you have any data to support that?<p>I thought about what you said, and immediately connected it with several other claims of things that <i>also</i> rise with tech advancement... marginal impact of weapons, medicine, intelligence, entrepreneurship&#x2F;luck, sports, games, entertainment, communications...<p>So if the marginal impact of <i>everything</i> rises, then maybe  that’s just the way of technology? It increases leverage. But then in relative terms, all those things still have the same impact? Or maybe the ratios between them change (e.g. weapons&#x2F;nukes became <i>more</i> more powerful than communications)? Or maybe there’s other areas that massively reduced in marginal impact (e.g. production of food)...')
