The autorelease is especially noteworthy... also I worry how hard it would be to have more finegrained control over allocations, releasing the memory instantly is not always the most perfomant way. In games for example big (temporary) allocations are often performed in some kind of arena buffer that gets cleared at the end of a frame (NativeArray in Unity does this) and thereby circumvents alot of unnecessary deallocating. How feasible would it be to implement such an allocator in V without losing the autorelease for the other cases?')
