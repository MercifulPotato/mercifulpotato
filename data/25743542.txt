But what if it&#x27;s just that Google&#x27;s algorithm, designed by someone who&#x27;s never even heard of Rumble, just doesn&#x27;t like the Rumble site as much as other sites?  If that by itself constitutes a violation, it seems impossible to make a non-violating search engine.  Like how could you possibly ensure that for every possible search, the &quot;correct&quot; results appear first?<p>Google does its fair share of shitty things with search and ads, but I&#x27;m kind of skeptical that this is one of them.')
