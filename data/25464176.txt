Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608269230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25463879, text='&gt; A charitable view would be that Amazon is trying to create a system that rewards fair sellers and provides unbiased reviews to consumers, while unscrupulous actors attempt to defeat that by engaging in new forms of grift.<p>I would agree with that until something like this happens, where Amazon prevents people from letting other people know that the reviews are paid.<p>&gt; If the unscrupulous actors are 10% less effective because of Amazon&#x27;s efforts, does that mean the &quot;purpose&quot; of the system has shifted 10% away from honest dealing? If Amazon all but eliminates dishonesty, does that mean the &quot;purpose&quot; of the system is to have an ever present, tiny baseline of fraud? At that point, better to use a different word.<p>I&#x27;ll think on your point. I&#x27;m not sure how to quantify purposefulness.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s because of strategic equivocation between the &quot;actor&quot; being implied in the &quot;purpose.&quot; The implication is that Amazon creates the system and this is their purpose, but the cybernetician&#x27;s definition of purpose is more like &quot;the role this system plays in the overall society in light of all the infinite restrictions on everyone&#x27;s behavior.&quot;<p>Point taken.<p>&gt; If you have two actors within a system that are at odds, using the term &quot;purpose&quot; to refer to the system is either mostly incoherent, or (in most cases) trying to import the connotation of &quot;purpose&quot; into a conversation.<p>I think that one can still imagine that the point of a competitive endeavor is separate from the purpose of the competitors involved in the system.<p>Thanks for the reply, I&#x27;ll consider your ideas.')
