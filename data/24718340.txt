Purchasing a pair of $1000 shoes, and then spending $1000-$2000 on maintenance the next 50 years will make sense for some, but not for others.<p>I personally, would much rather just buy a new pair of $500-$1000 shoes every 10-15 years, and discard the old ones when they start to look too shabby.<p>I live my guitars old and reliced, but shoes ? No thanks. When &#x2F; if my shoes need patching, I&#x27;m throwing them.')
