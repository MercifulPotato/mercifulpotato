This one was inspired by a Beatles song from Abbey Road<p>1. New Year’s Eve<p>Mean Mister Mustard sat on the dock,\nate chips &amp; cod,\nthen had had enough —<p>“Foo-bar!”<p>Vehement,\nMustard threw his fried fish to the sea.<p>“Go back where you came from!”<p>Typical Monday for Mustard,\nbut b&#x2F;w sitting in the English Rain<p>&amp; being fed-up w&#x2F; pub grub, this was the last straw.<p>“I’m leaving!”<p>So it goes,\njust under a half-dozen decades in the kingdom\nwas all it took Mustard\nto decide even:<p>The Best Fish &amp; Chips in London-Town!<p>couldn’t keep him.<p>“I’ve just had it up to here w&#x2F; England\nall her rain &amp; rubbish!”<p>So announcing,\nMustard SPAT like PATOOEY! then chucked a fistful of fries\nto the sea.<p>Wrung up in a frenzy of his own rueing was Mustard,\nwhen Sister Pammy stepped in.<p>“Mustard ..” said she,\n“Cheer up, y’ruddy badger!”<p>She bummed him a bump w her phanny, then said:<p>“It’s New Year’s Eve.”<p>But Mustard remained sat slumped.<p>“It’s no use,”\nhe said, feeling hapless, helpless, &amp; everything b&#x2F;w,\n“’Fraid I’ve just lost me taste for the sea.”<p>While bemoaning the state of things, Pammy, beside him, pat him on the head like she did sometimes.<p>“There, there ..” said she,\n“Think all you’ve yet to live for ..”<p>But to Mustard,\nthis thought was ludicrous, completely.<p>“To live for?”\nhe baffled,\n“Like what?! Beef Wellington?” he asked,\n“Mash’n Bangs? Meat Pies, eh? Fooey!”<p>Mustard knew his predicament, precisely.<p>“There ain’t a dish more delish than a Newspaper Wrap\nof Brit Fish &amp; Chips,\n&amp; not a thing a chap can do about that.”<p>Having sighed\nso exasperated a cry of defeat, Mustard looked to the salt-water body.<p>“Think it’s time I make like V.,” said he,\n“Fill me pockets full of stones,\nwalk the plank, sink me-self to bottom.”<p>Getting to his feet,\nMustard stepped to the end of the dock.<p>At the edge, he stared out for the horizon, searching for something to hold on to, nonetheless, realizing:<p>“There’s nothing here for me now . . .”<p>But Pam,\nso caring &amp; knowing a thing or two about coaxing,\nhinted:<p>“Mustard,” she intoned, “What about Pizza?” Quite wryly, Mustard’s face contorted.<p>“Pizza?!”\nhe cried, bewildered.\n“What tripe is this?”<p>Hearing such,\nhe really thought that Pammy had lost it.<p>“The Bloody Brits don’t make pizza!”<p>He banged the dock w&#x2F; both fists,\nlivid that Pam wouldn’t just cut to it, &amp; then she did —<p>“But in America ..” she said,\n“In New York, New York ..”<p>&amp; something about those words\nhad Mustard listening a bit more closely, than before.<p>“They say a slice of NYC Pie is: Out Of This World ..”\nsaid she.\n“&amp; we could go if you wish ..”<p>Well Mustard,\nbeing Mustard,\nwas fantasizing, already.\n“Out of this world ..” he repeated,\n“For pizza ..”<p>Like that, Sister Pammy’d filled his mind with hopes &amp; dreams\nof limitless fancy.<p>“Y’mean it, Sis?” he asked,\n“We can go there, you &amp; me?”<p>“Eventually,” said Pammy.<p>But Mustard\nwas never one\nfor arranging things hypothetically.<p>“I’ll be hangry b’fore eventually.” he growled,\n“And no time like the present, especially w&#x2F; my appetite ripe for Second-Lunch.”<p>Turning from the dock’s end,\nhe marched for land,\non the way, hooking elbows with Pammy.<p>“Come along to the airport,\n&amp; book a flight for the afternoon. Get me to there by evening.<p>You can meet me someday in the New Year.”<p>&amp; Pammy,\nwith her Saving Account stashings, &amp; wish-granting habituality,\nwent ahead,\nbooked a One-Way\nfor Mustard within the Hour<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;new trip')
