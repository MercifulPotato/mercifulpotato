I have a Mac Classic II in the role of &quot;transfer station&quot; - it has a SuperDrive (the floppy drive, not the CD&#x2F;DVD drive), so can read both standard IBM 1.44MB disks as well as the Mac 800K ones. But it&#x27;s been getting a bit temperamental recently, mainly due to failing capacitors and an old SCSI hard drive.<p>FluxEngine completely eliminates the need for it - I can download a 800k system disk image, write it to a physical floppy disk, and use that. What&#x27;s more, transferring individual files is easy now too: I can read back the physical disk to a DiskCopy image, and either mount that in an emulator such as Mini vMac, or convert[1] it to a raw disk image and mount it with hmount[2]. (The reverse process is similar).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bigmessowires.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;16&#x2F;macintosh-diskcopy-4-2-floppy-image-converter&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bigmessowires.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;16&#x2F;macintosh-diskcopy-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux.die.net&#x2F;man&#x2F;1&#x2F;hfsutils" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux.die.net&#x2F;man&#x2F;1&#x2F;hfsutils</a>')
