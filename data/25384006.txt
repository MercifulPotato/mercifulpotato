Within certain classes of programmers (and I don&#x27;t mean the obvious tautological one) Haskell is extremely popular, and fit for purpose. I assume the same is true for Dart.<p>And I would add that, in those circles, the introduction of advanced HKT features like RankNTypes has been extremely successful.')
