I also got a portion of the tips made by the front room staff (usually a few bucks a day). So as a teen who wasnâ€™t expected to pay rent or anything it was a pretty decent amount of money!<p>I also installed the phone line tap in my room myself, so initially I just had to pay for them to come out and turn on the line via the hookup box outside. I think it was like $50 for the initial setup and I saved $100 by running the tap myself.')
