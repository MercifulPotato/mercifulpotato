You just wouldn’t have the permissions to install your favourite editor and vi is almost everywhere.<p>I had to learn vi when working on green screen terminals logged into HP&#x2F;UX and there was no alternative but am very glad I did as I find that nothing as ubiquitous allows me to efficiently change files.<p>Does that mean I would go around advocating one editor over another? No, whatever works for you. I know vi works for me for editing files.<p>Would I use vi instead IntelliJ for development work? No, I found the development environment allows me to be more productive on project work.<p>But I think you’re doing students a favour teaching vi.')
