The notifications could be in various forms, but email was the most common. After a few prototypes, I quickly realized:<p>1. People don&#x27;t want to bother proof-reading both the HTML &amp; text version, so if they&#x27;re kept separate, people will just update the HTML version and the text verison will get stale.<p>2. People don&#x27;t want to learn Markdown (or ReST&#x2F;etc) to render HTML from text.<p>3. Even if they did, the result quickly becomes strange and difficult to read in-text if you want fancy formatting.<p>4. On top of that, templating is troublesome for anything not html&#x2F;text. Escaping requires special support that Django doesn&#x27;t have.<p>The only effective solutions I could think of are are a) don&#x27;t provide a text version b) automatiatically generate the text version from the HTML version. I ended up picking b, and it worked okay, though it&#x27;s still easy to fool it with bad HTML (like an image with a non-sensical alt value).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;django-vox&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;django-vox&#x2F;</a>')
