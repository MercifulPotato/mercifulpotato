The context of this conversation is someone asking for an example of ISIS using AWS, in a conversation about the capitol hill rioters &quot;using&quot; AWS. And my response is that they indeed use it in the same way. Now, if you want to argue that this doesn&#x27;t in fact constitute &quot;using&quot;, then the capitol hill rioters didn&#x27;t use AWS either, and AWS isn&#x27;t responsible for them.')
