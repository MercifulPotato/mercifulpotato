Item(by='xixixao', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605744390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142528, text='I used resources from bivector for part of implementation for excalidraw.com, and it did what I needed. It was an interesting lesson though in the difference between mathematical and software engineering priorities. I didn&#x27;t need to support arbitrary dimensions (only 2D). I wanted my code to be readable, and functions to have typed arguments (so a function like orthogonalLineThroughPoint should take a line and point, and you shouldn&#x27;t be able to pass the arguments in wrong order). So I wrapped the hard-to-remember and understand operators in a more friendly API, but it&#x27;s a question whether I even need most of the &quot;beauty&quot; of the math then, or just unroll the few algos I need into the API. One counter argument is applying transformations to all objects uniformly. So I left the implementation as is in the end, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it got ripped out later to save app size (if that was a big concern).')
