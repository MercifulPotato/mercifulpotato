How many bits is a 500D vector? Is it 10,000 bits, like in the post? Which &quot;coding&quot; does it use, real? Is it a memory-centric 10,000-bit hyperdimensional real-coded vector that can be combined with permutation? What benefit does your 500D vector get from the fact that it&#x27;s holographic, not micro-coded? How do you do gradient descent without backpropagation? None of those words make any sense and that&#x27;s exactly why this post is being lambasted. Thank you for trying to make sense of it, but just because it&#x27;s possible to write sensibly about similar topics does not mean this post belongs anywhere but the trash can.')
