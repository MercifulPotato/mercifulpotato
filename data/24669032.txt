At the end of the day nothing was fixed and the ransomware groups are happier than ever.<p>In a parallel universe we have an improved system, here it is regulated that all companies have either a backup of their information or a very robust system without back doors. Here Jhon also does not care about the security of his company, then it is discovered that Jhon does not have a backup copy and he is fined, Jhon pays and is forced to improve the security of his company, then he does it, then he receives an attack of ransomware, but Jhon refuses to pay because his company already has better security ... At the end of the day Jhon paid a fine, but the ransomware teams didn&#x27;t get what they wanted, the problem was fixed here.')
