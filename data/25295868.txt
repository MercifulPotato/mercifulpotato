Instead, our markets were flooded with high-octane spirits, of dubious purity.<p>I have never used purified cocaine, and don&#x27;t intend to start. Back in the early Noughts, coca tea bags were available for purchase on Amazon (yes, really) imported from Bolivia; this was illegal, but tolerated.<p>They were lovely! I would enjoy a glass in the early evening when I was going out, it gave me a nice, pro-social boost that wears off faster than caffeine, letting me sleep at night.<p>Of all the many drugs I&#x27;ve tasted over the years, coca tea might be the least harmful. Chewing coca is manifestly not a problem either, Bolivian and Peruvian indigenous society is in no danger from this habit, though I don&#x27;t doubt they get grumpy if they can&#x27;t get their leaf (I don&#x27;t think I would commit actual murder to obtain coffee but I never want to find out).<p>Here&#x27;s the kicker: At point I had probably three ounces of cocaine-bearing material in my cupboard, next to the Earl Grey. If I had suffered some bad luck, and my white-privilege shield broke down, that&#x27;s in the ten-year mandatory minimum category of felony.<p>So, if cocaine is illegal, the vast majority of users are going to rail lines of it, as pure as they can get, or smoke the carbonate salt.<p>I hope I&#x27;ve explained why that&#x27;s a bad idea?')
