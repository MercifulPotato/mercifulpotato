Congratulations!<p>Do anybody know how much Xenon Partners (te same buyer) paid recently for UXPin.com? I think that UXPin is 5-10x times bigger, but saw that their CEO after selling the company instantly joined Google as a senior manager.<p>UXPin had a few investors and 3-4 cofounders. So probably different outcome?')
