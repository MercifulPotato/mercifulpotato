The US&#x27; spying changed world events, including the Iran hostage crisis..<p>Imagine how much better they could have done without overconfidence, tampering, and such jewels as Reagan colluding with Khomeini in order to secure his own election.<p>Virtually any behavior other than their sabotage using data that undermined internal trust in actual pro-democracy politicians would not have caused the Iranian switch to batshit crazy religious leadership as a J-curve defense to not be in Latin Americas situation.<p>The US is very happily winning a GDP points war that will end with our extinction, and any opposition will be tortured into submission.<p>People ask me why I don&#x27;t get happier when one or the other of the American political parties is in office.. Even an idiot falling down the stairs isn&#x27;t stupid enough to declare the flat of each step they hit their saviour.')
