It&#x27;s an awesome machine; however, when I tried to install Lightroom 6, I wasn&#x27;t able to because the installer isn&#x27;t 64 bit. As a hobbyist who edits photos only a handful of times a year – usually after trips or photoshoots – moving to a subscription model is really costly. What&#x27;s silly is that I was able to use Lightroom 6 on my 2016 MBP, even after upgrading to Big Sur. I don&#x27;t blame Adobe for not supporting a product that came out 5 years ago but how nice would it be if they did.')
