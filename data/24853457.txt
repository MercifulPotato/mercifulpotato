For example, I have a rule enabled that will open links in a new temporary container when they leave the current one. That&#x27;s a terrible explanation, so let me give an example to make it clear:<p>- I have a GitHub container<p>- github.com and gist.github.com are set to always open in the GitHub container<p>- Say I am currently browsing github.com in the GitHub container.<p>- If I click a link to a domain other than [gist.]github.com, instead of navigating my current tab to that url, the url will open in a new tab &amp; new temporary container<p>This is more powerful than simply persisting cookies from github.com -- I&#x27;m keeping GitHub&#x27;s cookies, but only in the github container. It&#x27;s almost like first party isolation, but a little weaker (unless you enable the setting where any link to a different domain will open in a new container), and I have the ability to group sites that would break with 1st party isolation by opening them in the same container.')
