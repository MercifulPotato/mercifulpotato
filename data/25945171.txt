It&#x27;s done at the exchange level and includes ALL trades (buy and sell) on a particularly volatile stock. This is functioning normally. GME has been halted many times over the past few days.<p>But what OP is describing is not that. This is retail brokerages, where normal people buy and sell, disabling the &quot;buy&quot; on certain stocks and only allowing &quot;sell&quot;. Without the ability to buy, the stock price can only go one way; Down.')
