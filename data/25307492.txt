I was talking about: I want to change from line A to B on station X (or exit on the station X)... Station X is closed, and I learn about that on station (X-1), or even just by not stopping on the station X.<p>It happened in Paris more than &quot;extraordinary&quot; number of times, so I have to put extra 15 mins to every important travel.<p>OTP sounds like: the train is scheduled at 3:25, it arrives at 3.26. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here. But if the normal margin is 5 mins for total time of travel, making it 15 mins is not nice.')
