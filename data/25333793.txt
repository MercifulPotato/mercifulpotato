Albert tries to show how 2+2=4, but he is told he is being DISRUPTIVE and a WIKILAWYER. Albert says that consensus can&#x27;t trump the truth, that 2+2=4. Finally, an admin shows up and blocks Albert Einstein for being distruptive and a wikilawyer. The article now will show that 2+2=5 due to consensus of its editors.&quot;\n-User: Sir Joseph')
