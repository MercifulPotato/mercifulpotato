I think maybe GP is suggesting that rather than being stalwart champions of free speech as you implied, boomers are just more racist and want to be free to say racist things.<p>Fortunately for all of us, it&#x27;s not the general population of millenials <i>or</i> boomers who decide what speech the government gets to prevent; it&#x27;s experienced justices, who tend to take the constitution much more seriously than the average person.<p>The statistic that 40% of millenials want laws preventing statements offensive to minorities is kind of baffling to me. Do you think they just don&#x27;t understand the constitution, or do they want it rewritten to allow this kind of law?')
