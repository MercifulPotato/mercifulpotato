Elastic produced a product that is popular <i>because</i> it&#x27;s open source. (The closed source version of ES is called Splunk or DataDog.) Now they are pissed off that they can&#x27;t profit from its popularity. I feel their sadness, but I don&#x27;t think Amazon is the problem. Even before Amazon many non-Elastic hosted ES offers appeared (logz.io ?).<p>I would hate to be in their shoes, but it brings a valuable lesson to future entrepreneurs: Do fill the &quot;unfair advantage&quot; box in your business canvas.')
