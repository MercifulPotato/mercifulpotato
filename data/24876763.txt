No more meat subsidies, or better yet no more meat at all.</i><p>I&#x27;m with you on subsidies, but it&#x27;s worth noting that historically, cattle, sheep, etc. were often raised and grazed on land that wasn&#x27;t (and mostly still isn&#x27;t) suitable for growing crops, usually because of some combination of elevation, slope[0], soil, or lack of rainfall. Animals are mobile, so you can move them around on a larger area with relatively sparse vegetation that humans don&#x27;t consider palatable[1], or even migrate them seasonally on an even larger territory.<p>So, within some limits, animal husbandry in areas otherwise marginal for agriculture can convert poor ground cover to high quality protein (and other animal products). As long as overgrazing is avoided, this seems to me to be a decent and sustainable arrangement.<p>[0] Terraces can deal with slopes to an extent and slows erosion, but don&#x27;t always conveniently lend themselves to large scale mechanized agriculture. Solutions to the other challenges also don&#x27;t work everywhere.<p>[1] It&#x27;s worth noting that the domesticated animal least picky about what plants they&#x27;ll eat is the goat, many varieties of which, when not moved frequently enough, can completely denude an area by eating plants and bushes down to the ground, climb trees to eat all the leaves they can reach and even stripping the bark, which kills the tree. Which makes goatherding a likely driver of desertification in already stressed ecosystems.')
