Gaming has increasingly moved away from the PC (the only truly open&#x2F;competitive platform) towards the walled gardens of consoles and mobile devices.  This has a censorious effect in what&#x27;s actually allowed to be released, the big platforms get to do a lot of rent-seeking, and crucially, games are increasingly going digital, which eliminates a consumer&#x27;s right to resale and loan games to their friends.  The gaming marketplace would be a lot more competitive and interesting without gatekeeping.  About the only downside you&#x27;d see is that the up-front cost for some consoles would need to be higher, because selling them as a loss-leader and making the money up in back-end licensing fees would no longer be allowable.<p>I would love to see some sort of regulated 10% rake cap on digital marketplaces (both mobile and gaming) and ticket sales.  Note that this would apply only to games being distributed through the platform owner&#x27;s marketplace, and that consumers would be allowed to install by right software from other sources as well.')
