I am assuming that all computer players have figured out the simple formula which gives them the cheapest profitable odds to back or lay an outcome given the commission and the outcome&#x27;s probability (thanks to one of your previous comments).<p>I am assuming that there will be punters who bite at the odds I provide. If there weren&#x27;t, then the game would not be sustainable.<p>I came across a &quot;betting guide&quot; for sale for this game which claims to advise on bets based on the &quot;trends&quot; seen in the game. I don&#x27;t know what this means, but it gives me hope that there are people out there willing to part with their money in my direction.<p>Failing that, the novelty was an interesting one, and it&#x27;s all about the journey, dude!')
