Resellers (aka, stores) are not charged sales tax. [EDIT: Note that a &quot;reseller&quot; is any individual or entity that has registered as a reseller with their state. This usually incurs an obligation to file a sales tax return at least annually.]<p>In contrast, VAT is levied on every participant in the chain of transactions. (Note that businesses can offset their VAT liability with the VAT they paid for services&#x2F;goods received.)')
