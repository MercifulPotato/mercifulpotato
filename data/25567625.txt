Item(by='graderjs', descendants=None, kids=[25567906], score=None, time=1609227252, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25567374, text='oh I mean &quot;reminds me of‚Äù as a term including &quot;sounds like&quot;... and was just copying what I think of as Murakami&#x27;s style and some of his common tropes such as pasta, cooking, strangeness in mundane situations.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in reading, I reckon it&#x27;s safe to read his books in chronolgical order. You can see how his style and preoccupations develop over the years.<p>The first story I read was &quot;on meeting the 100% perfect girl one April morning&quot; out of a short story collection called &quot;the elephant vanishes&quot; which is not his first book. I was in a bookshop in early 2003 and just randomly looking for the shortest thing I could possibly read and this story got me hooked on Murakami. and then I think after reading that short story book the next thing I read was &quot;hear the wind sing&quot;, his original short novel. And then &quot;pinball 1973&quot; and then I think &quot;Norwegian Wood.&quot;<p>I like his sort of loose universe how similar characters and types of characters and tropes kind of return but the the recurrence is not necessarily central to any of the particular stories they&#x27;re just kind of like motifs.')
