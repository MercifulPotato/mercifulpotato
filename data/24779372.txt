Getting people to join political groups and getting them to feel less alone on a non-conspiracy basis would do wonders. I just don&#x27;t think technocratic solutions will work because either they restrict political speech, abuse people into staying politically conformist when that is clearly failing, or are ineffective and harm people.<p>For example, you might demand FB and Youtube stop using their divisive engagement strategies, but that would violate their profit motive so they won&#x27;t. The only solutions are political organizing.')
