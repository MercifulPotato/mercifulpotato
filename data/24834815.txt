I&#x27;m not expressing an opinion here.<p>How many &quot;real&quot; working hours does it take to get 25 working hours? I only found one reference (Berkeley Law) that estimated 1&#x2F;3 of the time is downtime, so very roughly 40 hours a week? Of course depends on location, chosen time of work, and much more.<p>More cynically, would these companies be able to distribute work such that rides are given to drivers with more &quot;buffer&quot; before hitting these ACA payouts?<p>Again, not at Uber, Lyft and others specifically but the USA is a country where if we mandate workers with 30 hours get healthcare, employers may try to schedule for 29. I think it&#x27;s unfortunate, but that&#x27;s the incentive.<p>(opinion mode on: we need to fix healthcare as a country; the current state of affairs and likely the state after the Supreme Court hears Texas v. California in three weeks is ridiculous)')
