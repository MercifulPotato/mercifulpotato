Its adding 50% more people to the workforce. Yes, it’s less because women might work less or part time, buts it’s an insanely high number in terms of market effects.<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if one of the reasons you simply can’t survive on one person per household working, as in the 60s and 70s, is simply that two people are willing to work now and spend all their free cash on mortgage payments.<p>No one talks about this. I’d love to hear the debates. I’d love to be proved wrong.')
