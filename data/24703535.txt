I try to watch a 5-10 min video and can&#x27;t without 5-8 min of super shitty scammish ads. what the actual fuck? That&#x27;s really annoying I frankly just bare use youtube because of this shit. I either put some 3-4 adblockers on my chrome to watch some video. The suggestions became super weird and full of promoted stuff. I mean, it&#x27;s okay to make money out of all this, but I really think google really took this too far. I personally won&#x27;t be coming back to youtube unless they will be pulling their shit together..')
