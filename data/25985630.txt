Have 10ish cloud-run services plus a full K8Ss cluster, all in GC.<p>and it is pretty good. So even, in a one person situation, i decided to split services sometimes into two.<p>Main reason for having separate services is - a different privacy&#x2F;security context or deployment time:<p>So one service had so many native libs that it needed that i didnt want to wait 3 minutes to build to deploy when independent code had changed.<p>So far I would say the setup totally practical for our use-case. A monolithic setup would have been slower. Mainly, with regard to quickly iterating.')
