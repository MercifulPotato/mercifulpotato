There is no argument here that the corporation <i>should</i> be able to monitor communications going on or out of their systems (though some limits how and for what purpose that monitoring can be done <i>do exist</i>, especially in the EU - it&#x27;s not unlimited), but that is not what the calling the technique for what it is is about.<p>Use of MitM by the corporation as part of Data Loss Prevention interferes with any hardening you or your vendors might be making against a MitM attack attempted by anyone else - it breaks if, for instance, the application vendor your enterprise has decided to use  (let us call them &quot;Example plc&quot;) has pinned <i>their own CA certificate</i> within the applicaton as the only one that is supposed to sign certificates on the Example domains - say, for  &quot;content.example.com&quot; - following example that e.g. Google set. Or, worse yet for this example, as specific certificate to be used instead of the specific trust anchor. I&#x27;ve seen both examples in the wild, so it is not an idle discussion.<p>Not only you need to override that pinning with your own CA in the application for the content to be inspected, to retain the same level of hardening you&#x27;d need to implement the same checks the application did in your DLP system, so that it verifies that the system is legit - and that costs money and time and remains fragile over time, so many enterprises simply do not bother doing so, falling back to the well-known list of public CAs instead (that includes my $CurrentCorpo, much to my annoyance). It weakens the whole system, which is already fragile enough thanks to actors like Symantec, WoSign and StartCom - and possibly others.')
