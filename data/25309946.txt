If you stomped the team on offense then it was possible to complete all objectives in 7 minutes or less. On the other hand if there was actually a stalemate then the match could last the whole 15 minutes. It&#x27;s an &quot;old&quot; game though. It&#x27;s officially shutdown but the servers are still running.')
