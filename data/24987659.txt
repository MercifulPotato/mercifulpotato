Dear ImGui is purely code based and it&#x27;s drawing in immediate mode. Meaning there is no way to have a visual tool to arrange layouts for things, you have to do everything in code. It&#x27;s fantastic for debugging, prototyping, very simple interfaces when that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s required, but it&#x27;s not a fully fledged UI library like QT. It&#x27;s like comparing a bicycle to a 4x4. Sure a bicycle works better in some uses cases, but for it&#x27;s not designed for heavy lifting.')
