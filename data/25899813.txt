Item(by='cbozeman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611554246, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25898076, text='&gt; Now I&#x27;m curious. The world you describe seems quite hostile to someone with your beliefs<p>That&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t have beliefs, I have data. I&#x27;m not interested in &quot;beliefs&quot;. I&#x27;m interested in being able to concretely prove something with varying degrees of certainty, and I won&#x27;t present my findings and conclusions unless I have the strongest available data to back them up.<p>To autopsy your assertion even further, you could extrapolate to the entire world. Most people in the world don&#x27;t really want to know why the world is the way it is, or even why they do the things they do. People don&#x27;t like that they can be quantified, that they can be predicted if someone, somewhere, with enough knowledge and understanding has enough data about them. Yet Facebook and Google and Twitter and YouTube do this every day, fairly easily nowadays I might add. It only upsets people when its in their face and clearly visible. When they can&#x27;t turn away from it and deny it.<p>The nearly wholesale rejection of evolutionary biology, psychology, and the Big Five personality traits by a subset of certain people is hilarious because 1) its anti-science, which is made even more ridiculous given the credence these groups place on science and 2) it not only can be, but often is used against them by researchers who have no moral misgivings about the nature of the science and accept it for what it is - its neither inherently good nor bad, its just how we evolved based on the selective pressures nature placed upon our species.<p>&gt; how and why are you in it?<p>The why is probably easier to answer than the how. By their own admission, I bring value to their organizations. When someone asks me what I do, instead of going through a bunch of technobabble and mathematics&#x2F;statistics jargon I just tell them, &quot;I bring order to chaos.&quot; It usually sparks more interesting conversations than talking about R, K-means clustering, Bayesian inference, and all the other jargon surrounding data science that frankly almost no one besides mathematicians, statisticians, and other data scientists will understand anyway. The second part of the &quot;why&quot; is &quot;enormous consulting fees&quot;. :)<p>The how is a very long post that I just don&#x27;t have time to type up right now.')
