Googling suggests ERV = Energy Recovery Ventilator [0] and HRV = Heat Recovery Ventilator [1]. Wikipedia says these are mostly about energy efficiency but also have air quality benefits. It&#x27;s not clear to me how this helps with indoor air quality - maybe better humidity and temperature regulation?<p>They also seem to require a centralized air conditioning&#x2F;heating system. That would give you a nice central place to put an air quality monitor. The big challenge though is that often these central systems don&#x27;t process all air in the building evenly.
