I&#x27;ve dabbled in go, but found it incredibly verbose and of a much lower level than python. The error handling alone is enough to turn me off completely. So much boilerplate, so much code and words to express even simple things.<p>No thanks, I&#x27;ll stick with python, for me it is the perfect balance between expressiveness and being easy to read.<p>Also Django itself and the python ecosystem is hard to beat. It gets out of my way so that I can focus on the business logic, instead of reinventing wheels.')
