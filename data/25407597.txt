Learning a foreign language is a complicated process due to different needs of individual learner. The author makes a sweeping statement without detail description of the learning process is not helpful for people who might want to try his way of learning.<p>Let me give an example what different student background and learning environment will impact the learning process. I know very little English when I emigrated to US when I was 13. I started high school after 6 months in the US. The school had no Chinese speaking teaching staff( Mandarin is my native language). Since I do not know much English to begin with. I don&#x27;t think anyone can teach me English using what Author proposed. I built up my vocabulary one word at the time until I know enough word to understand young adult novels. Reading many young adult novels helped to increase my vocabulary quickly and I was able to catch up within 3 years and managed to graduate from high school and enter University.<p>My English deteriorated after I have been back to Asia for 20 years but hopefully I get my point across.')
