You&#x27;ll notice the headline would&#x27;ve basically been complete &amp; sufficient after the word Coast: &quot;Big Internet outages hit the East Coast.&quot; But just in case there are any Homer Simpsons out there unable to imagine the impact of such a thing, they&#x27;re letting you know, that thing you think of as Zoom is actually the internet too.<p>Also if you mention Zoom, you can then go on about how Zoom has &quot;become essential&quot; in these unprecedented times when we&#x27;re all in this together now more than ever stay safe.
