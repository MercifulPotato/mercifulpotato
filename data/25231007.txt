Refusal to acknowledge the win of an opponent, instead spreading disinformation and outright lies. Getting into fights with the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger  (a republican) to try to force him not to certify the results of the election. Talking about trying to use the state legislatures to override the results of the election itself.<p>This is pretty sketchy stuff and is very much in line with a coup. While not necessarily &quot;troops in the street&quot; coup it&#x27;s very important not to underplay this.<p>He&#x27;s using as much soft power as possible to undermine the results of the election and to influence it in his favor.')
