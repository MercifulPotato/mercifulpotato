If you imagine the amount of indirection a Python program has just to add two numbers, that&#x27;s why C is &quot;fast&quot;. Compilers are clever, but they generally don&#x27;t bother and aren&#x27;t really allowed to look too far away from a given expression or function i.e. Extracting very high level information about even integers still requires manual annotation - GCC and LLVM will happily propagate parity through an expression but declaring an invariant about an integer inside a struct is not possible even with extensions AFAICS<p>The issue we have, now, however isn&#x27;t that <i>your</i> code (or any code, ideally) is slow but that the depth of the tree from your library call down to the missile launching is too deep. There&#x27;s just too much crap in between the important stuff.')
