My Bose headphones are starting to wear out, and have always been kind of finicky in pairing and getting disconnected. It&#x27;s worth it to me to pay the $200 more to get newer headphones that in all likelihood sound noticeably better, have spatial audio, and hopefully have no trouble connecting to and switching between Apple devices.<p>The one thing holding me back actually is, based on the reaction I&#x27;m seeing so far, wondering if there will be a negative stigma to these or if they&#x27;ll attract a lot of attention. Like the google glass years ago where everyone noticed it immediately and thought you were a douchebag for wearing it.')
