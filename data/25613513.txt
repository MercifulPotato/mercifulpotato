But as a Muslim I&#x27;ve seen this in quite a few places. Both in India and the US.<p>It&#x27;s not even that much a company thing as much as it is a personal thing. Some people are just bigoted and don&#x27;t like you. In fact the very sight of your existence disturbs them very deeply. And yeah, if you are better than them, it just makes the problem more worse. It&#x27;s like they have to now deal with the realization deep down that they inferior to the person they hate.<p>Mostly Muslims just move on, because we have bills to pay, and families to support. Over long periods of time, it&#x27;s not really possible to fight these political battles every time you have bigots around you.<p>I&#x27;ve also known cases when things are proven beyond doubt and the HR is likely to take action on the bigot, they start citing excuses like &#x27;mental health&#x27; and &#x27;personal preferences&#x27;.<p>You can&#x27;t win this, there are going to be these kind of people anywhere you go. You just leave them to their state, and move on.')
