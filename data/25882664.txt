I would stay up late at night listening when I was supposed to be sleeping.<p>I often ended up listening to Larry King&#x27;s late night radio show. Although unlikely for the medium and time slot, he was somehow able to attract amazing guests, and I learned about a lot of things. I especially remember his interviews with Isaac Asimov and Douglas Adams, which introduced me to those authors. RIP.')
