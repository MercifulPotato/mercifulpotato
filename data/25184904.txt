In the US free-speech does include hate speech.<p>Even in countries where there is hate speech, what and what doesn&#x27;t constitute it is normally broad, subjective and is frequently misused by state to prosecute people that have no ill intent.<p>The most egregious example is the Chelseas Rusell case in the UK:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.liverpoolecho.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;liverpool-news&#x2F;woman-who-posted-rap-lyrics-14543694" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.liverpoolecho.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;liverpool-news&#x2F;woman-wh...</a><p>Also not only that but it doesn&#x27;t work.
