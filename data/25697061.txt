Pretty sure one of those more serious food blogs measured it once. This is why basting in fat is important sometimes.<p>I was gifted some leftover thin wagyu cuts recently. I cooked them through because they have so much fat they&#x27;re still tender, and the brown adds flavour. It just had to render enough. I guess they were technically &quot;well done&quot; but perfect for me, as someone who prefers medium on typical steak.')
