Especially:<p>&gt; the employee would need to confer with lawyers how to control what now becomes a public spectacle (along with its usual problems of libel, PR, fake news, etc.).<p>I don&#x27;t think I even have a good armchair solution for this, let alone a real one.<p>--<p>I think in general it&#x27;s a difference of where I would draw the line. This:<p>&gt; Basically, it sounds like an institution at any time can announce &quot;hey we did nothing wrong, and we would like to explain why, and have just asked the employee if they accept but they haven&#x27;t responded yet&quot;<p>seems like a feature to me, not a bug. If an employee is making accusations against a organization, than the organization should have a chance to clear their name.<p>---<p>However I don&#x27;t have a good response to the issues of libel, PR, fake news, etc., except possibly to have a requirement that whatever is put out in the press release from the organization be approved by the ex-employee in question.<p>This guarantees that<p>A) The organization is not lying in a way that the employee is harmed by.<p>B) The employee is not lying in a way the organization is harmed by.<p>If it&#x27;s impossible for the two to come to a conclusion, than  either party can say something about it, or contest what the other says. This also allows the employee to say &quot;I wanted to do a joint press release with $org, but we could not come to an agreement about what to release.&quot;, so at least the damage from this can be turned either direction.<p>Edit: Formatting')
