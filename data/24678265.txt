Even here on HN I can post something during GMT business hours that gets scored based on the views of HN&#x27;s readership at that time, but when the US wakes up the score can change dramatically. Essentially, the US west coast can have the &#x27;final say&#x27; because of its timezone and probably larger user base. It&#x27;s really interesting to observe.')
