A free model may be a good way to go to build that user base initially, and may be something I explore, but I didn&#x27;t want to give something away if people WOULD pay for it.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve considered, if I do go down this route, is that free users&#x27; trips are public (or mostly, I would try to censor dates&#x2F;residential locations) while premium users can make private trips or something like that.<p>Overall, I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of feedback on this thread to reconsider the pricing&#x2F;monetization strategy, so it&#x27;s definitely something I need to look at.')
