The tools you mentioned all pre-date that I think.<p>Secondly notebooks have to run sandboxed. Most notebooks run the output&#x2F;code in an iframe but the editor is in the main window (e.g. JSFiddle). The moment you do that you can no longer support notebook style output (cell-output-cell-output) without some serialization step as you can only embed the iframe in one place (so there would be a single output pane).  This is also how Project Iodide worked [1].<p>Starboard&#x27;s approach is to put the entire editor&#x2F;runtime in the sandbox which I think is a superior approach  for a notebook. It only talks to the outside frame over a thin API (for saving notebooks, refreshing, syncing the content).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caniuse.com&#x2F;es6-module-dynamic-import" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caniuse.com&#x2F;es6-module-dynamic-import</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpha.iodide.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alpha.iodide.io&#x2F;</a>')
