I can sorta relate, my company has their core application built in C (or C++? idk), and they will often have one FTE slave away for weeks analyzing a crash report &#x2F; core dump, because apparently the code doesn&#x27;t give nearly enough information to debug a production crash.<p>whereas in Java you get an exception, a stack pointing neatly at where the issue was and an error that explains what&#x27;s going on, and you can fix it and move on.<p>I&#x27;d argue that C-like Java is much easier to debug than C.')
