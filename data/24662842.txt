They think they can keep manipulating the economy forever to keep their stock prices up through money printing and they want to suppress this information because they don&#x27;t want shareholders to realize it and dump the stock before they do.<p>There is tremendous peer pressure right now to suppress this kind of content for insiders and employees to not sell their shares... But the bad news for these people is that the last people to sell their stocks are going to lose and it&#x27;s a very fragile situation. It wouldn&#x27;t take many employees to dump to cause a stock market crash now.<p>Usually employees and small shareholders are the losers. If you look at who is buying Bitcoin now, it&#x27;s MicroStrategy, Greylock partners and A16z (smart money)... Many are also moving into gold and silver. Do you seriously think that the rank and file corporate bureaucrat&#x2F;employee who&#x27;s been sitting through useless meetings every day for 10 years is worth the $2 to $10 million in corporate stocks that they own? Did they deliver that kind of value to society? No.<p>If I owned corporate stocks worth even $100K and the bosses kept discouraging selling of stocks by employees, I would sell everything right now and change companies. You will never see such good valuation again.<p>As always, the first to jump on the new trend always win and it&#x27;s always going to be the smallest group possible. The majority always loses.')
