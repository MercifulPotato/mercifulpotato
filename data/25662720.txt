And truth doesn&#x27;t usually sell as well. That&#x27;s a problem. You can&#x27;t even trust the fact checker sources as they say &quot;out of context&quot; or &quot;partially true&quot; when it&#x27;s a fact against their agenda&#x2F;team. Even the fact checking sites are super biased.<p>If you align with a side, you attach your identity to it like Paul Graham wrote about with Keep Your Identity Small [1]. People don&#x27;t like their identity criticized, or want to believe they may be wrong, so they believe what they want and create their own distorted bubble.<p>My buddy always said &quot;we&#x27;re told to not talk about religion or politics. Probably the 2 most powerful and influential topics that exist&quot;. Now people have started talking about them, but not in a productive fashion.<p>If you believe someone on the other side is bad based on their views, you can&#x27;t have a dialogue. This is the greatest tragedy. Disowning family members and friends over their views because you concluded they must be bad people?<p>Very few people on either side are actually bad. They just have a different experience, they&#x27;ve aligned their identity and team, and there&#x27;s a ton of forces at play (ex: media, special interests, etc) to keep that divisiveness going.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;identity.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;identity.html</a>')
