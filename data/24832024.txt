I guess the key takeaway here is &quot;if you&#x27;re relying on someone else&#x27;s services, don&#x27;t flagrantly disregard the service&#x27;s rules publicly in order to start a lawsuit and then try the case in the court of public opinion&quot;, but I think that&#x27;s good advice for any service.')
