I think the next AMD chips are rumored to have AVX-512 and being on a smaller process node will help immensely with heat. At 14nm and being a backport that may not be optimized for 14nm, heat management may be a problem and downclocking still required.<p>Despite that, it is still probably too late anyways. My industry has moved on to GPUs and FPGAs for real-time compute, but I remember when everyone was waiting for 512 after utilizing AVX-256 for some time. Although the thought of a 64-core threadripper with avx-512 at 5GHz on all cores is appealing.')
