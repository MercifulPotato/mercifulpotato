There&#x27;s big friendly letters that say, &quot;Welcome, developer! We know that you&#x27;ll enjoy getting the most of your hardware and not clogging up our forums and support lines with complaints about things that are broken due to the unreviewed apps, because you&#x27;re a developer, and you know how to fix things when they break. Here&#x27;s your unwalled garden. Enjoy.&quot;<p>Then there can be that Dev Store where Advanced stuff goes, and if there&#x27;s ever any hacks &#x2F; vulnerabilities &#x2F; bad stuff Apple can point to the Dev Edition and say &quot;That&#x27;s what they signed up for, but for normal folks the walled garden awaits.&quot;<p>iPhone Developer Edition and iPhone Customer Editions are identical in hardware. You can buy a Customer Edition and convert it to a Developer Edition phone by simply registering as a developer and signing away your right to bitch and moan if apps contain spam, porn, scams, or brick your device. iPhone Developer Edition can be turned back into a Customer edition through a setting, all ready to be sold.')
