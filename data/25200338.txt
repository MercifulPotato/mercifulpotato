If you take guidance from the &quot;militia&quot; part (possibly dubious, as it&#x27;s generally interpreted as a preamble), a militia, in a current defensive war, would require anti-tank and anti-aircraft rockets and missiles, at the very least. The problem with that is, in Heller, the militia is not really part of the test anymore. You <i>might</i> be able to argue against suitcase nukes, and they don&#x27;t really have a defensive or targeted offensive purpose, and are only really useful for terrorism.')
