I don&#x27;t see how that makes sense. Flying the planes still costs the same. I doubt those frequent flyers pay significantly more (isn&#x27;t the whole point that they get a discount?), so it&#x27;s weird that they make so much more profit there.<p>I feel like one of those numbers includes all the costs while the other doesn&#x27;t.')
