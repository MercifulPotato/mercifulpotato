It was maybe the most surreal place i have been. You could buy strong opiates over the counter at the pharmacy so i was high af all the time, wich helped ease anxiety and boredom from not being able to leave the secured flat i was assigned most of the time, but did not exactly make the experience less surreal. The whole country has like one ambulance and one Hotel for diplomats with a &quot;western&quot; restaurant and coffee place, i was allowed to go there between 1000 and 1700, but only taking the biggest road and if it got close to 17 you could already feel the mood swing and your hair stand up.<p>The sight of disability due to theoretically curable diseases like polio or forms of blindness was sadly common.<p>I did not find anyone who admitted to eating a human heart in the civil war, but one guy stoped talking and got a blank stare into the void and huge sweat pearls forming on his forehead, but i was not sure if it was due to war memories or because his friends tried to scam me, i preferred not to inquire further.<p>There was no real powergrid as the dam was still not repaired after the war so all important places had a diesel generator and usually had one or two power outages a day when there is some switchover or too late refill  (i think). Especially funny in the hospital at night, when it gets pitch black and all machines turn off and the eery silence is only filled by the sound of vomiting and sounds of people in serious pain.<p>My Boss was an alcoholic and kind of comic savage who after a certain level of drunkenness would start hitting random guys on the ass and pointing to me when they turned around because he found it hilarious you can go to jail for being gay.')
