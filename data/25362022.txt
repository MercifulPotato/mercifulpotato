When I decided to finally stop being overweight and inactive (I played rec league soccer, which was miserable because it was my only exercises and I was grossly out of shape) I lost 40 pounds, then I put on 20 as I incorporated more strength (bodyweight) training into my routine.<p>And a couple colleagues who started weightlifting + moderate cardio saw initial losses of maybe 5-10 pounds before their weight became stable, but they were getting in obviously better condition even though they were still above their initial target weights by quite a bit.')
