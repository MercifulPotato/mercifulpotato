It&#x27;s quite possible iteration won&#x27;t be completely inlined and the overhead of calling hasNext &amp; next can become non-significant.<p>An even worse case that made massive speedups is just inlining everything. I believe modern IDEs can automatically inline all invocations of a function. You&#x27;d be surprised how much performance you can get with that.<p>As for writing efficient Java, it comes down to using primitive and value types.<p>Although, my experience is mostly with Java 8. I have no idea how streams or other new syntax works. After optimizing a really massive Java code base I&#x27;ve never used it since.')
