Plaintiff Pham responded stating the Guo Media App publishes valid claims of corruption against the Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party and, therefore, should not be taken down.<p>&gt; Apple became aware of plaintiff Pham’s criticism and defendant Apple’s managers responded by retaliating against plaintiff Pham and ultimately terminating plaintiff Pham.<p>Apple is a spineless piece of shit.<p>How anyone can defend these assholes and the horrible things they do to US software developers is beyond me. But to defend this - their kowtowing to a regime that conducts slavery, rape, and organ harvesting - that&#x27;s appalling.<p>Anybody jumping to disagree - I strongly encourage you to think of all the suffering going on, and how this company would rather make gobs of dirty money than take the moral high ground.<p>We cancel people and companies for far less than this.<p>Cancel Apple.')
