Unfortunately, as soon as they produce a finished model, that algorithm replaces them, permanently.<p>If a model is profitable to create, it produces structural unemployment. If it&#x27;s not profitable, then those jobs continue to exist. The only way his proposal functions is if it&#x27;s a stealth ban on AI. There&#x27;s no sustainable way for an image labeler to have anything like a middle class income for more than a few months.<p>And his proposal has to apply... globally? How much does Tencent pay its image labelers? I can&#x27;t image the PRC version of mturk is any kinder and gentler.')
