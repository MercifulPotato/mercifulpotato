I&#x27;m bold because as a woman in the field you need to be bold to survive as a researcher. In the type theory and proof assistant worlds there are only a handful of us. A typical ratio at a conference for proof assistant research is 1 woman for every 40 men.<p>Anonymous comments scare me because there are (a few, thankfully not many) abusive people in the PL community I am afraid of engaging with.

I don&#x27;t spend all of time on HackerNews, I sometimes don&#x27;t get around to responding to things.
