Item(by='anonytrary', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608423652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25482598, text='The math doesn&#x27;t work out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flurly.com&#x2F;pricing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flurly.com&#x2F;pricing</a>. The real cost is 3.9% + $0.30 (which takes into account Stripe&#x27;s fees). If you are a seller and price your item at $100, the platform charges $103.20 to the customer, gives $99 to you, takes $1.00, and gives $3.20 to Stripe.<p>The additional cost is covered by the customer, so they&#x27;re not lying about only taking 1% from the seller... still a bit misleading, though.')
