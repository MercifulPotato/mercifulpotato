I&#x27;m mainly an embedded software engineer, though, so I tend to get pinged for more niche projects. Google does internal interviews as well, at least when hopping between letters of the &quot;Alphabet&quot;.<p>When I interviewed, one or two of the questions were stereotypical &quot;reverse the string in Pig Latin while solving tic-tac-toe&quot; or whatever. Most of the questions were directly relevant to real-time safety-critical embedded systems stuff though.<p>At some point while I was there, Google did some viral marketing leetcode foobar challenge recruiting thing. If you searched for certain keywords, your web browser would do a fancy 3D zoom effect and then give you coding challenges. I did some of them for a couple hours one time. Some of them were tricky word problems, but algorithmically none of them were particularly difficult. The only one I remember had maybe 5 paragraphs of text, and my solution was literally one line of python.')
