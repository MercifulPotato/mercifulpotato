If you forced yourself to revisit your notes without switching, you&#x27;d see the same effect.<p>At this point, I&#x27;ve learned that a good system of notes <i>requires</i> frequent visits and pruning. Otherwise, it turns into an overgrown, sprawling dumping ground of tags and random notes&#x2F;links.<p>To me, Zettelkasten, and tools like Roam, help reinforce that behavior by providing a reward in connections. My brain can outsource the connection-making, context generating aspect. I just have to be prescriptive about setting time aside each day to tend the &quot;garden&quot;. Not a ton of time such that I get burned out. Just a little each day. As a knowledge worker, it seems like that is an invaluable exercise to build a habit around.')
