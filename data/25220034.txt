I think it&#x27;s because C++ engineers (well, the ones I would watch anyway) were sticklers for performance and so they&#x27;d describe the subtle differences in implementation. Even though I don&#x27;t code C++ anymore, using it for a short time really helped to develop a better understanding of how code actually works.')
