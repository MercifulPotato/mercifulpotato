So that&#x27;s people who start taking them for medical reasons and become addicted during the course of taking them for medical reasons. This wasn&#x27;t they decided to start taking them for fun. This also seems to be mainly an issue in the US as other countries doctors don&#x27;t hand out these pills that often due to nature of them.<p>To understand what heroin usage is like you can watch a few seconds of this video that I have at the correct time <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;17TbF6n4jI0?t=459" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;17TbF6n4jI0?t=459</a>.
