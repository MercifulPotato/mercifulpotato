(hint... it&#x27;s in the name!) In truly fluid and uncertain situations, capital takes a beating. Humans can adapt or even move; those factories that burned down won&#x27;t rebuild themselves. After the Revolutionary War, but before the USA Constitution was imposed on the populace, was such a situation. Free farmers opposed capital both violently and via monetary policy (through pro-inflation and relaxed debt-enforcement laws passed by states in the grip of actual representative government). Madison and the rest of the conspirators were far more troubled by the <i>latter</i> excess of freedom; they certainly didn&#x27;t invite any poor tenant farmers to Philadelphia. There they succeeded in making USA safe for capital. &quot;Federalism&quot; was a lie from the beginning; no state is allowed to inconvenience big business. In the 1860s a rather destructive war was fought over that issue (among others).<p>Ever since then, whenever and wherever circumstances have favored the positions of workers more than capitalists can accept, the USA Army (or sometimes the Pinkertons!) have stepped in to violently modify negotiating positions. In the post-WWII period they were unable to do that for several decades, and USA enjoyed its greatest prosperity. In the late 1960s they figured out a way to make a war hurt the population more than it hurt capital (and also they killed half a dozen of the people who were warning us about it), and USA has gone downhill ever since. Year after year, they introduce discrete &quot;shocks&quot; that devastate the poor and middle class, while always keeping the resources of the state ready to support the interests of capital. The &quot;mistakes&quot; of capitalism that we observe in every decade are in fact its most vital features. When the spoils of progress accrue to capital, they don&#x27;t accrue to humans. Even if we imagine they didn&#x27;t &quot;implement it properly&quot; last time, there&#x27;s no reason to expect they&#x27;ll do it &quot;properly&quot; next time either.')
