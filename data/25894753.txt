Looking at the issue in financial terms, having a child and bringing them up well is an enormous cost both in money and time. The most significant being the opportunity cost of at least one parent&#x27;s ability to participate economically being severely reduced for years. Brian Tomasik estimated that having a child may cost over $300k when measured in those terms, although there is some USA slant in his analysis (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reducing-suffering.org&#x2F;the-cost-of-kids&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reducing-suffering.org&#x2F;the-cost-of-kids&#x2F;</a>).<p>Now, Tomasik does mention that having children cannot be judged economically, it&#x27;s a special and important experience that you can&#x27;t place a price on. On the other hand, there&#x27;s no denying that raising a child in today&#x27;s world is simply unthinkable for many young adults who are struggling with insecurity in housing, careers, and a bleaker outlook on the future. Many commodities are historically cheap today but property is extremely less affordable, and most prospective parents would rather delay having children until they can achieve career stability and afford a reasonably-sized house, which is happening very late in life (if at all) compared to previous generations.<p>If governments were really serious about reversing the decline in birth rates, they should be looking at pursuing better policies for ensuring more people can afford a home, or providing free childcare at scale - tackling the underlying societal reasons why this trend is occurring rather than adding a hopelessly insufficient cash bandaid. Furthermore, a cash bonus creates a perverse incentive where some people may grab the short term reward without necessarily considering the long term sacrifice involved in having kids.')
