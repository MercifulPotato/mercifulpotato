What I learned was in the late 90&#x27;s better motor controls lead to a resurgence of electric golf carts especially for fleets. In most use cases electric is better logistically. The electric ones just run and run and they don&#x27;t require handling gasoline and oil. It&#x27;s really quick for an employee to plug the golf carts in at night. Pain in the ass to run around with gas cans. Not to mention having to store fuel on site.<p>Reason conversion to electric happened earlier for golf carts was electric golf carts only have about 4-5kwh worth of batteries. Interestingly historically lead acid batteries are about $100-150 per kwr. Which is close to where automotive grade lion batteries are now.<p>So no surprise that delivery trucks are converting to electric. They have the exact some scenario going on.')
