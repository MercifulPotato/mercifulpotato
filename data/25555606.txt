The eastern side (which included southernmost Italy, Greece, most of the mediterrenean, middle east - Syria, Lebanon, and balkans, and eastern (modern) turkey) persisted, kept and advanced the Roman civic structure, organization, legal system, etc and didn&#x27;t collapse during the middle ages.<p>That&#x27;s why you find e.g. levantine people like Taleb that feel and express the whole connection of their area back to the ancient times...')
