You can find lots of articles available, with no paywalls, through google scholar.\nI would start with Alvesson&#x27;s work on CMS.<p>We&#x27;ve actually used CMS to improve recruitment and retention of engineers in an organization.\nI subscribe to hard realism. We can&#x27;t pay like FAANG, and we can&#x27;t promise a fast career track. What do we offer? Oh, lots of things that don&#x27;t cost money but are highly valued by engineers. Honesty. Transparent culture - who gets paid more, promoted, and why. Engineering excellence - management does not decide on tech choices, all decisions are negotiated from the principle of compromise between excellence, financial viability and short-and long-term benefits. Not dictatorial &quot;transformational&quot; leadership, with &quot;agile&quot; on top.<p>Guaranteed no overtime for engineers. Flexible schedules. The opportunity to participate, in an active, self-determined, ethics-steered way, in creating tech solutions that impact millions of humans positively, with no moral gray areas.<p>This particular org is honest about not giving &quot;fuck-you money&quot;, but it also guarantees not bidding on military contracts, manipulating people to the lowest denominator, or engaging in surveillance capitalism.<p>From the earliest recruitment communication, we make it clear that we don&#x27;t do corporate cringe. No inspirational coaches. No transformational coaches. No coaches, period. We don&#x27;t do &quot;teambuilding&quot; exercises.\nWe do send people to conferences, on the company dime, and have the option of on-the-payroll personal project, for those that want it.<p><pre><code>  Surprising how easy it is to compete for talent with idiot companies that expect &quot;loyalty&quot; that they translate as &quot;blind obedience through fear&quot;.</code></pre>')
