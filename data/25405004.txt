Item(by='TMWNN', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607845593, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25381499, text='&gt;I&#x27;d be interested to learn more about what Best Buy did to rework their processes, but I doubt it will become public because operational improvements like this can be a real advantage over competitors.<p>It might be simpler than you think. I&#x27;ve noticed that Best Buy&#x27;s product listings consistently offer more product information (weight, dimensions, model numbers, and <i>especially</i> UPC) than the counterparts at Amazon, Target, and Walmart. All searchable, too; Amazon has the data but a) as mentioned, doesn&#x27;t always make it visible, and b) doesn&#x27;t always make it searchable.')
