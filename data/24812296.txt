The default ARM behavior is different. All this instruction does is perform a standard fpu operation, but instead of passing the current mode flags to the fpu, it passes a fixed set irrespective of the current processor mode.<p>As far as I can tell, any performance win comes from removing the branches after the ToInt conversion that are normally used to match x86 behavior.')
