Quite the contrary.  And it doesn&#x27;t deny them &quot;spoils&quot;, as though there&#x27;s a zero-sum prize, because there isn&#x27;t one.<p>If you&#x27;re really good at building tools, it will result in the creation of new, powerful tools which may be wielded for good or evil.  If <i>most other actors</i> out there will wield those tools you&#x27;re building for more evil than good, the <i>mere act of building those tools</i> will lead to more evil than good.<p>So I&#x27;m with cageface on this.<p>Deciding which tools to build does have consequences, and it&#x27;s other people who primarily decide how those tools will be used, not the toolmaker.  Sometimes you can already see what choices others look likely to make.<p>Some would argue this doesn&#x27;t place an ethical burden on the toolmaker, because you can&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t control other people.  That&#x27;s a different argument though.  Ethical or not, there are undeniably <i>consequences</i> from building tools when you can see how they are likely to be used.')
