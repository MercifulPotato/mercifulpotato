Item(by='wcoenen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601934105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24687688, text='&gt; There are only two types of euros: notes that are physical evidence of said money, and deposits in banks.<p>There are also &quot;bank reserves&quot;, which is the money sitting in the accounts that banks have at the central bank. Bank reserves, unlike deposits in a commercial bank, are equivalent to notes and coins and can be thought of as the current form of the digital euro. Banks use it for settlement of transactions between them. So the idea is to make this &quot;real&quot; digital money directly available to individuals and companies, like physical cash.')
