There, you could find real gems, math and physics books previously owned by the great french mathematicians (which were more expensive if they were ridden with handwritten notes).  I spend countless hours there as a student, until one day it wasn&#x27;t there anymore.  You can still order their books online, but it&#x27;s not at all the same thing.<p>These stalls never seemed interesting... they seem to be for tourists only.')
