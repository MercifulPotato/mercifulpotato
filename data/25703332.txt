But I&#x27;m making an even bolder statement:  that using concentration exercises like bicep curls, leg curls and (especially) 3-4 different angles of shoulder and chest work, espcially with machines and high reps, will very much increase your chances of injury.<p>I&#x27;m telling you that whenever I walk into a commercial gym or my building gym (i.e. not a powerlifting or oly gym) I see easily 90% of the people doing stuff I know is in bad form at worst, and at best will give them the most mild of training regimens.  I blame the culture of bodybuilding (in the U.S. at least.  I read  that in Eastern Europe there is a very different attitude and training culture starting from school).<p>I argue that barbell training -- functional training more broadly, which includes calisthenics if you want -- is vastly safer and superior to bodybuilding and indeed yes, it does require a bit of personal training and instruction in the beginning.')
