This along with advances in software&#x2F;hardware integration and being able to synergies that at a level nobody else can.   The way to think of it is - if Intel did an operating system from scratch, it would tap the CPU extremely well compared to others due to them knowing the internals better and fully.  Then add the ability for them to see that adding some dedicated hardware to replace some software instruction combinations and you start to see a tightly integrated team of CPU and Operating system&#x2F;software.<p>One area that I&#x27;ve always wished CPU&#x27;s would take would be a dedicated core or two for the OS that is completely isolated from the other cores, which would be for the software&#x2F;applications you run.  Now if those ran about two different architectures - darn that would be the inner geek in me appeased.')
