Seriously though, you sound very certain of your claim so let me at least offer a counterpoint, however anecdotal.<p>I&#x27;ve had tons of practical value out of some of my language skills. I would not have the career I have today if I hadn&#x27;t learned English as a second language. Admittedly my third language, German, was a bust, but I blame the way schools teach language for that (grammar, grammar, grammar). My fourth language, Thai, OTOH was a great investment not only because it made it possible for me to be self-sufficient and socialize (and make friends) while living in Thailand, it also was so different from the previous languages I knew that I could feel my mind expanding. Finally, I&#x27;ve also cracked my head at (Mandarin) Chinese but in that case the practical value has been much closer to 0 but it at least made it possible for me to travel around China on my own, which was well worth it at the time for me.')
