Now they are going to flag certain business as possible racists during a time of social unrest? How long will it take before one of these places gets targeted and burned down after a &quot;Peaceful Protest&quot; due to the Yelp warning? In civil law it is a balance of probabilities so wether or not it can be proven 100% that the flag made them a target, Yelp may still be found partially liable in court.')
