However, the fact is that employers will reasonably keep track of sicks leave and will in practice (and quite reasonably) have knowledge of health information very often including the illness.<p>Personally, I think things start to go too far. Saying that &quot;employee health is a personal matter&quot; is going too far. Intimate details are of course personal and people may not want to share too much (and that&#x27;s fine) but an employee&#x27;s health insofar it impacts their job very much concerns the employer, but it must be handled lawfully, reasonably, and tactfully by them. If the employer has a clear picture it is not necessarily negative for the employee as it means that the employer can adapt and take the appropriate supportive action.\nI think that the legislator recognises this, seeing that employment is an exception to the GDPR&#x27;s ban on health information processing (obviously without reason).')
