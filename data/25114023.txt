A novel, &quot;The Highliners&quot; by William McCloskey, is a coming of age set in the Alaska commercial fishery. Also good. While fascinating and culturally rich, I think it&#x27;s fair to say that small scale commericial fishing is a hard way make a marginal living. It&#x27;s a privilege to have other options to get by.')
