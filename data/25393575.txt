The tech is well understood already and they&#x27;re highly motivated and well funded.  It&#x27;s been tried a couple of times already and eventually they&#x27;re going to succeed.  And if the last two US presidential election results are any indication, they might grow as big (or bigger!) as any of the other social-media giants.  What will we do then?')
