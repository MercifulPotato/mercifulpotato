I was arguing with the &quot;predominant&quot; part he stated.  I&#x27;m not a blind moron.  I&#x27;m fully aware of bot manipulation.  Who isn&#x27;t?<p>Yet I was downvoted for simply trying to reign in the completely overblown nature of these statements.  These assertions since 2016 have been repeatedly made with partial and&#x2F;or zero evidence.<p>There is still zero evidence that the manipulation of social media by Russian assets in 2016 actually affected the votes of the American public.  As far as I can tell, the blue collar whites in the Rust Belt don&#x27;t exactly have a large presence on social media, let alone any record of statements saying they are changing their vote because of an advertisement.  This is all just playing into the hands of the DNC, who for two successive elections have manipulated the Democratic primary to kill Bernie Sanders, and immediately resort to &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot; mode to bamboozle his supporters into supporting their oppressors.')
