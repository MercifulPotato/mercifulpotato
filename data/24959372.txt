It&#x27;s not actually clear cut to me who was at fault.  The truck was in the right lane, the bus and SUV right behind in the left lane.   Bus merged right (into truck&#x27;s lane immediately in front) SUV could not occupy the space already occupied by the truck as SUV tried following bus.  Truck did not yield, SUV tried to wedge in and straddled both lanes.  There was subsequent contact but I&#x27;m not sure who initiated it.  Never the less, you should not drive in two lanes --you should wait till it&#x27;s safe to merge, it&#x27;s basic traffic safety to not change lanes till it&#x27;s safe to do so.')
