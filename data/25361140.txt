UMC actually invented it and TSMC joined the game later. Some people said UMC made the wrong decision to invest in China too early. That effort took too much of UMC&#x27;s resource. TSMC focused their resource in Taiwan and was able to move forward faster in technology when compare to UMC. When UMC made the move to China, Taiwan government were not happy, so I believe government direct resource to TSMC in retaliation to ensure TSMC has the edge. it is no wonder TSMC won the technology race.')
