Item(by='phoe-krk', descendants=None, kids=[24868246], score=None, time=1603445507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24867548, text='Author here.<p><i>The Common Lisp Condition System</i> is my first book and it was previously discussed on Hacker News[0] as soon as the Apress page for the book was first posted.<p>The HN discussion was very fruitful and insightful and prompted me to add more content about the condition system in general. Due to time constraints and the flow of working on the book, it was impossible to add this new stuff to the actual body of the book, so me and Apress have decided to publish this content as an appendix named <i>Discussing the Common Lisp Condition System</i> and release it[1] on the Internet. The appendix is free to download and use in any way and I&#x27;d like to once again thank everyone who participated in the original thread.<p>The book is currently available for purchase on Apress[2] (with chapter samplers) and Amazon[3].<p>The full source code is available on GitHub[4] and should be buildable under any conforming C compilers and any conforming Common Lisp implementations. I&#x27;m available for answering any questions about it and merging any PRs that might arrive.<p>I hope that the book is helpful in general and wish everyone who decides to try it a good read.<p>AMA.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23843525" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23843525</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Apress&#x2F;common-lisp-condition-system&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Appendix%20E&#x2F;Appendix%20E.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Apress&#x2F;common-lisp-condition-system&#x2F;blob&#x2F;...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apress.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;book&#x2F;9781484261330" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apress.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;book&#x2F;9781484261330</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Common-Lisp-Condition-System-Mechanisms&#x2F;dp&#x2F;148426133X" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Common-Lisp-Condition-System-Mechanis...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Apress&#x2F;common-lisp-condition-system" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Apress&#x2F;common-lisp-condition-system</a>')
