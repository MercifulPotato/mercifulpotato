When the USB stick I keep my home server&#x27;s file system on didn&#x27;t boot after a power outage I stuck it into my PC, performed the simplest repair on it (don&#x27;t remember which) and everything was great again.<p>The most annoying issue I&#x27;ve run into (and I really hate it) was being low on space and it being really hard to free some since it&#x27;s very intransparent what&#x27;s actually using it - but with btdu I mostly got that under control as well.<p>That said when repairing the boot drive I did experience some confusion due to there being multiple different ways - the documentation could be better on that front. For simple things at least (subvolume management, snapshot creation, checking free space) I&#x27;ve been quite happy with the btrfs command line tool.')
