Is everything just a string? They complain about how YAML handles booleans (fair criticism), however I can&#x27;t see how NestedText fixes this.<p>This feels far inferior to TOML (everything NextText does, and much more) or JSON (very unambiguous, works natively in most languages).<p>I see this a lot in startups and open source projects. They exist solely as a criticism of their competition (which is fair!), but don&#x27;t work to understand the real problems and fix them in any meaningful way. You can spot them when they talk a lot about what&#x27;s wrong with the competition (&quot;AWS is too expensive&quot;, &quot;YAML is too ambiguous&quot;) but never explain their solution.')
