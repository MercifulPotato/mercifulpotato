Have you considered other pricing models? One approach that comes to mind:<p>- Allow the user to use the full tool without ever having to sign-up.\n- Charge $3-5 for them to download it. Sign-up optional.\n- To prevent them from screenshotting it without paying, add a watermark that only gets removed once they&#x27;ve paid for the download.<p>I remember seeing a resume generator on HN many years ago that used this model (i.e. no sign up required&#x2F;pay upon download), and I thought it was clever: 1) it breaks down the barrier to use that the sign up causes; 2) it gets people bought-in&#x2F;proud of their beautiful cover and thus more likely to pay; 3) allows you to monetize one-time users. Meanwhile, you could also keep the monthly subscription for people who expect to use it a lot (designers, agencies, etc).')
