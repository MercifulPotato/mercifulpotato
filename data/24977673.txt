And no, it is not &#x27;like an electrician refusing to wear protective clothing&#x27;, it is much more like an electrical engineer that knows when to use auto-routing and when to route things themselves.<p>Besides, I&#x27;d love to see you make your case to HR: &quot;I want to fire this person because they don&#x27;t edit their text like I do&quot;.<p>Good luck with your career as a boss.')
