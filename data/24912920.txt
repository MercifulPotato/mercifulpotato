I’ve interviewed 100-200 engineers in my career and hired 10-15 of those. Not one of those hires was a failure and I didn’t need to incorporate puzzles as part of the interview process. If you’re an experienced engineer with a history of designing and delivering business solutions for multiple domains you should never need to ask trivial data structure and algorithms questions that can be easily looked up if they’re ever needed.')
