Back in early March of this year, &quot;conformism&quot; with respect to social distancing and wearing masks would have meant <i>not</i> doing it, because practically nobody else was doing it and all of the public health authorities were still saying it wasn&#x27;t necessary for the general population. Based on how the pandemic spread during that time period, that conformism was not a good idea. (And my wife and I did <i>not</i> conform; we started social distancing and wearing masks and gloves when making unavoidable trips to crowded places like the grocery store, at the end of February. Neither of us have had any health issues.)')
