The mechanism described in the Yahoo article is implausible to say the least (TANSTAFFL principle: if you could reverse aging by simply lengthening telomeres, there would have been significant evolutionary pressure for increased expression of telomerase, so unless it came with sufficiently bad downsides, you would expect it to have already reached fixation in the population). Still, I would be interested to see what the researchers themselves actually say.<p>I did find a related article, titled &quot;Telomere elongation followed by telomere length reduction, in leukocytesfrom divers exposed to intense oxidative stress â€“ Implications for tissueand organismal aging&quot; [1]. I would expect the actual findings here were similar to that article.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;citeseerx.ist.psu.edu&#x2F;viewdoc&#x2F;download?doi=10.1.1.208.4475&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;citeseerx.ist.psu.edu&#x2F;viewdoc&#x2F;download?doi=10.1.1.208...</a>')
