Item(by='winter_blue', descendants=None, kids=[24673642], score=None, time=1601746448, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24671686, text='&gt; Tried vyvanse. Only one side effect. The deepest most profound sadness imaginable. Would sit for hours just “sad”. Nothing was bothering me. Worked fine aside from that. Gave it up after a few weeks.<p>Omg, I actually experience <i>this very thing for myself</i>. I thought I was unique in experiencing the &quot;deepest most profound sadness imaginable&quot; from Vyvanse. It&#x27;s good to know it wasn&#x27;t just me.<p>I did eventually connect the dots with Vyvanse, after taking it a bunch of times. I did several &quot;test runs&quot; where I took it some days, and not other days, and the deep sadness always <i>and consistently</i> occurred about 3-4 hours after taking Vyvanse.<p>Thankfully, Adderall doesn&#x27;t have this horrible side effect.<p>&gt; Aderral did remove most of the “pain” from boring things. So in that regards it taught me how to manage symptoms better. Focus is still a major problem, and I’m back to older trucks of ear plugs and a dim room. But not as bad as before.<p>I&#x27;ve read that exercise can go a long way in mitigating ADHD. I&#x27;m trying to now motivate myself to exercise -- which if I&#x27;m able to do would essentially solve the problem ADHD (at least partially), <i>and create a positive feedback loop</i> that could improve my life for the better in the long run.')
