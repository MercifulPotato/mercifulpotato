In practice, this means that engineers are asked to draft the bulk of documentation, and the writers scramble to at least copy-edit it.<p>This seems like an organizational&#x2F;staffing mistake. In other engineering orgs you&#x27;d see these roles filled by applications engineers, who dogfood while evangelizing the product and writing its technical documentation. Ambiguity or questions are handled by conversations with the engineers that built it.')
