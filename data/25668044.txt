They created the lies, promoted them, and made sure the people heard them wherever they could reach them.  It&#x27;s not the media&#x27;s fault for taking action against these lies, and in doing so offended people so much that they had to resort to sedition.<p>It&#x27;s absurd to me to hear that people just needed to talk it out more openly!  If only someone could nicely tell them the truth!  As if all these people were discussing things in good faith and would listen to reality about their conspiracy theories.  Must we really coddle and give a voice to dangerous conspiracy theorists that have steadily gotten more and more extreme and violent?  They are being groomed and egged on by Republican leadership - surely that&#x27;s the source of the problem, and one that nobody seems to be able to do anything about.')
