Remember trying to do any kind of portable multi core in C&#x2F;C++ in 2000?  It was no surprise JVM languages took over and became what we’ve built Big Data on (Hadoop, Hive, spark, etc)<p>But they leave so much on the table for micro performance!  Take a CSV or JSON parser for example - likely spends all its time extracting string objects!<p>Now the Big Data community mostly doesn’t notice; for example, the Parquet code is about 5x slower than the Orc code, apparently, but we all adopt Parquet anyhow.<p>I’ve been going through my java codebases doing the basic stuff like “let’s write a simple fast json parser that doesn’t make a lot of garbage” and you can easily half the number of boxes you need etc.  sometimes order of magnitude improvements by writing java code that is more like C.<p>But there’s this level you cannot reach.  You look longingly at the raw mechanical sympathy C enabled.<p>Perhaps Rust is the future?  I expect we’ll just keep using more cores than necessary though.')
