So someone who spent five years in grad school getting a PhD and then spent another three years as a postdoc might be considered the equivalent of someone with four years of experience in industry.  If you are going to leave academia anyway it is much more efficient to do it as soon as possible.<p>It does depend on the role though.  If the company is hiring someone who is a world expert in your specific research subject it makes sense to have stayed to become the world expert.  But I think that&#x27;s unusual.  Much more commonly people leave academia and go into more generic &quot;data science&quot; type roles in which case extra postdoc years don&#x27;t really help you.<p>Of course if you enjoy the research and don&#x27;t mind the opportunity cost then there&#x27;s nothing wrong with staying.')
