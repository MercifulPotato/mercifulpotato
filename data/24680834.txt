IRIX os on them was a joy to use. Before this I had only used Windows 3.1 and Dos. SGI machines were always hogged by final year students and we poor 2nd year kids had only 486s with win 3.1. A friends brother got us a Slackware distro on 10 or so 3.5&quot; floppies. That was how I started.<p>Getting just the terminal or text mode was easy but getting Xwindows which was the GUI interface was a PITA at that time. Major issues was we had some generic monitors in the lab. There was this file xf86config that had the configuration for various monitors from different vendors. Noname Indian monitors were not there. I have fond memories of summer of 95 spending muggy afternoons changing frequency settings one slowly, save, restart cycles. Still remember the kick i got when i finally made it to work.')
