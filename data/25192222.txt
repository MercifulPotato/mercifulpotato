At least with gridlock they can&#x27;t screw things up worse than they are.<p>Just look at AB 5 in CA - tailored by labor unions with all sorts of collateral damage and unintended consequences that are still reverberating through CA economy.  What&#x27;s hilarious is that many independent tech writers who were in favor of it initially suddenly got to find out the wisdom of our legislators first hand when AB 5 proceeded to destroy their current business model as an independent, for higher worker.<p>Ha!  Delicious irony indeed.<p>Making new laws _should_ be hard.  It also would be good if congress started to do their job instead of delegating it to the executive branch.  And for every new hair brained law it would be awesome if they were required to at least remove one other one - removing five would be better still.<p>If you think complexity favors you vs. big businesses or special interests....')
