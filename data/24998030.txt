But &quot;little support&quot; implies that these goals are outside the mainstream of US politics (as does the prefix &quot;far-&quot;) and neither of these descriptions is supported by the numerical evidence.<p>I find it very frustrating that so many people seem to not want to acknowledge that they&#x27;re sharing the country with a lot of other people who don&#x27;t agree with them.<p>EDIT: To be clear, this isn&#x27;t a position based on personal political beliefs. I find it equally inappropriate to describe anti-abortion as a &quot;far-right&quot; belief. Even though it&#x27;s a minority of Americans that feel this way, it&#x27;s clearly a sizable enough minority that painting it as fringe somehow instead of mainstream is not justified.')
