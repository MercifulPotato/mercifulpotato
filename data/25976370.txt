Medieval Europe was closer to 40, but definitely not the magnitude I took from my initial source.<p>There are several ways to look at inequality. The most simplistic way to so do is looking at relative wealthy by decile and comparing the ratio between the top and bottom. In feudal society, everybody was relatively poor, and the wealth gap may be on the order of 10-100X. In modern times, that ratio may be far larger and under a certain definition that would be mean higher inequality. I&#x27;ll concede that this approach fails to capture the practical experience of the haves and have-nots over time, and having our&#x27;s hit all-time highs isn&#x27;t immoral if there is some baseline of sufficiency at the bottom. It also doesn&#x27;t account for social mobility, which we exceptional at.<p>Still, we live in a novel time where orders of magnitude of wealth that haven&#x27;t existed before. It is hard to fathom, and calls into question what is and isn&#x27;t a de-facto privilege of enjoying.<p>I found this article which offers some more nuanced approaches to measuring inequality in different societies than Gini. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de&#x2F;5388&#x2F;1&#x2F;MPRA_paper_5388.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de&#x2F;5388&#x2F;1&#x2F;MPRA_paper_5388.pdf</a>')
