You couldn&#x27;t breathe this outside of a writers room, anywhere, and yet, it&#x27;s something that probably a lot of people, even within the industry, absolutely love.<p>+ Walmart as a cultural monster, devouring society? Possibly not an unpopular idea, but definitely not one that anyone can do, because Walmart represents too much advertising power. Many of us hate Walmart, so where&#x27;s the Walmart skits on SNL? There are none, because they&#x27;re shills. SNL literally exists to sell Walmart ads.<p>+ Very simple articulation of how China is able to suppress and censor American businesses? Nobody in entertainment will touch this. Hollywood exists to sell films, and China will eventually be their biggest market.<p>+ Insufferable WholeFoods&#x2F;hipster gentrification culture?<p>+ Jesus snorting cocaine, depictions of Mohamed?<p>+ Wrestlers as posing, effect actors, ultra authoritarian &#x27;PC Bro&#x27; culture, Japanese businessmen deferring to the &#x27;large penises&#x27; of American businessmen for social favour, a &#x27;Token&#x27; Black character ...<p>Most of it is completely inane obviously, but the whole thing exists to satire&#x2F;make light commonly accepted norms with insufferable artifacts, or to give air to the the issues nobody can talk about. That&#x27;s what makes it funny.<p>&#x27;Man Bear Pig&#x27; was probably wrong and not in a good way, so they did another show about it ... which is great ... but really who cares? It was funny at the time.')
