No single number makes any sense.<p>A plunger can probably expect &lt;0.1% use of it&#x27;s capacity. But being stuck without one really sucks, the cost to rent is... once you account for the spent traveling back and forth would be higher than the cost of buying, and as a result literally everyone just buys them.<p>On the flip side a 20 year old fast food worker with $0 in their bank account probably just plain can&#x27;t afford to have 5x the housing capacity they actually use. That would bankrupt them. So they just don&#x27;t do it.')
