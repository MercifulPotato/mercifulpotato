Both my girlfriend and I have moved a lot during our educations and work histories, we would like somewhere to grow roots, have a vegetable garden, invite friends for barbecues, that sort of thing.<p>Upholding a nomad lifestyle means it&#x27;s very hard to establish and maintain friendships and we&#x27;ve both had to completely abandon several circles of friends over the years, due to moving. That&#x27;s not something I enjoy.')
