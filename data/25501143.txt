They own like 70-80% of every EV market they compete in.  This is the kind of criticism you&#x27;d read about Tesla in 2014.  The companies that &quot;have been building cars for decades&quot; are getting stomped by Tesla in this space, 12x more Model 3&#x27;s were sold than LEAF&#x27;s in the US last year.<p>At some point the established wisdom among some people that Tesla is failing is going to change, right?  The ship has sailed on that, left the harbor, and is half way across the ocean by now.<p>And the weirdest thing here is that it&#x27;s not an attempt to attack Tesla from the perspective of established auto makers but from <i>Apple Computer</i>, a company with no experience at all in the market and almost nothing to bring to the table <i>but</i> &quot;brand status&quot; (and a freighter full of cash, of course).')
