The burden to configure each software to have tracing or mTLS is higher than finding out how each software might handle HTTP_PROXY.<p>So yeah, I am a big fan of gRPC with contexts, deadlines client certificates, but in an integrated heterogeneous environment you can only do so much.<p>At least this is my current understanding. If somebody has better&#x2F;other experiences please help :)')
