You turn on the rx and listen for a few hundred milliseconds, then turn off. This is very low power. Later you push these to a server (a smartphone or the cloud) which computes the position. This is called snapshot processing.<p>So if you don&#x27;t need the position in real time for navigation it is quite possible to track location over a week with a tiny battery. This could be time triggered and&#x2F;or based on MEMs counters (which are also power friendly). Or you could calculate locally if the user explicitly asks.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieeexplore.ieee.org&#x2F;document&#x2F;5708033" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ieeexplore.ieee.org&#x2F;document&#x2F;5708033</a>\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;publica.fraunhofer.de&#x2F;documents&#x2F;N-464241.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;publica.fraunhofer.de&#x2F;documents&#x2F;N-464241.html</a>')
