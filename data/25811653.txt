A man with a rifle can cause dozens of deaths. A man with a big enough megaphone can cause millions of deaths.<p>It’s funny that the specious argument that the second amendment doesn’t protect arms the framers didn’t have available isn’t applied to the first amendment. The Internet and mass persuasion is way more unforeseeable than a rifle that shoots faster. Perhaps it’s time for common sense speech control? This isn’t unconstitutional, freedom of speech is not unlimited under the constitution it’s just a matter of where to draw the lines.')
