On the one hand, it does make it harder for newer businesses to enter the space. However, from what I have been able to piece together, the real culprits here are DoorDash and GrubHub, by listing restaurants without permission&#x2F;agreements in the first place, necessitating the creation of this law. You&#x27;re probably right that GrubHub and DoorDash are cheering at the moment, unless the law gets applied retro-actively (though I highly doubt that).<p>&gt; Indexing and aggregating data is already covered by numerous laws. If Google can aggregate restaurant listings without permission then why can&#x27;t others? Linking is ok, showing a call button is ok, but delivering isn&#x27;t?<p>Searching for information on the internet and having food delivered are not the same experience; I&#x27;m usually not &quot;hangry&quot; when my search results take too long to come up, and&#x2F;or are not what I was expecting. Even so, I usually blame Google for the bad results. It &quot;should&quot; be the same for food delivery services as well, where people &quot;should&quot; blame DoorDash&#x2F;GrubHub, but that rarely happens. For better or worse, it is the restaurant that takes the blame, and risks losing future business.<p>Most people I have spoken to regarding this issue were under the assumption that the delivery service already had agreements in place with these restaurants. A lot of these people are business owners themselves, and were surprised to find out that no such agreements existed; much like I was when I first found out about this issue.<p>&gt; The law around copyright is clear: you can&#x27;t copy a restaurants menu without permission the same way you can&#x27;t copy someone&#x27;s blog post. This should be enough.<p>True. It &quot;should&quot; be enough, but in practice, it rarely is. Most companies operate knowing that legal processes are lengthy and expensive and take that into account when modeling their business practices.<p>&gt; Why don&#x27;t restaurants want delivery companies doing this? The typical argument is bad Yelp reviews. Instead of blaming delivery companies why not blame Yelp for not authenticating their reviews?<p>When you&#x27;re a small-business owner losing business due to the activities of some third-party service you did not authorize to represent you in the first place, you&#x27;re usually not looking to blame another third-party service for the bad reviews you didn&#x27;t know you were getting; especially one whose &quot;business-model&quot; was to blackmail restaurants to take down bad reviews. As a business owner, it is my right to know my customer and know anyone who is (mis)using my brand without my permission.<p>&gt; Restaurants should be benefiting from delivery companies distributing their products, and there is nothing preventing them from offering direct to consumer deliveries themselves.<p>A handful of restaurants I order from on DoorDash&#x2F;GrubHub usually have their own delivery crew. It isn&#x27;t a requirement for every restaurant to offer delivery. Elsewhere in this thread, there was the issue of certain food items (usually the restaurant&#x27;s speciality) having very precise kitchen-to-table  time requirements. It is hard for a restaurant owner to control their product when they don&#x27;t have any control over the delivery process. And when they choose to not have delivery, they are bypassed entirely by these third-parties. Seems perfectly fine for the restaurant to fight back against such practices.<p>EDIT: fixed typo')
