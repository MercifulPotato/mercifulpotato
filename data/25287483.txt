They need them in the workforce for an economically sustainable future. They know they are heading for crisis rapidly and investing hard to get out of there. However, they are ridiculously dependent on oil. Oil money is basically the whole country&#x27;s sugar daddy (not for the slaves and foreign workers...). People don&#x27;t really work there, they all just live off the oil money. Literally every aspect of their lives need to change.<p>I really doubt the rest of the world needs to be too concerned about them. They are pretty uniquely fucked and not that many people anyway.')
