I get why you wouldn&#x27;t want to raise kids in somewhere like NYC (though I can also see the inverse).<p>I don&#x27;t comment often on HN but I feel like I had to chime in here with a bunch of questions. These may sound inflammatory but I mean them sincerely, I just don&#x27;t see where people are coming from. I understand that a lot of the things I&#x27;m listing are negatives for some people, I&#x27;m just shocked that it seems like they&#x27;re negatives for 99.99% of people. Like, I&#x27;d expect at least a little more of a balance<p>I don&#x27;t understand all of the hate for big cities recently. I mean do THAT many people truly hate living in a big vibrant city? Do that many people really want to have to get into their car and drive 25 minutes to the only (probably subpar) ramen shop in town. Does everyone just want a big 6 bedroom house that they can sit in and read&#x2F;watch TV all day? Are you gonna go out on all that land more often then you would go out to eat world class, multicultural food? No one likes&#x2F;wants public transit anymore? Having tons of theaters, shops, bars, etc around? You don&#x27;t want access to the [some of the] most interesting jobs in the world? Surrounded by people who are world class at what they do? Being able to go to a bar and find someone who&#x27;s a musician, someone who&#x27;s an actor, someone from wall street, someone who sells hotdogs, etc all in the same place? How could you go from NYC to Madison, WI and not be so bored that you want to blow your brains out? It&#x27;s a completely different world.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just the midwestern cities that I&#x27;ve been in, but they&#x27;re all so dead. Everyone just seems to be ok with the status quo. Everyone just goes home and watches TV until work the next day. Maybe once a year they take a beach vacation, and then the other week they have off they see family for the holidays.<p>I mean yes, I get that it&#x27;s expensive. I&#x27;m just surprised that SO may people have been seemingly staying in this place that they hate, driving up rent prices for everyone who wants to be in the city, just so they could keep whatever job they have. I mean if you really hated the city wouldn&#x27;t you have looked elsewhere by now? It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s competitive to get a job in one of these midwestern cities, so surely that great job you had in NYC that tied you there would guarantee you a way out of the city.')
