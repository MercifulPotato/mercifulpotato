Its not like this has not happen before, SARS like virus&#x27;s have crossed species within modern history that we have detected, and they all flame out eventually.  I&#x27;m no virologist, but I believe its typically because of selection pressure and the mutations needed to start to adapt to humans don&#x27;t come easily once a jump occurs, it usually takes a few jumps to get it right.  This one came out already well adapted to humans and has a furin site not seen in other bat corona viruses, plus 4 additional amino acid chains that give it even more ability to infect cells.  This is why Elon Musk got egg on his face for making the prediction that it would be over within a few months, that was based on past outbreaks.<p>Bret is very clear that yes, this can happen naturally, but the chances are very slim that such a alignment of events occurred in proximity to a lab that was performing gain of function research which does this very thing of combining aspects of multiple viruses and rapidly adapting them in either other animal hosts or petri dishes of cells, including human cells.')
