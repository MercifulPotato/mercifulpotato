Item(by='gojomo', descendants=None, kids=[25781914], score=None, time=1610652276, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25780157, text='Twitter&#x27;s CEO Jack Dorsey has repeatedly been summoned before Congress to be dressed-down by legislators, who regularly threaten to &quot;do something&quot; that increases Twitter&#x27;s liabilities or otherwise encumbers their business, if Twitter doesn&#x27;t change their internal policies. In some cases, it&#x27;s been suggested that discretionary government powers under existing laws could be used to reward or punish Twitter. Twitter&#x27;s been the topic of executive orders &amp; criticism from the FCC chair.<p>If Twitter&#x27;d been left to do anything it thought legal and wise, and only challenged via formal lawsuits or prosecutions that courts could rule on, then sure, Twitter can do whatever they want.<p>But now that politicians, elected officeholders, &amp; appointed regulators have all piled-on with their opinions of what Twitter should do, &quot;or else&quot;, might there be some government-restricting-expression issues to consider? Is it a coincidence that they only took strong action against Trump once he became a &quot;lame duck&quot;, and the action they took will specifically please the incoming administrations&#x27; coalition?<p>Has the government found the perfect 1st Amendment loophole, by laundering their speech-restricting preferences through threats – &quot;because of the implication&quot; – while maintaining a facade of non-involvement in this &quot;private&quot; decision?')
