People don&#x27;t often self-host things at the home, so it&#x27;s unlikely anyone out there would see my DNS record and assume that it&#x27;s of value and a useful tool for correlating my IP with my identity (and this actor would need to have eyes on a lot of different services&#x27; server logs in order to have data to _maybe_ correlate with me in the first place).')
