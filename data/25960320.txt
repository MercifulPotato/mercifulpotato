I held for years and didn&#x27;t make any money (maybe a little from BTC increases?). You could buy some and hold and check the price every waking hour for the next few years waiting for another pump where you can 2x your investment, or you could move on with your life and not got get sucked into stupid fantasy money making schemes.')
