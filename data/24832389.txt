Item(by='tgsovlerkhgsel', descendants=None, kids=[24834407, 24833949, 24834509], score=None, time=1603151371, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831216, text='In general, I agree.<p>However, their decision to force PINs <i>broke</i> Signal for one of my non-technical contacts, to this day (despite them supposedly offering an opt-out now). This person opens Signal, gets some weird confusing modal dialog, and is now stuck.<p>There is supposed to be a way to opt out without having to set and remember a PIN now, but I was unable to guide this person to find it, and I can&#x27;t exactly travel there to see what&#x27;s on the screen and find the damn button (or figure out why it isn&#x27;t showing up). So this person can no longer use Signal, and we had to fall back to WhatsApp. Which leaks more information, but has a killer feature that Signal now lacks: it allows me to communicate with this person!<p>(For those unaware: Signal made a really boneheaded decision a couple months ago, against all specific criticism that they were receiving - they introduced PINs that would then be used to back up at least metadata to the server, protected under a questionable scheme whose security assumptions only work if SGX is unbreakable. To force users into this, they blocked access to the messenger and your messages, so you had to set a PIN and upload your data if you wanted to talk to your friends and didn&#x27;t have a contact for them on a different messenger.)<p>Intentionally breaking a product like this also breaks <i>trust</i>. I can no longer rely on Signal for &quot;just wanting a video chat with Grandma and Grandpa&quot;. I can no longer trust that Moxie will make reasonable decisions, and not e.g. tomorrow break my ability to communicate with people unless I agree to upload my message history.')
