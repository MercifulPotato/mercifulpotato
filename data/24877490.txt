Take the extreme case of that some energy source requires huge amount of CO2 to build, but produces no emissions during operation. Is that a zero emission source? Also for nuclear we need to include the uranium mining, and ideally we would account for waste storage as well (not sure if that goes into current estimates).<p>Now the OP argument disingenuous because he also included emmissions of other sources into wind and solar. However as many have already pointed out it would  be much easier to run a grid on renewables only than at nuclear only, because for renewables you only need a large enough grid and overprovisioning. Nuclear on the other hand is very bad at handling variable loads, so you will essentially have to overprovision to the the peak demand and run your plants at that demand and burn the energy somehow. Note that Belgium used to do that by illuminating all their highways at night.')
