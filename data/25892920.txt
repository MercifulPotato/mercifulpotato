Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=[25892936], score=None, time=1611503121, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25869297, text='The key here is that, if time travel is possible, you would experience the events like this :<p>1. You start your day normally<p>2. You meet yourself from the future and discuss some niceties.<p>3. Many years later, you enter a time machine, and you arrive back at time 2, where you have that conversation with yourself that you remember.<p>The past has already happened, so it can&#x27;t change. So, if you haven&#x27;t met a time traveler so far, that is proof that no one will ever time travel to the moment and place where you just were, even if time travel becomes possible in the future.<p>Now, you may ask, &#x27;what happens if at step 3 I decide to shoot myself, or not have that conversation?&#x27;. Here the answer is simple : that question makes no sense. You have already done our not fine these things, there is no power of decision that could influence this. It&#x27;s like asking &quot;what if I now decide that yesterday I didn&#x27;t go to the store&quot;. The fact that the event at time 2 happened is fixed both in the past and the future. It was in fact fixed at the time of the universe&#x27;s creation.<p>Now, you may not accept determinism, or you may believe in free will, and there are good reasons for both (quantum indeterminism, subjective experience, etc.). In either case, I don&#x27;t think you can believe in time travel, since all of the paradoxes reappear. But if you believe the past and the future are already set in stone, there is no paradox if the two cross each other in certain ways. But it doesn&#x27;t make sense about what you &#x27;will decide to do&#x27;, because this is as fixed as what you ate yesterday.')
