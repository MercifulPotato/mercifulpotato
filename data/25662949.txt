Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25666239], score=None, time=1609969251, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25662345, text='&gt; People should be held accountable for what they say on media platforms, and lies shouldn&#x27;t be allowed.. but i can&#x27;t see that even happening.<p>I&#x27;ve suggested to @dang that he tries implementing a kind of experimental discussion mode like that right here on HN, where for certain types of topics he could enable this mode and see what the effect would be on the human mind.<p>I don&#x27;t know all the particulars of what changes should be included in such a mode (would be a good topic for a discussion), but the main one I would include is an additional guideline something along the lines of &quot;Please exert some effort in restricting your statements to the discussion of reasonably conclusive <i>true</i> facts about physical reality.&quot;<p>This way, when people inevitably succumb to mistaking the virtual reality in their mind (where one has supernatural powers like omniscience, the ability to read minds at scale, predict the future with precise accuracy, completely  understand infinitely complex indeterminate&#x2F;chaotic systems, etc) for physical reality (where we do not have these powers), such comments could be flagged and reviewed a few days later (when cooler heads prevail) in a group Post Incident Review process of some sort (maybe a zoom meeting), where we could examine our behavior from a more metaphysical perspective, the goal being to increase awareness of the fact that inaccurate beliefs about reality are not something that only members of our personal outgroups suffer from, but rather something we all suffer from.  It is simply a consequence of the same base software we all run in our minds.<p>Unfortunately, this idea seems to be rather unpopular (shocking!) - so, the beatings will continue until morale improves (or some variation of that), or until this never ending process comes to its natural conclusion.  Mother Nature is a cruel mistress.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;humorinamerica.wordpress.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;19&#x2F;the-morphology-of-a-humorous-phrase&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;humorinamerica.wordpress.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;19&#x2F;the-morpholo...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3MHExbJGIQs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3MHExbJGIQs</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;smX2UtdJFq8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;smX2UtdJFq8</a> (<i>not recommended for filthy casuals</i>)')
