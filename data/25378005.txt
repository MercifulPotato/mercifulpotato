I can also select the footnote toggles by tabbing, and toggle them with the keyboard. But canâ€™t select them in a random-access way with link hinting (I mentioned vimperator), because they are not links nor something else, such as an input field, that gets a hint. So that&#x27;s a slight advantage on the side of using some kind of link for the footnotes. But really, this just shows me that link-hinting systems should include detail toggles as targets.')
