I&#x27;ve skimmed the Racket docs, but never took the plunge, in part because the license weirds me out a bit. Scheme always struck me as the better designed language, but Common Lisp tends to be more pragmatic. The latest Scheme reports only made the problem worse by further fragmenting the community.<p>The main problem I tended to have when starting projects in CL&#x2F;Scheme was library support. Sure, I could wrap whatever libraries I needed in SWIG or the implementation&#x27;s FFI, but that was work taken out of my all-too-small pool of time to work on something that wasn&#x27;t the problem that interested me.<p>Clojure solves this problem by being hosted while also making a lot of the language changes I once dreamed of making to Scheme and Common Lisp.')
