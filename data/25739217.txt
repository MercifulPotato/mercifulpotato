And I agree with the court&#x27;s opinion there,<p>&gt; &quot;These later decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.&quot;<p>I could be wrong, but I don&#x27;t think anyone advocating for it, especially from behind a keyboard, actually expected storming the capital to happen, and it seems like it only happened as a result of law enforcement essentially giving it it&#x27;s blessing. As pointed out by your sibling comment, calling a group of people who mostly milled around the capital &quot;insurrectionists&quot; is just fallacious, and tells you how loaded this whole thing is. I&#x27;m extremely concerned that this spectacle is going to be used to curtail our liberties the same way 9&#x2F;11 was used to pass the Patriot act.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m in crazy town when I see so much being done to stop &quot;inciting violence&quot;. Isn&#x27;t it ultimately the responsibility of the public to not act on such incitements?  When a group becomes sufficiently disenfranchised the most radical members transition from trying to make peaceful change to calling for revolution. If the disenfranchisement continues unabated more and more members of the group will be convinced of the need for action.  This is fundamentally why the U.S. exists, and I think it is the right of the oppressed group to self-advocate and self-determine.<p>So in that sense I don&#x27;t think that anyone can honestly say that calls for violence are never appropriate. Any revolution, even a velvet one, is going to have some fringe of people calling for violence or it will never come about. Should western media have shut down the Arab spring for the same reason? What about #freepalestine? There were plenty of calls for violence against Trump, and nobody seemed too concerned. Should Kathy Griffin have been blackballed?<p>If we define this group of people as predominantly non-college educated, non-hispanic white males, then we are talking about a group whose deaths of despair (suicide and drug overdose) rate has tripled in the last twenty years, a trend that has likely intensified significantly during the lockdown [1]. Now I could be wrong, but I don&#x27;t think they are killing themselves because they aren&#x27;t allowed to be racist, rather I think it&#x27;s because non-college educated rural americans[2] are being and have been marginalized.[3]<p>Perhaps we should try and lift this group up instead of grinding them down and using them as a scape goat for problems primarily related to wealth inequality.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencenews.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;deaths-of-despair-depression-mental-health-covid-19-pandemic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencenews.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;deaths-of-despair-depres...</a>\n[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americancommunities.org&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;american-communities-experience-deaths-of-despair-at-uneven-rates&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americancommunities.org&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;american-communi...</a>  \n[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.the74million.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;solving-the-rural-education-gap-experts-weigh-in-on-new-reports-findings-tying-gap-to-prosperity&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.the74million.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;solving-the-rural-educa...</a><p>e: formatting')
