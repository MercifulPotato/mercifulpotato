Talking to my younger colleagues I generally get a deep feeling that they know what they are talking about, are thoughtful and make good decisions.<p>But the thing is, that&#x27;s just branding: they aren&#x27;t actually much more competent or thoughtful than my generation was at that age, they just <i>seem</i> like it.  When I look at the code they write, it is as bad as the code I wrote.  They have startling gaps in their knowledge and experience, just as I did (and no doubt still do — there is always something to learn!).<p>The thing that worries me is that until one gets to more objective measures, they really do seem more competent and trustworthy — which means that others are more likely to trust them, which is likely to lead to more bad decisionmaking at scale.<p>I wonder, though, if there is really a difference at all.  Maybe my generation actually seemed more competent to our betters than we really were, too!')
