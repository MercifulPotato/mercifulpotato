So do you mean it is safe as long as -mno-red-zone is used?<p>Even then, I am not quite sure: redzone is just an example of one of the assumptions that might be violated when calls are made from an asm block, but at least some gcc devs are on record saying that calls from inline asm are not supported: the main problem is that leaf functions can be compiled differently than non-leaf, and a hidden call breaks this (i.e., a non-leaf function may appear as leaf to the compiler).')
