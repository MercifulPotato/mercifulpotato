If a package I want isn’t compatible with my license config at work, I think I’m more likely to find a different package or try to get a license than I am to change my package manager confit away from the team sanctioned settings, potentially opening my employer to what I now explicitly know to be legal risk.<p>I’m thinking about the packages I usually use and I don’t know their licenses. Pandas? Pytorch? I assume I can use them at work because everyone else does. If my package manager told me otherwise, I don’t have to be proactive.')
