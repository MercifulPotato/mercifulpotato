Sometimes, it&#x27;ll just refuse to stop when press &quot;stop&quot;.  It&#x27;ll continue replicating the mouse to the other computer.<p>Other times, it&#x27;ll refuse to start working again, requiring me to restart one or both computers, with know way to know which is messed up.<p>If I could guarantee one of the non-subscription ones would work properly, I&#x27;d probably pay.  But since Barrier is apparently a fork of Synergy, I don&#x27;t trust it.  And most of the others have weird monetization, or I&#x27;ve heard bad things about their customer service...  So I don&#x27;t trust any of them.<p>In the end, I&#x27;m still using Barrier and just dealing with its problems.')
