Yes. When it comes to the snakes FAANG have created biting the hand that feeds on the industry stage? No. I absolutely love to watch their internal dramas spill out for all to see or, if you&#x27;re smart, take warning from.<p>&gt;I don&#x27;t know if Gebru actually qualifies aside the matters of ethical AI. In my experience those people who work in engineering who sidewalks into some non-engineering matters often lack skills to compete where most do, and decided to leverage their incompetency with some other topics. And Gebru is doing exactly that in Google.<p>Not in a position to comment on this person&#x27;s credentials or skills but I don&#x27;t personally begrudge the type of grifter you&#x27;re talking about. Most of us are merely trying to optimize for income and they&#x27;re no different, and their success is a result of poor leadership in companies and&#x2F;or society.')
