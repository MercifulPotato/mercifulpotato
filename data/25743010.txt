I lost interest a minute into the article and skimmed the rest of it and didn&#x27;t take much from it. The blob before the first subheading just repeats that the Toronto scene is not a good one â€“ this could have taken just 3-5 sentences, and not 5 paragraphs. The part about good&#x2F;bad angels, finite&#x2F;infinite game typically would have been interesting to me but I was asleep by then. I recommend putting a summary in the first blob, and&#x2F;or making the subheadings more informative e.g. instead of &quot;Angels&quot; &quot;Deal Speed and Founder Leverage&quot;, should say &quot;Angels are Shortsighted and Play Finite Games&quot; and &quot;Deal Speeds are Magnitudes Slower&quot;.')
