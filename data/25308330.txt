We were all D1 athletes. I&#x27;m the slowest by a pretty substantial margin.<p>However, I matured faster than my brothers and, having been able to observe them, picked up proper techniques and approaches to training earlier than they did.

That access to training with older kids who were bigger, faster and more mature accelerated my development both physically and mentally.')
