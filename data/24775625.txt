The Holocaust, and its uniqueness, are fact. Israel’s behavior towards Palestinians today is reprehensible. These are neither incompatible, nor does the latter diminish the former.<p>We can expect more from Israel than, say, Sudan, because it is a democracy, relatively rich, and part of “the west”. To instead use the Holocaust to place additional burdens on them is cynical. So stop whining about your youth. It was probably terrible, but the Jews weren’t involved in that. And, unlike many of them, you got to survive to adulthood.')
