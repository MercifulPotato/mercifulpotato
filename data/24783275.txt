Going to a bar or a club is absolutely social.  And can absolutely be anonymous.<p>Granted, that does include personal contact, but there&#x27;s no requirement to identify yourself, or if you do, provide accurate information.<p>I&#x27;d say the same is true for online interaction.  When you <i>interact</i> with others (such as me responding to your comment) that&#x27;s a social interaction.<p>Whether it&#x27;s a <i>meaningful</i> or <i>useful</i> social interaction is a different question, but definitely social interactions, IMHO.<p>&gt;On anonymous sites you may get into a generic argument, but you don&#x27;t lose reputation, you&#x27;re not personally attacked in your identity, and you can&#x27;t be ostracised.<p>That&#x27;s absolutely true.  At the same time, it doesn&#x27;t make those interactions not &quot;social interactions,&quot; just anonymous or pseudonymous ones.<p>Just like the ones you might have on a subway or in the checkout line at a supermarket.')
