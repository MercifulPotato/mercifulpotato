Not great, but one of the privacy considerations to be aware of when using one of these devices.<p>But I, for example, have my Echo configured to automatically delete voice recordings, and to disallow manual review. I&#x27;m pretty comfortable with the privacy compromise involved.<p>Maybe what you&#x27;re actually driving at is the somewhat more dodgy practices involved around consent. Everybody should criticise Amazon for their processes here. Manual review is probably generally unexpected, and the default option for an Alexa speaker should be recording no data and allowing no manual review, with both features being explicitly opt-in. This is something it would be fair to pressure Amazon to do, if it&#x27;s not already the case.<p>But the point is â€“ it&#x27;s a dumb argument that &quot;anybody who uses one of these devices doesn&#x27;t get to complain&quot; and I&#x27;m bored of it.')
