If that&#x27;s not possible you have to tell your employer, manager, customer when you will and will not make yourself available for work-related calls and emails.<p>I work freelance, remote for about ten years now. I tell my customers up front what days and times they can expect to reach me by phone or email (or Slack or whatever they are using), and I make myself available during those times. If they have an emergency they can call anytime, but if they abuse that I will charge them double rate for calling. We agree in advance what constitutes an emergency.<p>I also use the &quot;do not disturb&quot; feature on my phone to disable incoming calls from people not in my contact favorites, and to turn off email&#x2F;Slack&#x2F;etc. notifications during the times I&#x27;m not &quot;working.&quot;<p>It comes down to setting expectations and not letting your job rule your life.')
