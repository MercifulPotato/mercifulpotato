Then you just go on about some irrelevant stats regarding the size of the public sector etc. While other countries realise that the &quot;free market&quot; needs to be curtailed in many spheres to not do too much damage, the US have decided that this isn&#x27;t an issue and people need to take care of themselves on the &quot;free market&quot;. Hence the lack of proper welfare and universal health care (and we can go on to worker benefits if you&#x27;d like, or perhaps higher education?).')
