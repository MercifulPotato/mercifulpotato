What comes to mind is blocking of the phone call recording API in Android. I can imagine insurance companies and various other organisations involved in from phone sales to outright scams had a &quot;talk&quot; with Google to have this removed from the phones as consumers had too much power. I myself got scammed by insurance company - they claimed I will get a certain option, but after I paid and got all the paperwork, there was no mention of the option I was supposed to get. Thankfully I recorded all calls with that company and only when I said I had them lying on record they changed their tune and refunded me. I am now struggling to find a new phone that can record calls as if there was a conspiracy to never talk about this feature as well. I couldn&#x27;t find any review that would test if call recording is possible.')
