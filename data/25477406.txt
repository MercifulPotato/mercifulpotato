Item(by='Veen', descendants=None, kids=[25477496], score=None, time=1608386177, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25476956, text='&gt; intricate left-wing, working-class, Marxist, etc. mission.<p>I think this is a mischaracterization. When conservatives complain about the Guardian&#x27;s (and the BBC&#x27;s) left-wing agenda, they don&#x27;t mean the older socialist working-class left. They mean the modern elite leftism focused on identity politics, critical race theory, critical gender theory, and so on. That conflict is still playing out, as we saw with Suzanne Moore&#x27;s recent defenestration. Interestingly, this older generation of leftists are being published by traditionally conservative publications like the Spectator and newish center-right publications like Unherd and The Critic Magazine.')
