Most people try other outlets. If there are no other outlets available, then they tend to give up. Deplatforming has been shown to work.<p>And it&#x27;s worth remembering that going violent means putting their life at high risk. Their family at risk. Their possessions and personal freedom at risk. And it means hurting other people. There&#x27;s fortunately not many people willing to take that step and pay that price.<p>Just think about what would cause more violence: banning all nazis from Twitter? Or allowing nazis free reign to talk about how horrible minorities are, and what they&#x27;d like to do to them?')
