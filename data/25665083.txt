Is that a &quot;big marketing effort&quot; or does it fit into community?&quot;<p>There’s definitely lots of overlap between content and community, and generally we don’t try to draw hard lines, as context matters so much.<p>For the purposes of this question, though, we can think in terms of a spectrum.
