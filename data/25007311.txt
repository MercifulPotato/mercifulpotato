Only fixing the broken system does that. Containerization lets you apply your fix to all the hosts that you want fixed, and as we have thoroughly established, the number of those hosts in this scenario is one.<p>So far I have been told that containerization fixes configuration problems and allows multiple services to be configured the same way. No container will fix a typo in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;dovecot&#x2F;config.d&#x2F;20-imap.conf, and no container management system will make nginx.conf look like sendmail.cf.<p>&quot;running&#x2F;updating images are all single line commands&quot;<p>There is some kind of elven glamour being cast over Kubernetes, Docker, and other container&#x2F;VM&#x2F;serverless systems that confuses people about the difference between configuring a service to be useful and managing the lifecycle of that service over a scalable number of machines. Docker cannot update an image that you have not already fixed.<p>This reminds me of the MBA illusion, that claims that all management can be performed most efficiently by a management specialist with no particular knowledge or skills in the actual production process; all of that is irrelevant detail for somebody else to do.<p>I assure you that detailed understanding is the sine qua non of getting things done.')
