I used to build a custom launcher&#x2F;theme&#x2F;background widget setup, now I tend to even keep the stock background because I basically never see it anyway. Same with customising apps. I tend to just learn the defaults and then it works wherever I use it.<p>That said there are certain customisations which do really impact my productivity, and they tend to be ones which are &#x27;off the beaten path&#x27;, so I&#x27;m very much in favour of keeping software configurable. There are also tools which I spend a lot of effort hammering into a usable state using their options and extension support, and I wish they would take a more &#x27;toolkit and framework&#x27; approach (as opposed to thousands of ad-hoc options), and&#x2F;or present a more useful default.')
