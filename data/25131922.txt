If there&#x27;s _any_ reasonable chance it was a lab mistake, that absolutely should be investigated thoroughly, so it doesn&#x27;t happen again. And the fact is, gain of function research is already controversial, because of the obvious potential safety risks.<p>Second, most of us live in democracies. Even if it can&#x27;t be proven, voters should absolutely know if a lab mistake is plausible, so we can make good decisions on what types of risks we&#x27;re willing to take for scientific research, and what kinds of oversight are appropriate.')
