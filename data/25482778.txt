There&#x27;s also the requirement that the network has enough participants that no single party can gain a majority of the network&#x27;s compute power, which seems a very iffy assumption with private&#x2F;permissioned blockchains.<p>So I don&#x27;t see how blockchain is useful in a healthcare context. Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong and enlightenen me if I&#x27;m missing something.')
