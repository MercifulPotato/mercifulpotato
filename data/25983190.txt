Apple’s recent history in political manipulations includes swapping the gun emoji for a squirt gun emoji, banning Parler, and more. Now, I’m no less alarmed that they could “end” Facebook even if I’m not a fan of Facebook and even if privacy protections help me.<p>This issue is that there simply isn’t much choice in the market here - between Google and Apple it’s two companies from the same area espousing the same political culture. Having them influence and control the entire world between them is dangerous. Unfortunately I don’t see viable competition for them on mobile devices. Who would we look to - Purism?')
