What does something being <i>real</i> mean? It&#x27;s got to mean that observations are consistent with the description of that something. That&#x27;s actually all we can do, check that observations aren&#x27;t disagreeing with what the model said. So if an electron is a tiny little thing that is deflected by a magnetic field, has a certain mass, etc, then it&#x27;s real insofar as we observe those qualities. In the same way if Santa Claus isn&#x27;t real, it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s issues with the evidence.<p>This doesn&#x27;t preclude there being a better model of course. Observations can get more sophisticated, revealing that your model needed adjustment. Or parsimony can drive and someone finds a way to describe multiple phenomena at once, eg electromagnetism.<p>As for why mathematics is great at describing nature, it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s loads of it, since it&#x27;s an extensible system of logic. Someone somewhere is going to find a way of describing how asteroids go round, and being a kind of logic there&#x27;s no way you would say it wasn&#x27;t math, regardless of what exactly it was. Epicycles are math too, despite not being the exact right way to think about it.')
