Here you go:<p>1. Monopoly (in law and in practice) is not just defined by what percentage of the pie they have; it&#x27;s also about what power they have and what non-competitive behaviours they can and do engage in.<p>Claiming that Amazon is not a monopoly based on the technicality that they don&#x27;t have 100% of all retail is an irrelevant claim.<p>2. It&#x27;s possible to estimate Amazon&#x27;s &quot;addressable retail&quot; in 2019 as a whole number percentage - that is already huge. There are few companies with that percentage in much smaller sectors.<p>3. You put it in competition with Bricks and Mortar stores in order to get to this figure, which makes your figure artificially low.<p>4. I understood your figures were from a 2019 estimate, although they were unsourced. Amazon revenue has been growing exponentially. There&#x27;s now a pandemic on. Year-on-year sales have increased something like 50%.')
