If Signal had a culture where the principles and direction of the company are beyond discussion, that&#x27;d be a problem - both because it would make Signal a worse place to work, and because it would make compromising the spirit of the principles much easier.<p>It&#x27;s probably helpful to look at a less emotionally charged principle like &quot;customer focused&quot;. If your company enshrines &quot;customer focus&quot; as an inviolate principle, and nobody&#x27;s comfortable discussing the value or meaning of &quot;customer focus&quot;, you won&#x27;t end up with a laser focus on the customer. You&#x27;ll end up rudderless, because anyone skilled at office politics can justify whatever they want to do by declaring it customer focused.')
