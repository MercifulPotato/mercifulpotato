BLM is the catalyst, but the reality is that more people have witnessed, and are shocked by, the militarization and seemingly federal mobilization of police.  That is why the largely white ANTIFA is a thing.<p>If you protested the Iraq invasion, Occupy, or BLM, you have seen it, and probably felt it too.  If you never bothered trying to assemble in public to protest abuses of power, and been chased around by your supposed &quot;protectors of the peace&quot;, you don&#x27;t get it. The reaction to protests has exposed the progressive &quot;elite&quot; for either being out of touch or outright hypocritical (neither should surprise).  To hear some of them praise the &quot;monopoly on violence&quot; as humanity&#x27;s best idea is enraging.<p>This is where libertarian ism falls shorts.  Wealthy progressives think their liberties should be protected over  all of our rightsâ€”that they should be able to enjoy their free enterprise lattes and public parks while abuses of power run rampant at every level.  They will talk reform forever, but only as a prescription for &quot;other people&#x27;s problems&quot;.  These things are problems for everyone, and the fundamental democracy upon which all our liberties rest.')
