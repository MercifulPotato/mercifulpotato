Item(by='johnisgood', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609206185, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25549462, text='For this I highly recommend <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zolk3ri.name&#x2F;cgit&#x2F;zpkg&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zolk3ri.name&#x2F;cgit&#x2F;zpkg&#x2F;</a> which I have been using for years now. It works wonderfully for my use case, and might work for yours, too. It is very simple.<p>Environment variables and their defaults:<p><pre><code>    ZPKG_SRC = ~&#x2F;.local&#x2F;pkg\n    ZPKG_DST = ~&#x2F;.local\n    ZPKG_DB = ~&#x2F;.local&#x2F;pkg&#x2F;.db\n</code></pre>\nIt means that if you install anything from scratch, you have to `<i>make install</i>` (or the like, depending on the build system) it to, say, `<i>~&#x2F;.local&#x2F;pkg&#x2F;foo-1.0</i>` and then run `<i>zpkg link foo:1.0</i>` to install (i.e. link) the &quot;package&quot;.<p>After that you just have to make sure you have (typically in your `<i>~&#x2F;.bash_profile</i>` file):<p>- added `<i>~&#x2F;.local&#x2F;bin</i>` to your `<i>PATH</i>` environment variable, and<p>- added `<i>~&#x2F;.local&#x2F;man</i>` to your `<i>MANPATH</i>` environment variable<p>Seems to do the job. For help, read the source code or type `<i>zpkg --help</i>` which should be of tremendous help.<p>By the way, I have noticed that someone created a package manager with the same name, but its initial commit was in 2019, while this one&#x27;s was in 2017.<p>It is written in OCaml, so you do need to have the OCaml compiler installed. I recommend doing it via `<i>opam</i>`, but your Linux distribution&#x27;s package manager will suffice (simply `<i>ocaml</i>` on Arch Linux, for example). Run `<i>make</i>` to compile it, it will produce a working executable file.<p>Direct link to the source code: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zolk3ri.name&#x2F;cgit&#x2F;zpkg&#x2F;tree&#x2F;src&#x2F;zpkg.ml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zolk3ri.name&#x2F;cgit&#x2F;zpkg&#x2F;tree&#x2F;src&#x2F;zpkg.ml</a><p>If you find any bugs, report it via e-mail which can be found in the `<i>LICENSE</i>` file. I reported a bug before and it was fixed almost immediately. I suppose you can send pull requests or mention missing features, the creator seemed friendly to me.<p>---<p>The above is a modified version of an old comment of mine: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24238587" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24238587</a><p>---<p>To be frank, I forgot how it compares to GNU Stow because it was many years ago, but I did use GNU Stow prior to finding this program. All I remember is that it is way simpler, and it seemed to be perfect for my use case, no more and no less than what I needed. Maybe it works for you, too.')
