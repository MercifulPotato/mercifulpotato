But what if I want a bike, and also car would be $20k, so actually bicycles are pretty cheap!<p>At the end of the day though, when the short term situation resolves itself, that bike is still worth $500 and it wasn&#x27;t cheap.<p>I think the fallacy here is that you don&#x27;t HAVE to buy returns. You could choose to just eat the inflation or pick an alternative asset class.')
