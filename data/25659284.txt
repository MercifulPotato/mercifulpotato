I don&#x27;t see how the interest changes anything.<p>I guess you could argue if the bank is not paying interest on that money, then they won&#x27;t lose anything if the client is in default. I think there&#x27;s probably still opportunity costs to the bank in that case - they could be loaning that money to a client that pays additional fees and makes the payments on time. But I imagine they would still foreclose and sell the asset to recover the principal in that case. Which might turn a profit for them.')
