You&#x27;re not understanding or ignoring what I wrote.<p>The availability of vehicles in the 3rd world is determined in large part by the used car market in the first world (with south America depending more to north America and Africa&#x2F;ME depending more on Europe)  Exporters buy from auctions just like the rest of the used car dealers.  Everybody steers clear of vehicles that have been used hard.  The used car dealers steer clear of cars too old for prospective buyers to get a car loan on.  The lower down the economic ladder you go the harder people are on vehicles and the more likely they are to keep them until they are totally clapped our and the more likely they are to sell private party.  This means that the cars the dealers and the exporters want to buy are  the upper middle class trade ins that were never smoked in that were kept clean and maintained, etc with the importers erring toward 10yo+ ones that the dealers don&#x27;t want as badly.<p>The net result is that the vehicles of the upper middle class are over-represented in the set of vehicles that exporters steer themselves towards.<p>If every dumb yuppie in the US and Europe woke up tomorrow and decided they would only commute in blue cars from now on then in 10yr we&#x27;d have morons on the internet making up reasons that blue cars are more reliable and using their prevalence in the 3rd world as evidence.<p>Of course there&#x27;s market specific models and locally made stuff available too but I&#x27;m not talking about those and that&#x27;s not the avenue from which cars that have a 20k+ MSRP appear in those markets.')
