This has caused a bit of a fuss since they are quite popular for use with Home Assistant.  You can get it reenabled by contacting tp link support  for a custom firmware but they have burned a lot of customers with this. A shame because the hardware is not bad, they just want people to use their own, unintegrated app with it.')
