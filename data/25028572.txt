Once upon a time people lines up for hours to get the latest software.  Boxes were and CDs were proudly displayed on office shelves.  But software isn&#x27;t the hot thing.  Services are king.  Facebook and youtube aren&#x27;t software.  TikTok isn&#x27;t software.  They are services and services are much harder to open source.<p>There are a few.  Tor and Signal are good examples.  They are software that enables an underlying service.  So they get attention.  People want to contribute.  Imho if F&#x2F;OSS wants to thrive it has to focus on those projects that provide services that people can proudly say that they use and to which they can proudly contribute time and energy.')
