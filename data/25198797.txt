Not waiting 30 days for shipping is easily worth paying 5€ for a product that sells for 2€ directly from China. You can often find the same Chinese stuff at a brick and mortar shop for a reasonable price (2x at most) but its sold under the budget store brand.<p>The high quality products from China are often branded by an American or European company. You can&#x27;t buy them directly from China unless it is a knockoff and a lot of knockoffs are sold on Ebay locally. I don&#x27;t even know why anyone would bother to get stuff directly from aliexpress at this point.')
