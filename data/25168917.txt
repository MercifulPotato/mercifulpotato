The article mentioned difficulties operating those servers reliably and they can&#x27;t just buy hardware from different vendor because there is no other vendor that sells arm server at that moment (pretty much only thunderx server was available for purchase). Maybe things will be different this time and a bunch of new arm server vendors would show up due to renewed interest in arm servers.')
