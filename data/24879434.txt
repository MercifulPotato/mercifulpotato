I spent ages trying to find a solution that does a nice mix of cross platform, own hard drive, cloud. I eventually found it in the shape of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mylio.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mylio.com&#x2F;</a><p>Along lines of other comments here, none of my other material has even like the same value as my family photos, so I&#x27;m stupendously careful with redundancy &#x2F; multi location backup.<p>In case anyone cares: local HDD attached to Mac, Synology on local network, folder on there synced to Dropbox and finally Synology C2. Too far I know, but it&#x27;s worth it.<p>Mylio is fast, clever (has a nice P2P model for in-network syncing), doesn&#x27;t have to hit any cloud service if you don&#x27;t want it to, good search, great management tools. I rate it highly.')
