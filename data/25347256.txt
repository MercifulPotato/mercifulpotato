Except, if that user is in any groups that you&#x27;re a member of, in order to still see group messages, you must accept to still see their messages (and they yours) in those groups - or you must leave the group.<p>Actually being able to block other users, whether they&#x27;re in a group you&#x27;re in, or not, does not seem like an insurmountable technical challenge to me, so I assume it&#x27;s a policy &#x27;nudge&#x27; to discourage blocking toxic people.')
