The only range anxiety I&#x27;ve had has been self induced.  Eg, skipping the Tesla map planned supercharger and using the next one down the road for a variety of reasons [1] .  The most anxious I&#x27;ve been is when I pulled into a supercharger with 2% remaining.<p>[1] I often do this to arrive at a supercharger with a lower state of charge.  This allows for charging lower on the curve, which allows for faster charging.  I sometimes do this to avoid unpleasant chargers. My least favorite is the Savannah super charger, which is located several stoplights from the highway in an airport parking garage.')
