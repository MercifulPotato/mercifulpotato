A command line interface is an interface. That&#x27;s it. Instead of pressing a button, you run a command. If you want to pass settings to an app when you launch it, you use the command line interface. If you want to script away a task, you call the command from your script.<p>That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s not a layer of abstraction. It&#x27;s an interface. They exist for many good reasons.')
