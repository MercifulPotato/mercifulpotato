I just hope things go right in the rest of my life.<p>Talk to your doctor, there have been many advances in ADHD meds and they all work differently on different people. Some people respond well to Ritalin, Some respond well to the generic. Some respond well the Adderal, or Vyvanse. For some people only the name brand formulation works. Some people any formulation works. Also, make sure you are at the right dosage. You can and do build up a tolerance over time. I try to take weekends off when I don&#x27;t have anything in particular I need to do, and at least one or two weeks a year (normally when I go on vacation).')
