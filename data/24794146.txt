The system was getting a digital signal when the signaling devices were unlocked, so unless Watson was unsure of the correct response, it could _always_ beat the humans to the punch. It also had the advantage of parsing the text version of the answers, rather than the audio of Alex speaking in real time, meaning it had a head start to begin with. Unlike the similar Chess and Go challenges, the Jeopardy event was incredibly unfair to the humans involved.')
