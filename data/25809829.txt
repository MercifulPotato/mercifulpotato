I remember one of my first real &quot;programs&quot; I wrote during my studies (I was 23 or 24, so I started of later with programming as well). They all gave us these Lego Mindstorm sets, which you can control through this little UI interface, but you could also control using C# code. With my team mates we build this little game you could play with four people, and it worked great! I wrote most of the code for it, knowing very little programming at that moment. I wrote the entire flow in one script, no classes or OOP, I was so proud!<p>Still I can only learn a new language or framework if I have a project that grabs my attention. So I would say don&#x27;t start off with teaching &quot;progtamming&quot;, like, what &#x27;public static void main&#x27; means. Start with letting them create a simple CRUD app or little game through programming. And build from there. I like the process of programming but what I like most is interacting with my creation.')
