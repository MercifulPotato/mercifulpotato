For instance, I&#x27;ve been reading &quot;The Psychology of Money&quot; recently, and I&#x27;m enjoying it, but its style is a lot like this article; an endless series of anecdotes about famous and semi-famous people, with insights from the author tying them together. Is this a new trend of some kind, or has it just become more obvious to me lately?<p>Edit: Ha! I did not catch the part at the end where this is the same author as that book. Ok then!')
