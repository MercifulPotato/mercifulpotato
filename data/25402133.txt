I am much more disturbed by the behavior of Microsoft Teams, which installs itself into your login items on install. Then you remove it from your login items and think you&#x27;re all good. But if you ever open the application, it automatically adds itself to your login items again.<p>As far as I can tell, it will re-add itself no matter how many times you have removed it. This strikes me as incredibly user hostile and I&#x27;m surprised Microsoft is quite so brazen about it. I would expect this behavior would lead people to just uninstall the desktop application and use Teams through a browser when needed.')
