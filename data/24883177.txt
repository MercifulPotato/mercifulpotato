Item(by='core-questions', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603589211, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24882907, text='&gt; one can still find plenty of people who will argue in favor of walled gardens and against general computing.<p>What these people don&#x27;t know is that we already had all of these arguments, 20+ years ago, on Usenet and Slashdot and a ton of mailing lists and it&#x27;s all still there; every counter-argument, every riposte, every troll. The argument in favour of Free Software was won, philosophically, a while ago. The problem, of course, is actually getting the average Joe to understand what it means and what it implies; they have enough difficulty understanding what Free Speech really meant for them, and even now are willing participants in its dismantling.<p>That said, the library of existing Free Software is phenomenal. For most people, almost anything you could possibly need has some incarnation in the vast libraries of GPL and copylefted software out there. It&#x27;s not going away, and so far there&#x27;s no sign of general purpose-ish computing going away; $50 Raspberry Pis have more compute than most machines from a decade ago and so it&#x27;s a really good, really equalizing era in computing, for anyone willing to take the plunge.<p>We need schools to start teaching kids Linux from a young age, I think.')
