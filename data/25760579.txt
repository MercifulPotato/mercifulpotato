I for my part do not feel the sort of empathy for Google that this argument seems to be predicated on me feeling, and I can&#x27;t imagine this changing even if I were to operate  my own bar. My bar would not be a temporarily embarrassed Google, so to speak.<p>&gt; start your own<p>...and start your own DDoS protection, DNS hierarchy, payment processor etc. as well? In the context of bars, I have not heard of beer companies, kitchen equipment suppliers, map makers or PoS terminal providers demand that the bar ban a particular customer on threat of refusing to service them, either, so that proposal seems rather more realistic than the one we are actually talking about here.')
