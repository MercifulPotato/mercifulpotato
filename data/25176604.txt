Usually I want to start doing stuff and then go back and read more.<p>This is why I say it felt that way and I did not say that the SPA is unstable.<p>Here is how my experience with SPA looked like:<p>- I started with jQuery, 10 years ago or so (actually with Scriptaculous :) ), replacing parts of the interface with Ajax calls. Worked a little for a while then got into very ugly code both on JS and on Ruby. This was not a full SPA, but it was moving into that direction.<p>- Then I moved to Backbone around 2013 I think. In the beginning it sounded very nice in the end again the code and mix with jQuery quickly become hard to organise. Also as it started to be slower to build MVPs in terms of moving fast and adding application features.<p>- So I tried Angular and my main problem there was debugging production issues. The errors I saw on browser console were mostly not giving any clue about what went wrong. Probably it was because of the whole compile JS pipeline to support various browsers ...<p>- Then I inherited a Webapp written in React (around 2014 or 2015) with backend in Rails which was a second-screen for a radio show. It provided various live interaction with listeners. There I saw the need for SPA but also is where SPA lost me as I spent a lot of time debugging simple things from someone could not be able to login to how long it took to add a new page to display some poll results. For sure a big part (or the most part) is on me and with my expectation about how things were working in Rails where if I wanted a page to display some poll results it meant to simply build a .html.erb and it was done. Of course later on came Action Cable and I started using it for any live thing.<p>Again I am not saying SPA is in general heavy or hard to use. I am saying that for the products I build SSR sprinkled with some small reactive things is enough and for me (when I am mostly the solo developer) it is fast to produce (from idea to deploy) and debug a feature for a web app.<p>That being told I am trying to learn Vue - and force myself to use so that I want to have experience with this kind of frameworks.')
