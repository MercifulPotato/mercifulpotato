I also categorize the flavors so you can color match, or match for certain events.<p>The pairings are divided into three major kitchens - &quot;sweet&quot;, &quot;savory&quot; and &quot;cocktails&quot;.<p>Of course the amount of flavor pairings, and the number of flavors themselves will increase over time.')
