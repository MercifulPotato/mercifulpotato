Kubernetes 1.0 and 1.20 share the same name, design principles and a certain amount of API compatibility, but it&#x27;s impossible to take a nontrivial application running on 1.20 and just `kubectl apply` it on 1.0. Too much has changed.<p>Kubernetes is <i>just now</i> entering the realm of &quot;becoming stable&quot;. Maybe in five years or so it&#x27;ll finally be boring (in the best sense of the word) like Postgres.')
