I forgot for a moment there that the BOC uses fuel prices as a gauge to regulate currency values. But that wasn&#x27;t my core point, nor was I attributing it to Liberal policy (kinda stated I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with that).<p>2.) I don&#x27;t mind criticizing the Harper government. In fact, I&#x27;d readily place them below Trudeau&#x27;s. But I don&#x27;t think Trudeau&#x27;s would have aggressively pursued Chinese IP theft. In fact, no Western government would have. What did Obama do when the Chinese were stealing IP from Western universities?<p>3.) Again, as I said, I don&#x27;t really know about Canadian KYC and AML laws and the &quot;Caribbean banker blush&quot; thing. But one cursory glance, and it&#x27;s easy to find so many loopholes in the current policy which was created to dissuade investor citizenship.<p>4.) Canada is only positioning itself for its strongest ally, just as Australia. Till the trade war began, I dearly remember how Canada and Australia had these nice treats and fancy dinners for Chinese investors that weren&#x27;t available to investors from other places. Not that I&#x27;m complaining, but some special treatment was certainly meted out to the Chinese, via regulations and otherwise. Which led to the current shit show.<p>5.) Vancouver and Toronto are still on the high side. Let&#x27;s talk when those places become affordable to buy into for native city folks. But as always, for most big issues, we&#x27;ll continue putting a Band-Aid solution over it.')
