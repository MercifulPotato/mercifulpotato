You only infringe once you distribute the content further.<p>Wrong.  Copying something, without distribution, is still violating copyright.  It&#x27;s just taken less seriously than distribution.  It&#x27;s the same difference between drug dealers and drug users.<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not hard to predict that&#x27;s coming, especially in Europe given Article 13 last year.<p>&gt; This is wrong. Article 13 regulates content hosts (in this case, Youtube), not end users. Hence, Article 13 has no bearing on ad-blocking software.<p>No, I did not say anything at all about Article 13.  Please re-read what I said.')
