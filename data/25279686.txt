One trick I use is &quot;locate -Ai&quot; that lets you search for multiple patterns and makes it case insensitive. So you can use &quot;locate -Ai linux .pdf&quot; to search for all pdf files related to Linux.<p>Also for gnome there is tracker which does search and indexing built into the system. I think by default its set for minimal use but it can be configured by the settings&#x2F;search panel to index many locations. I haven&#x27;t played with is much recently though.')
