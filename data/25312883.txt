I work for 6 months with StimulusJS 1 and I&#x27;m very happy to use it. I use it mainly in a rails app combined with Turbolinks.<p>My original thought was to go for an SPA with a rails API backend. I tried out both React &amp; Vue extensively but got stuck in a while. Since implementing Rails and plain &#x27;vanilla&#x27; JS it went better. But with StimulusJS 1+ it went simply great.<p>Allready upgraded to 2.0 and it feels even more structured with the new features, like values and improved targets.')
