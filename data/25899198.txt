Granted, you have to read it in light of the fact that it wasn&#x27;t written down until a long time after the events happened.<p>But it describes Iceland&#x27;s ancient legal system in some detail. If you killed someone, you could be sued, tried, and fined. The fine went to the victim&#x27;s family. What it looks like happened in practice was that the victim&#x27;s family wasn&#x27;t really satisfied that justice was done, and would conduct a revenge killing. Then the money would pass back to the other family again. The practical effect was that the entire saga is like a decades long blood feud, mediated by the court system.<p>Of course it was fascinating to read, especially since we were visiting places described in the saga, such as Thingvellier, where they met to conduct government and trials.<p>They had another system, where if you were utterly uncontrollable, they could vote you off the island by making you an outlaw, meaning that anybody could kill you without repercussion.')
