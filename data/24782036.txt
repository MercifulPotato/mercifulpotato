For a couple of years in my life, when I was about 20, I went through this phase where I went around all year long in just a t-shirt (and shoes and trousers, of course). I also took hot-and-cold showers: I showered with cold water then alternated cold and hot a few times.<p>I did this because I got sick and tired of catching a cold every year and having a very high fever (39 to 41 C all the time). I blamed having being overperscribed antibiotics as a child, which at the time I believed had weakened my immune system. That was probably nonsense, although it&#x27;s true that when I was a kid it was common to give kids antibiotics for viral infections, so I got a lot of antibiotics for no good reason at all. I figured that exposing myself to cold would help me build up my immune system again. Also probably nonsense.<p>I can&#x27;t tell if anything changed by what I was doing. I never felt any different from doing it, not &quot;more alive&quot; etc as others report. I got over my colds with high fever but that was most probably because I grew up (I think adults don&#x27;t get such high temperatures from a cold as kids do). I sure got lots of strange looks and people kept asking me whether I&#x27;m a) cold and b) mad.<p>I didn&#x27;t use any breathing techniques or meditation or anything like that. I didn&#x27;t particularly exercise much, though I was a strong lad at the time (now, not so much). I think I just sort of willed myself to do it and did it and then realised it wasn&#x27;t that hard after all. I think the true secret, the real lesson, is that we are made to withstand a lot more cold than we think and we&#x27;re just used to being warm a lot more than we were meant to be if we lived without all our technology. Except of course we don&#x27;t have to be cold because we have all that technology. So there&#x27;s no reason for breathing exercises and so on to learn how to withstand the cold. That&#x27;s what our brains are for.<p>Also, don&#x27;t follow gurus.')
