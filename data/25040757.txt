I&#x27;m currently on a Mac running Windows 10 in a Parallels VM, and checking here[1] shows<p><pre><code>  ANGLE (Parallels Display Adapter (WDDM) Direct3D11 vs_5_0 ps_5_0)\n</code></pre>\nThe &quot;Parallels Display Adapter (WDDM)&quot; seems to be coming from my Display Adapter name, which I could change. But I&#x27;m not sure if any other part of that string leaks my computer&#x27;s status as a VM.<p>My non-standard screen resolution is another dead giveaway. There may be others as well, but those two seem to be the lowest hanging fruit. And many of these proctoring suites run as browser extensions, and I&#x27;m not sure what additional information extensions have access to.<p>But yea, they&#x27;re not too hard to trick. You <i>could</i> get fancy, around listening for mouse clicks and keyboard taps, without detecting any corresponding actions within the VM. But that sounds like far too much effort for a higher education software vendor.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browserleaks.com&#x2F;webgl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browserleaks.com&#x2F;webgl</a>')
