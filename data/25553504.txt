As a byproduct I think you see much less autonomy or even diversity of job roles in that space because a good portions of the problems are considered &quot;solved&quot;.<p>This is not a knock against hardware(it&#x27;s hard!) but more that the design space of large scale software projects involve a diverse set of teams and people so you see similar patterns arise.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Conway%27s_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Conway%27s_law</a>')
