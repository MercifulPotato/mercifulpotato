Facebook isn’t a consumer and Facebook’s principal business is antithetical to the FTC’s mission. So while they certainly have jurisdiction over advertising they really ought not be acting on behalf of facebook in any meaningful way. Even to the extent consumer interests align with facebooks (I’m skeptical) the appearance of impropriety by having this meeting far outweighs any potential consumer benefit.')
