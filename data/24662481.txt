And if not me, imagine a person of some power or influence: don&#x27;t we want to know when someone&#x27;s public political stance is different to how they really feel?<p>perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m privileged, but I don&#x27;t really see how this is a problem? does it really matter if someone holds abhorrent beliefs privately if everything they do in public (and at their job) is consistent with their publicly espoused views? if instead of only confiding in close family members, the person abused the privacy protection to spread their views to many private groups, this would start to blur the line.<p>a more clear cut example would be if someone privately expressed a credible and imminent plan to harm someone else. you would definitely want an exception for that.')
