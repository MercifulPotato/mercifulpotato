When the Taiwanese government began to make initiatives to support a local semiconductor industry, they had connections to the industry to be able to make deals with American and European companies--some of which had Taiwanese leaders or founders.<p>Edit: On the note of Europe, Philips was one of TSMC&#x27;s original investors and customers. Philips also co-founded ASML which other people have mentioned.')
