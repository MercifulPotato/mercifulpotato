I&#x27;d be happy to work with you on this.<p>I&#x27;ve built a custom JavaScript sandbox and corresponding electron based IDE (with syntax highlighting, full &quot;intellisense&quot;, type hinting etc) in the recent past. Lots of experience walking abstract syntax trees and modifying output. Happy to discuss in more detail. While not exactly the same, the techniques are very transferable to this project!<p>Fixed fee is preferred, but happy to jump into details in PM.<p>Let me know!')
