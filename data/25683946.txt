What you are describing is a fundamental flaw of the current AI effort: the data that supports AI models is mostly irrelevant to the problem. In medicine, the saying goes: 90% of diagnoses are made on patient history. Ironically, there is no reason that would change for AI-enabled systems given the same information.<p>So to answer you directly yes, it&#x27;s a better route until we have better information available. But it&#x27;s also the wrong route to take in the long term. It would be far better to attempt to produce better supporting information.')
