In this case all 6 solutions are basically the same amount of code.<p>There&#x27;s absolutely no reason to choose the slowest solution.<p>50% can easily be the difference between some VSCode extension making it sluggish vs not.<p>Further, in my experience slow solutions will eventually come back to bite you.<p>One I saw recenty. see if 2 arrays contain the same elements. The &quot;simple&quot; solution is sort copies of the arrays, concat them into strings, compare the strings. It looks simple but it&#x27;s around 1000x slower than pretty much any normal but not 1 line solution. 1000x won&#x27;t matter when you&#x27;re testing your 5 element arrays in your unit test but it will matter then your users start using larger arrays.')
