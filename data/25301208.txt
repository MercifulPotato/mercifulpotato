That plus loads of speculation presented as fact.<p>Can you please point to pages where opposite things are stated? If it is cherry picked, surely you can quote.<p>&gt; &quot;The Dothraki were based on demeaning stereotypes as evidenced by their clothing choices&quot; is unconvincing<p>This article is about clothing. Next installment will be about culture.<p>&gt; Did he talk about ways that Dothraki culture is similar to horse-riding, raiding cultures? No, he did not. It&#x27;s All Wrong and Bad<p>Are there way in which they are similar? It is cherry picking only if you ignore opposing evidence. I am sure you can provide some?<p>&gt; You literally just redefined a word that I used and argued against this new, less defensible, dumb position. Don&#x27;t do that.<p>I literally did not.
