It looks like checks and balances don&#x27;t work that well after all.<p>I&#x27;m starting to see the benefits of small government. The case for a decentralized, citizen-driven monetary system is also increasingly strong. Reduction of government and monetary reform must go together or else we risk corporations or some other large bureaucratic organisations replacing the government and end up doing the same kinds of senseless things.<p>An economy should not support such massive and immoral waste of human lives and productive capacity.')
