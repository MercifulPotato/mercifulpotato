It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s outright splitting up work between peers, often with the use of illicit solutions manuals, for the purpose of gaming the grading system. It&#x27;s especially beneficial in classes where the professor just writes exams from homework problems or problems very similar to them.<p>There isn&#x27;t anything special or insightful, mystical or different or &quot;eastern&quot; about cooperative learning. I&#x27;m thoroughly &quot;western&quot; and had plenty of homework groups in both undergrad and grad school. Nor is there anything special about the cooperative cheating I described: &quot;certain groups&quot; applied to plenty of western peer groups I saw in undergrad especially, though they didn&#x27;t claim what they were doing was some &quot;cultural&quot; thing, as they knew it was simply cheating.')
