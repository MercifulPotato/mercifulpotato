Now they&#x27;re doing face recognition. I think there&#x27;s great potential for ML to curate the photos for me. I hope my phone can one day present to me low quality vs high quality images based on exposure, focus, and composure. I can then swipe left or right to keep or delete. There&#x27;s nothing more exhausting than having to sort through photos after a vacation :-)')
