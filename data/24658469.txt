They invited me to parties and insisted that I eat with them. Like if I was late to some mini-celebration, they&#x27;d ask me why I did not come earlier. They always spoke english at the meetings I attended. I did find them extremely political and manipulative, also browbeating me in work tasks. They did the same to my Indian colleague. But they didn&#x27;t try to exclude me.')
