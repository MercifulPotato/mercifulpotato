Ads change behavior. We don&#x27;t just have ads to buy things, but we also have political ads. We have ads for charity. We have ads for religion. We have ads for mental health. We have ads for public awareness. There&#x27;s this common argument that ads are just about selling you things but such an argument doesn&#x27;t reflect reality and is often strange to find coming from people living in a country that is going through a major political election where they are being accosted by ads encouraging people to vote. Considering we&#x27;ve been doing this for a few hundred years, I&#x27;m pretty sure someone would have picked up on it being wasted money if ads didn&#x27;t influence behavior.')
