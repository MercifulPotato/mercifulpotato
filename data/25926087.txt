Really, nobody can see it being created except the actual developer building that piece and maybe one level up if they are good enough to review the code. But to everybody else its a mysterious black box. Now this not only hides the complexity but actually amplifies it because at the ground level people are highly incentivised to inject complexity into their work. It <i>feels good</i> to make something complex. You feel productive and it definitely helps your resume if you can claim to have worked on something highly complex. Everybody else is impressed. The team gets more resources to support this amazing thing being created.<p>So hiding the complexity not only prevents exposure but means many people in the production chain incentivised to create complexity can get away with gratuitously injecting it into things. Whole frameworks will be deployed where 10 lines of code would have worked, new libraries will mysteriously appear and get used for 1 function. Layers of indirection in the design will appear to abstract things that have only 1 concrete implementation. etc etc. All of this is invisible above 1 management layer and therefore unmeasurable and unmanageable. But the outcome is, the end result takes much longer than you would surmise from the bare bones functionality or requirements.')
