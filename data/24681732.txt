It&#x27;s not like someone intentionally omitted a screenshot to annoy people. It needs a contributor who cares about changing the mobile prompt for it to be fixed.<p>I have a similar useless prompt in one of my open source games and it&#x27;s just a boring issue to fix and I rather focus on the game itself.')
