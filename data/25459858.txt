But I&#x27;m pretty sure Coinbase&#x27;s customers care. I doubt anyone would want them to trade exclusively as a token, but maybe they could do some shares on Nasdaq and some in token form. If anyone would figure out the regulatory hurdles for that, it&#x27;s Coinbase. Their whole business model is being the most regulated and rule-following bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies.')
