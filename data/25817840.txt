If those problems were unsolvable by other systems then what exactly were you comparing?<p>Spanner isn&#x27;t magic, it&#x27;s just a proprietary distributed relational database that is strongly consistent (CP) and relies on Google&#x27;s network and infrastructure to make up for availability as much as possible. CRDB solves the same problems. It was founded by ex-googlers who are familiar with Spanner and the product is production-grade enough to achieve a multi-billion dollar valuation with impressive customers. Plenty of &quot;new-sql&quot; relational datastores have been created that compete and win on both features and cost, because the reality is that the vast majority of companies do not have a scaling problem; certainly not one that can only be solved by Spanner.')
