(Which doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t support it in the future.)<p>This issue might be relevant (mio is internally used by tokio for async I&#x2F;O): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tokio-rs&#x2F;mio&#x2F;issues&#x2F;923" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tokio-rs&#x2F;mio&#x2F;issues&#x2F;923</a>')
