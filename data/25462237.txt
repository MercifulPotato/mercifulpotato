The objects (blobs, trees, etc.) are sorted for similarity, completely ignoring the graph of commit history<p>While I understand this point, I would make two further ones:<p>- The storage is still diffs, and definitely not snapshots. It&#x27;s just that the diffs of which a given commit consists do not all refer to the same &quot;base&quot;. Contrasting git with a system in which commits are stored as one large diff (whereas git stores them as many small diffs) is something you can do, but it&#x27;s not the same thing as contrasting git with a system in which commits are stored as snapshots. (Whereas git stores them as diffs.)<p>- &quot;Sorting for similarity&quot; isn&#x27;t a thing you can do; similarity does not induce a consistent ordering.<p>&gt; This allows gitâ€™s storage to be smaller than version control systems that use a storage structure that preserves history<p>This is worded unfortunately; git wouldn&#x27;t be a version control system at all if its storage structure didn&#x27;t preserve history. It does, but it doesn&#x27;t mix that concern with its concern for file contents.')
