BTC is digital gold (yes, I know HN hates that, but short of a better set of words, it is what it is.)<p>The thing that, in my opinion, disconnects ETH from BTC is CeFi&#x2F;DeFi. It really is the programmable money... but not money in the context of a currency every day people spend.<p>I&#x27;m talking about money in the context of &quot;institutional money&quot;. Like the trading desks in Wall Street. Where money goes to use in making more money. All those crazy algo&#x27;s that people use to pool funds and hedge and trade are getting created out in the open now and solidified (see the pun?) in code.<p>That is where ETH shines. The amount of development and innovation happening there, at &#x27;move fast and break things&#x27; speed is literally amazing. Heavy emphasis on &#x27;break&#x27; because these things are getting hacked almost daily. But just like crypto exchanges (which used to get hacked daily), it&#x27;ll settle down eventually.<p>Interestingly, as soon as I could (Nov 6th), I bought $100 each of BTC and ETH on paypal within minutes of each other. A little experiment. Today, the ETH is worth 5.5% more and both are up a combined 32%. I don&#x27;t think people are paying close enough attention to this difference because they are blinded by the 32%.')
