Here&#x27;s my guess as to what happened.<p>Somebody posted a joke that was, taken literally, a threat or incitement of rape. &quot;I hope you get fucked and don&#x27;t enjoy it&quot;. An admin of the group &quot;liked&quot; or commented on the post.<p>Later, a human labeler determined that the post was &quot;adult sexual exploitation&quot;. It was removed. Because the admin had &quot;liked&quot; or commented on it, the group was automatically banned. That&#x27;s FB&#x27;s public policy on &quot;adult sexual exploitation&quot;.<p>Just a guess, but that is the most likely explanation to me.')
