This is the case for sessions and for many non-HTTP protocols that need to track state per connection (e.g. TCP tracks connection flags, statistics and sequence numbers, TLS tracks your keys, FTP tracks your current directory, SMTP tracks which data fields were sent, etc etc).<p>It does not apply for simple database searches or even CRUD endpoints because while there is <i>global</i> state (there always is), the server does not care which client in particular made the requests.<p>APIs that have no <i>per-client</i> state can generally be implemented by a shim that internally calls a newer API pretty easily. It&#x27;s not that easy with APIs that do have per-client state.')
