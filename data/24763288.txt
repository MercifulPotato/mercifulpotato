I completely disagree. What fb was at the start was actually useful - simply a way to write a status update to your friends and see what they have been up to in chronological order. None of the tracking or manipulative bull.<p>What it has become (and rapidly since going public) is an attention-seeking addiction portal trying to gain every dollar it can from clicks. Full of ads, showing you only the friend status updates it wants to show you from its blackbox algorithm, inferring what your interests are based on whatever you click on, adding on tons and tons of functionality to keep you in the bubble (events, marketplace and so on)<p>It is very different to what it began as.')
