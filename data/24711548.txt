(They may charge her money for the certificate, if they’re a scummy VPS.)<p>This ship has sailed, though: “plaintext HTTP” is available only with HTTP&#x2F;0 and HTTP&#x2F;1. This article is discussing HTTP&#x2F;3, which carries forward the requirement of wire encryption that HTTP&#x2F;2 argued over for a long time and then incorporated into the standard.<p>(Incidentally, my grandmother was a Smalltalk and 6502 assembly programmer of educational software in the 80s. She let me read her technical books at age 5. Probably best to find another example, such as “non-technical site owners”.)')
