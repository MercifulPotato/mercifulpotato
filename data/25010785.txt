The great white shark is great because it&#x27;s huge and powerful, though it&#x27;s considered monstrous in popular culture.  In my experience it&#x27;s also the favorite shark of nearly any kid who likes sharks, probably because it is immense and powerful.<p><i>&quot;World&#x27;s [blankiest] [blank]&quot;</i> is generally a pretty popular genre, regardless of the subject.   Whether it&#x27;s the tallest mountain, most venomous snake, longest railroad or fastest plane, people are fascinated with extremes.  I think the obsession with the world&#x27;s &#x27;great&#x27; leaders like Genghis Khan or Alexander is just another manifestation of this.')
