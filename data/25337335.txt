Item(by='dmoy', descendants=None, kids=[25337402], score=None, time=1607374332, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25335453, text='It&#x27;s not as pronounced here in WA as it is in say Nevada.  But, things that I see in WA, off the top of my head (not all government policy):<p>1 - anti-housing like you say.  You see lots of signs in my neighborhood wishing against more-dense housing, despite (relatively) astronomical pricing.  At least in Seattle, we do have an issue where we&#x27;re constrained by water so there isn&#x27;t a lot of places to build that aren&#x27;t very far out.  So density really is the only solution if you&#x27;re going to keep computes reasonable.  The only people who can afford to buy the existing not-dense housing have a ton of money or income (or both).  A &gt;$1m SFH is just not affordable in a city where median household income is $100k.<p>2 - push against increasing property tax.  Sort of a corollary to the housing bit.  Which gets doubly odd because we have no income tax in WA.  Weirdly regressive.<p>3 - the strange and ineffectual CA-style push against &quot;assault rifles&quot; as the main item of gun control, despite the fact that all rifles nation-wide kill ~300&#x2F;yr while pistols kill 30,000&#x2F;yr, 10k of which are homicide.  I say ineffectual because Amdahl&#x27;s law is a thing, so even if you did magically disappear all riles in the country, it would have a ~1% impact on gun violence.<p>4 - restaurants heating the out of doors.  This spiked a lot with coronavirus so it&#x27;s hard to talk about now.  (This might also be me projecting because I myself am an implant from the Midwest (yes I am a hypocrite), and heating the out of doors is just complete insanity to me)<p>5 - Many more good restaurants in general though.  Sadly, still not a lot of good mexican restaurants.<p>6 - a change in coffee styles.  Take from that what you will, people are kinda religious about it here.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to pick out what&#x27;s <i>actually</i> influenced by CA implants, vs what is just homegrown.')
