This was back in 2015, when &quot;Hunger Games&quot; was starting to lose steam. And many feminists on twitter were lampooning it for focusing on romance, and having a flimsy love triangle, when the life-or-death situation of the book wouldn&#x27;t realistically allow for that.<p>Mocking the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; and any book with a love triangle was totally in vogue.<p>&gt;He made some godawful marketing and communications decisions and faced predictable consequences.<p>It&#x27;s funny, because I&#x27;ve seen dozens of YA authors sneer at &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey.&quot; Call it toxic, poorly written, laugh at it, mock it, insist it was dangerous to even publish it.<p>Yet I&#x27;ve never seen the Fifty Shades of Grey fanbase, or any Romance genre authors, talk about threatening, stalking, and publicly heckling those authors who criticize the work.<p>You call it &quot;predictable consequences.&quot; I call it &quot;hateful, disturbing, potentially dangerous behavior that reeks of censorship.&quot;')
