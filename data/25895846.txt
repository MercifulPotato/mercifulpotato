We lived in busy Paris and Berlin and were able to consider our homes quiet refuges.  We had a kid and all the other reasons why people transition from city to suburb.  It felt more accommodating than the German suburb my brother in law lived in with his kids, full of bike lanes and the like.<p>Now we’re in Palo Alto, a walkable suburb, which doesn’t seem much quieter.  I still can’t see the stars, and getting to concerts, art exhibits and the like is inconvenient and doesn’t really happen.  At least I can still walk to the grocery store or restaurants through of course the selection is limited.')
