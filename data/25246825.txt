Yes, distributing an app requires a paid membership, but you can build and run your app on your own device just fine.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;xcode&#x2F;running_your_app_in_the_simulator_or_on_a_device" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;xcode&#x2F;running_your...</a><p>&gt; We&#x27;re about to enter a trusted computing dystopia.<p>Tell this to the young kids coming up - I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s now - and explain that there existed a time when most sites were served over plain-old, unencrypted HTTP. They either won&#x27;t believe you, will be horrified at the security hole here, or both.<p>&gt; The web was the perfect platform and would have been utopia. Google sunk their claws in and neutered the browser, removing the concept of the URL, forced media companies to use AMP, and crippled ad&#x2F;tracker blocking.<p>In retrospect, it isn&#x27;t surprising that Google - a company that makes its real money off of ads - went down this road. It stinks, but I don&#x27;t know if they had any better options to protect this revenue stream in the face of tech that lets people subvert it getting better all the time.<p>&gt; And iPhone has a shitty browser so it can favor apps.<p>In some ways, I do wish that Apple put more effort into the web app side of things, but the key victory of the App Store can&#x27;t be ignored.<p>If you make software easier to acquire, install, and remove, people will use more of it. With few exceptions, I would posit that most people who aren&#x27;t nerds didn&#x27;t use much software because these guardrails weren&#x27;t there, and that they might &quot;screw up their phone&#x2F;computer.&quot;<p>As a result of this progress, that fear has been largely eliminated, even if it means people give up some access to the nuts and bolts of how the software stack works.')
