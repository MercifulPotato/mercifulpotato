This is an article that makes an appeal to fairness though. The underlying message is &quot;the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer&quot;. So, if you want to follow the argument of fairness, should the wage of the minimum wage workers grow at the same rate as the average productivity for the nation, or as the rate of the productivity gains for the minimum wage workers? If it&#x27;s the latter, then it&#x27;s quite likely that the productivity of the lower end jobs did not see a whole lot of gains.')
