That resolved all of my issues.<p>Additionally, I later ended up adding more Wifi APs to provide consistent throughput across the house. Previously I had &quot;slow&quot; zones. Not really dead zones, but annoyingly slow enough to force you to switch temporarily to 4G.<p>If you can&#x27;t hardwire the device specifically, consider repositioning the WiFi AP closer, add&#x2F;or add another AP if you are able to.<p>Hope this helps.')
