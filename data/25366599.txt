The theory that there was fraud on a scale large enough to swing this election <i>should</i> be falsifiable in any sane, working electoral system. In parts of the US, however, I&#x27;m less confident, since in <i>some cases</i> it doesn&#x27;t seem possible to disprove the theory that an individual vote was fraudulent. Hence the problem: anyone saying it&#x27;s impossible is just as deluded as the person saying the election was stolen. The system is broken.')
