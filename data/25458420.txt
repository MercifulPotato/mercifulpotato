There needs to be more information disseminated about what kind of convenient foods people _can_ choose and what the impacts are to your health are.<p>Most people would consider frozen or canned fruits and vegetables as more processed, and therefore less good, than fresh fruit or vegetables.<p>Although I do have a bone to pick with your assessment of why &quot;fresh&quot; produce tends to be less nutritious. While you correctly note that frozen or canned items are picked at peak ripeness, the fresh items don&#x27;t have less nutrition simply because the nutrients &quot;evaporated away&quot;. Instead, they have to be picked _far before_ peak ripeness in order to avoid spoilage. That means the plants just take in fewer nutrients.')
