Their physical strength and jaw strength in particular make them potentially deadly.<p>Can a poodle kill you? In some edge cases maybe. Can a pit bull do it? For sure.<p>This is correlated with lower rates of spay &#x2F; neuter as well. So you have an animal that is naturally MUCH more dangerous, and then you have that correlated with folks who LIKE that they are so dangerous and the bad outcomes multiply.<p>Want a poodle? Here you go. Want a pit bull? You should have to prove you are going to be able to train, care, etc for them and will keep them on leash in situations where they could kill others (ie, children&#x27;s playground - yes - people bring off leash pitbulls occasionally - NOT a good situation).<p>BTW - same rule should apply to guns. Want a .50 cal automatic machine gun? You should need some kind of extra license given the danger you now pose.')
