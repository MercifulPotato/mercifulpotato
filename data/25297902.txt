We&#x27;ve gotten used to a few models of digital downloads it seems:<p>1. Pay to &quot;own&quot;[0]: ~$10<p>2. Pay to rent for 24h or so: ~$5<p>3. Unlimited streaming of all titles: ~$15&#x2F;mo<p>It&#x27;d be a bit weird to pay $20 for #2, even for a first-run movie.  I get that the price we pay doesn&#x27;t always reflect just the seller&#x27;s cost (sometimes we pay more just for the perception of a premium product), but it&#x27;s hard to justify paying an extra $15 for the costs of running a theater when you aren&#x27;t actually going to that theater.<p>I get that there are certainly people who would value that (like the OP who has kids and can&#x27;t get out with his wife to go to the theater), but I expect most people of average means would balk at $20 for home viewing, and just wait for a normal rental price or for it to appear on whichever AYCE streaming service the subscribe to.<p>[0] Scare-quotes because of course the download you get is still DRMed, which means you don&#x27;t really truly own the copy.')
