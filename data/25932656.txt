People who choose to eschew these standard components very frequently end up with a site which is unusable for disabled people.</i><p>&gt; <i>Very few people have the skill to turn a div into an effective button, yet over and over I see web sites with rows of buttons which are in fact just divs with javascript behind them.</i><p>Using a div as a button is <i>not</i> &quot;bog-standard&quot; HTML or a &quot;standard component&quot;.  Use a button and be done with it.<p>Using React or whatever does not prevent you from doing this, and in fact makes it less obvious to anyone doing a cursory review.  I&#x27;ve not seen any difference overall in the amount of people knowingly using divs as buttons with plain HTML vs whatever framework, but I have seen an increase in <i>unknowingly</i> doing so by importing a calendar widget or similar without reviewing it.')
