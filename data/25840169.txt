Item(by='codazoda', descendants=3, kids=[25842147, 25840202], score=2, time=1611097491, title='Ask HN: What makes a good problem for a bootstrapped company to solve?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I recently joined YC&#x27;s Future Founders Course, which I think was new last year. From there I ended up on the Kevin Hale talk, &quot;How to Evaluate your Startup Idea&quot;. In that he talks about what investors at YC look for when they&#x27;re evaluating the problem that you&#x27;re trying to solve.<p>He says...<p><pre><code>  - We like problems that are urgent\n  - We like problems that are really expensive to solve  \n  - We like problems that are mandatory  \n  - We like problems that are frequent\n</code></pre>\nIn the &quot;How to Get Startup Ideas&quot; talk, Jared Friedman has some good tips where he suggests the &quot;Idea Quality Score&quot;. With it, there are four questions you use to rate your idea. You rate each of the four questions between 1 and 10 and then average the values to get your score. The questions to ask yourself are...<p><pre><code>  - How big is this idea?\n  - How much expertise do the founders have in what they&#x27;re doing?\n  - How sure are you that you&#x27;re solving a severe problem?\n  - How important is your new insight into this problem?\n</code></pre>\nOther signs you might have a good idea...<p><pre><code>  - Your making something that you personally want to have\n  - It has only recently become possible\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d like to create a small company while I&#x27;m working and I&#x27;d like to bootstrap it myself. So, I&#x27;m focusing on growth but probably nowhere near the startup founders growth. I realize there&#x27;s a chance that I have &quot;Schlep Blindness&quot; and I&#x27;m rejecting ideas that seem hard. But, really expensive problems are probably out, unless I&#x27;ve got a great idea on how to solve them on a shoe string budget. So, I&#x27;m discounting the expensive ideas for my small company.<p>With all that in mind, what do you think makes a good problem for a small bootstrapped company to solve?<p>References:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;6e-how-to-evaluate-startup-ideas\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;8g-how-to-get-startup-ideas')
