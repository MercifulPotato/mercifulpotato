Trump hasn&#x27;t even lost and he&#x27;s already talking about repealing Section 230, and Facebook (I think rightfully) is getting a lot of attention that could lead them to get broken up.<p>No one wants a target on their back when some research firm uncovers that &quot;bad guy X&quot; spent a couple million dollars astroturfing and&#x2F;or abusing the platform or skirting election advertising regulation.
