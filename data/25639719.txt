In this case it was, though, a clearly constrained problem space. For only a few hundred rarely changed nodes, an O(n^4) algorithm (running O(n^2) against every possible n^2 pair of nodes) is perfectly amenable to brute force and caching the results.<p>Totally wouldn&#x27;t work for Google Maps doing shortest path routing globally, but for an event with only a couple of hundred POIs and intersections, it&#x27;s a cheat that seems almost magical to people who have some concept of the algorithmic problem, but haven&#x27;t worked out the &quot;trick&quot;.<p>If I were asked to whiteboard this, I would 100% be asking that constraints of the dataset up front. (I&#x27;m not too sure I&#x27;d have been smart enough to do that a couple of decades back, when I last had a &quot;perform for us code-monkey!&quot; type of job interview...)')
