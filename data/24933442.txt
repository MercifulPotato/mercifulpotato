I worked at Nike and Apple, and when I was there all of my professional (and most of my personal) contacts&#x2F;friends were also co-workers. Fortunately many of them went on to other companies and worked their way up to hiring authority positions.<p>My advice is to expand your network outside of the software dev&#x2F;tech group.
