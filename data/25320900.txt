Unlike a car accident, those that survived do contribute to the spread of the virus and expose people who are at higher risk of a far more fatal outcome. Additionally every person that contracts this has a chance of needing supplemental oxygen and an intensive care bed. These are already in short supply and the people to manage these intensive care facilities aren’t an infinite resource. It is just reckless to expose more people to this virus when we have vaccines on the way to inoculate the highest risk communities.<p>While people certainly have a right to be upset, they don’t have a right to willfully endanger others.')
