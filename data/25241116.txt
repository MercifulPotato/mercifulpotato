Are we still talking about Bazel here, because that’s the size of the download. What about tools like compilers? You have to download those, too.<p>&gt; Running a background JVM daemon process is a NO for me and Bazel wastes system resources.<p>What system resources does it actually use up? A half-gig of RAM? This kind of optimization is penny-wise and pound-foolish. You are spending your precious time and energy worrying about a resource whose marginal cost to you is about the same as a cup of coffee.<p>I run Bazel on a terribly obsolete, seven-year-old laptop which is my daily driver. Sometimes Chrome will choke on a website, sometimes I&#x27;m waiting ages for Homebrew to update or for NPM to download some packages, but Bazel is not a problem.')
