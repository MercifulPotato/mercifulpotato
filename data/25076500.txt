Item(by='brundolf', descendants=None, kids=[25076654], score=None, time=1605222442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25076425, text='&gt; It&#x27;s enough to predict whether I&#x27;m a &quot;good&quot; worker.<p>If your employer is willing to be that invasive, they already have a much easier route for getting that information: forcibly installing surveillance software on your work machine.<p>&gt; It also reveals whenever I travel, which coffee shops and libraries I frequent and what times of day.<p>How...? How would the binaries you&#x27;re running have anything remotely relevant to say about this?<p>&gt; They wouldn&#x27;t need to ask &quot;do you know X&quot;, they could just consult the Apple log of how often I run the relevant commands. Things like &quot;we see you ran &#x27;git&#x27; an average of 145 times per day last month, tell us more about that&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty contrived use-case for a pretty significant and unscrupulous bit of data-sharing. From a PR perspective Apple would never intentionally and publicly share this data. So assuming this data is even stored anywhere after the check is complete, and assuming any personal identification is kept with it, both of which are huge ifs, that leaves a couple of possibilities:<p>- Hackers gain access to the data<p>- Government subpoenas the data<p>- Extremely lucrative contracts, probably from advertising companies, are enough to motivate Apple to sell the data despite the risk of a massive PR scandal<p>I don&#x27;t see any of those falling under your proposed scenario of random employers casually perusing the logs.')
