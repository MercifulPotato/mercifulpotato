Could be just an error.<p>Important clarification, agreed, but that wasn&#x27;t the point of my comment. The point was the retraction of &quot;there are no missing votes, it is nonsense&quot;, and that is yet to happen afaik.<p>I wasn&#x27;t aware that NPR did it already, which is good. But I am still salty that it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as much attention as the initial &quot;we know for a fact there were no missing votes despite zero evidence one way or another&quot; from a bit more &quot;mainstream&quot; publications like CNN and such. But I guess I am moving the goalpost at this point, because you are correct that one of the somewhat mainstream media publications indeed retracted their earlier statement.')
