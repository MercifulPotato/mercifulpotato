Prior to this point in time only hate speech, inciteful, vulgar, things were censored.  To remove speech from the view of others that is contrary to your own simply because you believe it is &quot;garbage&quot; is censorship. Perhaps the other side believes your speech should be censored.  Let&#x27;s have your comment removed because of your generalization of speech you don&#x27;t like as &quot;garbage&quot; doesn&#x27;t conform with the guidelines i just thought of right now and actually, i think your comment is &quot;garbage&quot;. How to punish you for your opinion now? 12 hours ban? 24? Deplatformed? Where does it end? THAT is censorship.')
