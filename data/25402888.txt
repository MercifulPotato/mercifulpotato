You likely won&#x27;t believe the speed.<p>I use ag many times a day to search 10,400 files comprising about 800k lines of code, and it is in every meaningful way completely instantaneous. It also understands repository structures, and so won&#x27;t waste your time there.<p>It seriously changed my (programming) life.')
