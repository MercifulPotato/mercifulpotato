Tens of different graphs I&#x27;ve seen have infection rates go down, like clockwork, roughly 10-14 days after stricter lockdowns are enforced. Keep in mind that they&#x27;re all aware of the economic costs, mental health issues, etc. They&#x27;re not doing this for fun. And they&#x27;re not going to lock us forever, there is no &quot;freedoms&quot; slippery slope here.<p>B) A rather fringe group of libertarians, freedom fighters and the like, who dislike government overreach, prove that models used by all those governments are all wrong, thus indirectly confirming their long held beliefs and biases.<p>In Romanian we say: &quot;If someone says you&#x27;re drunk, ignore them. If two people say that you&#x27;re drunk, go to bed even if you haven&#x27;t touched a bottle of liquor.&quot;<p>The odds of your sources being a scientific revolution are low. They&#x27;re much more likely to be Nostradamuses (Nostradami?) than Galileos.<p>Plus, using Ben Shapiro as a source? Isn&#x27;t he obviously an agenda pushing hypocrite?
