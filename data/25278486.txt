It&#x27;s for one arbitrary month. It&#x27;s not a trend. And it&#x27;s insignificant. Suicides make up a tiny percentage of japan&#x27;s death and population. Sure every suicide is tragic but it&#x27;s really not a serious problem. Their 30 year economic stagnation and their low birthrate is far greater concern than suicide. It&#x27;s the washingtonpost earning money by fetishizing japan&#x2F;suicide and virtue signaling. It&#x27;s one of the many problems with news. It&#x27;s not that they report news, they have to manufacture news every single day. On slow news day, it&#x27;s back to &quot;japan suicides&quot;.<p>Also, wasn&#x27;t there a study that said news of suicide actually contributed to more suicides? That spamming national suicide hotlines across social media actually increased suicides. That most people, including borderline suicidal people, don&#x27;t think about suicide until it is broadcast all over news&#x2F;social media?')
