Item(by='kranner', descendants=None, kids=[25969036], score=None, time=1612007491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25968120, text='The same cookbook recommends weighing eggs as well; recipes specify egg whites&#x2F;yolks&#x2F;whole by weight (all ingredients are specified by both weight and volume, though weight is recommended).<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Likewise, eggs vary slightly in weight from one to another; measuring eggs by weight ensures great accuracy. “Large” eggs are 56 grams&#x2F;2 ounces by definition, but they vary in weight by 10 or more grams, so calling for eggs by weight, as we do in these recipes, guarantees more consistent results. And weighing allows you to use any size egg you have access to, which is especially helpful if you use farm-raised eggs, which are often not graded by size.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;')
