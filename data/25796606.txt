For all you know, the OP had specifically his&#x2F;her aunt in mind.<p>If I wrote that, I’d have my 93 year old grandma who got Signal years in mind. She’s i it because  because I refuse to share pictures of my kids otherwise.<p>Or maybe I’d have my sister in mind. The older one of the two, who has zero interest in this stuff. My youngest sister, OTOH would just as likely advice me to adopt some technology.<p>All this ranging about fake (and it is fake) politeness is oppressive to the thought process. And it’s very irksome and tiring. When I speak, I want to say something.  Not stop and figure out which real an imagined person with a disadvantage might perceive a slight where none is intended.<p>If I mean to insult you, you’ll know.<p>When you write instructions to others, by all means, make the “idiot” a young white man from the Midwest. I don’t care. But, just so you know, my grandma is an inspiration of fierce independence (she lives alone in a bad neighborhood in a third world country ). My sister who doesn’t care about tech is brilliant. They just don’t care about apps. And it’s ok.')
