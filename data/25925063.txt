I don&#x27;t think it has been &quot;recognized&quot; in boring legal terms by any of the organisations that we normally trust to do such things (FSF or OSI).  Apparently Bradley Kuhn of the FSF made an unofficial remark that it&#x27;s a free software license (and I would agree), but clearly being a free license in spirit and philosophy is not the same as being recognized in a legal context.  Have any of the paranoid companies like Google and Microsoft used WTFPL software for anything?  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using WTFPL unless the point is specifically to make life harder for corporations (which I think is a totally valid thing to do).')
