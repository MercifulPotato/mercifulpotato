Item(by='nvilcins', descendants=None, kids=[25848066, 25848986], score=None, time=1611158515, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25846959, text='2 cents from someone living in a post-soviet neighboring-to-Russia country.<p>What I hear very frequently (mostly) from Russian people is stuff like &quot;not sure Navalny is clear himself&quot; or &quot;how come a random blogger know about &#x2F; be involved in so much?&quot; etc. Which then somehow invalidates all the vast amounts of proof of corruption, injustice, and plain incompetency going on.<p>Muddying the waters appears to be Russia&#x27;s&#x2F;Putin&#x27;s weapon of choice. Russian information-bubble is strong.<p>Doesn&#x27;t only apply to Navalny situation, of course. Same goes for the occupation of Crimea, striking of MH17, as well as lots of past crimes that the elite wants to sugar-coat for political reasons.<p>I guess the moral here is to take this into account when someone tells you how the situation in&#x2F;with Russia is &quot;actually not like the media portrays&quot;. (spoiler: it&#x27;s likely even worse)')
