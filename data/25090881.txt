I want the usual photos timeline, but extended to include other artefacts of my daily life. The goal is to roll back to a point in time and find my photos, conversations, transactions, actions and location history.<p>Working on my own files is easy: pull files incrementally to a central place with rsync, then process the changed files. Use their checksum to create previews without duplicates.<p>Working on my own websites is also easy. I just need to add an RSS feed.<p>Unfortunately, fetching data from other sources is much harder. It made me realise how much of my data is held hostage. Most of it can be retrieved manually, but not with a script that runs regularly. Instant messaging and location history are two big examples.<p>Repeatability is another problem. For example, Reddit only lets you access your last 1000 comments.<p>And at last, you must deal with updates. If you go back and revise a comment or a post, the data should be updated.')
