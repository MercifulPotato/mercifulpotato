I spend most of my time developing new features and talking my customers.<p>I know it seems like a lot of tools, but most of them are set up once and forget. Except for the occasional round of dependency updates. But even for that I have automated dependency&#x2F;container scanning to detect vulnerabilities, and get notified if updating an image is recommended.<p>Most of the stack consists of &quot;platform&quot; tools, such as the ingress-nginx, external-dns, or cert-manager. So it&#x27;s stuff I take with me for every project. It&#x27;s like a personal Heroku I&#x27;ve been building, but way cheaper and fully customizable.<p>I&#x27;ve been iterating on this stack over the years with various other projects, and also learned a lot from running Kubernetes in production at my full-time job, so it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d advise for someone who just wants to deploy their MVP for the first time.')
