If we didn’t put so much focus on UX (i.e: if we were building a “boring” typical B2B education tool), we would most likely have gone with React Native (we also have a lot of expertise with React in the team).\nBut we talked with people, and realized that they use our app at the same time that they go on IG, Snapchat or TikTok. What that means for us is that our UX needs to be just as good or even better than those big players if we want to compete on “screen time”.<p>That’s already quite hard to do with a 2 people tech-team, so adding on top of that limitations from cross-platform frameworks would have been shooting ourselves in the foot.')
