Unless of course it&#x27;s us monopolizing it! Then it&#x27;s okay!&quot; Facebook pulled the same shit banning crypto ads and then shilling their crapcoin. Samsung did it by stalling anyone working on blockchain tech designed to run on their devices until they could offer their own solution. Google is doing the same with search ads until it can shill their centralized cloud solutions as a scalability option and whatever other evil shit they have in the pipeline. These companies are the anti-thesis to the blockchain. Paypal&#x27;s crappiness is probably a leading reason &#x27;Satoshi&#x27; invented Bitcoin.')
