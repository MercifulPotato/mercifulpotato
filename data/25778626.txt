People didn&#x27;t, in fact, stick with D&amp;D at the point where Pathfinder launched.  Pathfinder was (relative to the third party RPG market) a huge success.  And 4e D&amp;D was objectively a failure in the market (though sure, it sold more than Pathfinder).<p>Where Wizards won was with the 5e rules.  And the 5e rules are better than Pathfinder in fundamental ways that lead to higher sales and more player satisfaction.<p>And the reason is that 5e is, really for the first time since the Holmes Basic Set of 1978, <i>accessible to the mass market</i>.  Kids like D&amp;D again!  Prior to covid, I ran a 2-year campaign for my 10-12 year old son and a bunch of his friends and they <i>loved</i> it.  Some of them are hooked hard now.  Likewise, couples play 5e; random groups in offices.  You can watch people play it on the internet, and apparently that&#x27;s a big thing too.  There are communities of women and queer folks plugging a game that used to be associated mostly with unwashed cloistered incels.<p>It&#x27;s a straightforward, easy game that gets out of the way and exposes the actual fun part of in-person RPGs to people who would never have had the patience to read through the tomes full of prestige classes and feats that 3.x&#x2F;Pathfinder require.<p>Basically: with 5e WotC finally got back to the promise we all saw in the early 80&#x27;s.  Pathfinder is a fine game, but it&#x27;s really just trying to hang on to a player culture from 2004 that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of growth in it.')
