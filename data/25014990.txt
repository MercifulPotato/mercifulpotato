It&#x27;s actually nothing more... than a whine. &#x27;I find that offensive.&#x27; It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. &#x27;I am offended by that.&#x27; Well, so fucking what.</i><p>I pointed to Americans because they are <i>the only ones who constantly whine about everything</i>, not knowing that they are a very very very small part of the World population and their whines are insignifcant<p>They really can&#x27;t understand it<p>Either because they are dumb or assholes is yet to be determined, but it&#x27;s a fact.<p>Constantly lamenting that GIMP is offensive on every thread about GIMP or GTK or even something not directly related like someone posts &quot;have you ever tried GIMP&quot; or &quot;that could be solved with some GIMP-FU&quot;, while it is actually not a problem for billion of people, is so annoying that I wish Colombo stayed home sick that day he left for the Indias.')
