Item(by='romanoderoma', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604756311, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25014683, text='&gt; If you feel so strongly about &quot;mamma mia&quot;, then you should have no problem with other people feeling strongly about the implications of &#x27;GIMP&#x27;, regardless of its origin (which you haven&#x27;t mentioned once; it&#x27;s a film reference<p>Pffff<p>That&#x27;s some heavy twisting of my words<p>Or some kind of cognitive dissonance<p>I don&#x27;t feel anything about &quot;mamma mia&quot;, I feel that the people that invented a false stereotype, which is also offensive to many, because it&#x27;s not representative of Italians just like Nazis are not representative of Germans, has no right to feel offended by something that is their own creation.<p>Stephen Frey gave the perfect definition of this behaviour<p>&gt; <i>It&#x27;s now very common to hear people say, &#x27;I&#x27;m rather offended by that.&#x27; As if that gives them certain rights. It&#x27;s actually nothing more... than a whine. &#x27;I find that offensive.&#x27; It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. &#x27;I am offended by that.&#x27; Well, so fucking what.</i><p>I pointed to Americans because they are <i>the only ones who constantly whine about everything</i>, not knowing that they are a very very very small part of the World population and their whines are insignifcant<p>They really can&#x27;t understand it<p>Either because they are dumb or assholes is yet to be determined, but it&#x27;s a fact.<p>Constantly lamenting that GIMP is offensive on every thread about GIMP or GTK or even something not directly related like someone posts &quot;have you ever tried GIMP&quot; or &quot;that could be solved with some GIMP-FU&quot;, while it is actually not a problem for billion of people, is so annoying that I wish Colombo stayed home sick that day he left for the Indias.<p>&gt; Actually, they do. It&#x27;s a well-known problem that people don&#x27;t just downvote for content that they think is inappropriate or irrelevant<p>That&#x27;s because the majority of Reddit users read subreddits where the majority of commenters are American<p>It&#x27;s just a bias towards the platform given by the fact that the majority of its userbase comes from the same country with the heavy social issues I was talking about fee paragraphs before.<p>I don&#x27;t hang out with American redditors anymore, I only read subreddits of things I like that are not of interest to American general population and my opinion of Reddit completely changed<p>I also met a lot of Americans there who share this sentiment on their country and are sad of the state of the things, just we were when Berlusconi was an important politcal leader<p>HN, on the other hand, can&#x27;t change because there&#x27;s only one HN and you can&#x27;t make your own sub HN')
