I don&#x27;t want to say that it is wasted money, rather just point out that it feels like a spray&amp;pray approach. We travelled a lot, produced a lot of excel and word documents in a very inefficient way, the outcome, despite being the project &quot;successful&quot;, is completely useless and will never see the light as a commercial product, not even as a useful blueprint for other organizations. All in all it was a depressing experience, knowing that we were going on thanks to taxpayer money. R&amp;D is good and I don&#x27;t want to bash on these initiatives... I guess I just ended up in a project that didn&#x27;t go anywhere.')
