I coded a prototype like this with a few friends after we saw gather.town. We decided to focus on language learning communities because that is an area where people are already using online platforms to meet strangers. (We also thought about dating usecases.) We&#x27;ve since abandoned the concept to pursue other ideas, but here are some thoughts:<p>1. Current platforms don&#x27;t recreate the experience of mingling that you have in real-life. In real-life you can be doing one thing (getting coffee from the kitchenette) and overhear an ongoing conversation which you then decide to join. Is it possible to recreate that serendipity online? (We thought about running speech-to-text on all conversations and showing them in bubbles in the ui so that you could see what other people are talking about before you join the conversation.)<p>2. People want to express themselves in ways other than speech. In the real world you do that via your clothing, the stickers you put on your laptop, the look on your face, etc. How can you recreate that in a digital world? Should you let people &quot;vandalize&quot; the room by drawing on it?<p>3. Is this something that people will have on throughout the day to hang out with friends? Is it something you use only at a time scheduled in advance?<p>4. I play chess online with friends and anecdotally many other people have started doing that in the past year for obvious reasons. Can you embed those types of experiences in Chatmosphere so that I can hang out with friends and do actual activities with them where other people can drop in&#x2F;out of observing? (The same applies to watching youtube videos together, playing video games, etc.) Gather.town is trying to do this, but I didn&#x27;t like their implementation when I last checked it. Bunch is also in this space, obviously.<p>5. There are a LOT of competitors in this space. (Mozilla Hubs, Rambly, Tengable, Calla, High Fidelity, Teamflow, Movement, Sococo, etc.) What is unique about your solution?<p>I&#x27;ve thought about this a lot (and coded a small poc) so I would be happy to chat in more detail if it helps you. (I&#x27;m no longer pursuing this myself.)')
