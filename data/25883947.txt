I saw higher scores for either accounts that followed me out of nowhere (I&#x27;m not interesting enough to draw real strangers), or for accounts that are run as public profiles (an artist with a public account for their comics). I&#x27;m inclined to assume that you likely have either atypical or impersonal twitter habits.')
