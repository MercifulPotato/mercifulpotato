If you can speak English, that&#x27;s fine.<p>In places like Germany and Sweden, irrespective of how educated someone might be, there are larger barriers to integration and migrants are often social outsiders.<p>This isn&#x27;t driven mostly by &#x27;hate&#x27; or anything deeply nefarious, rather it&#x27;s by strong association of &#x27;in-group&#x27; dynamics.<p>The Paradox is that in the US and even in the UK (i.e. Brexit) people are lambasted as &#x27;xenophobic&#x27; by certain parts of the political spectrum when this is demonstrably false. UK&#x2F;US are actually much more likely to believe in the economic value of migrants than elsewhere. They are generally welcoming places, however, due to larger rates of migration - much more existential discussions arise.<p>Of course Anglosphere countries are also much more likley to be aspirational targets for migration in general (though it&#x27;s clearly not always true: kids Maghreb especially want to got to France, and Germany&#x2F;Sweden were popular among Syrian refugees).')
