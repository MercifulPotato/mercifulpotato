So why shouldn&#x27;t I extend that benefit of the doubt to other people too? I assume a lot of people have an innate desire to change and improve as well since lots of people are religious, and the core message of a lot of religions is just that - that you <i>can</i> repent of your past mistakes, change, and become better.')
