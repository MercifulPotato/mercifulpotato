Especially since it seems extremely likely the scaled up iterations will be able to do this properly in short order.<p>I am curious about the other &quot;USB to PCIe cards&quot; though. I know there are NVMe to USB (non TB) adapters these days but I think that&#x27;s largely due to the NVMe protocol being transport agnostic not that PCIe is actually interacting over the USB connection.')
