I don&#x27;t think slave labor is a good thing but I am sure that I, living in the West, have benefitted from historical slavery and continue to benefit from thinly-disguised slavery in sweatshops&#x2F;factories far away from me. Should we just bring back slavery everywhere?<p>The options are not &quot;become a monk&quot; or &quot;give up and take everything you can&quot;. We can all do something to help and&#x2F;or (probably more effective) lobby&#x2F;vote for systemic change but none of us will ever be perfect.')
