That is, if you could write Haskell code that checked that equality, that equality wouldn&#x27;t be enough, because you could write a function `mapStrange foo [x]` that is equal to `map` if `foo = id` and is something else otherwise.<p>But since you can&#x27;t compare 2 functions for equality, and you can&#x27;t compare two arbitrary values for equality, then yes - your informal requirement is enough togethet with the type to force the function to be `map`.')
