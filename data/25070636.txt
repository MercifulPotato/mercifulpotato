Item(by='abeppu', descendants=None, kids=[25070708], score=None, time=1605193689, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25070314, text='&gt; The only problem with blind selection, is that, sooner or later, the race&#x2F;gender&#x2F;sexual orientation&#x2F;religion&#x2F;age becomes apparent.<p>Changing the emphasis of your statement slightly, I think one of the gaps of focusing on blind selection is that by attempting to work around assumed biases within the org, even if it works perfectly in the hiring process, it does nothing for employees once hired (when presumably several of the traits you listed are not going to remain hidden). Blinding part of the hiring process doesn&#x27;t help employees have equal access to projects, growth opportunities, involvement in decision-making, etc.')
