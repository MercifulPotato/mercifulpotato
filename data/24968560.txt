Just yesterday I had to hear about voter intimidation by Trump supporters in my own home town. That&#x27;s not the actions of a few nutters, that&#x27;s action called for and promoted by Trump himself. At the risk of Godwinning, this is straight out of the Nazi playbook. It is not ok to ignore that we are potentially becoming a fascist state.')
