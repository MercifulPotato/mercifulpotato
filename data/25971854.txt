And while that was a true and an objective fact, important context was left out. The context that was missing was that they were being buried on Hart Island, which is literally a mass grave site designated for unidentifiable persons dying of any cause, not just covid. But if you leave that part out it seems like the bodies are piling up so fast and so high the authorities had no choice but to dump the corpses in mass graves. Whereas in truth only unidentifiable&#x2F;unclaimed covid victims were buried on Hart Island, and the same fate happens to any of NYC&#x27;s homeless when they die for any reason and nobody claims the body.<p>Except even your &quot;objective fact&quot; lacks the context.<p>Hart island is and was a mass grave for unidentified&#x2F;unclaimed bodies... however the number of dead going to that island was way way higher than years before during normal times. Hell even in october of last year at a time where the virus was more under control there was still 4 times(360 vs 90) the number normally going to that island. the number buried there through october was over 2 times the total buried there from the previous year with two more months to go in the year.<p>even people who discount covid as a bad, made up thing also can&#x27;t escape the fact that the year is <i>far</i> more deadly from deaths of any cause than prior years:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;excess_deaths.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;excess_deaths.htm</a><p>So either people are dying from <i>something else</i> at an alarming rate that defies predictions or covid is something worth taking seriously(also, the fact that death is not the only outcome and there are people with serious long term negative effects).')
