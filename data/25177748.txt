I&#x27;m just using it as a type example. Gnu-ish software is different in a recognizable way from Google, MSFT, etc. Different enough that both strengths and weaknesses are different.<p>With Calibre, most users won&#x27;t <i>feel</i> like they have a grasp of what the software is and what you can do with it...  compared to an Apple product. But, it&#x27;s super powerful and the answer to a lot of &quot;how do I X?&quot; queries is use calibre. Without calibre, the operative answer would probably be &quot;you can&#x27;t.&quot;')
