You would just argue that there haven&#x27;t been enough runs to accurately assess its safety. If ordinary &quot;safe&quot; car travel results in one fatality for every ten thousand trips (assuming all trips are equal apart from the &#x27;cannonball&#x27; variable for simplicity) and if there have only been 50 cannonball run trips, it&#x27;s entirely possible that cannonball runs are twice as dangerous as a regular trip <i>and we would still expect to see zero bystander incidents in those 50 trips</i>. The question is &quot;have there been enough cannonball runs to accurately assess safety?&quot;.')
