Almost all support questions we field come from people who have no intention of solving a problem.  Most are just anxious people who need a little bit of reassurance, but plenty expect us to do pointless busywork, want to vent emotionally at someone who can&#x27;t fight back, or just generally want to smear shit all over the walls because they can.\nEither way, because they don&#x27;t want to solve a problem, they just keep up eating up your support time and emotional energy in an extended loop for no gain - we&#x27;re talking upwards of 80% of your support resources if you let these people have their way.<p>Having to deal regularly with the type of person that the average HN reader would never come across in their lifetime, I can understand why organisations like Amazon would set up these bureaucratic support &quot;walls&quot; and&#x2F;or outsource all support to a Filipino call centre staffed by people that don&#x27;t even know what Amazon is.\nThe systems are designed to make getting support hard, because most people contacting consumer support literally don&#x27;t even have a problem that good support staff could solve.<p>In this instance, they&#x27;ve clearly made an error in requiring the user to navigate an automated system when the dollar value is in the _millions_, and I understand why the average HN user would be pissed off by a system like this, but I don&#x27;t think the solution to the problem is as simple as &quot;provide good, human support to everyone&quot; - it creates as many problems as it solves.')
