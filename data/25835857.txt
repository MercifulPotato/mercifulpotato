I understand the need to deploy each service independently... but to have +10 deployments within each service seems crazy to me. Is there a reason each service needs so many lambdas (vs deploying the service code as a single lambda function with different branches)?<p>Fwiw, I found it possible to get quite far with a single monolithic lambda function that defined multiple “routes” within it, similar to how an Express server would define routes &amp; middleware.<p>Anyways, thanks for writing that PDF, and good luck with Seed!')
