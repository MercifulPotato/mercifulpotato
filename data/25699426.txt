Some don&#x27;t believe these invasions negatively impact them <i>personally</i>. But I think, largely, it&#x27;s about misplaced (IMO) trust - they trust Facebook et al not to abuse their privacy or &quot;do anything evil&quot;, and perhaps worse, they trust all organs of the government completely and totally. Any suggestion otherwise is waved away as &quot;who cares?&quot;, or dismissed as a conspiracy theory (yes, even post-Snowden).<p>Large sections of the media are certainly part of the problem too (as we are seeing for so many things) - some serious, privacy-related stories are either not covered at all, or covered with pretty blatant, extreme bias.')
