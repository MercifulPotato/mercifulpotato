Item(by='Armisael16', descendants=None, kids=[25483862, 25483852], score=None, time=1608436805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25483626, text='&gt; These people are possibly the most important staff in the hospital: nobody else would be able to do a thing without them<p>I find this viewpoint a little confusing, because that’s true of almost everyone working there. No one gets treated if there aren’t doctors and nurses even if all the equipment is sparkling. No one gets treated if the back office isn’t procuring supplies.<p>The only way to split things along these lines that I’ve heard that makes sense to me is “could the hospital run without these people?”, where you say “not at all even briefly” for the most important group (as opposed to “yes” or “yes for a little bit”).')
