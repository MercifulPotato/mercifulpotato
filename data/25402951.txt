As you point out, if the sensor is just returning an inaccurate it&#x27;s probably fine as you&#x27;re only interested in a relative load value (loaded vs unloaded), not an accurate reading.<p>I don&#x27;t have actual data with regards to this, but the instantaneous force applied to the load cells would likely exceed their spec in the case of a heavier adult jumping on the arrows or otherwise hitting them off center with more force than placing a static load on it.')
