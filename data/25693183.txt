I do think he&#x27;s smart enough, but he&#x27;s got a mortgage, child support, etc &amp; needs to continue to earn income.<p>There are no&#x2F;few opportunities for work in his space in Portland, ME at the moment. He was previously making $70k which is well above the average in that area.<p>Wondering if any HNers have seen folks like Dan use their slightly-oldschool Graphic Design skills in interesting&#x2F;profitable ways.<p>Cheers')
