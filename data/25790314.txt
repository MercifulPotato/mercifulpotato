I tried Vivaldi when it was in beta (or maybe alpha, I don&#x27;t remember. The first few publicly downloadable versions) and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t meet my needs: it did have customizability, but didn&#x27;t support some of the most useful Opera 12 features for my workflow (e.g. MDI) and even more importantly, the UI had a quite bad latency. As you mention, the Opera UI did have a lot of stuff (which you could choose to use or not) but it was the snappiest by a mile. Unfortunately, Vivaldi wasn&#x27;t recreating that when I tried it.<p>I&#x27;ll give it another chance one of these days, though. I&#x27;m hearing a lot of news about it lately so I suppose there will be improvements and maybe the newer versions are closer to what I want.')
