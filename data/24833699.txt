The core Matrix protocol doesn&#x27;t handle contact discovery at all.<p>An entirely separate system exists to facilitate contact discovery. You have to explicitly choose to publish an identifier to it. You choose the server you want to publish to. You choose if, which, and when to query such servers. You choose what to query them with.<p>A server implementation can (in theory) support whatever arbitrary thing it wants to for an identifier. The fact that email addresses are commonly supported is already _significantly_ better than being forced to use a phone number.')
