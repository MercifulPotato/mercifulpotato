And I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s a few other variables that can end up having some effect at later points in the story.<p>Granted, it&#x27;s probably the most-cited example of great Witcher 3 quests, second perhaps only to the romancing options (again, 3 possible outcomes), but I&#x27;ve already come across a few more main and sub-quests where reloading and trying a different option was meaningful.<p>As part of the journey, they might not affect the ending, but in an RPG style game with quests, it&#x27;s just as much about the journey.')
