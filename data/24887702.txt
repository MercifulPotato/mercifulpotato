The risk of dying if you&#x27;re relatively young is low, but it&#x27;s not zero.<p>The chance of dying doesn’t have to be zero to be a non-vulnerable population. The odds of dying if you’re less than 60 or don’t have a comorbidity is less than 0.03% (and that number avalanches downward the younger you are).<p>Given that the general random chance of dying hovers around that number, the increased chance of dying from covid for the non-vulnerable groups is statistically insignificant.<p>Nearly nothing has a zero chance of happening but pragmatically it’s virtually impossible that a non-vulnerable person would die from it.')
