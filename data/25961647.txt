(i.e. Your buddy doing something didn&#x27;t make you angry; you chose at some level to get angry when your buddy did something.)<p>There is no exception for &quot;good anger&quot; or &quot;motivating anger&quot;.<p>At least, I&#x27;m pretty sure that applies to all strains of Buddhism, but there are many, so YMMV.')
