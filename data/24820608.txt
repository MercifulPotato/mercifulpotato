Searching the names and images used in the article returns many other publications which similarly have no masthead, don&#x27;t credit authors, and either provide no physical address or a junk address. Calmatters&#x27; staff photo is recycled on other astroturf publications. Anyway, I guess the point is that good propaganda should be hyperbolic.')
