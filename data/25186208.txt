I would not recommend it after reading that review.<p>Hue, on the other hand, isn&#x27;t <i>just</i> wifi.  It has a box that will hook it to your network, but it&#x27;s also got another wireless protocol that isn&#x27;t affected by your wifi network.    That means that physical Hue switches should continue to work even if your internet is down, a massive advantage of standard wifi bulbs.<p>I haven&#x27;t actually got any Hue bulbs set up at this point, though, so I&#x27;m going on what I&#x27;ve read rather than experienced.')
