Globally, this has been persistent (and recorded) for millennia up until the present day.  This doesn&#x27;t go away unless there&#x27;s incentive for companies to pay them more than they absolutely have to, and treat them better than they absolutely must.<p>There might be some merit to Baumol&#x27;s cost disease, but I&#x27;d wager the studies that support the theory were limited to domestic economies in wealthy countries (orchestras in particular are a weird example because they are propped up often by sponsorship and government arts funding).  Even still, consider now the growing wage disparity in the US, a &#x27;wealthy&#x27; nation, where people are earning less almost across the board excluding tech, yet a sliver of the population is gaining wealth exponentially.  Gained advantages from production efficiencies are being routed by globalisation - the claimed &#x27;uplifting&#x27; force for the poor.  And on the other end, China had to find slaves from somewhere to fulfil demand at the lower end, and suddenly a bunch of &#x27;re-education&#x27; camps pop up and commandeer the most politically expendable population as extra human resources.')
