It&#x27;s not even a study, it&#x27;s just someone putting together some graphs. It&#x27;s not clear that they have any experience in interpreting this sort of data, which is probably important. Random economists poking around datasets they don&#x27;t understand have a habit of coming to weird conclusions that disappear when looked at by subject matter experts.<p>I&#x27;m not sure it even counts as a study, where was it published? Is there a preprint somewhere? Is it just a PowerPoint presentation?')
