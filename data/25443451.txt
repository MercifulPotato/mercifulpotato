So there&#x27;s no additional service to run to use it to make authorization decisions in an application.<p>The other part is that oso policies are written directly over your application data - e.g. the classes&#x2F;types, and can access attributes and call methods. There&#x27;s no integration work needed to get application data available to the policy to start making decisions, nothing to keep in sync, and no additional network overhead.')
