Apple can sell their music service for $9.99 and get some nice profits. Spotify cannot sell at $9.99 with an in app purchase as the remaining money doesn’t cover the license costs.<p>This is the very reason Spotify charges more (if they even allow it anymore) when purchased as an iap.<p>Apple likely has not stomped down on it because that one would be rather clear cut case  for courts.')
