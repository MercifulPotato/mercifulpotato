You also got charged for spam SMS. Prices were completely disjointed from the reality of underlying costs (zero for the telcos).</i><p>&gt; <i>In the following ten years, the tech giants sweeped in, competed, provided a better service, with better cross-platform support, for zero dollar immediate cost to the end customer -- gained a massive following (think whatsapp), and are now vilified for their &quot;monopoly&quot; and the &quot;harm&quot; it has caused.)</i><p>The only thing holding back a messaging-style disruption of voice services is the universal inter-operability of phone numbers.  Various apps can be used for voice calls within the apps themselves but they&#x27;re not compatible with a phone call from a landline for restaurant booking confirmations and such.<p>Google Voice achieves this and Twilio got a mention in the other thread, but I&#x27;m not sure what else is out there (I&#x27;m not in the US so it&#x27;s not a problem I need to solve for myself).  Seems that US telco&#x27;s are still asleep at the wheel in regards to their consumer-level services and will devolve into providing purely network connectivity and losing entirely any of the services that sit atop the network.<p>What&#x27;s ridiculous is that such things have become necessary.  That there&#x27;s no (enforced) legislation to prevent selling any and all contact information that passes a receptionists desk.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=TuringNYC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=TuringNYC</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24749971" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24749971</a>')
