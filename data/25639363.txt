There is no point for companies to take security seriously because what the flip does it matter for them? They&#x27;ll bohoo about how bad it was, fire their security people bring in new ones and nothing will change.<p>In short if you are in the security field at this point you aren&#x27;t being brought in to secure or stop anything you&#x27;re there for upper management to point the blame at when the attack does occur. Because spending money on security cuts into revenue and profits and unlike not investing in paying off technical debt this has no material consequences.')
