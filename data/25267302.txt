I know what you think.  &quot;Jupyter notebooks and Powerpoint, and zero engineering skill.&quot;  That&#x27;s not me.  I mean: I <i>can</i> do those things.  But in a rare confluence of complementary skill, I&#x27;m also highly skilled as an engineer (software engineering, data engineering) and enthusiastic about wrapping great QUANT work into great ENGINEERING work.<p>I mostly work on projects that involve:<p>* mathematical modelling &amp; data fitting (= MACHINE LEARNING).<p>* NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING.<p>* VISUALIZATION (and yes: I know who Edward Tufte is).<p>* creation of dashboards &amp; reporting infrastructure.')
