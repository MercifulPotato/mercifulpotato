Window seats in the back of the plane boarded first, aisle seats in the front boarded last.  United adopted it (they were both part of the Star Alliance), but it didn&#x27;t last; I&#x27;m guessing it was incompatible with the pre-boarding of high-mileage (= high revenue back then) fliers, esp those who wanted overhead space.')
