There&#x27;s place for both nuclear and renewables.<p>Secondly, the goal is to reduce emissions. Increasing renewables (or nuclear for that matter) isn&#x27;t the goal. What we need is a least-cost zero-carbon grid. If that happens to be 0% nuclear, fine. Just as fine as if that happens to be 100% nuclear. Most likely it&#x27;ll be a combination (see e.g. work by Jenkins, Caldeira etc.).<p>&gt; Furthermore, heating and transport make up a large proportion of carbon emissions, and these generally aren&#x27;t powered by nuclear energy.<p>They aren&#x27;t powered by wind or solar either, which are the renewable sources with, so far at least, the best potential. That&#x27;s why there needs to be, together with a massive push to clean and expand the electric grid, a massive push to electrify transportation and heating.')
