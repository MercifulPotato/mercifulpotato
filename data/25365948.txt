After all, as you just admitted, morality changed in the past just as much as it did in the present.<p>Not only was morality not constant in the past, it was not constant geographically, nor even within the same religion (Protestant vs Catholic, Southern Baptist vs Episcopalian). Protestants in the US did not agree with Catholics in Europe, to say nothing of Muslims in the middle east and Buddhists in Asia.<p>What &quot;eternal constant morality&quot; are you appealing to? Are we talking about Protestantism in 1800? Roman Catholicism in 1400? Buddhism in 800 AD? Theocratic Judaism in 200 BC? Kantian categorical imperatives of the early 20th century?<p>So, again, if you claim that morality is constant based on some &quot;past&quot;, it is incumbent upon you to answer : Which past, and in what country&#x2F;tribe&#x2F;kingdom, was the absolute &quot;constant&quot; morality that you claim we should now uphold here in the 21st Century?')
