Take-home pay would be in the region of 2.5-4.5k most likely<p>With 6k salary, you would likely be taking home at most 4k. 6k translates to about 75000 yearly (lomaraha, i.e. holiday bonus, is about 50% of single month&#x27;s pay). With standard deductions, your tax rate would be around 29% (that&#x27;s with 19% municipal tax, it varies a bit depending where you live) &amp; you need to add 8.40% to that for retirement &amp; unemployment (those are required). 6000*(1-0.3745)=3753. Additional 156 if you add 1&#x2F;12 of lomaraha to that.<p>Some additional deductions can bring the value up a bit (transport, home office etc.).')
