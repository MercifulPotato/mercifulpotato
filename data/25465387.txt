Given a snapshot of an arrow suspended in air, how do you know its direction and speed (or if it has been shot at all rather than just been let go in mid-air)? That&#x27;s basically Zeno&#x27;s paradox of the arrow[0]. A snapshot description without speed doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about speed.<p>In the case of light-waves, their propagation is governed by Maxwell&#x27;s equations, which have have a dynamic component (induction).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zeno%27s_paradox#Arrow_paradox" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zeno%27s_paradox#Arrow_paradox</a><p>(Edit: typo.)')
