His knees and feet are painful and will never heal. He is overweight, has multiple cardiac issues and other problems. He lives in a rural town.<p>He&#x27;s also looking to buy an electric bicycle, because he&#x27;s anticipating the day when he won&#x27;t be allowed to drive anymore. He also wants to be able to follow my mom on bike, or me and my siblings, or his grandkids. His car is getting expensive and less and less useful since he&#x27;s been buying his groceries online (yes, even in a rural town).')
