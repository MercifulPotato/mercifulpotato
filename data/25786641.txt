Everybody and their friends decided to jump off the bridge and are now complaining they didn&#x27;t know who owned the river.<p>Twitter only has the power its users give to them. People in aggregate can make mistakes and suffer for them. At this point they should learn not to rely on Twitter but instead they&#x27;d prefer to alter reality so Twitter has to suit them.<p>Right now the EU and Poland want to put their two cents in because the US is having problems, but really they need to shut up for a while. We&#x27;re going through some real stuff here.<p>Regulating social media like this in the US will completely destroy a lot of faith in our society. Capitalism, private property, and free enterprise are core values of US society.. if they bend them for Twitter in support of dickheads right to be dickheads for no reason than that it benefits them to do so ?<p>The Trumpers are upset right now and they claim they&#x27;re &quot;half the country&quot;. They&#x27;ll get over it though because ultimately nothing unusual has happened! The President isn&#x27;t a noble Lord, he&#x27;s supposed to just be a citizen, and anyone can get banned from Twitter. Parler got rinsed away because no one wanted to be associated with them. It&#x27;s not like we haven&#x27;t already had mass killers emerge from anonymous image boards, where they posted their violent intentions and received encouragement, in the last decade. It&#x27;s really not that wild for vendors to look at their moderation policy and decide they want no part of it. I don&#x27;t think it takes much imagination to think of an application that is both legal, politely worded, and within the rules of any service that if publicized would rightfully make them ban you rather than have to defend continuing to serve you. Yes it might suck if you accidentally put that combination of elements together but it is still normal. Compelling service is going to leave a horrific taste in everyone&#x27;s mouth.')
