Subreddits may have quasi-independent moderation (Reddit admins can always intervene if not doing so would cause bigger PR problems than they&#x27;re willing to ignore or deal with in other ways) but there&#x27;s no real way for one subreddit to disassociate with other subreddits.<p>PeerTube (or Mastodon or PixelFed or Lemmy) instances <i>can</i> disassociate from other instances that have incompatible moderation practices, though. Either through allowlisting or denylisting depending on the operators&#x27; risk models.<p>Using Mastodon as a case study: Gab tried to pivot to ActivityPub-based software (I think Mastodon) and yet they were denied the ability to federate with most instances because it&#x27;s a deeply toxic community.')
