If you understand how normal mapping and reflections work in a software Raytracer you shouldn&#x27;t have too much trouble implementing the same algorithms in a hardware accelerated pixel shader for instance.<p>In general I think that implementing a raytracer is just one of these projects that&#x27;s just too cool and simple not to do, so I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be wasting your time anyway.')
