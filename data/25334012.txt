I&#x27;m building Ruffly after experiencing project failures due to bad planning for over a decade. Two out of three software projects fail. They are either late, over budget, or deliver the wrong thing.<p>Ruffly uses past performance data and allows you to scenario plan the project scope so that you can deliver projects on time. Take a look, and if you have any questions or suggestions, I am here for a discussion. Thanks!')
