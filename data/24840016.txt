It&#x27;s not like Google has had great customer support when they started out and later on, as they became a monopoly, they stopped doing that so it&#x27;s one of the (many) signals it&#x27;s a monopoly that doesn&#x27;t care. Google never had customer support, it&#x27;s whole business was built around that model. They are successful BECAUSE of it, not IN SPITE of, and only the latter form can be a signal of monopoly.<p>If you want a more accurate signal here go for &quot;Google doesn&#x27;t care about its users as much as it did many years ago&quot; in terms of anti-user features and changes it&#x27;s making all the time now. But of course that&#x27;s a bit harder to show as happening because you have to take each such change on a case by case basis and show that indeed it&#x27;s hurting more users than it&#x27;s helping (because many such changes while they seem as they go against the prosumer or the HN community, they very much follow what the average Joe needs or wants).')
