In practice, JS compilers&#x2F;bundlers can&#x27;t mangle property names because 1) alias analysis is hard, and 2) property name string logic is ubiquitous in JS 3) the data often flows from APIs, and mangling would make API maintenance hard. Google&#x27;s closure compiler and other static compilers are an issue.<p>As I mentioned in the post, dynamic CSS classnames are also tricky depending on how much gets mangled. We have some techniques in the pipeline for better handling those')
