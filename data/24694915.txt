You can tell a lot of useful things about the food safety of an establishment by looking at it. If the farmer&#x27;s equipment is filthy, or she keeps chickens in the same room she processes the milk, I&#x27;m probably not gonna drink milk from there. If it&#x27;s all spotless, and there are clearly systems and processes being followed, I feel reasonably safe (I&#x27;ve been drinking raw milk most of my life and never once became ill from doing so).<p>These kinds of risks are similar to the risks of eating beef tartare or oysters (things that I also do fairly regularly, including sometimes in developing countries!), and humans have been reasonably successfully managing these risks for a long time, meanwhile some other humans seem to massively overstate the risks for some reason.')
