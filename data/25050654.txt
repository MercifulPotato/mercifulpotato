They&#x27;re generally in something called the Quick Reference Handbook, or QRH, but there are also simple flows that crews are supposed to be trained for. One thing that is key in this situation is to announce &quot;my plane&quot; if you are the one flying...which never happened. The Airbus also has a button to mark sidestick priority, removing the other pilot&#x27;s inputs entirely. That also was not used. No, one part of this (holding the stick full back) could not happen on a Boeing, but the rest of it sure could.<p>The thing that personally scares me is not Airbus&#x27; take on how to fly planes, but rather Boeing&#x27;s current take on the 737MAX where things are physical controls, kinda, somewhat, unless they aren&#x27;t and become fly-by-wire. <i>That&#x27;s</i> the issue with the MAX: if they&#x27;d been willing to train pilots for the new dynamics, rather than try to mask it with MCAS, it&#x27;d be fine.  If it were fully fly-by-wire like an Airbus, it&#x27;d be fine. But the halfway house confused everybody on board.')
