My scores are on the low end of average (mid 400s). Not low enough to warrant corrective T therapy (200s), but enough to wonder if the 600-700 range might mean a big change in quality of life.<p>I was pretty adamant about giving it a shot, and consulted with an endocrinologist who said the same thing (&quot;it&#x27;s not low enough to introduce what would become a life sentence of treatment&quot;). After much stubborn research trying to find a legitimate second opinion[1], I finally conceded that he was right.<p>I&#x27;m all for biohacking, but the one-way&#x2F;ratcheting nature of T therapy specifically should make it an endeavor of last resort.<p>[1] I say legitimate because you can effortlessly find someone who will agree that you and everyone needs a T boost, and will write you an Rx on the spot if you have the cash. An it will work. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s a scam, or particularly deadly. The benefits are just very overplayed compared to their permanence, which is downplayed.')
