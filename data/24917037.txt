It&#x27;s not relevant why he wasn&#x27;t.<p>He had the agency to mitigate the problem, and didn&#x27;t. What happened was not an unpreventable natural disaster. The lesson out of this shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;you don&#x27;t have agency so we need a safety net&quot;, but rather &quot;we often have agency to stay afloat&quot;. Perhaps also &quot;we need a safety net for when our bets don&#x27;t pay off or when we don&#x27;t&quot;.')
