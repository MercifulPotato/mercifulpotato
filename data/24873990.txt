Item(by='mgkimsal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603486178, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24873167, text='&gt; where I have test suits and where I can be totally confident, that everything has a well defined spec of what it should do and where I can&#x27;t break something accidentally without noticing it<p>I&#x27;m often in the middle.  Where I have tests, they&#x27;re not always (or rarely) the result of a &quot;well defined spec&quot;.  But... the tests do reference whatever the understanding of XYZ was at that time.  That&#x27;s often as well-defined as I can get.  Clients will come back months later and say &quot;this is broken&quot;.  Well, no it&#x27;s not.  The tests work just fine.  &quot;No, that&#x27;s wrong, it&#x27;s not supposed to work that way&quot;.  Well.. there&#x27;s a test with notes indicating &quot;do ABC then XYZ&quot; and the test ensures that&#x27;s working based on what was known&#x2F;agreed on at that time.  That&#x27;s often not the same as &quot;well defined&quot; by a long shot.')
