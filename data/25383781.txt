Basic problems like recursion don&#x27;t occur to them, they use a technology they don&#x27;t understand, they are not careful with the number of instances and then burn ~16000 (or close to 2y) of cpu time.<p>Why not test the algorithm locally, realize the problems and fix them? Why test on 1000 instances, not 1 or 2?<p>I get the &quot;move fast, fail fast&quot; attitude and why it is deemed beneficial by some, but this was essentially &quot;goto fail&quot;.')
