Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608761689, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25521038, text='That is a fun presentation, although the title is misleading because it&#x27;s 99% about the Web PKI which is orthogonal to SSL (and TLS). TLS doesn&#x27;t care at all why you trust these certificates, if you want to trust certificates so long as the public key contains the decimal digits 42069 that&#x27;s fine.<p>Even PKIX (the IETF&#x27;s profile for X.509 on the Internet) is orthogonal to TLS as designed, although in practice you&#x27;re creating a world of pain for yourself if you decide you do want TLS but you don&#x27;t want PKIX since the two have grown next to each other for decades.<p>Anyway, almost all of Moxie&#x27;s talk is about the Certificate Authorities in the Web PKI, and not about SSL&#x2F;TLS per se at all. It&#x27;s about his attempt (Convergence) at multi-perspective peer validation for authenticity to eventually replace Certificate Authorities. Could that have worked? Maybe, sort of. It never went anywhere much.<p>Of course in hindsight we can&#x27;t blame Moxie for not guessing what will happen next - I expect few if any of us spent last Xmas thinking &quot;Better enjoy this, next Xmas will be a totally different ball game because of a pandemic virus&quot; either.')
