Hydrogen distribution might be able to use&#x2F;share natural gas infrastructure (not high yield so embridlement isn&#x27;t as big an issue)<p>2. Hydrogen is used for chemical processes (refining&#x2F;ammonia) that can serve as a first step even if use for energy storage never becomes feasible.<p>3.Hydrogen is cheaper to store  (&lt;$10) per kWh than basically anything else (&gt;$50).<p>But it basically won&#x27;t be relevant until we have 12 hours of storage and zero marginal cost electricity 50+% of the year. Then it may be cheaper than overbuilding renewables or capturing gas emissions to cover the last 10-20 percent')
