I haven&#x27;t really seen any discussion of if and why that is actually a good extrapolation to make.<p>So for example in a specific situation, with a specific type of intermingling of a population in which the R value was, say, 1.2, we think the new strain caused that to increase to an R value of 1.8. How does it necessarily follow that taking intervention measures that bring the R value of the base strains down to, say, 0.8 would bring the R value of the new strain to exactly 1.2?<p>There are just so many factors involved, it doesn&#x27;t seem like this could possibly be knowable right now. So there may be some hope that things like getting everyone N95 masks and requiring their use, and closing down indoor activities, which are good measures to control the current strains anyway, could also bring down the reproduction number of the new strain below 1 as well.<p>However, this is all a purely academic exercise anyway. Even in places that are being &quot;aggressive&quot; in countering the virus like San Francisco, we have done exactly nothing to react to new information in the past 1.5 months. Our &quot;lockdown&quot;, which is entirely optional and has no teeth, is clearly not working, but we have neither removed it or strengthened it. The health department has exactly zero plans regarding the vaccine. It feels like we&#x27;ve just given up altogether, and we&#x27;re praying that the private market saves us by somehow distributing the vaccines effectively. And on top of all that, we&#x27;ve handicapped the private market by making it illegal to distribute the vaccine to the vast majority of the population, even the elderly and vulnerable groups!')
