Full credit to Bezos and Amazon for their incredible execution in achieving this. However, monopolies are an example of market failure, and in this case, also an example of an authority able to act as judge + jury where the affected parties have no realistic recourse, while being accountable to no-one. This is why we need government to intervene and ensure competition is restored on both the buyer + seller sides in e-commerce.')
