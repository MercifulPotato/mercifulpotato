But then COVID-19 happened and they all caved in to using Zoom&#x2F;Teams. Those are now heavily recommended, even for use in smaller groups. When promted about it a few of them might say that they care about privacy, too, but that&#x27;s then not reflected in their actions. Even those doing research on privacy or security related topics heavily embrace Zoom&#x2F;Teams.\nAnd as if that&#x27;s not enough, the administration seems to view things like the GDPR as a nuisance, especially since the privacy shield has been invalidated.<p>You might argue that the professors have no choice. But then there actually are non-CS professors from other universities that won&#x27;t even put recorded videos of themselves online. They teach by uploading a few documents. Some stopped teaching altogether. None of that is particularly great. But it shows that professors have some power and would have even more of it as a collective. That in turn means that all those CS professors chose not to exercise it. From what I know it&#x27;s the same at many other universities.<p>I seriously doubt anyone is taught any of the values you&#x27;re talking about any more. The opposite is the case - if you held any of them before you&#x27;ll have to be practical and let them go.')
