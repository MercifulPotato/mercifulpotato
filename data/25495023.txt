(And CentOS was the gateway drug, and now probably someone at IBM, beancounter or VP of sales, or someone with an ideology about how to convert free users into paying customers thought that many current CentOS users will just buy RHEL if they really need RHEL7&#x2F;8. And ... it&#x27;s hard to think they won&#x27;t. The &quot;vendor lock-in&quot; happened the moment they picked CentOS instead of Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu.)<p>The low-level integration is just as good in Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu land too. Hell, Arch does it too pretty well. (There&#x27;s an announcement list about manual updates, it&#x27;s worth subscribing to even if you don&#x27;t use arch[0], because usually the same change will percolate down on the grapevine and next releases of other distros will also change similarly.)<p>[0] btw, I don&#x27;t use arch')
