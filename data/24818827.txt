For instance Twitter and snapchat and Tiktok are very different.  I view the social media landscape as an oligopoly rather than monopolistic and they rarely cross into each others territory.  Also the rate of new meaningful competitors just is not occurring fast enough when a democracy like the US has elections every 4 years.  Theres a mismatch in competitor lane crossing and the rate at which democracy operates.  Theres been what...2 or 3 major new social networks with limited scope that dont really compete with each other in 20 years on the western side?  Its just not enough to make an impact and give people choice especially as we see them act in tandum.')
