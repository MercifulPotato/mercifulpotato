I would have assumed that a majority of these states - and my home state of NJ - would be very anti-drug but these votes with &gt;60% in favor of legalization show that significant portions of America think drug-related activities are not &quot;immoral&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; and should not be criminalized.<p>If you had asked me a few years ago if I thought this was what the general American populous thought I&#x27;d have said no because, of all of the politicians who advocated for legalization of drugs, very very few got elected.<p>Maybe now that politicians see that people are very against drug laws we&#x27;ll see some of them renege on their hard anti-drug stances.')
