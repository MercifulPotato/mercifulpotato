The Democratic party had a large lead at the start from postal votes, but that shrunk as more early voting happened.<p><pre><code>  Date         Likely Democratic lead\n  24 Oct 2020     386,908\n  26 Oct 2020     354,654\n  27 Oct 2020     299,021\n  28 Oct 2020     245,912\n  29 Oct 2020     204,277\n  1 Nov 2020     94,325\n  2 Nov 2020     108,123\n  3 Nov 2020     114,889\n\n</code></pre>\nTo me this indicates that the narrative of postal votes being vastly more from the Democratic party holds up.<p>In states (like PA) where postal votes weren&#x27;t counted until after polls closed we&#x27;d absolutely expect to see a large Republican lead which would shrink as postal votes were counted.')
