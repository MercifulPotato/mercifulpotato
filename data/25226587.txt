I had an idea to make an app that did just this. Unfortunately I never got further than a command line proof of concept that returned the co-ordinates of the point on Earth directly opposite any location you entered --before deciding me and Objective-C just weren&#x27;t going to get along.<p>Good to see my &#x27;killer app&#x27; idea being brought to life, all these years later.
