You&#x27;re quite right that &quot;not to have to deal with politics is just privilege,&quot; but it&#x27;s clearly a lesson you haven&#x27;t learned.<p>&gt; Rather than being snarky, why don&#x27;t you share some of what you know so the rest of us can learn? I mean that quite sincerely.<p>If you could explain how you reconcile everything you quoted about politics with the ban on politics, I could perhaps help you understand. I can&#x27;t really grasp what it is you don&#x27;t understand.')
