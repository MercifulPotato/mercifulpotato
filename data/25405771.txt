Then again, irony seems to  be in vogue these days.<p>The article admittedly goes on to find some &quot;prescience&quot; in Schmitts thinking but the purpose of the piece is above all to reveal and attach a brown aspect to the Brexit movement, nothing else.<p>Wikipedia says it more clearly [0]: &quot;Schmitt joined the Nazi Party on 1 May 1933.  Within days, he supported the party in the burning of books by Jewish authors, rejoiced in the burning of &#x27;un-German&#x27; and &#x27;anti-German&#x27; material, and called for a much more extensive purge, to include works by authors influenced by Jewish ideas. In July Hermann Göring appointed him State Councillor for Prussia, and in November he became the president of the &#x27;Union of National-Socialist Jurists&#x27;.(...) He presented his theories as an ideological foundation of the Nazi dictatorship and a justification of the Führer state concerning legal philosophy, particularly through the concept of auctoritas.&quot;<p>and<p>&quot;In 1945, American forces captured Schmitt and, after spending more than a year in an internment camp, he returned to his home town (...) . He remained unrepentant for his role in the creation of the Nazi state, and refused every attempt at de-nazification, which barred him from academic jobs.&quot;<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carl_Schmitt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carl_Schmitt</a>')
