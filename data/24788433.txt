As soon as third parties started to work out exploits to your conceptual system, ya got involved.<p>&#x27;The algorithm&#x27; has a lot to do with this, but at heart it&#x27;s an exploit and not the algorithm itself. Until the algorithm is actually intelligent and can think about itself and what it&#x27;s doing, you and the company you work for are exploitable. As such, you may feel democratization of media and the ability for individuals to broadcast and information-search is vital to societies and humanity as a whole, and you&#x27;d be right, but that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re doing. So long as your work is exploitable in this way, you become partisan, you are just blind to WHO you are being partisan for. And we&#x27;ve seen some pretty wild consequences out of the range of possible outcomes this produces.')
