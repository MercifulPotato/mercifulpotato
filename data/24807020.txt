I&#x27;m also not accusing anyone of anything. I&#x27;m very specifically asking a question and revealing my opinions and reasoning for my opinoin on the matter as a non-expert on the subject.<p>edit: it should also be noted that the article says she was diagnosed with sociopathy which isn&#x27;t even in the DSM-5. In fact the word sociopathy appears once in the entire DSM-5 as an incorrect term to describe antisocial personality disorder. Which to me is a red-flag for self-diagnosis.')
