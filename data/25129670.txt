It&#x27;s not like Chinese or Japanese with their many thousands of characters could have fit in those 2,048 spots <i>anyways</i>. So it makes sense to allocate the small common alphabets there.<p>Second, text is so comparatively tiny relative to photos, video, code, etc. that it really doesn&#x27;t matter at all anyways.<p>Third, text is often zipped <i>as well</i>. It&#x27;s often zipped over HTTP. It&#x27;s zipped when it sits inside of an EPUB. It&#x27;s zipped when it sits inside a Word document. You can even configure MySQL to zip text fields in a database. Basically, whenever space <i>is</i> an issue, you can fix it.<p>So it&#x27;s hard to see how this is any problem in practice at all, when phones and computers mostly ship with 32 GB of SSD minimum.')
