Or when you deploy client code and the code-split chunks have changed. It&#x27;s true that with this approach it likely becomes a more common problem.<p>One way to solve this is immutable deployments where the server runs the version of the code that the client is on. Many providers already do immutable delpoyments so there&#x27;s possible integration there. It could also have some kind of a fallback where a coarser refetch is triggered when the versions become incompatible.<p>We expect that hosting providers will be innovating in this area in the future, too.')
