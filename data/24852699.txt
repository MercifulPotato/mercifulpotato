Their code was the source of truth for correctness. No matter horrible terrible their syntax, they would have been sufferable if they had grammars.<p>Bespoke parsing of expressions benefits from having an implicit grammar, like this OC. But threshold for needing explicit grammars is pretty low.<p>Prime examples are all the data exchange formats. Descriptions of JSON and CSV are short and naively reasonable, but insufficient. As we&#x27;ve seen, any ambiguity that can happen will happen.')
