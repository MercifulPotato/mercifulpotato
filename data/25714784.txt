Item(by='brmgb', descendants=None, kids=[25715559], score=None, time=1610288183, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25712781, text='&gt; pronounce ps as in &quot;pissed&quot; without the &quot;i&quot;, instead of just the &quot;s&quot; (the &quot;p&quot; is silent), which is the correct way to pronounce it in English.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely lost reading your comment as neither the p nor the i are silent in pissed (&#x2F;pÉªst&#x2F;). The only weird part is the &quot;ed&quot; pronounced &quot;t&quot; but that&#x27;s fairly common in English.<p>I also don&#x27;t get the part about &quot;ps&quot; in romance languages. There is no special pronunciation rule regarding this group of letters in French. Are you sure it&#x27;s not specific to Italian?<p>Edit: I think I now realized you might be talking about the pronunciation of words like pseudo and psyched where the p would indeed be pronunced where it French (and I guess in the same way in Italian).')
