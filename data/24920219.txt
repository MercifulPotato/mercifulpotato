Hacker News participants aren&#x27;t going to have any impact on regulators, so while I try to persuade that this automation development is necessary (because I genuinely believe that, and have lost loved ones [plural] to vehicular accidents), it&#x27;s moot beyond discussion (and there are <i>so many discussions</i> [1]). Some will argue that any deaths are too much, other will argue that many deaths are reasonable. I argue that some deaths will occur, which will lead to less deaths overall over the long term (which I would also argue is a goal we could all agree on), and I don&#x27;t believe this is an unreasonable position to hold.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?q=tesla+autopilot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?q=tesla+autopilot</a>')
