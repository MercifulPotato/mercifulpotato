Item(by='jeffbee', descendants=None, kids=[25023100], score=None, time=1604808598, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25022627, text='I think signal path degradation is thinking that can only be applied to linear amplifiers, and Class D amps are anything but linear. They literally short the power supply into the load with nanosecond timing. The transfer function through all that lossy, distorting stuff in the output path is pre-computed and equalized out by the DSP.<p>If I had been more clear about what I was trying to say, I wouldn&#x27;t have said slow and fast. What I was trying to emphasize was that the linear power amps are optimized around a linear ideal of a transistor that never existed. By contrast, the Class D amplifier exploits the characteristics of the transistors we actually make today: high dv&#x2F;dt, high di&#x2F;dt, Rds(on) close to zero. There are fifty companies out there trying to outdo each other on these stats and the closer they get to infinity&#x2F;zero, the better the output of these new amps becomes. There are fewer people out there any more trying to make transistors more linear in the linear region.')
