In line with my theory that Covid (or at least, the overall response to it) has accelerated all that was going wrong in the world, I have seen similar disturbing trends among scientific academics. That is - the science (couched in terms impenetrable to the layman) is right, actions are being taken in the best interest of all, and daring to question it marks you as anti-science (when questioning the status quo really <i>is</i> the essence of science). The comparison to state-sponsored religion is very apt.')
