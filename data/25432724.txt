That is, do they connect the bad policies to the bad outcomes, or will they still favor the bad policies?<p>They are leaving because of high prices caused by factors that are just as present in cities in Texas.<p>They&#x27;re bringing their money and jobs with them, so they&#x27;ll bring some of those higher prices too.<p>It&#x27;s supply and demand, not liberal or conservative policies.<p>Texas conservative suburb-dwellers don&#x27;t want higher density housing either. They especially don&#x27;t want lower income folks near them! Look at how litle public transit exists, because such things would let the poor people get closer to their little burb.<p>Why are so many people falling for this &quot;hey, look, we have lower prices, therefore we have better policies&quot; talking point? Been there, done that. Lower prices are because I <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> pay as much to live there, that&#x27;s not higher desirability.')
