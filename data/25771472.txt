It used to be minimum feature size, or just L of the gate, but with finfet it can be an overloaded term. Scaling in x of .75 and y of .7 lead to 10% performance improvement per node at Intel. TSMC hasn&#x27;t been that clear. And that doesn&#x27;t even account for increase in metal layers, pitch of layers (or if they use poly lower layers to get even faster gains), or average track density due to above&#x2F;below electromigration minimums.<p>EDIT: All of this stuff is usually stated at ISSCC every time a new process is announced, so it isn&#x27;t NDA. I haven&#x27;t followed this in years which is why I was asking for a process person to step in.')
