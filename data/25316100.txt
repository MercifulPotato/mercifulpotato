Item(by='Sunspark', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607187886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25315623, text='I have a regular 16:9 monitor, 2048x1152, in which I have Windows font scaling set at 150%.<p>The reason I prefer AA off (with fonts that were designed for it like Verdana or Bitstream Vera Sans Mono) is because I find it less tiring on the eyes. With AA off, the edges are all sharp and crisp, there&#x27;s no blurriness. It looks closer to print. When AA is on, they look smeared and don&#x27;t have clearly defined edges.<p>What is also a puzzler, as displays become increasingly higher resolution, now 4K and heading toward 8K, the need for AA is supposed to disappear. You don&#x27;t need to fake smoothness at high pixel resolutions, yet many OSes are actually now making it harder to turn AA off.<p>It gets dumber.. OSes that used RGB subpixel AA (cleartype) because they&#x27;re now on tablets and other devices that rotate, they can&#x27;t count on the RGB stripe, so they stopped using RGB subpixel AA and went back to greyscale AA.')
