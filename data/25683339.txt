Rarely required services might have a small footprint, but that&#x27;s because they service a very large area. You&#x27;re not going to have hospitals after every mile. You&#x27;re going to have one for a small city and a few for larger cities. This means that getting to the hospital for most residents is not going to be walkable.<p>2. Many businesses of a similar kind seem to cluster together. Eg lots of (competing) shops will be in the same location instead of being spread out. This means that you&#x27;ll have disproportionate amounts of some businesses at the expense of other services in your area.<p>3. Jobs and specialization. If you&#x27;ve specialized in a field that is only hired in some specific places, then you&#x27;re going to be doing a longer commute unless you can move close to your job. If it&#x27;s a high paying job then chances are that this will be a very expensive area - some people will accept a longer trip to work to save the money.<p>I think this kind of analysis is great. It would certainly help if cities were more walkable, but I don&#x27;t think that we can go without driving infrastructure.')
