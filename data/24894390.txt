They expect full support. They will also follow directions on any website without knowing what they&#x27;re doing, and mess things up. The move to lock down computers isn&#x27;t really a Big Brother conspiracy to prevent us from doing things on our computers that The Man doesn&#x27;t want us to. It&#x27;s a safety measure to stop inexperienced users bricking their machines and demanding support fix it.<p>Purism (and others) sell &quot;overpriced&quot; computers to people who know what we&#x27;re doing. When I had a problem on my Purism laptop, they told me to unscrew the back and check the connections. That&#x27;s not something that Dell can do with their customers.<p>I think they&#x27;ll always stay &quot;overpriced&quot;, partly because we&#x27;re happy paying for the extra freedom. And partly so that they don&#x27;t become mainstream and end up with a huge support overhead.<p>Given that the author&#x27;s demands are being met, exactly, by Purism (etc), then I don&#x27;t think he gets to complain that it&#x27;s &quot;too expensive&quot; - that&#x27;s not how markets work. You have a niche need, you pay a niche price. Stop with the Big Brother conspiracy theories and pay the extra cash to get the specific thing you want.')
