An interesting way seeing ideology at work is when people start framing policy choice as the natural state of things.<p>It isn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s a clever propaganda trick to make people think it is.  How much opposition will you get if you convince people that to oppose you would be like arguing against having the tide coming in tomorrow?<p>How work is organized is a political decision for a society, and some people want that decision to be gigs for larger segment of workers.
