You can aggressively point things like intermediate compilation steps or testing databases to a ramdrive. Any time you&#x27;re doing anything moderately expensive you can cache the result in RAM to make it cheaper to use next time. When choosing algorithms you can bias heavily toward time in any time-space tradeoffs.<p>&gt; Do you think most developers can benefit with this much RAM?<p>I&#x27;d wager they could use more than they have typically ;) But no, 512GB seems excessive to me for most developer use cases with today&#x27;s software. In my current job I haven&#x27;t had a single use case for that much, and there have only been a few instances where 128GB would have been much more productive than what I have.')
