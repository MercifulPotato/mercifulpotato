At the time, from my recollection, the mainstream view as that human culture at 10k BPE was nowhere near being able to produce the kind of social organisation that a complex like Göbekli Tepe would require. Was the book ahead of its time in recognising the potential for something like  Göbekli Tepe? Or does it need a new edition, in light of what&#x27;s been discovered?')
