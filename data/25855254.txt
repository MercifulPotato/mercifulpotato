Item(by='noetic_techy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611201856, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25848512, text='&gt;&gt;I don&#x27;t think very many people are saying it is impossible that Oumuamua was an alien construct<p>Listen to his interviews, he is talking about his colleagues at Harvard, not the general public.  They are the ones saying things like &quot;I wish it never existed because we can&#x27;t explain it&quot;<p>&gt;&gt;it is a pretty big fallacy to say &quot;we don&#x27;t understand it, therefore it was aliens&quot;.<p>Again, this is not at all what he is saying.  Read his paper and listen to his interviews.  It exhibits the signs and being an artificial construct, and he even points to a similar object that was detected that turned out to be a booster launched back in the 50s.  You can&#x27;t easily explain the acceleration of the object with known natural entities like comets and asteroids.  It showed no plume nor ejecta, yet seemed to gain speed equivalent to 10% of its mass being ejected.  The reason the booster did this was due to the push of solar winds on a thin shell of a hollow object.  Hence the theory that this may be some kind of alien solar sail.  It does have an extremely odd geometry.  The renderings of it being a large turd of an asteroid is pure speculation.  There is no clear picture of it.  I bet if Voyager 1 made it to another star system it would accelerate also due to its thin surfaces and exhibit the same profile, albeit smaller.  And we left a gold disk with our address on it.  What if it has technology that we haven&#x27;t even conceived of?  It actually would be worth while for our species to mount an expedition to catch up with it and turn it around.  Sounds expensive but wow would it be huge if it was an alien craft.')
