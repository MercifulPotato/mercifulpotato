They &quot;just&quot; need to pay twice for it. The over 100% borrows happen like this:<p>Alice owns one GME. Bob borrows the share and sells it to John. John doesn&#x27;t know this is borrowed stock and borrows it to Lisa. This way way you got two borrows on one stock.<p>As you can see, the hedgefonds likely already recovered some stocks from 140% down to 113%.<p>Their intention was to speculate on Gamespots bankruptcy and there for not even have to buy back any shares. That&#x27;s why they overshot like this and also why they are human scum needing to bleed for their sins.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know what it means for the short squeeze, if they reach &lt;100%. I assume at that point it becomes less of an we against them, and increasingly more of an everyone against everyone, again.')
