I used to in the past, but not any longer. I don&#x27;t know where you get the assumption that things like Planet eBook are specifically targeted to people who read a lot.<p>I have no intention at all to buy into Amazon&#x27;s walled garden.<p>I want to own my books, not having to take the risk that books disappear from a subscribed service at any time.<p>I sometimes read books from Project Gutenberg, I also often buy books; but only if they have no DRM, or if I know I can strip the DRM from them. Only them I can be sure that I really have the book available for reading at any time and any device.')
