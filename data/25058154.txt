For many months I struggled with performance issues and throttling on my Macbook Pro (15 inch, mid 2017).  I went down a bunch of rabbit holes, messing with Time Machine backup, paranoia about specific apps pegging the CPU.  The issue with one side of the thunderbolt ports running hotter than the other, and maybe that was causing the system to heat up to the point of throttling.<p>Finally I discovered it was my external monitors - I have have 2 4k monitors connected and I use display scaling on both.  This apparently strains the integrated GPU, heats up the system, and caused the throttling.  As ridiculous as it was to purchase an external enclosure and video card - that solved the issue.  Now the system runs flawlessly.')
