Are there more recent #s? A lot has changed in the last 5 years.<p>I&#x27;d also argue that &quot;Facebook: We told them to join these groups&quot; is a misleading take, since it&#x27;s not a quote from Facebook and it&#x27;s twisting their words. I guess &quot;64% of Facebook users joined groups via recommendations&quot; isn&#x27;t sexy enough of a headline.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that no one mentions the percentage for non-extremist groups. Assuming the omission is intentional, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the rate for rate for extremist groups is actually lower than for nonextremist groups')
