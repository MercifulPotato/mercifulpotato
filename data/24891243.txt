When I was still there it was either take all 30 days in a row, or two 15 day blocks, but AFAIK there was some kind of reform recently that made it a little bit more flexible.<p>&gt; I love my country but there&#x27;s no way in hell I&#x27;d go back to those working ways<p>Yeah. I&#x27;d only go back if I could work a remote job for an overseas company.')
