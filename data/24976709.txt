Looking at my screen now, I would fat finger just about everything if it was a touch screen as sensitive as my iPhone (where I fat finger quite a few of things, and my fingers are really quite narrow). The mouse is a precision instrument. Your finger is not. I&#x27;d hate for the UI to suffer due to catering toward a less precise input I have no intention of ever using.')
