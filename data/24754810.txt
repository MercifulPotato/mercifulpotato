The only &quot;true facts&quot; that newspapers publish are those that are cherry-picked.<p>I, personally, accept climate change on faith because I defer to the experts. However, it&#x27;s shocking to me how inaccessible unbiased facts are. It is conceivable that record cold temps are being set just as often. It&#x27;s conceivable that nearly everything is a record if global averages are just now being recorded by month (or if they have been rebaselined after a methodology change).<p>Articles like this raise more questions than they answer. They aren&#x27;t going to convince someone who isn&#x27;t already convinced, and they only demoralize those who already are convinced.')
