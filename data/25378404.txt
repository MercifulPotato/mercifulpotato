The companies I&#x27;ve programmed clojure in were sizable and bet on it for their entire stack, and hired very sharp senior people to work on them.<p>Even there, the projects suffered so much to hit release dates and stay understandable as the system grew that velocity suffered relative to peers doing experiments in traditional OO languages.
