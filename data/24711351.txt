Item(by='oarsinsync', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602096689, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24710971, text='&gt; Guessing how long to fix, or how many &quot;points&quot; a bug will take is complete BS next to real-world values.<p>The difficulty is that &quot;how long to fix&quot; literally has to be a guess. Even with up front investment to investigate the nature of the bug and how to go about fixing it, the end result is still a guess, just a more educated guess.<p>Unless you&#x27;re exceptionally good at predicting the future. We should have a sidebar chat if this applies to you.')
