Says who? The Soviets did a great many things. It doesn&#x27;t mean all of them are &quot;Soviet things&quot;. Nationalized healthcare predates the Soviets, still exists in nearly all capitalist countries in one form or another, and is viewed largely positively in each of those countries.<p>The Soviets had a powerful military and infamous police force. When you say &quot;Soviet Russia&quot; the average person will think &quot;Red Army&quot; and &quot;KGB&quot; before nationalized healthcare. Going by your logic are the military and police &quot;socialist ideas&quot;? They use government money to provide an equal level of service to all inhabitants of the nation - namely protecting and safeguarding them. Police and military obviously predate socialism&#x2F;communism but the Soviets were renowned for them, so that makes them socialist ideas, right?<p>Comparing racism in Nazism - a core central tenet, and one that&#x27;s actively harmful, to nationalized healthcare in communism - an incidental feature, mostly positive, and also found in nearly every capitalist country, is a strawman.')
