But I appreciate the decompiler. While it isn&#x27;t perfect, it reverses simple functions to C like pseudo-code a lot faster than I can (not that I&#x27;m fast at that anyway). Combining it with the free version of IDA (the disassembler, not the decompiler of IDA) has helped me a lot with hackthebox.eu challenges :)')
