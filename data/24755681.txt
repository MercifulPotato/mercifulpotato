And yet there are many disputes over the facts in our world, and the &quot;Fact Check&quot; is an entire genre of opinion journalism these days, and Facebook is already applying censorship based on these opinions.<p>Take, for instance, this overtly right-wing partisan here, John Stossel, also writing within the past week:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pjmedia.com&#x2F;columns&#x2F;john-stossel&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;fake-fact-checking-n1011737" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pjmedia.com&#x2F;columns&#x2F;john-stossel&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;fake-fac...</a><p>I have little traffick with John Stossel&#x27;s work, and will not attest to any specific claims about wildfires, but Facebook&#x27;s idea of &quot;fact checking&quot; this specific video involves groups like Climate Feedback, who are apparently empowered to lie about Professor Stefan Doerr of Swansea University reviewing his video.<p>This is not about Stossel, whose work I will not condone here. This how much you should trust Facebook to be an effective arbiter of Factual Truth, which should be very near zero. And there&#x27;s a word for enforcing the &quot;Factual Truth&quot; like this: it&#x27;s called Orthodoxy.')
