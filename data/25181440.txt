I would argue this is a blub example, in that this person&#x27;s lens does not contain enough context or experience to be able to assess value.<p>Terraform&#x27;s value becomes clear when moving in scenarios like moving from CloudFormation to Terraform, or when trying to integrate a second cloud&#x27;s resources into your infrastructure workflow.  Without experience in anything other than Heroku, of course a tool designed to do many many things is going to seem complex and at times frustrating.<p>&gt; Iteration times are way longer than with even mobile apps. Like, “you’re liable to task-switch while waiting to see plan output” longer.<p>I&#x27;m over here laughing in my &quot;over an hour of CloudFormation only to have a run fail, and then a rollback fail, and have to contact AWS support&quot; life.')
