One is to have 2 or less mega-platforms (e.g. iPhone&#x2F;Android is a duopoly, Google &amp; Facebook are monopolies) that are barely compatible.<p>The other is that the ecosystem is so open that competition is easy - e.g. email.<p>The fears of some lawmakers about &quot;if we break up US companies, then Chinese alternatives will take over&quot; are misguided. This is pretty easy to prevent by (1) mandating compatibility (e.g. all social media must be open &#x2F; federated, all phones must support all app frameworks) or (2) simply banning &quot;rogue&quot; companies (e.g. Chinese or in general those linked with security agencies and&#x2F;or totalitarian regimes).<p>In the long term, in particular (1) would IMO foster a lot of competition, and be hugely beneficial to consumers. In part because the market would be much more open - if some company wrongs you (sells&#x2F;leaks your data?) you just move to another company.')
