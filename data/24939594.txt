Op-eds are still a matter of editorial decisions - obviously, papers don&#x27;t just publish anything by anyone.<p>Maybe this is breaching the agree Greenwald had with the editor(s). But independent op-eds able to say whatever they want isn&#x27;t a principle of <i>journalistic integrity</i>. Questions of that sort revolve around whether you lie or misdirect or run paid articles and so-forth. That you refuse to run an op-ed right when your writer really want it published is a wholly different question, one clearly about the paper having indeed evolved to a left-liberal position while Greenwald maintains his conservative&#x2F;Libertarian principles - ie, the argument is political.')
