They take a <i>lot</i> of cells. Eg, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nicholas.carlini.com&#x2F;writing&#x2F;2020&#x2F;intro-to-circuits-game-of-life.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nicholas.carlini.com&#x2F;writing&#x2F;2020&#x2F;intro-to-circuits-...</a> .<p>You end up using scores of cells to emulate one simple logic circuit - and the implementation contains many hardware versions of that logic circuits.<p>Note also that in practice the high-performance, long-time Life implementations use hashlife. This gets its speedup because of redundancies in large life boards - a redundancy that doesn&#x27;t really exist for, say, matrix multiplies.<p>And hashlife is harder to implement in hardware.')
