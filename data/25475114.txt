The root cause of these crashes is a mind-bogglingly irresponsible bit of design that can be linked <i>directly</i> to decision makers at Boeing deciding to prioritize corporate profits over human lives.<p>I don&#x27;t have a hard time believing that we won&#x27;t see any more MCAS-related trim runaway accidents after the scrutiny of the past two years, but what evidence do we have that the dysfunctional leadership behind this particular flaw is the exception rather than the rule?<p>When the Max was flying, it was still extremely unlikely that you&#x27;d die on one, but dying is a pretty big deal (to me, at least). For the foreseeable future, I&#x27;ll be choosing alternatives to Boeing when they&#x27;re available.')
