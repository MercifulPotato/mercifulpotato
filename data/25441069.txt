I find floating window manager like Windows, MacOS, Gnome, Kde really inefficient at managing screen space. Even more now that we have big screens.\nTilling window managers for me brings a few things:\n* Almost never require to resize or position a window, the window manager optimise the layout for you. It removes the constant needs of organizing window\n* Combine with workspaces and multiple monitors makes working with a lot of windows so much easier\n* Finally, and this is the most important win for me, it is easy to manage everything with a keyboard. Even the few times I need to resize windows, it&#x27;s such a pleasure to resize all the windows of the current workspace in one go with a simple keyboard shortcut.<p>It takes a bit of time to get used to it, especially since most tilling window manager I&#x27;ve used require a bit of customisation to bet to my taste but once I&#x27;ve been used to it, going back to clicking on menus, moving things around with a mouse or a touchpad is just not possible. I find this so inefficient, exhausting and, first and foremost, something that should be avoidable.')
