Connecting doxing as a privacy violation to free speech is a very interesting point that I didn&#x27;t think about - I was thinking about data collection and tracking when talking about privacy violations.<p>For what you bring up with doxing, I don&#x27;t think I have a very satisfying answer. I definitely won&#x27;t advocate for keeping it on social media websites. But I can&#x27;t advocate for all-powerful tools that would allow even for actually dangerous content like that to be tracked down and removed from <i>everywhere</i>, because there is no way to ensure that tools like that will not be abused.<p>Remove it from Twitter, block it on your own federation nodes, try to bring the perpetrators to justice, but, as painful as it is, you shouldn&#x27;t have a magic button that would be able to <i>completely</i> eradicate that from the internet.<p>It would also be good to reduce data collection and to teach people to be more conscious of what they share to prevent private information from leaking to begin with.')
