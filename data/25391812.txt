I think a Hilton is normally upwards of $200 a night, plus $50 per night for parking ($1400-1750 depending if you have a car). The average American earns $900 per week and is probably not dropping that kind of money on a hotel.<p>They&#x27;re also pretty geared towards business travelers, with lots of premium conveniences that aren&#x27;t needed by someone traveling to visit friends or something. For example, I usually prefer a basic kitchen with a fridge rather than room service for $40 per meal. I&#x27;ll happily take the room service if I have work to do and my employer is paying, though.')
