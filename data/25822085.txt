Stochastic nets have a &quot;master equation&quot; which spits out a system of PDEs representing reactions where many many things happen at the same time, and so it makes more sense to think in terms of concentrations etc.<p>We are working to capture this categorically as well. We are perfectly conscious of how a discrete system won&#x27;t help you if you have an Avogadro number of things going around. Just give us time. :)')
