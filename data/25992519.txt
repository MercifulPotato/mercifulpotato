A couple of additional plus points to above:<p>1. Integration with jinja2 , meaning I was able to use all my view templates virtually untouched.<p>2. uvicorn supported out the box, meaning there&#x27;s a production-grade web server ready to go.  It&#x27;ll need some work for very high volumes I&#x27;d imagine - but for low-medium load (c.10s-100s req&#x2F;sec) it&#x27;s working just fine for me.<p>Flask is clear that the built-in server is not for prod use.  It&#x27;s not a show-stopper in the great scheme of things.  But it&#x27;s just one less thing to worry about with FastAPI.  Building a docker image is trivially easy, so lots of hosting options.')
