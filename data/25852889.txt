For example, I have repeatedly tested Manchego cheese, expecting to eventually grow to like it (I love a wide variety of cheeses), but somehow I still don’t like it. The same with some forms of music that others may love which I have tried to appreciate, but I just never grow fond of the genre.<p>That said, perhaps a counter-example: I have found that at my favourite restaurants (more than one cuisine), I can pick anything on the menu, and I will like it even though it may a dish or contain an ingredient I would usually dislike... but maybe that is because a seasoning&#x2F;sauce matters more to me than the base ingredient? Or I’ve found a chef with similar taste profile to me?<p>I am now old enough to give up more quickly on things others love but I don’t. I have also learnt that some things&#x2F;experiences are not worth trying even once, regardless that others recommend them.')
