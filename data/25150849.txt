Thunderbolt with two 40Gb&#x2F;sec links isn&#x27;t tiny either.<p>64GB will come for future laptops. And Apple can scale with a single package beyond 64GB too, very high performance solutions included. See the A100 80GB from NVIDIA with 2TB&#x2F;sec of memory bandwidth, with RAM as part of the package, just not in the same die.')
