Been around forever. I think you just hit F7 to activate<p>I prefer to set Firefox to start searching when I type, and to restrict searching in that way to links only. This means that I can just start typing some text from a link and hit enter to navigate there. No weird letter combos like vimium or vimperator, so easier in that regard, but also does not work for every click target, so crappier in that regard.<p>I do a heck of a lot more navigating than text selection, though.')
