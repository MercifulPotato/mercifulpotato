You are comparing how many events to 1 event?<p>And let&#x27;s not forget the reason BLM were protesting and the aggressive response from police, versus whatever the fuck that was yesterday.<p>From your link:<p>&gt; Nine of the people killed during protests were demonstrators taking part in Black Lives Matter protests.<p>So your number is actually 9.  Not 25.<p>Also, how many police were killed by BLM?  My count is zero.\nFunny to see you rush to defend the liars and the conspiracy theorists.<p>From your link:<p>&gt; ACLED found that the overwhelming majority of the more than 9.000 Black Lives Matter demonstrations that took place across the US after the killing of George Floyd have been peaceful.<p>Over 9000 protests compared to 1.  Interesting!  Are you sure you are making the case you think you are making?')
