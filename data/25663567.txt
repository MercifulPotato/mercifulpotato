It&#x27;s certainly possible to use longer trace lengths, but that may come with tradeoffs.<p>&gt;The only thing you can say against them is they might consume more power driving that trace<p>Power consumption is really important in a laptop, and Apple clearly care deeply about minimising it.<p>For all we know for sure, moving the memory closer to the CPU may have been part of what&#x27;s enabled Apple to run higher frequency memory with acceptable (to them) power draw.')
