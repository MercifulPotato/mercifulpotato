While I would consider it all &quot;time well spent,&quot; after a few months I found myself watching a 20-40 minute talk to jot down just one or two small thoughts or quotes that rang out.  I not only researched a lot, but immediately applied what I was learning to our company and our situation, and have had strong results so far.  I took some time away from coding, designing, and writing for the startup to write a short handbook (~40 pages) for aspiring entrepreneurs and people designing consumer software products.  I believe that the insights, overall path, and advice in this book encapsulate well the general motion required in going from market-lack to product-market-fit.  The paperback is $6.99 on Amazon and would be most useful to first time entrepreneurs and product creators, as well as seasoned individuals who want a more methodical approach about starting and succeeding with a product-oriented startup.  Below are the first 5 sections of the book, there are 19 sections total.  Such a resource would have saved me significant time in the beginning, so I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s done and alive in the world.<p>You can read the first 5 sections here for free: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satisologie.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;rocketshipping-book-excerpts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satisologie.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;rocketshipping-book-excer...</a>')
