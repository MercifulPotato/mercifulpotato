Nintendo wasn&#x27;t going to go anywhere, and PS2 had a huge impact even prior to its release (including a DVD player was a big decision), sucking the oxygen out of the market in the year between Dreamcast&#x27;s launch and PS2&#x27;s. That left Sega, who was struggling financially.<p>Nobody has mentioned piracy, but it&#x27;s worth noting that Dreamcast&#x27;s proprietary GD-ROM format was cracked pretty quickly, allowing games to be pirated with a regular CD-R. This article [2] and HN discussion [3] goes into detail about the technical implementation of the format and how piracy came about. That didn&#x27;t help Sega&#x27;s financial position.<p>For a bit of personal history, in mid-2000 I worked with Sony America on a PS2 title for the upcoming PS2 release while I was a game designer at Pandemic Studios.

Microsoft had the deep pockets that Sega lacked, and their willingness to spend also caused losses at Sony as they locked horns in subsequent generations.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fabiensanglard.net&#x2F;dreamcast_hacking&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fabiensanglard.net&#x2F;dreamcast_hacking&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18654199" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18654199</a>')
