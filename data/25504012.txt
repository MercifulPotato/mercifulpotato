It seems like the best proof of concept for change in the modern American political quagmire.<p>How do you get marijuana legalized? You sure as hell aren’t going to find the political spine in the house&#x2F;senate&#x2F;executive to pull it off at the federal level.<p>The state level also seems to have a scaled down version of the federal quagmire if you rely on the state legislatures to dictate the initiative.<p>But that ballot referendum just seems to work. People vote, it passes, a state gets what it wants. Then, other states follow suit, and voila, you just scaled something as once-obtuse as marijuana legalization from one state to fifty, effectively replicating federal law.<p>Now rinse and repeat and get other things passed. It seems like the ultimate short circuit for this circus.')
