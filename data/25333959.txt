At least you don&#x27;t have to construct fancy weird machines (with type confusion, heap spraying and all those shenanigans). It comes down to finding something that can perform code execution in their internal API (here: &quot;electronSafeIpc&quot;) and then finding a way to get there (here: angular escape bypass&#x2F;not-properly-sanitized user provided data) and you can do both in javascript and don&#x27;t have to read tons of machine code.<p>Given that Teams is a great target because of it&#x27;s large and often corporate user base, I&#x27;d be surprised if none of the usual industrial espionage suspects (e.g. China, NSA, etc) had a look at Teams before. And I&#x27;d think the chance of them having found the same bug, or a related bug, once they looked is pretty good too.<p>From what I am hearing even the (US) military uses Teams sometimes... If that isn&#x27;t incentive to look at this thing for &quot;interested parties&quot;, then I don&#x27;t know.')
