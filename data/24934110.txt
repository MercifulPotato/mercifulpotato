Drawing that line would be deliberate misinformation purely for election destabilization.<p>The emails mention his father, a meeting, etc. There&#x27;s obviously some connection, but claiming that the emails are referencing a meeting with Joe is not &quot;deliberate misinformation.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but it&#x27;s just pretty clear that your threshold for what constitutes a &quot;debunking&quot; is much lower than mine.<p>It&#x27;s a stupid reason to not vote for Biden anyways, but I think it is better to be honest.')
