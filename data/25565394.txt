VoIP is very widespread, e.g. in Germany basically all new landline contracts are VoIP.<p>Also the backhaul of mobile networks is usually VoIP (references to this on Wikipedia date back to 2011 [1]), i.e. even calls starting and ending over the old analog network are converted to VoIP in between.<p>So what&#x27;s stopping us is not technology, but exactly these local carriers with their national phone numbers and often also national law around selling these services (e.g. in Japan you need to identify yourself as a resident to buy a phone number). Why do we still need carriers? Because they are operating the local physical infrastructure necessary to connect your phone to the network.<p>So the problem to solve is to cooperate on an international level to use the physical infrastructure of a country&#x2F;carrier free of charge while you are paying a different carrier in another country. We just recently (~2 years back?) &quot;solved&quot; this in Europe (&quot;solved&quot; because it only works within time limits generous enough for long term travel but not for permanent relocation). It will eventually happen on a global scale.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20110809025050&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eetimes.com&#x2F;electronics-news&#x2F;4052152&#x2F;WIRELESS-Carriers-look-to-IP-for-back-haul" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20110809025050&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eetime...</a>')
