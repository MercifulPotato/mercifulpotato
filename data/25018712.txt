I was very lucky in where I ended up, and while my pay dropped a lot from an industry engineering job, I was still able to live comfortably by my standards for the duration of my degree. I&#x27;m now a postdoc, which still pays poorly relative to alternate options, but that&#x27;s not why I do what I do. It&#x27;s a privileged position to be in, and likely does constrain my thinking about starting a family, etc. but works well enough for me. Postdocs should be paid more across the board, however.')
