It&#x27;d make sense to do that once and then never talk about it again and refuse questions, but the fact that there&#x27;s not a single denial is telling. It&#x27;s definitely not proof, but it&#x27;s a sign.<p>Also, at least one email thread was corroborated by someone else on the thread as being real. That doesn&#x27;t prove the rest of the emails are real, but it increases the likelihood.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t even think there&#x27;s anything damaging in there. But the absolute kneejerk insistence that they&#x27;re fabricated, and that even trying to be impartial about it is giving into propaganda, by so many people, is pretty bizarre to me. There&#x27;s a reasonable, rational, balanced middle ground here that very few people (besides some actual journalists like Matt Taibbi, Ross Douthat, and perhaps Glenn Greenwald - pending exactly what he says in this forthcoming article) seem to be taking.')
