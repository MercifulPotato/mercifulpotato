Compared to Cali:<p>Beef was cheaper. Chicken and pork were same as Cali. Produce was a lot more expensive; regular produce cost the same as <i>organic</i> produce in Cali, and the quality dropped off a cliff in the winter.<p>Gasoline was cheaper, but the only utility that was cheaper was water. Internet was more expensive. Electricity and (natural) gas was significantly more expensive, because A&#x2F;C was a must in the summer and heating was a must in the winter.<p>Car maintenance was much more expensive, since the salt they use to melt the snow is corrosive. House maintenance was more expensive, because the humidity year-round meant increased mold growth.<p>In order to get cheaper than LA&#x2F;SF, you had to move to a small town...but you can do the same thing in Cali too; such as by moving to San Bernardino or Sacramento, and you end up with a much higher quality of life than a small town in the Midwest.')
