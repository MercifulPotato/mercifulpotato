Why isn&#x27;t the same standard applied to rich companies?<p>Because the tax code is relatively simple for W2 employees. Not so much for corporations.<p>&gt; &quot;You&#x27;re technically owned by an Irish company you invented to avoid taxes? Cool. The c-suite plus your accountants are going to prison for the next five years and we&#x27;re seizing the X billion you actually owe plus a punitive fine.&quot;<p>It gets doubly complicated once you cross borders, because transferring assets like that might be legal under some treaty between country A and B.<p>Truth is, if society doesn&#x27;t want these practices to be legal it has to write a tax code that doesn&#x27;t make them legal.')
