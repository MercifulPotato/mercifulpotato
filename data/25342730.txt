One is illegal and the other, selling to a company like Zerodium, isn&#x27;t.  The ethical objection I have is that you lose control over how that exploit is used if you sell it to someone like Zerodium and I think it&#x27;s better for users and the general public if bugs are disclosed directly to software makers.<p>However, the idea that security researchers are guilted into &quot;being ethical&quot; while the (rich) executives for massive, multi-billion dollar tech companies are saving money on security, plus skimping on paying security researchers fair value when bugs are discovered, frustrates me.<p>It&#x27;s hypocritical for big tech to expect &quot;ethical&quot; behavior from security researchers when it&#x27;s a lot closer to &quot;let us take advantage of you&quot; IMO.  If it becomes a debate about ethics, I think every time an exploit is sold to a company like Zerodium it&#x27;s primarily the fault of the tech companies that are exploiting security researchers.')
