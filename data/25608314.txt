Worked for 5 companies, 2 were ruled by fear culture (including an explicit stack ranking of employees every 2 quarters, with the bottom ones being fired), one by desperation, one by... inertia maybe. The 5th is Google. Still can&#x27;t figure out what it&#x27;s ruled by exactly, but absolutely no fear, yet it mostly works. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m sticking around, I guess.\nI&#x27;ve moved teams and orgs quite a bit, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just me being lucky with a manager. If there is fear, it&#x27;s in quite isolated pockets.')
