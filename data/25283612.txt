I don&#x27;t think &quot;HN hates humor&quot; is true. But I think it <i>is</i> true that humor is only appreciated here on a very limited basis, and if it&#x27;s done in a specific way. Most really obvious puns, gags, meme references, etc. <i>are</i> devoid of value and don&#x27;t go over well here. But sometimes one does find a way to say something that&#x27;s meaningful and funny at the same time, and I&#x27;ve seen those posts get upvoted.')
