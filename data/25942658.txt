I&#x27;ve been using it to give me 3 rows of tabs since Firefox broke Tabmix Plus.  It&#x27;s not as slick as an addon, but it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem for anyone who lurks here. Clone a repo into your firefox profile directory and copy and paste a few lines of config to enable that feature.  This is the sole feature that has kept me on the Firefox side of things.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MrOtherGuy&#x2F;firefox-csshacks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MrOtherGuy&#x2F;firefox-csshacks</a>')
