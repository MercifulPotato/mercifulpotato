Without static typing, they don&#x27;t seem really useful: Erlang doesn&#x27;t have sum types, and it doesn&#x27;t really have a use for them until it gets a type system which can leverage them. Instead it models &quot;sum types&quot; as tagged tuples e.g.<p><pre><code>    {ok, Ok} | {err, Err}\n</code></pre>\n<i>however</i> Erlang has very good pattern matching. Pythonâ€¦ doesn&#x27;t.<p>There&#x27;s a PEP but I stopped following it because the discussion was a mess. And it&#x27;s apparently now split into 3 different PEP, I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s an improvement or not though.<p>Furthermore Python&#x27;s dislike of HOFs means you can&#x27;t really do &quot;monadic&quot; processing as you&#x27;d do in, say, smalltalk where your &quot;variants&quot; would really be subtypes with cool higher-order messages. So you&#x27;re mostly just adding indirections.')
