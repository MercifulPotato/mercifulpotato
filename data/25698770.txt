The right of association is what gives twitter the ethical foundation to ban or refuse to publish the words of anyone they choose<p>Which I 100% support,  however the fly in the ointment is the fact that congress has given special legal liability protections to Twitter where by they will not be held liable if they choose to associate with the public at large as a platform.  IMO granting these liabilities shields to twitter, twitter should also have to accept they will welcome all legal protected speech.  They would also be free to choose to reject that liability shield and retain their right of association.')
