If corporations are &quot;people&quot;, we should be able to &quot;unpeople&quot; (terminate) them.<p>I&#x27;ve long hoped that progressives and libertarians could find common ground over the need to reign in corporations.<p>I&#x27;ve always found it weird that &quot;freedom from oppression&quot; minded people prefer Big Corp over Big Govt. As you point out, corporations are just more government, but without all that troublesome accountability, transparency, and democratic oversight.')
