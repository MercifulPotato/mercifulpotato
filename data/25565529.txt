You&#x27;re talking about the right to own property in a sort of static sense, while the parent is talking about the right not only to own property, but build and develop on it as the owner sees fit.<p>SF homeowners of course believe in the kind of property rights you&#x27;re talking about, but mostly do not believe in the latter.  Most homeowners here want (and unfortunately mostly have) absolute veto right over any kind of construction or development that their neighbors want to engage in, whether it&#x27;s as simple as reasonable cosmetic changes by a resident homeowner, or as complex as a denser rebuild by a housing developer.<p>(But I mostly agree with you in your characterization of the two types of SF homeowners.  There also are some who are nominally in your second category but wouldn&#x27;t be catastrophically financially impacted if their mortgages went under water, but they&#x27;re definitely in the minority.)')
