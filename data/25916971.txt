I would consider that very close to fundamental functionality; I know that lacking it would make me stumble from time to time, and I’ve seen various other Vim users and plugins depend on it not irregularly also.<p>I’m not confident I know just what’s meant by “gvim did not support this until 1-2 years ago”. Opening the command in a <i>Vim terminal</i>, sure, that’s recent functionality (as is the whole concept of a Vim terminal), and opt-in at that, but on MS-Windows at least, from time immemorial :! opened the command in a separate console window, meaning it always worked. Not sure what it does on other platforms, as I’ve long used terminal Vim exclusively.<p>Also it sounds like they haven’t actually <i>fixed</i> this, just implemented the equivalent of Vim’s guioptions+=!, which… well, that’s definitely not how I want it to work.')
