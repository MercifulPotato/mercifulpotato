The situation around WebRender is pretty unfortunate, as AFAIK it is blocked by the compatibility issue in macOS. I have played it in Windows Firefox just fine though.<p>Anyway, I think it&#x27;s more about the wording: it&#x27;s very fine that the developer hasn&#x27;t tested much in other browsers (not every developer has resources to do so, sure), but saying a certain browser is required or recommended implies that the issue is something to do with that browser (which might or might not be the case). Shapez.io also doesn&#x27;t support macOS in its standalone build, but the statement on that was more amicable and honest; I wish the developer did the same for non-Chrome browsers as well.<p>&gt; In all honesty I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s different from only releasing a game on Xbox and not PlayStation.<p>Consoles generally have much different requirements (hardware, vendor integration etc.) than PC games. For me it&#x27;s more like Steam vs. Epic Store which I found pretty frustrating as a gamer.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24678720" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24678720</a>')
