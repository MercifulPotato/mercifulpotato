I tried setting Bing as my default search engine for a month earlier this year and half the time I had to go back to Google.<p>Here&#x27;s an example from my browser history: &quot;wacom tablet not detecting levels&quot; (in retrospect, I actually meant to search for pen pressure instead of levels). On Bing, I get results about device not found whereas on Google I get results about pen pressure not working as top result (by automatically excluding the &quot;levels&quot; term).<p>Best of luck to anyone trying to compete in the search engine space. It seems even Microsoft with their seemingly infinite cash can&#x27;t put a dent against Google.')
