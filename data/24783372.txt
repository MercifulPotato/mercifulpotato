Those are different enough to some language course, such as Rosetta Stone, offer them as separate courses.<p>There are also two French sections. I assume one is France French. Has French spoken in any major place outside French changed enough to justify its own section, like the Spain&#x2F;Latin America thing? Maybe Quebec?')
