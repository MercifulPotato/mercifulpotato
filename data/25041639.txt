Item(by='Pils', descendants=None, kids=[25041789], score=None, time=1604968111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25041385, text='&gt; people still make a mess and a version that is absolutely fact based is still not there, then there is little hope for the things we don&#x27;t hear about<p>This is sometimes called an &quot;isolated demand for rigour&quot;[0]. There is worldwide governmental consensus that Khashoggi was murdered. The Saudi Arabian government admits to it using purposely euphemistic language. They even had a (closed) trial and sentenced five people to death in relation to this &quot;horrible incident.&quot;<p>But then, you respond, have you actually seen video footage of the murder taking place? Well, then it&#x27;s settled. We <i>truly</i> cannot know if Khashoggi was &quot;murdered,&quot; and since no body was recovered, for all we know he&#x27;s vacationing in the Seychelles, or deep in a Turkish prison. How is this different than the &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; that got us into the Iraq War?<p>&gt; You may be mistaken thinking I&#x27;m defending a government and you seem to think you&#x27;re producing evidence.<p>This passive-aggressive nonsense is ridiculous. You seem to clinging to some fiction that SA has not literally and materially admitted to wrongdoing. You operate in a worldview where everything that doesn&#x27;t meet your arbitrary standard of truth is not &quot;evidence-based,&quot; and therefore wrong. What you present as some sort of epistemic skepticism is just garden variety solipsism.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;14&#x2F;beware-isolated-demands-for-rigor&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;14&#x2F;beware-isolated-demand...</a>')
