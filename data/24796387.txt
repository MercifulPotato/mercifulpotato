It’s just name-calling. I suppose I somehow agree that name calling is a common critique of pretty much anything.<p>More importantly, it also shuts down conversations. Behaving like you’re the only non-idiot in the room makes you an unpleasant interlocutor. Consider the possibility that the people you interact with and think are midwits are actually intelligent but are optimizing for “have as short an interaction with this unpleasant egomaniac as possible without being unpleasant myself”. Particularly irl.<p>I’m still interacting with you because I hope you realize that your dismissal of basically every accomplished person in society as a midwit might have more to do with your insecurities than the broad structure of society, and that your obsession with this insecurity is eroding your long-term relationships. I have old close friends who talk and think like you are in this thread, and their attitude toward others has turned them into lonely old men. It’s sad.')
