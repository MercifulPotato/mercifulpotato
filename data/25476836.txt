I know I can have a discussion with anyone if I feel like it or if people come to me. I just answer &quot;the world is my friend&quot;. My father is also like this.<p>I&#x27;m leaning on the introvert side but as an adult I&#x27;ve quickly adapted.<p>A therapist also told me friendships are a lot of work to maintain, and often a cause of pain. If romantic relationships are already a source of pain, I cannot let friendships do the same to me.')
