On my Ryzen board they are reported via SMI events and there is a chip that you can talk to on the SMBUS that will tell you how many events it has seen since the log was reset.<p>In my experience getting the information isn&#x27;t &quot;difficult&quot; so much as it isn&#x27;t &quot;common&quot;. On my FreeNAS device (which has the Xeon) it also has an IPMI controller which lets me ask it over the network how many ecc errors have been seen. (and it can act like a remote console as well but we&#x27;ll leave that for another time :-))<p>So find out how the motherboard is tracking ECC, then find the tool that talks to that system to ask it for the logs of ECC errors.')
