It&#x27;s just one is marginally better at not introducing damaging regulations than the other.<p>Japan too had 100mb&#x2F;s since nineties for example, and theeeen..... they stuck. Speeds there not been rising by much since because regulations froze in nineties, and so did the market.<p>Countries which had near zero telecommunication regulations covering the Internet, or had no Internet as such did advance more uniformly.<p>I can have a 500mb&#x2F;s over GPON, or even a symmetric gigabit over 1000BASE-LX even in *stan countries, and Africa these days. Fiberlink has 1Gbs for $30 a month in Lahore. PCTL is starting a 10Gb&#x2F;s GPON trial in Islamabad.<p>Single mode fibre based tech is much cheaper to deploy, and maintain than any legacy tech, and properly designed GPON net probably being the cheapest option ever.')
