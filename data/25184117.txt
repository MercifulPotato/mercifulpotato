The proposition that the Earth is a sphere makes plenty of specific predictions which were confirmed observationally as long ago as ancient Greece.<p><i>&gt; If 90% of people believe in God but 60% reject climate change, does that make climate change less real?</i><p>What percentage of people believe a proposition is irrelevant from the standpoint of science. The relevant criterion in science is whether a proposition can be tested against observation and experiment, whether, if so, it <i>has</i> been tested, and how the tests came out.<p>The reason &quot;belief in God&quot; is generally not considered a scientific proposition is that there is no way to test it against observation and experiment, because it makes no particular predictions about what we should observe or what the results of particular experiments should be. Whereas various beliefs about climate change <i>do</i> make such predictions and can be tested.<p><i>&gt; what makes God so easy to believe in?</i><p>The fact that &quot;belief in God&quot; does not commit you to <i>any</i> specific predictions about what you should observe, so it&#x27;s easy to adopt such a belief without having to disturb any of your other beliefs. Many scientists, for example, profess to believe in God, and don&#x27;t seem to see any contradiction with what they do as scientists.<p><i>&gt; in the classical definition science is a branch of art as art is the more general term</i><p>There is a sense of &quot;art&quot; in which science is one of the arts, yes. But that&#x27;s not the sense in which I was using the term &quot;art&quot;.')
