ARM dominates phones, and is popping up in server environments as well, where it is cheaper to run for many workloads than X86-64.  We have migrated to ARM based Gravitron processors to deliver our services at my company, and we have been able to reduce our AWS EC2 costs by 40% or so, with almost the same performance.  The M1 based Macs certainly show the potential on the desktop.  Other vendors will produce better, more competitive desktop power level chips, too, that are completely adequate for desktop computing experiences.<p>We are seeing the classic Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma pattern whereby the lesser technology slowly overtakes the more brittle incumbent tech. x86 did the same with minicomputers, and then mainframe type workloads.')
