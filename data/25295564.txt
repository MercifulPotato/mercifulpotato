I agree that Timnit will ultimately be fine, despite what she is going through right now. I also agree that Google should ultimately do whatever it wants in accordance with its determined corporate policies.<p>However, you really should read <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abc.xyz&#x2F;investor&#x2F;founders-letters&#x2F;2004-ipo-letter&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abc.xyz&#x2F;investor&#x2F;founders-letters&#x2F;2004-ipo-letter&#x2F;</a><p>Anyone who recalls this letter should be able to muster sympathy for those who have joined Google with an activist mindset. Google is supposed to be different. Google is supposed to be for people who want to make the world better. Sure, maybe it&#x27;s all just so much branding, but this is how Google (and by extension many Googlers) styles itself. This news is more evidence that Google is really bad at living up to that image - as idealistic&#x2F;lofty&#x2F;unrealistic as it may be - where it counts.<p>And any way, Timnit isn&#x27;t toxic. She is upset with the status quo of equity among genders and ethnic groups in her field, and she is fighting to improve it. This is naturally unwelcome - and perhaps comes off as combative - to anyone who is satisfied with the status quo, but I would not call it toxic.')
