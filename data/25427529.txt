The author links to bug #61502 in GCC, where you&#x27;ll see the compiler devs agree with the author of that page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;bugzilla&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=61502#c15" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;bugzilla&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=61502#c15</a><p>No they don&#x27;t. The previous comment from that compiler dev explicitly says that this comparison is <i>not</i> undefined behaviour. There is nothing in either the standard or that bug report that supports the claim that you originally posted (&quot;Comparing pointers for equality is defined if both pointers are derived from the same (multidimensional) array object. Thus, if two pointers point to different array objects, then these array objects must be subaggregates of the same multidimensional array object in order to compare them. Otherwise this leads to undefined behavior.&quot;). Equality comparisons (not relational comparisons) of pointers to (unrelated) arrays are not and never have been undefined behaviour, and anyone claiming they are is at best confused.')
