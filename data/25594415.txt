Within flowing text, it can never break naturally onto the next line, whereas an &lt;a&gt; link can.<p>It also can&#x27;t be a flex or grid container in certain browsers, so you often need an inner element for proper spacing&#x2F;positioning.<p>Note that the inner element would need to be a &lt;span&gt; not a &lt;div&gt; because &lt;button&gt; can only contain phrasing elements.')
