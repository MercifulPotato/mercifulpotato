Some of those codes made it through to the reporting, and were published to the Internet, making it fairly easy for federal law enforcement to track her down.<p>I have also not seen any information saying that the journalists who received the documents, definitively were, or were not aware of the presence of the ID numbers stegoed into the documents.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;the-mysterious-printer-code-that-could-have-led-the-fbi-to-reality-winner&#x2F;529350&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;the-m...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.erratasec.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;how-intercept-outed-reality-winner.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.erratasec.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;how-intercept-outed-reali...</a><p>On a more meta level, it&#x27;s a hard problem to solve with handling and publishing leaked documents, because on one side you have the vast resources of the NSA and the US intelligence community coming up with new steganographic and other methods to embed tracking ID numbers into documents. The full size, scale, budget and weight of various federal agencies&#x27; &quot;counterintelligence&quot; efforts.<p>And on the other side you have investigative journalists who do not have PhD level degrees in math&#x2F;cryptography, and do not have the technical resources to definitely search through a huge pile of documents and say with 100% confidence that any possible tracking IDs have been stripped out.<p>I don&#x27;t think I could reasonably expect a person from a journalism&#x2F;liberal arts degree educational and work experience background to identify steganography.')
