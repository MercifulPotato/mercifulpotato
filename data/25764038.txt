No, I know, they would never shut down your righteous cause and protest because you are the good bois.<p>They&#x27;ll simply not let you board a plane (maybe even put you too on a no fly list?)? Not rent a car to you? Deny you a hotel&#x2F;airbnb, possibly for life? Your apps&#x2F;phones stop working within a geofence around any government building? You can&#x27;t eat in a restaurant? You cannot buy anything by payment processor&#x2F;visa&#x2F;MC? The only left over mega corporations will not take cash?<p>People who have done this, which is overwhelmingly on the &quot;left&quot; side of the spectrum, should really take a pause and think really long and really hard about what they have unleashed here; because no matter what I don&#x27;t see how this demon will be put back into pandora&#x27;s box without full collapse. Once you have relinquished control over your life to the government&#x2F;corporate fascist type alliance, you can ask nicely all you want, you aren&#x27;t getting that power over your life back from these types of people by any peaceful means. History is replete with the proof after proof for how this will all play out unfortunately.')
