Item(by='paxys', descendants=None, kids=[25260997], score=None, time=1606773706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25255589, text='Funny that there&#x27;s not a single mention in the article about natives and long-time locals who have constantly voted against new construction or any progressive housing measure, which is the root cause of the crisis to begin with. No mention also of all the corruption&#x2F;bribery scandals which city hall is currently involved in. Nor large landlords who can choose to rent out their apartment to whoever they want at whatever price they want. Nope, it&#x27;s always young techies that are the problem since they are the easiest target.<p>I think these advocates will find that even after all these tech companies have taken flight the city&#x27;s problems will still remain, perhaps worse than before due to the loss of the massive tax base.')
