Having null as the default would allow you to see in the database where authentication emails hadn&#x27;t been sent out, so you could resend them.<p>And then I guess you could imagine a developer checking authentication by looking for cases where `!authenticated`, rather than `authenticated == True`. Granted I don&#x27;t think this hack is real, but if it were then that&#x27;s probably how it would play out.')
