It seems like the gripe should not be with Apple changing processors (or OS’s or hardware features or ...), but rather that (especially commercial) software is so fragile to medium-term environmental change. Binaries are just not very resilient artifacts, especially when they so closely depend on their surroundings. High-level programming language code, on the other hand, is much more resilient.<p>It’s also a reason I use Lisp: the spec doesn’t change and won’t change. Stuff runs forever.')
