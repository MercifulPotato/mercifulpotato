You&#x27;re more likely to use a cutlery if you can afford it, and for most why buy it when I have hands and bread.<p>Cutlery is clearly the superior way to eat many types of food. But cutlery, reusable or not, costs money.<p>When I travelled in eastern Europe it was common to have only spoons (for soups) and rice dishes. Meat was always eaten by hand.<p>Soups served with entire boiled chicken legs were common (although usually the meat was often a luxury and only bought&#x2F;killed that day to respect my visit to their home).<p>The legs were expected to be eaten by hand and cleaned to the bone (cartilage and all). Chicken stomachs were my most hated and most commonly eaten...<p>In the poorest places home made bread was used in lieu of cutlery so much so that I began to make gifts of cutlery to the poorest homes I was invited to all of  which they use to this day (of course the new children miss out and must eat in the old we way).<p>Sorry for the disjointed nature of this post I find it hard to write on a phone.')
