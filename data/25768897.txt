I believe the vast majority of people can barely handle the stress of daily life, let alone juggle a drug use hobby.<p>I know there are people out there who are exceptional, one of the perils of the internet is that you get a glimpse into their lives through social media.<p>But we can&#x27;t all compare ourselves to these exceptional people.<p>Take a relatively harmless drug like cannabis as an example. I personally know people who are very active on cannabis and can still steer their life towards their long term goals.<p>But most people are not. Most people use cannabis as a way to make a boring day fun and in the long run those boring days amass to nothing gained.<p>So people like Carl are probably right but they should speak for themselves, not for the masses.')
