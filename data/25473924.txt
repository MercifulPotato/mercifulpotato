Item(by='andrepd', descendants=None, kids=[25475621], score=None, time=1608339068, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25470486, text='I don&#x27;t mean to be overly negative but browsing through some titles the &quot;emotional story arc&quot; is indistinguishable from a randomly generated line graph. Clicking on the bars reveals the way this was obtained... &quot;bad, death, dark, danger&quot; = less score, &quot;good, great, love&quot; = good. Of course such a trivial and simplistic analysis cannot ever produce any meaningful result.<p>The &quot;most passive page&quot; thing also does not seem to be working. Passive as in passive voice? If yes it&#x27;s also pretty off the mark.')
