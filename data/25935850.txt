Most gas stations break even on the gas an make money on the attached convenience store.  That&#x27;s a different business model than &quot;charge at home&quot; or &quot;charge at streetlight&quot; while you&#x27;re sleeping.<p>2. A gas station is a place you &quot;go&quot; to.  You&#x27;re normally taking a detour or at least making an extra stop.  Most day-to-day EV charging is done at your normal destination while you&#x27;re doing things you&#x27;d otherwise be doing.<p>Those are fairly fundamental differences to the gas station model, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.')
