Less than 30 in a crowd of a couple hundred thousand got charged with anything more serious than some variant of unlawful entry (and only about 100 people are wanted at all).<p>If such charges could be reasonably made, don&#x27;t you think they would make them? The prosecutor isn&#x27;t an idiot. He&#x2F;She knows that no reasonable jury will convict on those charges. It would even be a great political win if they could get them to stick, but it&#x27;s so far out of reach that they won&#x27;t take on the loss and resulting publicity.<p>It&#x27;s far easier for the media to make claims than to substantiate them. I&#x27;d guess that there&#x27;s a serious risk of several big media companies being sued.')
