Monopolies - See Peter Theil - this is the whole point of any business and not a problem. If you look at a wide enough time scale, startups always have a chance to disrupt - you just need a paradigm shift. Look at what the internet did to Wintel. Monopolies have persisted for MUCH longer periods in industries where paradigm shifts are rare. Look at the cable, wireless or utility industries.<p>3. Diversity - This is only a problem for liberals - not SV. Since most of SV are liberal this is a problem only by association.<p>4. Outsiders - Heard of the SV term &quot;domain expert&quot;? SV believes in their value but the ones how are going to push for the change are the rebels. This is not really a problem.<p>5. Gig economy - Exploiting low paid workers to gain market capitalization is totally a feature of the United States as a whole. SV just figured out how to do it more efficiently. You can&#x27;t do this in a country like Australia where the minimum wage is $20.')
