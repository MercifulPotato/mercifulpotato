But when say, it was a month away from FIFA&#x27;s ship date and they couldn&#x27;t get the game to run faster than 5 FPS, they would call him in. He would work some magic, the game would ship on time and with adequate perf, and he&#x27;d return to goofing off. Well worth EA&#x27;s money to keep him on salary.')
