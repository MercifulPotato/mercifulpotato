Seems we should just be measuring people&#x27;s revenu adjusted to their current geography.<p>Though I would argue against the adjustment for geography. It holds true when we&#x27;re talking about day to day expense, like rent, but generally doesn&#x27;t when we&#x27;re talking about life expenses like healthcare. At least we need to be careful how we adjust for geography. If we consider someone is able to pay rent and eat, that seems not good enough, it should also adjust for: and they&#x27;d be able to afford cancer treatment and sending children to university as a minimum.')
