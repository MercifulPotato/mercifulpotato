They then ordered them from Canada and were once again impeded by the federal government[1]. So now you are in a situation where your the hospital supply chain is now gone, and you are forced to buy masks for medical workers in the marketplace, and you are now facing the real possibility that the general public may buy up all the masks before they can contain and eliminate the virus.<p>The CDC may have been acting in it&#x27;s own best interest in the face of a federal branch who refused to believe that the virus was a big issue. If the CDC truly believed they had time to contain and eliminate the virus, I can see how telling people to not stock up on masks may have been a good idea at the time.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;canada&#x2F;article-fbi-redirects-medical-supplies-to-new-york-health-care-staff-after&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;canada&#x2F;article-fbi-redirects...</a>')
