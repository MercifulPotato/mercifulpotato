I think you could get a 2BR in Sac for the price of a studio in SF.<p>We might also see some exodus from the Bay Area, which would put a downward pressure on tech salaries till they hit some equilibrium.<p>I also wonder what enforcement mechanisms exist short of an IRS audit to make sure you&#x27;re actually &quot;local&quot; and not in a cheap cabin in North Dakota. Employers could monitor corp traffic, but I wonder if it&#x27;s actually worth the cost to enforce and they&#x27;ll just go by honor code.')
