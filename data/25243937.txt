They provided the capital, he did all the work and Winchell got a cut of his profits.<p>He then saved aggressively and started buying more donut shops.<p>Notice that Winchell had similar arrangement with many other people and presumably they didn&#x27;t become millionaires.<p>As to luck: he trained 100+ other immigrants to successfully operate a donut shop so if an immigrant that most likely doesn&#x27;t even speak English can profitably operate a donut shop, maybe luck is not such a big factor.<p>As for why he became a millionaire and not others - I don&#x27;t see any luck there either. He followed the same formula a hundred times: open one more donut shop. He was just more ambitious, worked harder, saved more aggressively and took a bit more risk.')
