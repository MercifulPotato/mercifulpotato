Why should the idea that there&#x27;s more mass that&#x27;s weakly-interacting than we&#x27;re used to be a point against it? Should we have any expectations about the amount of mass that&#x27;s interactable with us in regular ways we&#x27;ve evolved to deal with?<p>If we evolved in dark caves to be blind creatures with sensitive hearing and no concept of light, then when we first considered the possibility of outer space, would we be right to write it off just because it supposes that most matter couldn&#x27;t possibly be heard by us?<p>If we imagined that all particles we know about may be made up of some smaller building block particles connected together, or concentrations of some kind of stuff, wouldn&#x27;t it actually be more surprising if all of that building-block stuff had ended up becoming concentrated into normal particles? This might not be literally how it works, but it&#x27;s interesting that it seems easy to imagine plenty of possible ways the world could be where it turns out that most building-block stuff is never pushed to combine into normal mass, and instead most of it stays in an uncombined form that&#x27;s only weakly-interacting.')
