Item(by='wvenable', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612037297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25968125, text='US law has defined a few protected classes (race, color, religion, sex, age, and disability).  Is that a perfect list?  Probably not.  Is it a reasonable legal and moral framework, I think so.  Based on that protected class list, you can probably work out my answers to your questions easily.  So it&#x27;s not that arbitrary.<p>I could reverse this and ask your the same type of questions.  As a business owner, am I not allowed to have <i>any</i> control over who and what business that I do?  If I allow posts on my website, I must allow Nazi hate posts?  If I allow images, I must allow all images except those that are illegal?  If you&#x27;re being rude to my workers, I can&#x27;t turn you away, I just have to take it?  If you say yes, I&#x27;d like how that is fair to me.  If you say no, then that is also arbitrary, right?')
