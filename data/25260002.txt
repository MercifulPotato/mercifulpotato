ARM, which through a series of coincidences, ended up being the right architecture at the right time for mobile devices, has had its own injection of talent and money, and has advanced rapidly in the last 15 years.  The M1 is a long way from the ARM710 or StrongARM of the late 90&#x27;s!<p>Similarly, computer circuitry has evolved.  Early minicomputers used small circuit boards with just a few gates to assemble their CPUs.  In the early 80&#x27;s, bigger CPUs were built from multiple &quot;bit slice&quot; chips ganged together.  The modern PC motherboard has been a thing since the era of the Apple ][, growing through 8, 16, 32 and now 64 CPUs with ever-increasing speed and power, but maintaining a model of a motherboard and expansion cards.  SoCs have been a thing for embedded devices for some time now: the M1 is perhaps the first really high-profile &quot;computer&quot; to use this technique to integrate its major architectural components in one &quot;chip&quot; (package).  I think it&#x27;s inevitable that others will follow, given the obvious performance and power gains to be had.<p>AMD and Intel do this to some extend already.  The AMD chips powering the new Platstation and Xbox consoles are SoCs, and Intel has sold embedded variants of its CPUs that are basically SoCs for some years now too.<p>x86 has a long future ahead of it, but for the first time since Alpha (?) it&#x27;s seeing a major competitor.  Unlike DEC though, ARM has a broad and deep ecosystem behind it, and (as the article points out) there are some advantages to the instruction set that x86-64 will perhaps struggle to overcome.<p>2. Microsoft already has the Surface.  They&#x27;ve known for some time that Apple&#x27;s integration of hardware and software is hard to beat, and that the iPhone represented a technology that could be applied to laptops and desktops any time Apple wanted to do so.  So ... they&#x27;ve already made steps in the direction of competing, but they have a lot of business-model challenges to overcome in order to do so.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d be much more interested in the futures of Dell, HP(E), Lenovo, etc, than Microsoft.  This is a massive challenge for them.<p>3. No. The cloud vendors are already moving towards ARM for power reasons.  The AWS Nitro board is begging to be integrated with a Gravitron -- I would be surprised if Amazon doesn&#x27;t come up with a compute platform that&#x27;s powered by a similarly integrated SoC in the very near future.<p>The M1 helps accelerate this process because all Open Source software will now have to treat AARCH64 as a first-class citizen (which, to be fair, the Raspberry Pi has already helped to do).  Similarly, commercial software vendors now have another market that will need a native ARM version in 2 years (after Rosetta2 is phased out, like Rosetta was for PPC).  So .. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s changed the cloud direction at all, but it could make the transition faster.')
