You need to run the DAW as x86 under Rosetta, which  will result in reduced performance versus a native binary, assuming the native processor was capable of equal performance.<p>Given how zippy the M1 is, that performance penalty may well still put you ahead of where your x86 perf was, but still slower than native.')
