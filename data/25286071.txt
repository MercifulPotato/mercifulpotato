Is it documented in multiple solid studies somewhere? I&#x27;m wondering about whether it might be a potential side effect of a very limited scope (i.e., affecting only <i>a small subset of people</i>).<p>I have never tried modafinil (or any other nootropics) - will read more about it. However, based on my very brief review, it appears to be much less safe than Nootropil along with a questionable effectiveness as a &quot;cognitive enhancer&quot;. Plus, unlike Nootropil, it is considered a controlled substance in the United States.')
