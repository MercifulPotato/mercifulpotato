Now using Amplitude for user session analytics. I&#x27;m not familiar with it, but it appears that at least it&#x27;s less invasive than Hotjar. I don&#x27;t have the time right now to look into it further.<p>How long does the trial last? For me, these apps are all about working out kinks. The MOMENT I start feeling like it&#x27;s &quot;work&quot; then it gets ejected out of my flow and at some point I&#x27;ll circle back to cancel. Between evaluating the basics, such as privacy and testing with a small part of my flow, I probably need a couple weeks.<p>Can you comment on how you use the analytics?<p>EDIT: I see the trial is 14 days.')
