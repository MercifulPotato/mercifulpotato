Twitter is a private company and should be allowed to decide whoever they want to do business with or don&#x27;t... and should be able to decide what content they want to keep or remove on the computers they pay for and show (or hide) to&#x2F;from anyone they wish, as long as the content is legal.<p>Similarly, Amazon should be allowed to terminate any of their relationships with any of the clients and remove their data and applications from their servers.<p>As can HN can make my comments inaccessible to the masses with whatever pretend &quot;rules&quot; they claim to apply to me... or ban me completely.<p>Users who pay for their computers should be able to run any application and keep any data they want on the hardware they purchase and own or share it with others, as long as they&#x27;re not sharing licenced content or private information or such.<p>So, instead of trying to after Twitter or Facebook or Google, we should go after companies like Apple. Why is Apple allowed to deny users the right to run any application that want on the hardware they purchase? THAT should be illegal.<p>While Twitter can push out people, someone else like Gab can take them in. While Parler shuts down, Gab keeps going.<p>If ICANN went after these companies and terminated their domains or ISPs went after them and took away their internet, we could move to distributed internet today, which will make companies like Twitter irrelevant. The biggest threat to that is being presented by hardware and OS vendors making it practically impossible to run the software infrastructure required for running or consuming such an internet.')
