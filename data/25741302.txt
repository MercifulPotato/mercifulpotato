Even web browsing would time out. I used Tomato to prioritize DNS, my VoIP analog telephone adapter, the first 256KB of any HTTP(S) connection, and some 27000+ ports used by games.<p>My current WAN connection reaches 300 ms without fq_codel enabled. With it enabled there&#x27;s no jump in latency.')
