I know my dentist actively does clinical research. His day job just involves seeing patients, doing root canals (in my case), but weekends are about research, he&#x27;s published a bunch papers. His eyes light up every time I&#x27;m in the chair, and we have an enjoyable discussion about NumPy, R and the statistical techniques he&#x27;s using, and the medical papers he&#x27;s been reading (Well.. naturally with me unable to speak in the dentist&#x27;s chair, he gets to do most of the talking.) I&#x27;m a lay person, so I cannot judge his skill level, but it&#x27;s obvious he loves his job. His hospital obviously supports his work.')
