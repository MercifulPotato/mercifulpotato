This is a fairly narrow view; most cyclists use bikes for commuting, not for sport.  I consider myself an avid cyclist and I find lycra kits extremely ridiculous; for my commute I just use regular work clothes.  I&#x27;m actually a bit ashamed to use a bike when I cross these fat idiots with obnoxious colorful clothes on their carbon bikes, as I don&#x27;t want to be identified with them in any way.')
