And you probably won&#x27;t meet it until you actually get the call and realize you missed something.<p>I prefer to imagine alerts as if they&#x27;re going to your Grandmother. She can turn her computer on and surf the web and make phone calls. But she doesn&#x27;t have tribal knowledge about your product, or very specific technical knowledge. If she can&#x27;t figure out what to do from reading the runbook in the alert, it&#x27;s likely your on-call people can&#x27;t either and will just end up waking up <i>other</i> people, and at that point you&#x27;re just delaying resolving the alert and waking up too many people.')
