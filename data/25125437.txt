Item(by='emn13', descendants=None, kids=[25128560], score=None, time=1605629597, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25124620, text='&gt; I had to disable DoH on all 5 of my machines because it was enabled automatically.<p>Some googling: it&#x27;s on by default in the US now, not yet globally.<p>&gt; pihole supports using Cloudflare as an upstream DoH provider, not acting as a DoH provider.<p>That&#x27;s unfortunate; are you sure it&#x27;s not just a little poorly documentend?  At least the underlying software they link to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.cloudflare.com&#x2F;1.1.1.1&#x2F;dns-over-https&#x2F;cloudflared-proxy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.cloudflare.com&#x2F;1.1.1.1&#x2F;dns-over-https&#x2F;clo...</a> clearly mentions a proxy functionality, but maybe that&#x27;s not on yet?<p>In any case: the point is that just as DNS proxying became easier over time, so will DoH proxying.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with sticking to old tech as you chose to if it&#x27;s not yet convenient for you to switch; especially if pihole supports upstream DoH, since presumably you trust the network between your device and your pihole ;-) - rendering the rest of the DoH benefits moot.<p>I&#x27;m sure time will resolve issues like that, but in the meantime, the vast majority of people that didn&#x27;t customize their DNS and don&#x27;t choose at all, or choose based on privacy or performance get a more private &amp; secure option by default.  I mean, it&#x27;s transition pains are annoying, but it sounds like a good idea in general, so I suppose the transition costs are worth it in the long run, especially since the vast majority of users won&#x27;t even notice. It&#x27;s annoying to be in the camp that gets to bear the burden, for sure.')
