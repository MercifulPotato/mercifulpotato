I&#x27;m currently in the interview process with Coinbase for a fairly senior engineering role. I&#x27;m a white male. I have a strong interest in the company and the general space, and my interactions with the company so far have also been pretty positive. Coinbase is also one of very few Silicon Valley companies that have even offered me an interview (other than large FAANGs that interview anyone), so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m swimming in options in the area. Other companies like Robinhood, Stripe, Discord, etc., just tossed out my resume.<p>This is giving me second thoughts. I don&#x27;t really know what to do. Do I drop out of one of the few interviews I&#x27;ve been able to get at a &quot;hot&quot; SV company? I was excited about this opportunity, but now I worry I&#x27;d just feel embarrassed announcing that I, as a white guy, am going to go join Coinbase right after this comes out. To be clear, I do already have a (very) good job, so I don&#x27;t &quot;have&quot; to have this and can afford to just drop it.<p>I personally feel pretty upset about this whole situation, as I feel like Armstrong is just being completely socially incompetent. The issues discussed in the article are all really basic, straightforward issues of racism that should be easy to deal with as a leader. The &quot;apolitical culture&quot; memo seemed designed to bring the company extra scrutiny for no real reason. Even if you&#x27;re not on board with BLM, if it&#x27;s a cause a lot of your employees believe in, is it really <i>that</i> hard to pay it some basic lip service without being forced to via a walkout? I just don&#x27;t get it.')
