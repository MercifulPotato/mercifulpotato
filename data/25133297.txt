I see the issue, the HTTPS-Only mode of Firefox and the Encrypt-all-sites mode of HTTPS-Everywhere thinks that you do, because closed TCP ports on your server don&#x27;t respond to TCP SYN requests at all, whereas normally servers indicate connection refused by sending a TCP RST packet. So anything trying to access HTTPS on your site will just time out.')
