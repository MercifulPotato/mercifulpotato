Rishis and yogis have verified reincarnation. Though I realize to anyone outside of Hinduism that it is circular reasoning, or not valid.</i><p>By itself that isn&#x27;t circular reasoning, it is an appeal to authority.<p>It is when you are then asked why you trust what rishis and yogis say that things start to bend in on themselves into a circular argument.<p>A Western (specifically, Judeo-Christian) example:<p>&quot;I believe X, because the Bible says so.&quot;<p>&quot;How do you know that what the Bible says is true?&quot;<p>&quot;Because the Bible is the inerrant word of God.&quot;<p>&quot;And how do you know that?&quot;<p>&quot;The Bible says so.&quot;<p>&quot;And how do you know that what the Bible says is true?&quot;<p>... etc.<p>By itself, the first statement is only an appeal to authority, but when you dig into the source of the authority, it (rather quickly) turns into a circular argument.')
