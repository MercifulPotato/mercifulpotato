What&#x27;s worse, some nonprofits share their mailing list with other organizations, so you may also start to get marketing material from other organizations as well.<p>[US-specific]: If you regularly make any non-trivial donations, it&#x27;s worth considering setting up a donor-advised fund[1]. Among other benefits, it allows you to make donations anonymously, or to provide only your name, and no contact information.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Donor-advised_fund" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Donor-advised_fund</a>')
