There were prototypes of embedding React components in Cycle Apps, but more traction was made in embedding Cycle components in React apps, but by this point it rarely seems worth the effort to mix the component types together. (And with hooks eliminating whole sorts of reactivity issues with class components, I don&#x27;t really miss Cycle much in React work. Though I miss Cycle a great deal when working in Angular, yikes.)')
