The only difference is <i>how</i> your monorepo is organized.<p>If you split your codebase into lots of little SCM repositories and manage dependencies by pushing prebuilt artifacts here and there, all you&#x27;ve done is create a new meta-repo system on top of your SCM. And usually, this dynamic meta-repo coordination system is not only implicit, not only undocumented, but also not even understood by any single human being --- yet your project&#x27;s success depends on the operation of this meta-repository built accidentally and unconsciously from coordinated development in tons of little repositories.<p>I&#x27;m strongly in team formal-monorepo. Just make a single big repository that holds everything you depend on. Be honest and direct about the interactions of your components --- explicit, not accidental, as in a microrepo ecosystem.<p>The performance-based arguments against monorepos don&#x27;t apply as strongly as they once did: Mercurial and Git (moreso the former) have seen a lot of work for optimizing big repositories, and both support a sparse checkout model that allows people focused on specific tasks to focus on a small part of the larger repository without splitting the repository apart.')
