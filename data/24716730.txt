You need matter in order to define space, so if there is no matter, space or rather the original space doesn&#x27;t exist anymore.\nYou can contract all the radiation (that doesn&#x27;t have a notion of space due to the lack of matter) into a new point and start something like a big bang.<p>I think of it as redefining the space that makes the universe, rescaling the size of the whole universe. Anyway, that&#x27;s my personal take on this so far.')
