Why we need to go pollute all places and think we own any of those?\nWe should manage to live without wars and food crisis first on this earth, before we go anywhere else.<p>I&#x27;m totally against people greediness. We have here on the earth so many problems what we have to soft out first.<p>Example: we are hysterics of this &quot;pandemic&quot;, while tens of thousands die only in USA for drug overdose, cold, hunriness and so.. Not even mention how many children&#x27;s are missing.. Those should be our priority. Naah, covid, wars and political shitty take the priority. Please people, stay out of space. We as humans.. We ain&#x27;t ready for it.')
