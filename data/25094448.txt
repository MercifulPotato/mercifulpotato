It&#x27;s actually a pretty clever persuasive trick (ask a question designed to lead someone down a specific research path and &quot;self-discover&quot; your true message (a trick thats&#x27;s coincidentally also used by QAnon: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;qanon-video-game-cbbacb1e-969c-4f07-93cd-69e41bc6feeb.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;qanon-video-game-cbbacb1e-969c-4f07-93...</a>).<p>However, the argument of those graphs is pretty much correlation = causation.
