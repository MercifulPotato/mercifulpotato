I didn’t like the attention hijacking, or the never-ending feed surfing, or how they made me feel.<p>Looked around for a more minimalist platform I could use to stay connected to family and friends. Couldn’t find one, so started building one.<p>Sundayy is a social network centered around mindful reflection. It is designed to be checked just once a week, on Sunday.<p><i>Mon - Sat:</i> You’re prompted to slow down, reflect, and write about what the day has brought you. Once you reflect, that’s it. Reflections are kept secret. There are no feeds to check.<p><i>Sunday:</i> Reflections for the week are revealed. You can look back on your friend’s and family’s week as they lived it; day by day, in their own words.<p>My husband and I have been building Sundayy together while using it with close family and friends. Has become a nice ritual to read reflections over a tea on Sunday morning, then call family&#x2F;friends from there.')
