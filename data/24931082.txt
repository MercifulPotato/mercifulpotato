We should be able to support a very large number of people working on human development: scientists and technologists, medical professionals and even wide-spread service jobs, especially if better paid.<p>Unfortunately, for money to prove it&#x27;s worth, too many things must be made scarce.  It is this scarcity driven by the people who already have money and their servants in the system that are going to drive the current collapse, if it is happening (and I certainly think it is).<p>What&#x27;s mocking about the entire thing is that to retire with a 401k is to join the rent-seeking class.  I imagine there is some dark society that could exist where all the food was produced with automation and all that existed otherwise was ownership of that and other automation, producing nothing of value other than the already specious concept of wealth.')
