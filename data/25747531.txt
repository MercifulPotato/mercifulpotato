I imagine techniques have improved since then (as have counter measures to add noise to the data).<p>If you know the general area you can probably use public satellite imagery to narrow it down a bit. I suspect there some other clever information you could use to find the locations if you really wanted to.<p>Even with all the information I&#x27;m not sure how feasible it is for any small group to orchestrate a real disruption given how distributed data AWS centers are. Lots of failovers exist and probably a lot people outside AWS know little about.')
