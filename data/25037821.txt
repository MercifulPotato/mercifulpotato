In my mind it should be rather easy to trace a DNS request, something like: dig A google.com → etc&#x2F;resolv.conf says your nameserver is X.Y.Z.T → made a query to  X.Y.Z.T, it recursed → domain google.com has nameserver ns.a.b. → ADDITIONAL section told us ns.a.b is at X.C.F.G IP → made dns query to X.C.F.G, it told us it was Authoritative and gave RRs [IP1, IP2].<p>I never quite can get this level of clarity from dig(1), instead, &quot;dig A google.com +trace&quot; gives an output like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;ahmetb&#x2F;28a3853bef72fbabf4f0d8ac0712a38d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;ahmetb&#x2F;28a3853bef72fbabf4f0d8ac0712a...</a> which makes me think like: what the hell, am I actually hitting root nameservers every time?<p>If your tool can help developers here, I think it&#x27;s a major value add.')
