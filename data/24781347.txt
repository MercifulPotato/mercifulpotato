I&#x27;ll be searching for a solution to a problem and I notice a &quot;tutorial&quot; but it on the site of a product that&#x27;s name implies it is related to &quot;fixing&quot; the problem. And yep, as soon as I start reading the tutorial I can see they are going to say to use their product and explain how to use it. It gets rather annoying seeing these when I know there are free solutions.')
