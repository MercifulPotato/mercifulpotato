So does every language that isn&#x27;t C&#x2F;C++. And even on the C&#x2F;C++ side, unless you are doing some funky things I doubt it&#x27;s more effort than adding a release configuration that targets ARM in the build pipeline.</i><p>In my C&#x2F;C++ experience - it’s a big push that a software company would just rather not make. Even if you already have an ARM SKU for a different OS, all sorts of things can cause trouble. If you’re coding in C&#x2F;C++, you’re probably pretty interested in performance and you’ll have a lot of hand tuned assembly and&#x2F;or SIMD operations, and that can be a big pain to port, especially with different compilers and intrinsics.<p>I can only imagine the conversations that go on at Adobe or Autodesk or others when debating new platforms and SKUs. Given that even Microsoft wasn’t committed enough to ARM Windows to make a x64 emulator for it probably worked against this.')
