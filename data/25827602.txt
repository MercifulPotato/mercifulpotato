Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25830425], score=None, time=1611009760, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25824222, text='&#x27;Threats of violence&#x27;<p>&#x27;Threats of coordinated violence&#x27;<p>&#x27;Satire with violence&#x27;<p>Are all part of a type of information wherein we can make rules and try to apply them fairly.<p>Saying &#x27;Twitter allowed this but not that&#x27; is besides the point - it illustrates that Twitter is either inconsistent or hypocritical or both ... but it doesn&#x27;t abnegate the notion that policies can be crudely made to work.<p>If you straight up threatened to murder someone on Twitter, they&#x27;ll take it down.<p>The problem of &#x27;mass mistruth&#x27; is much more complicated, because of course, making the stupid claim that &#x27;the COVID vaccines kill 50% of it&#x27;s recipients&#x27; probably would normally be within the realm of protected speech - but when 100% of Americans are subject to such lies, 25% of them refuse to take the vaccine, and 5% of them want to get violent an overthrow the CDC &amp; murder Fauci because he&#x27;s &#x27;killing children&#x27; - well it becomes a problem.<p>One key thing to understand that nobody here in HN wants to contemplate is that the &#x27;commons&#x27; is utterly not a clearing house of information wherein the truth rises to the top. This is totally the opposite. The commons is an arena of populism where we plebes act on instinct and emotion, we chose the information we want to hear, we buy into the lies of groups and ideologues.<p>The truth is almost irrelevant, because it can only ever be contemplated in the context of legitimate authority, which is why we &#x27;mostly trust&#x27; the CDC, Homeland Security, our Judicial system etc. etc..<p>&#x27;Coordinating Violence&#x27; is a problem that can be dealt with in all but the eyes of those wanting &#x27;absolute free speech&#x27;.<p>But &#x27;Lies and Misinformation&#x27; we must understand is actually a serious problem, and worse, there&#x27;s no clear path to how we can solve this.<p>There&#x27;s no doubt we don&#x27;t want corporations, and not &#x27;Tim Cook&#x27; making these decisions, probably not individual bureaucrats or ideological politicians ... we&#x27;re all going to have to work hard to find something that works and that is fairly transparent and fair. FYI Apple doesn&#x27;t want the headache of deciding who speaks and not - they just want to make money and not get into risky scenarios.')
