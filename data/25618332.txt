But I don&#x27;t think the intermediate step of Apple employees reporting this anonymized story to Tim Cook helps much.<p>The original author has the option of reporting this pretty directly to Tim Cook (or, presumably, a team of minions acting as his mail filter), naming names, projects, etc. He&#x27;d be well advised to take this report seriously.<p>Alternatively, the author also has a number of further options. They could go to the press, as mentioned in the article. They could also find themselves a lawyer. IANAL, but the allegations, if true, would seem to constitute a constructive dismissal[0], which (apart from human decency) is a reason why Apple should have every interest to investigate the allegations.<p>Any of these three options would seem to me to be a promising way to get this investigated.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Constructive_dismissal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Constructive_dismissal</a>')
