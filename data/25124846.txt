I got distracted when I pull and forget to pop sometimes, or I was working on something so trivial I never unstashed it.<p>That doesn&#x27;t seem great... Usually these days I try to put my temporary work on a temp commit or branch at least so I don&#x27;t lose it to the stash. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m stashing properly, just that stash is easy to mess up.<p>Also probably half of these are things I popped but had merge conflicts or something. I fixed the merge conflict why is it still there? (I know the reason, but still).')
