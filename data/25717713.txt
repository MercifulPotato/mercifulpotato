That&#x27;d be very simple, which would be a plus in my book.<p>Pandas allows the first param in a pipe to be a tuple[callable, str], where the second argument would signify the parameter location, e.g. `val |&gt; (func, &quot;param_name&quot;)` which gives some flexibility.<p>But yeah, if you open up to piping, there are a lot of possible choices to be made and easy to go overboard also IMO.')
