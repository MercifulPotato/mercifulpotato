IF you need time off, you take time unpaid time off and that&#x27;s it. Why would the employer need to worry about your leisure at all?<p>It&#x27;s a vestige from another era. The people that dont have bargaining power do not get PTO, and the ones that do get some sort mandated vacation time or economically punished otherwise by lower wages or higher taxation.<p>Working during PTO is bad, but it would be better for everyone to not have PTO at all, just TO.')
