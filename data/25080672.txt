The only reason they&#x27;re not also doing very bad in terms of deaths is that people have chosen to isolate, but this is exactly why they&#x27;re doing bad economically.<p>Taiwan was one of the first countries to react to Covid, so they stopped it extremely early from getting into the country to any great extent. They also have extremely high mask usage, even having to ration ration them because of the rate at which they were getting bought. They even had public outcry when an official said mask use was NOT necessary in certain areas - the exact opposite of mask use in the US and Europe.<p>In Peru, it seems by the descriptions I see on Wikipedia that the lockdowns weren&#x27;t very well policed, and they were also not that strict - most of the early lockdowns seem to be of the &#x27;no going out at night&#x27; kind, which has dubious effectiveness. I also see little talk of contact tracing in the area.<p>The USA is by far the worse hit country in the world. How you can even think about opening up, given the hundreds of thousands of people it would likely kill over the next 3 months, is beyond me.')
