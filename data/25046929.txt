Item(by='vvillena', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605021802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25044440, text='&quot;runMain&quot; is still &quot;runMain&quot;, I don&#x27;t know where that comes from. There are lots of available commands indeed, due to the nature of SBT, but a basic workflow always uses the same commands: compile, test, run. Any extra tasks used usually come from plugins, just like in Maven. And reading documentation is needed for configuring and running those, just like in Maven. Projects should document why each plugin is included, and how to do things, because every project is indeed different. The difference is the extra configuration needed by each plugin is about 1&#x2F;10 the size.<p>Maven multimodule projects are strange. Yes, modules can work without knowledge of what&#x27;s above them, but that&#x27;s not usually what we want to do, because it means lots of duplication (e.g. dependencies) which can then lead to inconsistencies. And if the common settings are defined within the parent project, it stops being self-contained. SBT accepts this reality and that&#x27;s why multimodule projects are a thing. And having multiple subprojects in SBT doesn&#x27;t mean that suddenly some of them work and some don&#x27;t. By default, every project has the same settings (save for the obvious ones, like where the sources are). Any extra settings and task definitions just tell SBT to do extra things when certain tasks are run. One quick example: if you enable the integration test configuration just for some subprojects, the ones that don&#x27;t have them don&#x27;t start to fail. They correctly report a &quot;successful, 0 tests run, 0 test failed&quot;. By the way: creating a separate integration test config in Maven is painful, up to the point that people recommend to just add a new subproject that contains them. Yay, more nesting!<p>Regarding SBT current shortcomings: that article correctly points out lots of issues, like the lack of tooling. To this day, IntelliJ still has issues downloading the correct SBT sources. And when they work, there&#x27;s no easy way to find the actual code that does the work. That should be improved, because for lots of plugins, a quick look at the source is just what&#x27;s needed when working on the build. Namespacing is a problem too. The internal complexity of the core SBT concepts is complained about too, but that&#x27;s not as solvable as the other two things.<p>All in all, Maven and SBT are different tools that focus on different issues, and choose different sides in the consistency vs flexibility tradeoff.')
