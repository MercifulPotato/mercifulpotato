I learned my lesson the hard way on Windows tablets.<p>There was a time when &quot;non-x86&quot; is automatically developer&#x2F;hacking-friendly (ancient examples are SPARC, MIPS, and those ARM Chromebooks were probably the last examples...), now the landscape has changed. I always want to use a non-x86 machine as my desktop, but perhaps it&#x27;s time to abandon this idea.')
