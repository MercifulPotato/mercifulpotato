Another is whether it should be up to these companies to police their own platforms. Inciting violence is illegal. They&#x27;re banning people and platforms inciting violence.<p>&quot;Repeal section 230&quot; seems to be about making these companies responsible for policing their own platforms. When people incited violence&#x2F;genocide on Facebook in Myanmar, some people held Facebook partially responsible.
