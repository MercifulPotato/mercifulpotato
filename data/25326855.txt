Item(by='daxfohl', descendants=None, kids=[25328679], score=None, time=1607290292, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326569, text='Yeah, I was expecting you to be able to define a lambda in a cell, so like `B1` could be `=LAMBDA(x =&gt; $A1 + x + 1)`. Then you could assign another cell say `D1` to like `$B1($C1)`. Drag-filling B1 down would make say `B2` equal to `=LAMBDA(x =&gt; $A2 + x + 2)` or something, so that it would work like people would think Excel Lambdas should.<p>That would be more along the lines of lambdas in the traditional sense of anonymous functions, closure captures, higher order functions(?), etc. Could be cool, but IDK if it would be useful? Can&#x27;t think of any specific use cases right now, but perhaps once people get used to it, there would be tons of them.')
