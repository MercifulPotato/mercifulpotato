Item(by='Pet_Ant', descendants=None, kids=[25437076], score=None, time=1608063181, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431764, text='&gt; Freedom isn&#x27;t about being free of the consequences of what you&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s about the law not forbidding you from doing it in the first place.<p>\x10I&#x27;ve always found that definition useless. Imagine a restaurant where a black person can legally sit-down and order food, but where the townsfolk will beat them up if they do. They are legally not forbidden, there are just consequences! They are free!<p>Sorry, but freedom from consequences is really an integral part of freedom. Some consequences are unavoidable, but most of them time &quot;consequences&quot; are just oppression through social means as opposed to government means and are not nobler for it.')
