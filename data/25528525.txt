The professionals upholding the anti-functional design sometimes understand this, but generally shrug as they get a few extra shrubs planted around an intersection feeling they’ve done the best they can. “It’s the whole system, what can I do?”<p>It’s deeply frustrating and discouraging to experience hundred-year mistakes freshly poured in concrete on a regular basis, which I believe are just as this author suggests, mostly attributable to the large majority of people not caring about how roads and streets (or anything else, for that matter) actually work. Combined with the strong tendency of humans to prefer the familiar and status quo over the novel and new... and once things become shitty they will tend to stay that way forever.')
