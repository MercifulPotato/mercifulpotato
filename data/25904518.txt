The issue isn’t then in finding restaurants with v&#x2F;vg options, but instead finding those items in the menu? We haven’t standardized the tagging in menus too much in Germany yet, but this would definitely help. A separate category for v&#x2F;vg would be another solution. Let me take a discussion on this with the team and see how this could be improved. Also happy to take any suggestions.')
