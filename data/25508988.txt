You optimize it, and treat anything else as relatively free.<p>Rendering (or anything else that you can choose to do on the server or the client) has no impact on data coherence. Thus, as optimization goes, it&#x27;s something you care about less than nearly anything else.<p>By the way, I have seen my share of really horrendous code though my life. Only twice I have seen something that isn&#x27;t data coherence being a bottleneck to anything. Both times were really stupid bugs.')
