I have spent a lot of time trying to get familiar with jq. The problem is that I never use it outside of parsing JSON files, yet I use regular expressions all over the place: on the command line, in Python and Javascript and Java code. They are widely applicable. Their syntax is terse, but relatively small.<p>jq has never come naturally. Every time I try to intuit how to do something, my intuition fails. This is despite having read its man page a dozen times or more, and consulted it even more frequently than that.<p>I&#x27;ve spent 20+ years on the Unix command line. I know my way around most of it. I can use sed and awk and perl to great effect. But I just can&#x27;t seem to get jq to stick.<p>Aside, but there&#x27;s a lot of times when &quot;I know jq can do this, but I forget exactly how, let me find it in the man page&quot; and then... I find jq&#x27;s man page as difficult as jq itself when trying to use it as a reference.<p>Anyway, $0.02.<p>Edited to add: as a basic query language, I find it easy to use. It&#x27;s when I&#x27;m dealing with json that embeds literal json strings that need to be parsed as json a second time, or when I&#x27;m trying to manipulate one or more fields in some way before outputting that I struggle. So it&#x27;s when I&#x27;m trying to compose filters and functions inside jq that I find it hard to use.')
