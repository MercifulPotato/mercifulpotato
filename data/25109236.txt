Item(by='p1necone', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605513481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108790, text='&gt; There are a lot of papers on the fact that beans and nuts increase chances of gout.<p>I can&#x27;t find any, link?<p>Sounds like there are vegetables which are high in purines, which <i>are</i> suspected to be related to gout. But studies consistently show that those vegetables do not have an effect, whereas meat, fish etc do.<p>(Also I suspect the downvotes are because the comment claimed that this was the &quot;prevailing opinion&quot;, which it is not)')
