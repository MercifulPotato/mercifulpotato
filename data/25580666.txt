Perhaps there is a performance hit, but at least you have an option.<p>Worth mentioning that there are some use cases that are only possible using cloud infra due to scaling constraints.<p>This is the approach I took building my SaaS. Itâ€™s more difficult initially, but I had an infra that could easily be moved.
