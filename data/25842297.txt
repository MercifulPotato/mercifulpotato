Most people who use Firefox are still exposed to tracking. Google is still the default search engine and promoted via Firefox Home, and continues to track the large majority of users who don&#x27;t change their default. Pretty sure Facebook and Twitter are promoted via the default home page as well. Third party cookies, browser profiling and other tracking mechanisms have barely been addressed. Mozilla seems more focused on lip service, shameless self-promotion and double speak than addressing the problem. The so-called free web is a joke, it&#x27;s a web of giants, and companies like Mozilla who are mere pawns in their protection racket.')
