I can confirm we&#x27;ve all known this for quite a long time.<p>Our general rule is if the product doesn&#x27;t have broad appeal, you don&#x27;t run it on FB.<p>My running theory on all ad networks is pretty simple. There are a very small subset of users, 25%-30%, of people who are regular purchasers and these companies know that based on conversion data. They generally just throw your ad in front of these people and let it ride.')
