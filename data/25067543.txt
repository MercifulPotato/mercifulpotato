Putting the pram on the balcony, while the child was asleep.   We&#x27;d usually leave the door partway open so we could hear if he cried.<p>But to be honest once he was having a nap he was generally predictable, and quiet.  Especially the lunchtime naps after food - we knew he&#x27;d be absolutely fine asleep for 90 minutes and then he&#x27;d probably wake up.
