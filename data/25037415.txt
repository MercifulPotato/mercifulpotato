They&#x27;re payment for a service. You may not think that you entered into a contract with the &quot;donors&quot; by accepting the &quot;donations,&quot; but you did. You made an offer to perform an action in exchange for money and someone accepted that offer by paying you. That&#x27;s a contract and anyone who donated could take you to court to get the money back.')
