This year.<p>The flu is about as dangerous to me as SARS-CoV2, for example. How many years of your life, so far, have you avoided seeing your family at holidays in order to protect me?<p>Cars are also more dangerous to me than SARS-CoV2. How many years of your life have you avoided automobiles, because you might kill me in an accident?<p>The logic is the same. You may feel as though there is a justification for telling people not to see their families at Thanksgiving, but that&#x27;s <i>your opinion.</i> Other people have different opinions, and they&#x27;re equally valid.')
