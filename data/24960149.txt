Some people will &quot;be predisposed to think of labeled and filtered resources as objectionable&quot;, but that&#x27;s <i>wrong</i>, and the library has a duty to try and structure things to minimize that incorrect predisposition. That doesn&#x27;t seem to be the attitude the Internet Archive is taking here - information like &quot;this article was part of a disinformation campaign&quot; or &quot;this article was banned by Medium&quot; is relevant only to the extent that it discourages people from reading it or believing what it has to say.<p>Some of the practices you&#x27;re describing in book publishing do bother me. I have no issue with the author of a work making corrections, errata, disclaimers, etc. But when a publisher agrees to publish a book, and then reneges because they don&#x27;t agree with its contents, I find that disturbing.')
