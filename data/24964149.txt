Is having 100,000,000 USD not enough?<p>Nobody knows. Maybe yes. Maybe no.<p>Notice that billionaires can&#x27;t spend all their money on themselves. They can&#x27;t exactly buy a billion dollars worth of cheese and eat it all. They can sink whatever they like in to property but realistically they probably only spend a few million dollars on property and the vast bulk of their wealth goes in to directing the economy via shares and real estate.<p>So if all the billions of dollars was removed from the billionaires they will experience a very modest (potentially no) change in quality of life and there will be far reaching economic consequences because the control structure was just reworked. It is totally unclear if it would be a win or a loss for most people.')
