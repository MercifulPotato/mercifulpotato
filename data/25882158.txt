Live and let live is fine so long as we dont screw each other over. In those cases they are being actively hostile to peoples freedom. When they push, push back as hard as you can. Push them down the stairs if that&#x27;s what it takes to make them see their self interest is actively hostile to others.<p>(No, I&#x27;m not advocating violence, just taking the term &quot;pushback&quot; to the next metaphorical level. Ugh)')
