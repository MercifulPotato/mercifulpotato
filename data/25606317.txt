I&#x27;d wager a bet that legal users of amphetamines outnumber the illegal users 10,000 to 1. Besides, amphetamine is just the name of the compound, it doesn&#x27;t suggest anything. If you imply that simply knowing that amphetamines can keep you awake is dangerous, then I&#x27;d like to point you towards centuries of proof that not telling people about sex totally stops them from having it.')
