Social anxiety is not the root cause. Sales and marketing (entrepreneurship) is indeed at the hearth of a startup, but the difference is I find these activities fun and rewarding, and a huge opportunity to learn and grow as a person.<p>So much to learn like writing, doing presentations and conducting a sale (B2B), public speaking, crafting a brand, hiring,  designing processes, organizing and managing teams, company structure and culture...<p>I love to code, but it’s a small part.
