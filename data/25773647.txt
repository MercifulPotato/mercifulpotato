The reason is clear: Big Tech has no principles other than its desire to serve the interests of the radical left and the Democratic Party. They can’t say it out loud so they say it with their actions.<p>Seems like a strange claim if one looks at the top 10 popular contributors on Facebook[1], and I am very convinced that both Twitter and Facebook have been primary drivers behind fuelling populism in the US by removing gatekeepers. If they&#x27;re a liberal conspiracy, they&#x27;re probably the least successful one in a long time.<p>On the issue of hate itself, obviously comparing absolute numbers on Twitter and Gab is comparing apples and oranges. I suspect the density of hate speech on Gab, that is hate speech in relationship to regular posts is way higher, which creates the (correct) impression that they&#x27;re way more negligent or even explicitly try to service that audience. That&#x27;s not to say that Facebook or Twitter don&#x27;t have a larger responsibility simply because they&#x27;re larger, but it explains why these fringe networks are such quick targets without resorting to the logic of political coordination.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;facebookstop10?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;facebookstop10?lang=en</a>')
