For a $1m house in the Bay Area, only a quarter or a third of that value is the structure.<p>&gt; <i>However, most of all, it is one of the rare taxes that does not diminish economic activity, and in fact stimulates it.</i><p>How do they arrive at this conclusion? A bakery that’s been around for 100 years finds itself in a hip part of town (which maybe it helped foster), and then has to move out because the only type of business that can support the LVT in the area is luxury apartments. The higher the LVT, the <i>more</i> risk of a monoculture in land usage, not the other way around.')
