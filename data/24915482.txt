I&#x27;ve been trying to stop this ad for the last 5 days, but there&#x27;s a bug in Instagram&#x27;s UI that won&#x27;t let me. I also can&#x27;t get hold of an Instagram support person, or FB support. So I&#x27;ve kept spending money I don&#x27;t want to spend.<p>FB and Instagram are core parts of society now as one of the major places to advertise. Lack of support of this kind seems like a really bad sign of a future where all you talk to are robots.<p>Also, average cost per conversion thru Instagram is $16 - $33. That is just a straight up toll that is paid to Facebook by every product that wants to advertise on their platform. I&#x27;m not saying it should be free, but surely they can afford better customer service.')
