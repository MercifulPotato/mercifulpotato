That&#x27;s.. Not a lot. Maybe they only did it for batter life. Maybe they will allow more in the future. But you can only get an M1 with what Apple sells you, and the future means comparing to what&#x27;s available from AMD and Intel at that time as well.<p>No support for discrete GPU. They have some onboard support for ML workloads(which might actually be inflating their benchmark numbers a bit) but it&#x27;s only comparable to entry level GPUs apparently(sub 200).<p>Most reviews seem overly focused on Geekbench results and seem very lacking in intensive real world workloads(like photoshop, after effects, etc etc). Cinabench seems to tell a different story ATM. The latest top-end AMD mobile CPUs seem to smoke it on multi-core perf. And the new 5800U is not far off in single or multi-core perf. Will need to wait and see how real world perf actually compares across the board.<p>Overall I see this as a first step with some impressive FUTURE implications for the industry, but it&#x27;s not putting all the competition in its shadow. Apple will have flexibility controlling their chip designs and, perhaps more importantly, they stand to save billions moving away from Intel. It&#x27;s telling though that the M1 is limited to the 13&quot; MBP ATM, and I&#x27;d give it a pass for my current processing needs. Squarely in early adopter zone.')
