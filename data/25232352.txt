I use a VirtualBox-based Vagrant environment, and the performance is awful.  It mostly comes down to terrible disk performance due to how VBox shares directories from inside the VM to the host filesystem.  Apparently it can be fixed entirely by switching to local NFS, but I haven&#x27;t had any success getting that working.')
