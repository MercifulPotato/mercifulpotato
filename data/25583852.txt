I ran into it recently with the LOTR 4K Bluray set. I was going to leave a 3 or 4 star review, since while it&#x27;s fantastic, the image detail is hardly an improvement over the standard bluray version, with some claiming the 4K wasn&#x27;t even a full rescan from the originals. Side by side shots show very minor at best improvements to detail, with most of the actual benefits coming from HDR.<p>Since a 3 or 4 star review was pointless given their SKU grouping, I left a 1 star review. If 10% of users started punishing companies and Amazon with 1 star reviews they would change pretty quickly.')
