That means it takes up to a whole week to even <i>attempt</i> to automatically fix a problem, which is a long time. True that&#x27;s going to be four attempts before, finally, the certificate actually expires (if the problem is just intermittent service availability), but it doesn&#x27;t seem worth the small additional risk.<p>Now, sure, in principle you should have active monitoring so you&#x27;d know immediately if there&#x27;s a problem status e.g. certificate with only 14 days left until expiry; revoked, expired or otherwise bad certificate presented by server; OCSP staples missing. But we know lots of people don&#x27;t have monitoring, and I guarantee at least one person reading this HN thread is mistaken and isn&#x27;t monitoring everything they thought they were.<p>Like Certbot acme-client does a local check before taking any action, so if run once a day (or indeed once an hour) it will not normally call out to the Let&#x27;s Encrypt service.<p>Unlike Certbot acme-client doesn&#x27;t do OCSP checks, so it won&#x27;t even talk to the network to get an OCSP response. Even with Certbot this (OCSP) is provided through a CDN (so it&#x27;s roughly similar cost to fetching a static image for a popular web site) and so your check is negligible in terms of operating costs for Let&#x27;s Encrypt.')
