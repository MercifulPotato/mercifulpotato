Item(by='bigbubba', descendants=None, kids=[25411020], score=None, time=1607896746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25410358, text='&gt; <i>&quot;go! no, you go! no you go!&quot;</i><p>Seattle streets in a nutshell.  As a frequent pedestrian I&#x27;ve lost count of the number of times a car has stopped in the middle of an intersection and frantically tried to wave me across a street.  Some people are just bonkers.  If you&#x27;re already <i>inside</i> an intersection, don&#x27;t yield to a pedestrian who&#x27;s standing still on the sidewalk!  Are people <i>trying</i> to get t-boned?  Worse, in those situations I feel morally compelled to run across the street just so the driver will remove themselves from the dangerous situation they put themselves in for my sake.  Absolutely infuriating.')
