Item(by='blakehaswell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610432786, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25741172, text='My concern with this is that it gives the &quot;rain skeptics&quot; a platform to spread their views, and presents &quot;rain skeptics&quot; as a legitimate alternative to the &quot;rain scientists&quot;. The problem with this is that once people are given a platform and presented as legitimate, then they can convince people not based on the logic of their arguments but on things which have nothing to do with the matter under debate (e.g. &quot;I like the way he speaks, not like that snooty scientist&quot;).<p>I think people I know have been convinced in this manner. I don&#x27;t think people necessarily reflect on <i>why</i> they were convinced. They just know that they agree with the &quot;rain skeptics&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that giving &quot;rain skeptics&quot; a platform would be the right thing to do if they only make up a small percentage of the population. If they make up half the population, I have no idea.<p>EDIT: My experience above is probably not helped by weak moderation in debates. Moderators with a backbone would probably help in cases where &quot;rain skeptics&quot; are given a platform. Sadly that seems to be rare.')
