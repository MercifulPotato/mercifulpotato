Long story short, it really took employees a lot of time to do a task, « which I can automate in 2 days as a programmer » (that’s what every programmer says before they spend a year on it).<p>I finished the gig then I developed the solution alone, and indeed there was decent demand for it. And once it was well-designed, there was even more demand for it. And when we marketed for multi-node clusters... it seems we could charge anything we want as long as we have the enterprise features (cluster, performance reports, XML export, REST APIs, permissions, all those details that are important for companies).')
