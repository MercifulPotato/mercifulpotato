Having worked in bigCo vs small Co, there are a <i>lot</i> of small Co and OSHW EEs who barely have a clue what they&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s not worth TI&#x27;s time or money to help these people out. Upleveling lousy engineers thru support only to net them a 10 piece part order, is a really lousy ROI. (Unless of course we&#x27;re talking an ASIC or some other astronomically high ROI custom piece. But, I&#x27;m assuming that we&#x27;re not, because I don&#x27;t work for a military prime contractor.)')
