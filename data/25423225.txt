Anybody can bother you at any time.<p>In the real world, if we ever return to it, I like having physical team rooms, the sort of thing you have naturally when it&#x27;s an early-stage startup in a single space. When everybody knows each other and is focused on the same goal, it&#x27;s not hard to work out good communication and space-use norms. But scaling that up into large open-plan offices can quickly turn maddening. It&#x27;s the tragedy of the audio commons, and anybody can walk up and tap you on the shoulder.<p>For me Slack is the same problem, but worse in that it removes some of they physical signals and feedback mechanisms that work in an open-plan office.')
