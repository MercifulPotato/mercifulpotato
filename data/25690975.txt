I believe I used the word &quot;potentially&quot; in the reply you are commenting to. The officer was shooting from ~6ft away and had a firm grip and was well composed, if they can&#x27;t hit the chest of a target that was mostly still at the moment of the shot then they need to be spending a lot more time in the gun range (at the absolute minimum).')
