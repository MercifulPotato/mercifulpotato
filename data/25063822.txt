The big difference is what they compile to - where const enum evaporates by inlining the values into the usage sites.<p>enum is a keyword that is reserved in ECMAScript and therefore may one day clash with TypeScript.  It&#x27;s unlikely any ECMAScript-defined semantics for enum would match today&#x27;s TypeScript enum.  So it&#x27;s not on any standards track.<p>There is already a proposal for JS enum that has different semantics to TS enum, and it was created by someone on the TypeScript team:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rbuckton&#x2F;proposal-enum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rbuckton&#x2F;proposal-enum</a><p>So the const form doesn&#x27;t really change the hazard.')
