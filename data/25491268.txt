His father was a real con man, grifting people for a a living, as was the main character&#x27;s father in the book.  It really is an amazing read, I read it twice just to fully understand it, and the TV version makes things a little more understandable.<p>Think about it - who could possibly be a more perfect double agent than the son of a con man?')
