It doesn&#x27;t matter if Republicans try to appeal people outside the &quot;base&quot;, because those people won&#x27;t get the message. They will only get the message they get from the media, which in almost 100% of cases that I&#x27;ve looked into is completely different from what the Republicans actually said. They have no real choice.')
