Item(by='arfposting', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610432889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25742819, text='The tech forums have always been pretty good resources, and even in GD there are plenty of people I admire, including most of the old hands. swingset, subnet, DK-Prof, Aimless, Miami JBT, and Zhukov to name a few. But it ain&#x27;t all sunshine and rainbows, and reading GD in the past 2 months wouldn&#x27;t give anybody a very good impression of &quot;firearm enthusiasts&quot;.<p>Credit where it&#x27;s due: unlike, say, TheDonald or even r&#x2F;conservative, it is a free speech zone. I don&#x27;t recall them banning anybody for expressing a political opinion. If you were left-leaning you would definitely get dogpiled by commenters calling you an idiot or a shill, so you probably wouldn&#x27;t hang around very long, but that&#x27;s just what happens when the community is 95+% right wing, and maybe 50+% what you might call <i>far</i> right wing. You would not be censored just for going against the herd.<p>It&#x27;s been moderated much more strictly in recent days, including moving most political discussion to a separate, paid-members-only board, but it still takes like 10 clicks around GD to find a post where somebody suggests it might&#x27;ve been good if some Democrats in congress died that day. Subtle and not-so-subtle race replacement conspiracy theory rears its ugly head now and then in GD too. If you&#x27;re GoDaddy, looking at what happened and what type of rhetoric led to it, I can see why you&#x27;d want to distance yourself ASAP. It&#x27;s not the call I would&#x27;ve made if I ran a DNS registrar, but I&#x27;m not going to pretend there&#x27;s nothing there to justify it.')
