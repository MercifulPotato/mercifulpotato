At the time we needed this machine anyway (this is way before &quot;Cloud computing&quot; was really a thing) but a few years earlier it would have been a good choice.<p>We actually had most of the bloom filter code you&#x27;d need because we used a <i>lot</i> of Bloom Filters in that project. One of the very common queries that system had was &quot;Hey do we know about random thing X?&quot; for which the answer would often (but not always) be &quot;No&quot;. So Bloom Filters enabled the system to be able to say definitively &quot;Nope, I know nothing about X&quot; a good fraction of the time without any further work. This actually hurt us in some third party benchmarks we ran for boasting, but helped in our real use case.')
