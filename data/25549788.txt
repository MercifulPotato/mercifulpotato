There was even a Project Barmaid (are all British code names better?) that had a claw fitted to HMS Conquerer to sever and capture the towed sonar array from a soviet submarine while it was underway!<p>I’m not pretending any of this is likely in this case; I’m just giving us fun things to google and start reading about :)')
