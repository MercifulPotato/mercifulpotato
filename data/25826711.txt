Everything was tracked and it was fucking awful. The reliance on them meant she had no idea how to feel intuitively about our kid growing inside of her. After some convincing, the apps were ditched, she felt more &quot;in tune&quot; with what was going on, and we even had a ride to hospital to check on things because she felt things had gone quiet movement wise. Our kid moved like clockwork at certain times of the day and after meals, no app needed to figure that out.<p>These apps are a fucking cancer on what should be an enjoyable and natural time.')
