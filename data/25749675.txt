Although my iMac Pro begs to differ -- I hear its fans only if it maxes out all cores for more than 20-30 seconds. Otherwise not at all. But it&#x27;s an exception (and that machine is quite the marvel of engineering, too, minus the flimsy VESA mounting stuff where it&#x27;s an absolute catastrophe).<p>I have no qualms with my Win10 gaming PC being slightly audible (I use FractalDesign case with Noctua fans to it&#x27;s not easy to actually hear it). I have no trouble with a machine spinning its fans here and there.<p>But for my former work Lenovo T490 killed all my desire to work. Sometimes it even started making noise (again for a full minute) after I saved a file in Emacs (so the language server kicked in for 2-3 secs).<p>From here on I&#x27;ll just be only on desktop machines and will soon buy a Linux desktop workstation plus a MacBook Pro M1 with which I&#x27;ll only do work outside when I absolutely positively can&#x27;t do it at home. And use it for remoting to my machines as well, of course.')
