They&#x27;re out there. I had to go through a lot of them to get to where I am now and the journey has been worth it. Also, there are lots of little tricks that you can use to make the journey more comfortable. Some of it is technical and some of it is EQ-related&#x2F;interpersonal. It&#x27;s very important to step outside the box and think about what kind of work you could be proud of achieving, and then you can take steps toward honing the skills that will get you there.<p>For instance, an example of little things that make your job related duties more streamlined will surprise you with how much of a difference it makes for making the daily routine more enjoyable. It really adds up.<p>The example: We have to fill in timesheets every 2 weeks. Well I sat down one day and spent an hour writing a bookmarklet in js that autofills the timesheet, hacking through the silly event handlers so I don&#x27;t have to manually click and type on 20 cells. I even had to come back to it a few months later to add in logic to handle PTO and Holidays... I&#x27;m so glad I wrote it. Shared it with my coworkers too, which greatly increased its return on investment.')
