Or if they self-replicate. Maybe multiple conscious entities can even combine and then disentangle, for a sort of cerebral experience.<p>Who knows if we&#x27;ll be confined to this planet if we don&#x27;t have bodies? Will we have bodies?<p>If we don&#x27;t, we won&#x27;t even need earth like habitats. The entire solar system works. We might even solve the Jupiter radiation thing.<p>All of these things are <i>way cooler</i> than kids. Granted it&#x27;s all a pipe dream, but I&#x27;d jump at the opportunity.')
