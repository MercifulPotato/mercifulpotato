They&#x27;re not the only ones, of course. Mainstream media outlets are propaganda outlets. They all have a POV that the owner and editorial staff enforce through hiring, company culture, what they accept for print, etc.<p>Second, culture wars are always fought by minorities. It doesn&#x27;t take a large number of people to change the status quo. This applies as much to revolutionaries (communists, Nazis, etc) as demographics (Taleb once gave the relatively innocuous example of kashrut classifications on food in the grocery store as an example of how a tiny minority can impose its sectarian norms on an agricultural industry that serves a majority that probably doesn&#x27;t even know what kashrut is; he used this, I believe, to illustrate that the argument that you don&#x27;t need a majority of devout, Sharia law-following Muslims for Sharia to become a realistic possibility).<p>Third, the current culture war is real. Even if it is led and actively propelled by a small minority, it nonetheless embroils everyone. It&#x27;s difficult to give a single date of birth for the current culture war, and in some sense, the world has always been in a state of cultural war. But what people typically have in mind is the deep-cutting revolution that has been escalating since the 1960s. Like newborn fish that don&#x27;t know what water is and have no memory of things past, many fail to grasp the revolution taking place. Perhaps people expect revolutions to look theatrically dramatic. But there is a culture war taking place. In the last 20 years along, we have seen changes that were unthinkable across human history.<p>The stakes are high and the multitudes will be led by whoever is the victor. The media are instruments of different factions in the war. Some are looking for a seat at the table when the dust has settled Other look to wage total cultural war against their opponents. Some are fighting to preserve what&#x27;s left. Others seek to counteract the entire rebellion.<p>It may be better to call this a culture battle. I claim to know the victor of the war. I just don&#x27;t know who will win the battle, or how much blood will be spilled.')
