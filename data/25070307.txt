We are on hackernews, a site focused on startups. Pivoting <i>dramatically</i>, including throwing away your entire customer base for a different population, is considered an essential part of running a startup. But if a big company has a product that is obviously stagnating at a small userbase then the community demands that it be supported in perpetuity.<p>There is a pair of Cole Haan shoes I really like. I bought several of the same exact style over the years. It was eventually phased out. I can&#x27;t buy it anymore. Is Cole Haan narcissistic for not offering me the shoe I want?<p>Is it narcissism, or good business?')
