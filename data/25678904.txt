Signal is open source and we&#x27;re constantly seeing people complain on here about its lack of features or whatever. If we can&#x27;t convince the most populous location for programmers to help in that respect then how could we do it for a federated network? And even the server is open sources. So I don&#x27;t see why you couldn&#x27;t have a fork that is federated. Or an app that is able to talk to both the centralized server and federated servers. It seems more a will problem than anything else and I don&#x27;t see why Moxie and the Signal team would focus on these features above other features that are actually helping get people on the platform (arguably more important than any aspect).')
