I have never seen any news story call it an &quot;American flight&quot;. Have always seen news stories attribute to the organization: NASA&#x2F;SpaceX&#x2F;Virgin Galactic etc. I would have ignored the slight had the story at least mentioned ISRO. And this is a report by the &quot;Science Correspondent&quot;. This would be a bare minimum expectation.<p>&gt; I vouched you comment back up because I think it&#x27;s worth linking, but no need to ascribe some sort of malicious motive to the BBC here.<p>Thanks for vouching. Well BBC has held an anti-India stance for quite a long time[1]. Even positive stories are spun around to paint India in a negative light. And it is not just the BBC. A huge section of the Western media indulges in this behavior. So felt like calling them out. Even if I am the lone voice here.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-Indian_sentiment#BBC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-Indian_sentiment#BBC</a>')
