The problem is there is no clear delineated line between &quot;thoughtcrime&quot; and plain old crime prevention.  Where is the line for you when a threat of violence is equivalent to violence?  When does a thought become a plan? Threats are just words, so I imagine I can threaten to kill you.  What about if those threats are through deliberate and premeditated actions like mailing you a death threat?  Is it any different if I tell other people to attack you?  Those are just words, right?  Is it different if I pay them? Can I brandish a knife if I am 20 feet away from you?  I don&#x27;t pose an immediate threat in that instance. Can I pull a gun on you without any fear of reprisal?  That isn&#x27;t a direct act of violence either yet.  Do I need to pull the trigger before you respond?')
