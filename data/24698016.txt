If the planet warms 5C and we are all baked to a crisp, we had an effect on the biosphere AND climate change was correct. Carlin&#x27;s point is that in a astronomical, deep-time sense, it&#x27;s not the &quot;PLANET&quot; that&#x27;s in trouble, it&#x27;s the human race.<p>There may have been life on Mars, which may have died due to ignorant people like HashingtheCode, but Mars is still there. Mars is fine. The Martians on the other hand...')
