On Firefox. Fedora, both host and guests.<p>I can reproduce the crashes by going to a number of websites. I always assumed it had something to do with OpenGL but lately it&#x27;s happening on websites that I doubt are running any accelerated content. So it could be the browser&#x27;s hardware acceleration.<p>But essentially it takes down virt-manager&#x2F;virt-viewer and I have to launch another instance. The machine itself is fine but it becomes a race to close the tab before the window crashes again.<p>It&#x27;s been a while since I tried debugging but I&#x27;m pretty sure that it happens whether or not hw acceleration is enabled in Firefox and it also doesn&#x27;t matter whether the \nlibvirt XML configuration enables OpenGL or not.<p>By directly, do you mean just running the virtual machine through the cli or actually setting all my configuration flags in the qemu-system-x86_64 command?')
