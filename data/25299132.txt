Item(by='Apreche', descendants=None, kids=[25304884, 25299389], score=None, time=1607057789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298574, text='I refuse to take any such tests, and I&#x27;ve had no trouble finding employment. In a world where recruiters are blowing up your inbox, the ball is in your court.<p>One time I interviewed somewhere. It wasn&#x27;t a perfect job, but I would have taken it if the offer was good. After the interview they called and wanted me to take some kind of test. I said no. They called me at least two more times to see if I wouldn&#x27;t reconsider. That made me think wow, they must really like me from the interview. Why not just make me an offer? But no, they didn&#x27;t call back after I firmly denied them. Maybe they learned a lesson, maybe not. Not my problem.<p>And that&#x27;s the final lesson. If a place has this kind of hiring process, that is already a red flag that this is not a good place to work. Even if you took the test and they made you an offer, it would not be a good time working there.')
