As the saying goes &quot;your freedom to swing your fists ends at my nose.&quot; So it is with speech. You should be able to speak your mind, but if that speech causes someone else harm, then that person&#x27;s right not to be harmed must be weighed against your right to speak.<p>Maybe we shouldn&#x27;t allow private entities like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, etc decide where those boundaries are. I don&#x27;t think capitalism is a good fit in this case.')
