Someone shared it on social media, and I did the calculation and I knew many places that were affordable by those standards, even in a large city.<p>They retorted there isn&#x27;t a place in America that you can find a place under 800$.  I&#x27;m like .... did you look very hard?  When I was in philadelphia from 2007-2009, I shared a 3 bedroom apartment with 3-4 other people for ~200$.  When I wanted my own &#x27;place&#x27;, from 2009-2013 I rented a micro apartment in down town Philadelphia for 400$&#x2F;month.<p>I&#x27;m sure prices are higher now, but there are affordable places to live, but you have to be willing to give up something: commute time, amenities, size, privacy, etc.<p>With income, other industries have room to complain, but not tech.  my 28k TC starting salary isnt even what people are getting signing bonuses these days.')
