OLE is part of COM, which is all about individual classes, hidden behind interfaces, being available globally in the OS as building blocks.<p>In a COM model, you can imagine, say, a word processor being composed of UI, document model, document store and spellchecker components. In this reality, I could replace the UI with a touch-enabled one, and run the same spell checker on a remote computer, all with few changes in Windows registry. Think of it like OS-level dependency injection and microservices, with RPC and orchestration being handled transparently for you.')
