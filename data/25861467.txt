Research is based on 76 urine samples which is way too little. In the paper, there&#x27;s little info on model hyper-parameters as well as how they trained and tested them. I suspect they overfitted their model, meaning it just learned all the samples. If that&#x27;s not the case, the only other explanation for such high accuracy is that there&#x27;s a very obvious correlation and a human would be able to diagnose cancer with high accuracy also, meaning you don&#x27;t need any AI.')
