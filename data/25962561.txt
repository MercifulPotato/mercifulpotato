Even if the cop could grant it, why would he?<p>Obviously different if <i>your lawyer says</i> that requesting immunity might work, probably because you&#x27;re knee deep in someone else&#x27;s mess and their experience tells them that prosecution will be far more interested in your testimony against them than stuff you might need to admit to.')
