This was a bomb, yes, but a happenstance one spread nonuniformly over a large region of warehouse.  It&#x27;s not unlikely that a considerable portion of the ammonium nitrate was blown away by the first-to-detonate material.<p>Speculation, very much not my area.  Informed by earlier reading however.')
