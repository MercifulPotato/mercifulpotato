Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=[25371881], score=None, time=1607590746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25371202, text='The most likely explanation is that one of the many widespread contacts between wild animals and humans in the area, likely at a wet market where wild animals were being sold as food, resulted in the virus jumping to humans.<p>SARS-CoV2 makes a poor bioweapon.  You&#x27;d want something with a higher fatality (or severe morbidity) rate, both for effectiveness and also to limit it&#x27;s geographic impact to the target country.<p>If it&#x27;s not an engineered virus, the lab isn&#x27;t a smoking gun.  We have identified a very similar virus where bats are the reservoir species, and have identified a couple of very plausible routes by which it jumped to an intermediate wild animal that was transported to Wuhan for human consumption.  If it&#x27;s a wild virus, a lab escape seems less likely than the bushmeat hypothesis.<p>Both HIV and genital herpes are believed to have jumped to humans due to humans&#x2F;homonids eating bushmeat.  It&#x27;s known to be a very dangerous thing to do, and it&#x27;s known to be somewhat widespread in Wuhan.<p>Another possibility is that it is a virus engineered for research instead of direct use as a bioweapon, and it escaped.  It&#x27;s close enough to the wild bat virus that it&#x27;s not obvious any engineering has been done.<p>In any case, we have a very simple and likely explanation that matches the official story.<p>It&#x27;s comforting to believe we&#x27;re in control and that simply being more stringent about lab safety will prevent this in the future.  It&#x27;s also politically convenient to blame foreigners (a favorite tactic of politicians everywhere for every occasion).  Those two factors are why the lab escape rumours are so persistent.<p>The truth is that (1) we keep having dangerous contact with wild animals and farm animals and we will not have control until we cut down on these practices and (2) U.S. officials are largely to blame for the sad state of things in the U.S.  Yes, the Chinese authorities should have been more open from the beginning and botched the opportunity to snuff it out early, but there are plenty of countries doing much better than the U.S.')
