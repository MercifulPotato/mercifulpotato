There are conventions that may apply to a massive code base, such as those on some of the big providers that not initially clear, so I think spending some time in ensure that you explain why they haven&#x27;t had a PR merged is worthwhile. Sometimes a PR can be ignored completely.<p>I guess it depends on whether you want people to try and contribute to your project or whether you insta close the PR because they missed a semi colon, which it seems would be your approach.')
