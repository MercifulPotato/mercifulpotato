I&#x27;ll give VSCode credit for being better than your average Electron app, but it (and Azure Data Studio, which last I checked is based on VSCode) ain&#x27;t exactly a speed demon, either.  Then again, I&#x27;m typically running something like Emacs, which is a lot lighter-weight (at least <i>before</i> I blow up ~&#x2F;.emacs.d), so I&#x27;m probably just spoiled :)<p>It&#x27;s certainly faster than Visual Studio, but it also has far fewer features.')
