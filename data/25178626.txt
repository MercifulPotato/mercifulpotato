Item(by='_Understated_', descendants=None, kids=[25178780], score=None, time=1606061876, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25178529, text='Like what?<p>It&#x27;s not running on their servers at this point: It&#x27;s on my computer.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know what the US laws exactly say about that but in terms of common sense, FB should not be allowed to make any claims to that data when it&#x27;s on my computer.<p>Sure, they can say &quot;well, no more data for you, you&#x27;re banned&quot; but that&#x27;s a different argument.<p>In addition, having control over users of FB is one thing as they signed up to it and agreed to the terms but NYU didn&#x27;t so I have no idea how they can even claim to enforce them especially if NYU are scraping data from the users computer (I assume they aren&#x27;t making a connection to the FB servers!)<p>Also, not that it matters for this argument, I do not have a FB (or any social media) account: I tried it, maybe 10 years ago, and found it silly :)<p>Edit: Guys, this isn&#x27;t Reddit! I&#x27;m all for downvotes but not drive-by downvoting... a simple &quot;I downvoted you because...&quot; would suffice.<p>Edit2: Mea Culpa! As has been pointed out, I replied to someone that wasn&#x27;t actually commenting on my post... not sure how I missed that!')
