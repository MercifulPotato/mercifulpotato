Item(by='waterheater', descendants=None, kids=[24924416], score=None, time=1603919968, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24920789, text='Tangential to this topic, but Isaac Asimov wrote a book called &quot;The Chemicals of Life&quot; in 1954, just after Watson and Crick identified the double-helix structure of DNA. Many people don&#x27;t know this, but Asimov was, at one point, a professor of Biochemistry at Boston University.<p>The book provides a high-level overview of the biological functions of the body and why we need certain components (essential amino acids, vitamins, minerals, etc.). Certain elements of it are dated (scientists didn&#x27;t understand the purpose of cholesterol back then), but the general principles hold true.<p>If you&#x27;re a tech-minded person who understands very little about biology, you may find the book illustrative. You can find a used copy on Amazon for relatively cheap.')
