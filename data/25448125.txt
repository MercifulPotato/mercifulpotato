Going back to 1970s model where we had more cows which developed more slowly because they got their energy from grazing would require more labor than the system we have now but it would be much better for the environment.  From an environmental and animal welfare prospective I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with grazing cattle.  It&#x27;s the feedlots where cows now spend the last phase of their lives being stuffed with soy and high energy feed that&#x27;s the problem.')
