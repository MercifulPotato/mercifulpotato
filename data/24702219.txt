The fact that you don&#x27;t know them all isn&#x27;t because it&#x27;s hard nor complex. The same thing applies to bubblesort and every other thing you might not know off-hand without googling.<p>Watch Jeopardy and ask yourself if any of the questions are particularly hard or complex to memorize. Perhaps that&#x27;s not why you don&#x27;t know them.<p>I&#x27;ve implemented bubblesort at least 10 times in uni. I remember a few of the sorting algorithms I had to impl, but I forget which one is bubblesort. It would take me 10 seconds to go &quot;oh right, that one&quot; if I ever need to see it. I haven&#x27;t had to in the 15 years since uni. Remembering that bubblesort is algo A vs algo B without googling it the one time I need to know is worthless. Knowing higher level concepts of sorting and perf trade-offs, on the other hand, is not.<p>Having a set of trivia that you consider essential is itself trivia. As I could have my own arbitrary list of easily googleable essentials, like the wall socket voltage in every country in the world. No matter how handy I claim that knowledge is, it doesn&#x27;t even pay its rent in the grey matter is takes up when you can just google it.')
