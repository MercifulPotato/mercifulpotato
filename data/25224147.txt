People seem to have skipped the V&amp;V lectures. The code did exactly what it was asked to do. But the system&#x2F;aero engineers made that decision. Even the lights issue was specified that way in the system diagram.<p>But the biggest defect was the decision that the pilots didn&#x27;t have to be told about the risk (to avoid retraining and certification costs). If they had been told the pilots&#x2F;airlines may well have protested about the lack of redundancy. All those higher ups in Boeing and the FAA should be in prison.')
