The people who control the currency control the dynamics of the economy and society. That&#x27;s all good if the dynamics work in your favor (e.g. your friends are central bankers and billionaires) but otherwise it&#x27;s terrible.<p>Also, what does it mean &quot;well run&quot;? Well run from whose perspective? Monetary policy does not create economic value; it can only help those in charge to decide who are the winners and who are the losers.<p>My personal values don&#x27;t align at all with the current monetary system. It doesn&#x27;t work for me. It works against me. I&#x27;d rather accept a currency which cannot be controlled by anyone than one which is controlled by my enemies.')
