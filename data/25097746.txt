My current roommate got a &quot;therapy dog&quot; for her narcolepsy against my will (after I explicitly told her I&#x27;m incredibly allergic) and to be frank I now have no clue why you&#x27;d want a pet.  It&#x27;s hair is everywhere, the apartment smells like a dirty sock now and well this morning hair even ended up in my breakfast.<p>The front of the luxury building in NYC I live in is also basically always covered in urine from the pets of lazy dog owners.<p>Low key, I prefer to be the only class of animal in my home.  Pets are unsanitary (I&#x27;m not a clean freak, but a dirty animal living in the same space as me is disgusting).<p>Obviously this information isn&#x27;t directly relevant to the article, however I think it&#x27;s interesting to see how much ecological damage domesticated pets have.  Cats in terms of decimating bird and rodent populations and dogs, well they kill whatever they want and in the worst cases will attack toddlers etc.  Pit Bulls should be banned, they aren&#x27;t &quot;loving&quot; or &quot;just friendly&quot;.  Candidly, if I were back in a state with legal carry and saw a large dog running at me I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to shoot it on the spot.')
