You don&#x27;t ask &#x27;are you seeing a big sales drop because the crypto bubble blew up?&#x27;, you say &#x27;can you provide some color on when you excess inventory will clear from the channel?&#x27;<p>Analysts get their answers. Management avoids bad headlines written by casual listeners.<p>There&#x27;s an additional layer, which is the analysts know the industry and company very well, so general bad things are already background knowledge (there&#x27;s no reason to ask about them).
