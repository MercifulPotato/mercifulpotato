It&#x27;s just tradeoffs.<p>Some projects don&#x27;t warrant over engineering because the requirements are often not clear in the beginning. There&#x27;s a cost in terms of resources and opportunity which often doesn&#x27;t make sense to incur at an earlier stage of product development.<p>As the first few versions play out in the market, the requirements are better understood, the product starts fitting the market better. Obviously, a lot of the earlier choices don&#x27;t seem optimal for what the product becomes at a later time. Yes, theoretically, &quot;it could have been done better&quot;, but nobody could have known for sure. It should simply be refactored so that the design of the software better fits what it is doing at a given time... and this should be an expected way to develop products.<p>I think &quot;technical debt&quot; is often the wrong term for what is going on. I&#x27;m sure there is a better analogy in terms of business and finance to what is happening... but I&#x27;m not well-versed in finance to say what it is.')
