Item(by='trimbo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607290016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326658, text='&gt; I believe it&#x27;s because politicians get star-struck<p>Maybe that&#x27;s part of it, but I believe it&#x27;s because they know these filmmakers have incredible power to influence.<p>Remember &quot;Sideways&quot;? A fictional character in a fictional movie said one negative line about merlot and wiped out the market for that varietal[1]. People who liked the wine suddenly didn&#x27;t like it, because a character in a movie didn&#x27;t like it.<p>Now consider all of the semi-fictional movies that are made, like Citizen Kane was about Hearst (which destroyed Marion Davies&#x27; reputation as collateral damage). Or all of the movies glamorizing war, soldiers, FBI&#x2F;CIA&#x2F;police or politicians. This is something our government has needed and continues to need people to embrace.<p>[1] - I asked some winemakers about this and they said merlot in Napa &quot;was being ripped up like crazy&quot; after the movie came out. And that merlot often ends up in red blends because selling it as a single varietal still doesn&#x27;t fly.  It&#x27;s only coming back in the last few years.')
