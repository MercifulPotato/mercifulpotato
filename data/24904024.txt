I booked a ticket to Dubai, going through Abu Dhabi. Or so I thought. I was super surprised, once I landed in Abu Dhabi that the connection was on bus. And almost missed the bus, because of a bathroom break I took once I landed. Then had to rush across the airport, to figure out where the buses where that connect. I think it was 2 hour bus ride. But the original ticket was booked online for an airplane.')
