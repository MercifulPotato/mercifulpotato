Small but concrete examples are the Settings page&#x27;s &quot;Activate your free trial of AppleTV+ today!&quot; and their constant pitching of Apple Card. This is the thin edge, more than likely, of them moving to a model not of monetizing your hardware but rather capturing your data and selling you on a subscription bundle of services.<p>This transition is in a way necessitated by their declining revenue growth, so they&#x27;re looking at new ways of monetizing their existing users.')
