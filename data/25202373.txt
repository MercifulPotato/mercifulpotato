If mitigating large scale DDoS attacks was as simple as adding a few iptables rules they would have solved this weeks before paying AWS $3,000 a month for what is effectively an insurance policy.<p>The reality is that AWS has terabits of bandwidth and can mitigate these attacks upstream from your servers, which have bandwidth measured in gbps, not tbps.<p>So, unless you have a global network the size and scale of Amazon or Cloudfront, no, you can&#x27;t just mitigate these attacks with a few firewall rules.')
