It <i>just works</i>, there&#x27;s no extra installation, you start a program and start coding.  And <i>just about any PC</i> has what you need.

How hard would be to have a default Firefox environment for budding coders?  These days you can probably do some Wasm magic to create an entire Linux OS in a browser tab, and install stuff in a virtual disk in the local storage.<p>Heck, it probably wouldn&#x27;t be that hard to cobble together the existing pieces to make a Firefox addon to do that.<p>[1]  Granted BBC Micro and TRS-80 weren&#x27;t PC architectures, but for computers of that generation, a built-in BASIC interpreter was pretty much expected.')
