We had to part ways without anything to show for it. I can empathize.<p>You didn&#x27;t say why your co-founder wants to fire you. I suggest digging deeper into those reasons before you haggle on your exit terms.<p>Assuming you weren&#x27;t negligent: I would try to point out that pushing you out one month before your equity vests is bad faith on your co-founder&#x27;s side. Offer to leave voluntarily after your one-year cliff. Otherwise, if your co-founder just wants you gone now, request that you keep your 1-year equity and some severance.<p>Furthermore: Sometimes it&#x27;s cheaper to just close the company and use the &quot;lessons learned&quot; to restart a very similar company... And that very similar company won&#x27;t owe you anything.<p>[Edit: Deleted some text that, after reading the discussion, isn&#x27;t relevant.]')
