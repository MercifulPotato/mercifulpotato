While this is true of some people who engage in activities like this, there is also the &quot;ends justify the means&quot; group.  The latter <i>does</i> believe what they are doing is right and moral, and that being right and moral justifies behavior that is illegal.  It&#x27;s easy to be cynical and assume that the latter group is just the former group deluding themselves, but there are people who genuinely think that way.  Addressing them requires a different approach than addressing those who just want power and control by any means.')
