I would be incredibly shocked if Musk was hiring self taught, say... material engineers or any other “traditional” engineer.<p>I’m not really a fan of credentialism, especially when it can be expensive and painful as hell to obtain them, but I don’t put much stock into most “anti education” type stuff.')
