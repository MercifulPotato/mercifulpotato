Should I learn how to do it myself, or pay CloudFlare to do it for me? What about S3? What about Aurora&#x2F;Dynamo&#x2F;SQS? Where is the line between &quot;your company TOTALLY has to do it on its own&quot; vs &quot;pay the people who know how to run X to run it for you&quot;?<p>Regarding AWS prices: it&#x27;s not like you are forced to use AWS. Use the cloud your team is most familiar with. I&#x27;m not an expert on cloud offerings, yet if your problem is $20k&#x2F;month and $15k&#x2F;month infrastracture costs, you might be solving a wrong problem.')
