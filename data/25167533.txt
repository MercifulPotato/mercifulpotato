Rails loves its runtime metaprogramming and that is not where crystal offers much, but I don&#x27;t think it invalidates the overall similarity. There&#x27;s trivial (scripts with simple flow), non-trivial (libraries with heavy oop design and a little bit of trickery), and there&#x27;s almost everything else before we get to rails itself.<p>Just like in C, you have trivial, nontrivial, complex apps, then there&#x27;s still a long way before production OS kernels at the extreme.<p>Many advanced libraries don&#x27;t use metaprogramming much, and even if they do, it can be often made either more explicit or shifted to compile time.')
