TLB shootdowns vanish. Cache line ownership, similarly, does not pingpong. Sharing pointers causes fragility, as failure in one thread takes down the whole system.<p>Transferring ownership would add coupling. But such objects can live in a shared-memory area. Pointers into shared regions do require some care. Ideally, only one process ever owns objects in each, most commonly just the ring buffer.<p>With separate processes, they may come and go as needed. Yes, setting up shared memory for ring buffers is more work, but interactions establishing them are not fast-path.<p>Decoupling via separate processes is a different architecture, but has real benefits to motivate it.')
