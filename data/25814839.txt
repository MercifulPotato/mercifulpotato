(I&#x27;m not claiming this is the real look it will have, simply wanted to check the metodology)\nSimply counting the number of colors in the image does not seem a good idea since even with a real photo, a screen with all pixels outputing the same will not give you a single-color image when captured with a camera. The issue is even worse with e-ink due to their technology.')
