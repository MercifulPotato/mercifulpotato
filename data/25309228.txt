A cross functional team then reviewed the paper as part of our regular process and the authors were informed that it didn’t meet our bar for publication and were given feedback about why. [...] We acknowledge that the authors were extremely disappointed with the decision that Megan and I ultimately made, especially as they’d already submitted the paper.<p>There is no statement at all of how to reconcile &quot;approved for submission&quot; with &quot;didn’t meet our bar for publication&quot;, which probably means that there is no reconciliation, and the cancellation was done outside normal process.')
