You can only make $x flying between ports, but now you can make $5x or $10x. It&#x27;s not that you&#x27;re stealing from the robots, you&#x27;re just making use of a resource that can be put to profitable use.<p>People are the same -- just another kind of resource, a black box that lets you make $5x. And the thing is, you deserve the $5x -- you took a system where nothing was being put to its best use, and now it is.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is I&#x27;ve worked on many projects that sucked because no one had the vision and hiring skills the IntelliJ people do, and if society could give someone a billion dollars to make every project work that well, it would be a good deal.')
