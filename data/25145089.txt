We were inspired by the idea of laser microphones as an audio eavesdropping vector, and tried to find a way to use LIDARs similarly, even though they&#x27;re not designed for this purpose at all.<p>In the near future, what I think is scarier is the possibility of executing the same attack through self-driving cars LIDARs. Perhaps this would allow attackers to spy on conversations in cars that are driving beside you or stationary next to you at traffic lights.')
