In fact, I bet it would probably end with a large majority of people reading the first 10 pages of Plato&#x2F;Socrates&#x2F;etc., getting confused by the utter lack of context, and giving up. That&#x27;s what I did the first couple times I &quot;tried to get into philosophy.&quot; It took me getting to undergrad philosophy classes to really &quot;get it.&quot;<p>At the very least, if you&#x27;re going to go for primary sources, find a guide or lecture to lead you through it. Of course primary sources are important to read in philosophy, but in my personal opinion, I would recommend going for an introductory text first and picking primary sources to read from there.')
