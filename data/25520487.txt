Could the the result be attributed to something unique to loperamide&#x27;s molecular structure versus traditional opioids? Again not an expert on this topic, but looking at the molecular structure of loperamide compared to organic derived opioids (opium, heroin, codeine, etc) or synthetic opioids like oxytocin, loperamide&#x27;s molecular structure is markedly different. Could there be some other factor at play here?')
