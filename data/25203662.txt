I got frustrated and fedup waiting on the G Screen Spacebook and Project Valerie so one day I decided to just get on with making it myself. I am expected to respond to alerts for the many customer systems I manage so I usually have monitoring panels from Cisco, PRTG, Rapid7, Okta, Solarwinds, Vectra AI, open at the same time all day. Suffice to say this gets really stupid on a laptop with one screen especially when you sometimes have to spend whole days at customer sites or in the data center.<p>- Due to immense interest from people in the finance and content creation industries I decided to build these to specification.<p>- One crucial objective was that all the screens should slide out of the main chassis as this facilitates easy setup and folding down when leaving a customer site.<p>- The screen in the keyboard allows me test touch screen apps I&#x27;m writing for linux for another project that will be revealed shortly. The palmrest screen was originally designed to also support a WACOM pen but I&#x27;m still working on that.<p>- The tiny screen on the bezel is not connected to the GPU. It is connected to an Arduino micro controller and provides additional stats on battery life and system resource usage.<p>- YES to my surprise there are many digital nomad types, film studios, CEOs and other execs who are very interested in our prototypes.<p>- The battery in the Aurora 7 can be considered a mobile UPS however we are still working on that aspect. One of the big  problems we have is Airplane regulations regarding the max Watt Hours for Lithium batteries...<p>There have been a few prototypes before this one and our latest that will be revealed shortly features various improvements.')
