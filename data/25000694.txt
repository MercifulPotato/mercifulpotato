(If God exists, and we can know him, what <i>else</i> should life be about?)  And by &quot;knowing&quot;, I don&#x27;t mean knowing information or theology.  If God is <i>someone</i>, instead of just <i>something</i>, it&#x27;s about knowing him as <i>someone</i> - a relationship.<p>But if God isn&#x27;t actually there, that&#x27;s all futile.  The biggest thing would then be the universe - physics, maybe?  But humans are personal, and an impersonal universe is cold.  So I would say, if not God, then human relationships.')
