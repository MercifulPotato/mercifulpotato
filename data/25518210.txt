I used Freetrade and they delay all free trades until 3pm the next day. Obviously they are doing some nonsense to make a tiny bit of money from that, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me any more than the 0.5% duty does because I&#x27;m not idiotic enough to make short-term trades. Just put the money in, forget about it and take it out years later. 0.5% will be irrelevant.')
