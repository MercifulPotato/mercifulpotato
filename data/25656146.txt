Insurance companies are better  labeled “managed care organizations” (MCO).<p>They offer services for adjudicating services and prices for self insured and non self insured clients.<p>Self insured clients would be governments (Medicaid, Medicare, large corporations that can afford to pay for all of the healthcare).  Non self insured are clients like smaller companies and people on healthcare.gov that pay insurance premiums, but are not liable for the entire amount of healthcare.<p>In the event the MCO is administered a self funded plan, they are simply following rules laid out by the payer.  The payer (usually government) can come in and audit the MCO anytime and penalize them for approving healthcare that the payer deemed outside the scope of the rules.  This works out quite well for the payer, as the MCO serves as the fall guy and takes the heat of being a “bad actor” and denying people healthcare.<p>The reality is that healthcare in the US is rationed, and MCOs are tasked with rationing it.  The government gets to avoid being blamed for denying care.')
