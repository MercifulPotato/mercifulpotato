Plenty of people with degree and experience coasted on nothing, or have personalities so abrasive as to make working with them all but impossible. Disappointingly I have poor experience with degrees actually instilling any sense of diligence, or even research capabilities, thus making them questionable even when recruiting for fields such as R&amp;D, where it should be truly an obvious choice. At least a retrained nurse has some basic curiosity and a critical eye, though it&#x27;s a bit of a shame, what with the nursing staff shortage.<p>And, also personally, I&#x27;ve had great experience with people who migrated from absolutely unrelated fields (e.g. several people who retrained - within same company - from support into software development). Similarly I had great experience with fresh interns turning out to be brilliant theory people.')
