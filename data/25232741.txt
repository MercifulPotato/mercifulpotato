There is exactly 1 mass you can accelerate to any speed you want. YOU. Time dilation canceling out acceleration from the external perspective is why it looks like externally that it takes infinite energy to reach C. Light travels at C and thus experiences zero travel time. Things going slower than C will experience &quot;some&quot; travel time. Not 1 year per lightyear.<p>On the ship it is locally Newtonian the entire way. Sure your destination and origin are doing weird gymnastics out the view screen, and the radiation is getting a bit energetic, but if you have the fuel and willingness to take Gs, you can travel any distance in any subjective amount of time. There exists a fuel budget (a lot) (at overwhelming Gs) to reach another star in 5 minutes.<p>&gt; In addition, every bit of radiation arriving from the direction of travel will be turned into high energy gamma radiation and cook you something fierce real quick; not to mention dust or tiny rocks that would release the energy equivalent of a thermonuclear explosion upon impact.<p>This is a very real problem I offer no solution to other than adding shielding budget to the tyranny of the rocket equation. &quot;warp drives&quot; might offer a solution to this problem but all flavors of reactionless drives are currently SciFi. &quot;If you have enough fuel&quot; here likely means &quot;a couple Jupiters worth of hydrogen that you fuse at perfect e=mc^2 efficiency&quot;')
