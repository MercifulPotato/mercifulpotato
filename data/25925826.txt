When I hurt my elbow, a &quot;rollermouse&quot; was my savior. It&#x27;s absolutely no movement of my elbow. My fingers are resting on the keyboard, I move the bar using my thumbs, or if more precision is needed I bring down one index finger. But my palms don&#x27;t move at all. (Not like their press photos where they have moved their whole hand..)')
