I&#x27;ve recently found that my stubbornness has resulted in me investing in alternative solutions to my problems that are hand-tailored to exactly what I want. Some examples:<p>- I take notes profusely, but I&#x27;m dissatisfied with every note taking app. I have rigged up Typora (a Markdown editor) to an Alfred workflow to build exactly the solution that I want. I guess Alfred is the &quot;saving grace&quot; here.<p>- I can&#x27;t find a good podcasting app (I want to listen on my Mac, not on my phone). Eventually I just settled on The Old Reader subscribing to the podcast RSS and download the files manually to play in VLC. Works great, if you don&#x27;t want a seamless UI.<p>- I, like I&#x27;m guessing everyone in this thread, have a very customized terminal shell. The customization environment here is thriving more than ever before and doesn&#x27;t show signs of being trampled by any integrated solution.<p>What&#x27;s the common thread? GUIs. GUIs are hard to make customizable, and the returns on doing so rapidly diminish with the number of non-power-users. If you discount GUIs, there&#x27;s tons of customization to be had on your computer right now.')
