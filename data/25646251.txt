Remember how cell phone plans used to be metered by the minute for talk and you had a different allocation for nights and weekends. Now even cheap prepaid plans in the US offer unlimited talk. When Sri Lankan infrastructure improves and their economy grows plans like this will be a thing of the past.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slt.lk&#x2F;en&#x2F;broadband&#x2F;packages" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slt.lk&#x2F;en&#x2F;broadband&#x2F;packages</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slt.lk&#x2F;en&#x2F;broadband&#x2F;data-addons&#x2F;meet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slt.lk&#x2F;en&#x2F;broadband&#x2F;data-addons&#x2F;meet</a>')
