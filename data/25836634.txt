If something doesn&#x27;t feel right, back off, let your body recover.<p>But during events? Whether it&#x27;s the big through-hike or that marathon or the ironman, you <i>need</i> the ability to push past the pain and suffering, and learn that your body is better than you think at fixing itself. It&#x27;s effectively impossible to injure yourself in a permanent way, I promise you.<p>Few marathon runners will run a full marathon during training, even at slower paces. Before I ran my first one, the longest training run I ever did was about 35km, with most runs below 25 (for comparison, a marathon is 42.2km). The sheer amount of suffering you&#x27;ll endure during those last 7.2km is probably the worst you&#x27;ll ever feel in your life, but slowing to a walk or dropping out at that point is ridiculous.<p>Like the author said, having the mental fortitude to tough it out when the going gets tough is what separates athletes from wannabes -- and knowing the difference between &quot;this is just a training run&quot; and &quot;this is the event I&#x27;ve been preparing for over the last 12 months&quot; is key.')
