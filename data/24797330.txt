They claimed that as more people signed up, the proportion of bad actors would decrease [0], which makes no sense to me.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not entirely sure what methods they have taken to stop a bad actor from collecting packets from other users that are routed through the bad actors exit node.<p>The worst thing IMO is the way it&#x27;s being presented and marketed. The impression the website gives is that its just like all other VPNs but free, which is very misleading.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Ubuntu&#x2F;comments&#x2F;f5y6qg&#x2F;update_launching_free_fast_anonymous_vpn_w&#x2F;fi2jxja&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Ubuntu&#x2F;comments&#x2F;f5y6qg&#x2F;update_launc...</a>')
