I’ve been using it to document 3 types of things for the projects.<p>1. Code guidelines, which anyone can contribute to and we can discuss&#x2F;review them via PRs. As each note is a small rule or idea, it’s easy to reason about. It aids discovery for new team members, but early days to test that bit out.<p>2. Application implementation patterns. I’ve added small notes in the codebase to outline how concept work, state management, styling, types, etc. Relevant to the codebase, but not specific to any individual code file.<p>3. DevOps playbook. I’ve been working on this in the past week and having it in a Zettelkasten format has been very beneficial to fill it out with the most important aspects. The set of markdown files covers how to do deployment, how we do security, backups, etc. Would love to turn that into a blog&#x2F;video series when I’m done - which probably shows the power of having knowledge that is very reusable.')
