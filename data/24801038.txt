Item(by='mercer', descendants=None, kids=[24802802], score=None, time=1602858018, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24793170, text='Yeah, well, fuck the whole thing.<p>So this guy fired a college buddy who chose to work for him instead of a better-paying job. &quot;I believed in you&quot;. And the story just moves on, like it&#x27;s a colour detail to the whole thing?<p>Does this person get a royal severance package? Does the struggling CEO help them land on their feet? That&#x27;s the kind of stuff I want to know.<p>With those little details left out, it&#x27;s just another powerful individual complaining about how hard it is to be powerful and wealthy.<p>I&#x27;m trying to think of ways to make this comment more even-keeled and less likely to be downvoted, but I honestly can&#x27;t. This kind of stuff bothers me to my bones, and while I definitely support this guy being honest, so much, because I do care about mental health, I can&#x27;t get past the &quot;here&#x27;s my hero story, forget about the consequences for the small guys&quot; aspect of it.')
