They&#x27;d just reach out to the N people that seem best at a quick glance, say &quot;hey come get your vaccine&quot;, and repeat as new shipments come in until everyone&#x27;s vaccinated. That bias towards doing things, rather than going to laborious efforts checking plans against everyone who might be affected, is exactly why they can do things so fast.')
