Australia bugged the East Timorese government offices to get an unfair advantage in the negotiations.<p>The East Timorese government found about this, and then sued Australia in the Permanent Court of Arbitration to have the treaty invalidated.<p>An Australian intelligence agent (&#x27;&#x27;Witness K&#x27;&#x27;), who knew about the bugging, contacted East Timor&#x27;s lawyer – Australian Bernard Collaery – offering to testify for East Timor.<p>The Australian government responded by cancelling Witness K&#x27;s passport to stop him from testifying, raiding the offices of East Timor&#x27;s lawyer, and now both of them are on trial – in secret.')
