It works: we can&#x27;t have another 4 years of Donald Trump. If it looks like he might win, we can attack the legitimacy of the vote and install Biden instead.<p>Of course, if <i>Biden</i> wins in a landslide on Nov 3rd (which seems increasingly likely), then the legitimate media will announce him as the winner immediately, and none of this will be necessary. Better safe than sorry thoughâ€¦<p>&gt; <i>keep campaigns from drumming up any kind of fear about the election results</i><p>The goal is to keep Trump from doing this, while legitimate media promotes Biden unopposed (regardless of the vote totals). I also will not be surprised if Trump is suspended from Twitter immediately after the election, and any &quot;this election was rigged!&quot; content from Trump&#x27;s people on YouTube to also be banned.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Colour_revolution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Colour_revolution</a>')
