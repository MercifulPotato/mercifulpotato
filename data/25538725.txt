You fixed something from the immediately-buildable tarball that you&#x27;d rebuilt and tested, or even something that didn&#x27;t need a rebuild (config, doc, interpreted source), and sent the change, perhaps using M-x diff-backup.  You didn&#x27;t have pull 100Mb of git stuff, figure out how to rebuild the build framework, find you hadn&#x27;t got the submodules, prat about with a pull request, and then whatever demands it makes of you, etc.<p>I was fine with that as a maintainer too, on three very active major projects at one time (using a 48Mb Pentium 1).  A maintainer&#x27;s job is partly to make it easy for contributors, not for the maintainer, but tending the contributors will help in the end.')
