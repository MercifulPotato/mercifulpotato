Nobody would want to buy and set up Tivos or Slingboxes and LAN setups  and all just to turn their existing cable subscription into a Netflix subscription when they could just buy the streaming subscription separately.<p>Sure, the cable companies could&#x27;ve theoretically made Netflix streaming before Netflix did - and the broadcast networks kinda-sorta-tried-this with Hulu - but that had nothing to do with their ad load increasing over time. Hulu was way more convenient than watching the same shows on cable <i>even with ads still!</i> But to go all in on a reinvention towards streaming would&#x27;ve been a huge gamble even seeing the streaming train coming right at them.')
