They seized on it because they&#x27;re convinced that we hate them. They seize on any signal and tell each other, over and over, that it&#x27;s Democratic policy.<p>And now they&#x27;re right. They&#x27;re ignorant fucks, and I&#x27;m done reaching out to them. Time for them to reach out to me. They can shove their snowplow where the sun don&#x27;t shine. They can stop voting for the people who <i>do</i> use hateful language, over and over, as policy.<p>They just turned out to vote for a person who was demonstrably incompetent, and their visions of his opponent were delusional -- he never once called them any of the things you say. Until they stop doing that, they will remain correct that I have no respect for them.')
