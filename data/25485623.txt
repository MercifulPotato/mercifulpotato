This is the cause of rampant inequality, rampant mental illness caused by stress and feelings of meaninglessness and powerlessness, ecological destruction and so on.<p>The problem is Capitalism and the related mindless obsession with GDP. Degrowth economics in the form of an ecologically-sane post capitalism, is the only way humans can thrive again, and probably the only way we can survive as a species. This would not mean no work, it would mean our economics were in line with our needs as a species and planet.')
