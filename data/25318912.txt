It took _years_ for non-Apple alternatives to materialize.<p>Ironically this is now somewhere they could stand to improve.<p>The MacBook displays are excellent, particularly when it comes to colour reproduction, but for the past several years they default to a scaled display mode. For anyone not familiar, the frame buffer is a higher resolution, and scaled down for the display, trading sharpness for screen space.<p>Evidently the drop in sharpness is imperceptible to most people, but I can certainly tell, to the point where I forego the extra space and drop it back to the native resolution.<p>For a company that generally prides itself on its displays, I think the right option would be to just ship higher res panels matching the default resolution.<p>They have also done this with certain iPhone displays over the years, but at 400+ppi itâ€™s well within the imperceptible territory for most people. For the 200-something ppi display on the MacBooks, not so.')
