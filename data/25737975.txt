Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=[25738099], score=None, time=1610402505, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25735276, text='Exchanges generally like (and provide incentives to) orders that add liquidity, which means orders that do not execute immediately. HFT orders are generally intended to not execute immediately, so exchanges would tend to like them. Of course, HFT also usually pays higher connection fees to get closer to the exchange, which probably doesn&#x27;t hurt their relations with the exchange.<p>The dark pools that HFT firms setup to trade with retail investors are probably less enjoyed by the exchanges, but at the same time, it does reduce load at the exchange, so maybe  it&#x27;s mixed because it reduces the exchanges&#x27; income from commissions, but also reduces their expense from operations.<p>Padding orders by a random amount doesn&#x27;t really discourage racing to get their first; if it&#x27;s a uniform random, across all orders, you still want to get there first, which means you still want to get your order there quickly; and depending on implementation, you might break your order up into many smaller orders, so that some of them get there with less delay. If you wanted to disincentivize speed, what you really want to do is group orders that arrive in a given interval and treat them as arriving at the same time; you could do that with fixed intervals (1 minute, 1 second, 100 ms, whatever) or adaptive intervals based on the number of orders over the last interval, or randomly, if you like random.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen from selling employer stock over the years, the commissions have gone down (to zero), and the bid&#x2F;offer spreads have gone down, and both are due to HFT firms, so as far as I can see, HFT is helping me. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in execution speed, trading always seemed pretty fast, as long as I was able to setup the order via the browser.')
