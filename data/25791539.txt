Programming is massively over-complicated for no useful reason.<p>What are you trying to do?<p>Say I&#x27;m Santa and have a list of names in &quot;naughtynice.lst&quot;, in the format<p><pre><code>  Joey Bloggs,train,nice\n  Johnny Doe,car,naughty\n  Mary Lamb,car,nice\n</code></pre>\netc<p>I can get my shopping list by simply creating a file on my machine<p><pre><code>  my $i = 0;\n  my $toys = {};\n  my $coal = 0;\n  while (&lt;&gt;) {\n    chomp;\n    my ($name, $toy, $nice) = split(&#x2F;,&#x2F;);\n    if ($nice eq &quot;nice&quot;) {\n        $toys-&gt;{$toy}++;\n    } else {\n        $coal = $coal++;\n    }\n  }\n  \n  print &quot;$_: &quot;.$toys-&gt;{$_}.&quot;\\n&quot; foreach keys (%{$toys});\n  print &quot;coal: $coal\\n&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nand then typing<p><pre><code>  perl test.pl naughtnice.lst \n</code></pre>\nto run it. Python I assume is similar. I&#x27;m fairly sure that OSX comes with perl, python and bash if nothing else.<p>Now you could say that you don&#x27;t like the syntax of perl, or python, or basic, or java, but actually knocking up a quick program and running is no harder than writing that same code in some hidden part of excel')
