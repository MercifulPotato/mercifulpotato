That said, how weird is it for someone like myself (late thirties, healthy, no direct contact with any human being) to just... wait it out? I am not too eager to be among the first humans to take a rushed vaccine.<p>So, how rushed is this vaccine? Is there any precedent with other vaccines that were developed this quickly? Is there a known risk, or is the risk simply unknown?')
