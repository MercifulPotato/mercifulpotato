My entire childhood and teenage years were dominated by Rush Limbaugh&#x2F;Charlie Sykes&#x2F;et al on the radio and Fox News on the television (<i>always</i> Fox News). Did NPR&#x2F;CNN&#x2F;etc exist? Sure - but I (literally) didn’t know anyone who listened&#x2F;watched them until college.<p>This idea that conservatives are being crushed under the boot of “liberal” media feels like a cop-out. Conservative politicians could have gone big tent in the 80-90’s, but they didn’t. They focused on consolidation of a specific demographic and are now in a kerfluffal because that base is becoming a cultural minority.<p>Edit: also - the resentment <i>was always there</i>. Go listen to Rush in the 90s. Nothing about what conservatives are complaining about is new.')
