That clears up some details.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ll be honest, we&#x27;re working to make the ToS more clear as we&#x27;ve learned about other use cases. We mean to say, Minors need a parents consent (credit card to book).<p>I know how tricky ToS can be, especially around safe access for minors. A lot of games I&#x27;ve run professionally have been at cons and events where kids could be present, and online signup&#x2F;registration tends to be one of the recurring hangups.<p>&gt; A bunch of our games aren&#x27;t in search because GMs use our tools for charging their customers and scheduling sessions, but for private groups.<p>This is an awesome use of the service, and it&#x27;d be great if that use case was made more visible up front as a selling point toward becoming a GM.<p>The pitch to GMs as it&#x27;s presented on the site is more about how the site can help to drive people to games, but if I already have players and my goal isn&#x27;t necessarily to expand my audience through discovery, then using this service solely as a front-end to handle private scheduling and compensation — and with the option to open it up if we want to add a player built in — sounds a lot more compelling.<p>For instance, I use Calendly to book and take payments, but it&#x27;s more rigid to work with as a group scheduling tool than I&#x27;d like — a business meeting isn&#x27;t quite as expected to have people join and leave a group meeting on a whim. I feel also like I&#x27;m paying for business-focused features and integrations I don&#x27;t use, while fighting against that design in order to connect it to VTTs and the like.')
