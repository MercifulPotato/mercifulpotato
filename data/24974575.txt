We believe the future is in tools that provide collaborative and explainable predictive power to decision makers.<p>The challenges involve building highly interactive and data intensive interfaces in a Simulation IDE, spanning the gamut from UX concerns through to low-latency compilers. On the server side we&#x27;re then providing services around on-demand computation, analysis, and compilation.<p>We&#x27;re currently 3 people, have recently secured VC backing (pre-seed) and are building out a core engineering team, with positions open on frontend and backend. Technology stack is TypeScript (Next.js), Rust, Hasura, and deployed on GCP.<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.sheetless.io&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;981287-frontend-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.sheetless.io&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;981287-frontend-engineer</a><p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.sheetless.io&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;985470-backend-engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.sheetless.io&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;985470-backend-engineer</a>')
