Mine was a single excel sheet, 30 minutes each. S for Sleeping, W for Work, D Drive, F Food eating &amp; cooking, N for Bathing Cleaning etc, F for Fun, W for Time Waste. Simple conditional formatting. Last column counted the Ws Fs Ns &amp; all. Next Sheet had some bar charts. My job was in Excel, so it was easy to log data. I used to use an A6 size simple printout to mark things. It was fun while it lasted, but I thought it was too much work.<p>Now, as I learnt Google Apps Script, can use a simple HTML app, with GAS to easily log the hours or time slots.')
