We then intercept the chalice deployed resources and feed them back into dependent terraform modules as inputs. It&#x27;s been incredibly smooth for us and we&#x27;re able to get deterministic environments that are easy to debug, modify and deploy. It takes a little imperative glue to manage dependencies, but the bulk of the configuration is declaratively defined and I&#x27;ve been incredibly happy with this workflow.')
