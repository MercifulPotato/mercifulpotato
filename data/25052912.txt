As for the rest of the keys on the top row, I was not in the habit of using them except in vim, where I hooked them up to some macros I had written.  For them, I kind of like the touchbar now, because I have the fake keys labelled with sensible names.  (No more trying to remember that I have to hit F3 to do such-and-such.)<p>I&#x27;ve also found the touchbar pretty useful in zoom calls, because my zoom client shows keys for common actions.<p>All in all, I think a physical escape key plus the touchbar is a slight win.  I would not pay more for it, but I have reversed my previous opinion that I&#x27;d pay more <i>not</i> to have it.<p>I suspect these new machines are going to be quite nice, although I won&#x27;t buy one for a while since I purchased a mbp a few months ago.')
