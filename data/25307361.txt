I have a hybrid with studded tires (specifically Nokian) and an internal hub. I&#x27;d also like to get a fat bike for fresh&#x2F;powdery snow, but it&#x27;s rare that&#x27;s a big deal. There&#x27;s of course some trade-off between how much traction&#x2F;stability your tires give you and how much friction &amp; inertia you have to work against when pedaling. Some people have a few different winter options so they can select the bike that will be easiest to propel but still be able to handle the particular day&#x27;s conditions.<p>It&#x27;s good to have warm clothes for your extremities, but your core gets surprisingly warm when you bike with any kind of coat on. I often just wear a think goretex jacket till it&#x27;s in the single digits fahrenheit. I wear winter boots, warm gloves or mittens (depending on how cold it is), and a balaclava or gaiter. Also ski goggles for really cold&#x2F;windy weather. If you don&#x27;t start off feeling somewhat cold, you&#x27;ve overdressed.')
