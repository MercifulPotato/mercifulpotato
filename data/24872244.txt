Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603476933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24870442, text='&gt; I can&#x27;t think of any way to give people more say based on how long they&#x27;ve been invested in a place that couldn&#x27;t also be trivially used for voter suppression.<p>I don&#x27;t think something like that necessarily needs to be some kind of constitutional mechanism.  It could be a social norm, kinda like the ones that discourage people from casually insulting others and which punish them if they do.<p>Though I suppose if you&#x27;re looking for a constitutional mechanism, clearly defined but longish residency requirements for voting probably wouldn&#x27;t fall under the category of &quot;voter suppression&quot; (which I take to mean policies designed to indirectly disenfranchise certain kinds of voters for partisan political advantage).')
