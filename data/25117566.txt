I won&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m on the side of the angels, but I&#x27;ll know I&#x27;m in good company and I&#x27;ll have heard both sides at levels roughly proportionate to the size of the population interested in defending each side.<p>In hindsight, I see how citing codes of conduct implies support for censorship, when my actual intent was simply to demonstrate another example of &quot;intolerance&quot; having noble goals.')
