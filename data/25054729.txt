Over time we want to be able to execute against Parquet files on disk.<p>However, for large scale analytics on huge data sets where you&#x27;re scanning all of it, we&#x27;ll likely push you to EMR or something like that. The nice part is that those big data systems can execute directly against the Parquet files in object storage that form the basis of our durability.<p>This is part of the bet we&#x27;re making compatibility with a larger data processing ecosystem.<p>Almost all of our use cases fall within what you can compute in memory on a single system (which is pretty much up to 1TB).')
