If I argue your religious beliefs than there&#x27;s a lower threshold for me being an asshole, and a lower expectation of being able to sway you.<p>Rather than religious &#x2F; non-religious the fundamental distinction is how open to debate and effectively changeable those beliefs are. It&#x27;s just that, empirically, religious beliefs are harder to sway. They also have greater protection under the law than non-religious beliefs.')
