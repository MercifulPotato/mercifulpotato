Item(by='PeterisP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609796669, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25638420, text='We&#x27;re looking at a target audience of people who already can  &quot;do quite bit with computers&quot;, know all the algorithms they need for the job they are going to do, and don&#x27;t really want to spend time on leetcode because they would rather be doing or learning something else, or perhaps they have done leetcode or stuff like that a lot ten or twenty years ago and they wouldn&#x27;t learn anything new, just re-adapt to do useless things quickly once again.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to denigrate it by labeling it useless - competitive problem solving&#x2F;&quot;sport programming&quot; is a fun activity and can be a rewarding hobby, but it&#x27;s important to recognize it as such, as a hobby that&#x27;s only tangentially related to most actual development work once you move above a certain base competency level ( I&#x27;ll grant it that it is useful for people without much practice in actual programming to do a bit of it.)<p>It&#x27;s a problem from the industry perspective if we as industry have many people spend a lot of time doing things that don&#x27;t benefit the employer (since grinding leetcode doesn&#x27;t make a non-junior person better at their development job, it&#x27;s an orthogonal skill) and  that doesn&#x27;t benefit themselves personally (we&#x27;re talking about people who don&#x27;t want to do leetcode just because they enjoy it) but only through the zero-sum game of competing for jobs effectively by &quot;peacock signaling&quot; of who invested&#x2F;wasted the most effort in leetcode. This is effectively a lose-lose competition, spending a lot of everyone&#x27;s time without a net benefit.')
