(I didn&#x27;t try with multiple monitors, but I did use the Settings app to change the scaling factor frequently.)<p>On OSX in contrast, if you change the display resolution in System Preferences, most apps do not automatically adapt, with the result that you have to close their windows, then re-open them before your system is usable. And at non-integral scaling factors, everything is blurry at least on the non-retina displays I tried. In constrast, there is zero blurriness in the apps I just listed in Windows 10 regardless of which scale factor is chosen in the Settings app. On a 1080p monitor, the choices are 100%, 125%, 150% and 175%.<p>Gnome also lets you choose the scale factor in increments of 25% and in a few months after more apps have been adapted to work &quot;directly&quot; with Wayland (without the intervention of XWayland) promises to be as slick as Windows 10 currently is. (In fact, I personally prefer Gnome because on Windows changing the scale factor by 25% can result the stems and lines of the letters becoming abruptly twice as thick, but I vastly prefer either to MacOS&#x27;s blurriness when the display is not being run at its native resolution, but again I had the luxury of being very choosy about which apps I used on Windows, relying mainly on a web browser and vscode.)')
