Build your own company.<p>I was with you until your last line. You don&#x27;t have to build your own company - you can simply go after a job at a company that understands how beneficial it is to align the incentives of its owners and employees.<p>There plenty of ways to give workers a piece of the pie: there are full-on co-ops (at one end of the spectrum), and there are more watered-down implementations like stock options, ESPP plans, etc., all of which allow the worker to take on some of the risk and share some of the gains.<p>Plenty of companies also distribute simple profit-sharing bonuses, which (arguably) don&#x27;t require the employee to take on any risk at all.')
