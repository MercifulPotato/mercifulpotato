Item(by='Minor49er', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603199575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836679, text='The book &quot;Men Without Work: America&#x27;s Invisible Crisis&quot; by Nicholas Eberstadt also points to this too. Even though it&#x27;s four years old, it uses BLS data to show the labor force participation rate and how it has been gradually declining for decades. There also isn&#x27;t a clear solution since there are so many different causes that contribute to the high number.<p>The Axios article is highlighting the problem, but is going about it in the wrong way by conflating terms and not offering any further insight into the issue. If they mentioned the participation rate or the types of measurement that you noted, it would be a much stronger piece. But I want to underline your point that the data is available and anyone curious should look at it to see the trends for themselves.')
