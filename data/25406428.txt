It is a great book, and Orwell was spot on with so much of what he wrote.  How did he do it?<p>I think I know.  I don&#x27;t think Orwell (Erik Blair) was writing a book about a dystopian future.  No.  I think he was writing about the dystopian present he was already aware of, and then projecting that a little into the future.  From personal experience with the BBC, he knew what news and history really were.  As a connected individual (allowed to finish his work on the private owned island of Jura) he was aware of the plans that were in place.<p>So, I don&#x27;t see 1984 as a dystopian vision of the future.  I see it as a far more straightforward projection of what was already in place.  We may be unaware of our prison, but Orwell was not - and was telegraphing it to us.<p>And most of us still do not get it, and cannot see it.  We are glad big Brother is making us wear masks to help us breath better, that we are keeping away from our families because of love, that we will be &#x27;cured&#x27; by a &#x27;vaccine&#x27;.<p>And if you draw attention to this around here, you won&#x27;t be thanked!  We&#x27;re not coding a harder, more impenetrable prison - we&#x27;re making a better future, right?')
