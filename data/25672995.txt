Item(by='bedhead', descendants=None, kids=[25673692], score=None, time=1610036683, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25672461, text='No fan of Trump and I try to be militantly centrist, but how is Trump&#x27;s baseless rhetoric about election fraud any different than almost every Democrat politician&#x27;s endless claims that Trump was [eye roll] a &quot;Russian agent&quot;?? Both claims are absurd, but how exactly is one &quot;incitement&quot; while the other is just normal course mainstream news?? Facebook of course provides no specific explanation about their decision. But how would calling the president LITERALLY a Russian spy not qualify as incitement under the same basic logic? I&#x27;m just getting tired of all the brazen double standards. It&#x27;s entirely possible to hate Trump and (a) not go completely overboard about what he does and (b) not pretend the left doesn&#x27;t also have some disturbing pathologies.<p>I&#x27;m sure this will get about a thousand downvotes...')
