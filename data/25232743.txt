Atheists are the only people qualified to discuss the American left&#x27;s receptivity to science, because the American right&#x27;s dual belief system (faith plus science) disqualifies them, as they have said out loud that they believe in the supernatural. Therefore if you are a part of the right lamenting the lefts refusal to consider the study, you are disqualified, respectfully, as you are from all critique of all receptivity to all studies because you overtly believe in the supernatural. If you are a conservative atheist, I am all ears. I am absolutely receptive to the study being true, but that begs the question, how can both the study be true and the world scientific leaders have a consensus that there is not only net new death, but significant net new death due to covid? What would explain the discrepancy? A well run conspiracy? I ask not in mockery but I genuinely want to know what explains the difference?')
