Aside from the size constraint (driven by the size of the battery and the height of the speaker,) the number of earring styles is not an issue (since the module is detachable.) Does that address what you were saying or did I completely miss what you were saying? Our plan is to introduce several styles on an ongoing basis much like any fashion brand. These earrings can be worn with our without the module.')
