If this is the case, keep your head down and apply to more places.  .95^30 &gt; 20% but .95^90 &lt; 1%<p>2) You&#x27;re not applying to the right places.  There are literally thousands of startups that would kill to hire a good, remote software engineer for $45K.  Take a look at workatastartup.com<p>3) You&#x27;re not actually a good programmer.  This may sound harsh, but some of us don&#x27;t have the points of reference to accurately determine how our skillset stacks up against others.<p>4) You&#x27;re not easy to get along with or manage.  When hiring for junior positions, companies are less likely to put up with jerks than for senior positions.<p>I realize some of this may sound harsh.  My intention is to help you.<p>My advice is to apply to startups and offer to work for free for a month.  Do this 3 times, and there&#x27;s almost no chance you will not get an offer if you&#x27;re good programmer who&#x27;s easy to get along with.')
