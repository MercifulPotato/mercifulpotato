This is a crazy statement to make. Guns are everywhere here in NYC and everyone who lives in an actual NYC neighborhood knows this.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in NYC my whole life. I always knew kids that had handguns, I knew people that sold them, I knew people that would buy them every chance one came on their radar.<p>I was at my local deli today and heard a 45 year old gentleman telling another older person about the new Smith &amp; Wesson they had for sale.<p>&gt; that crime rate is dropping lower and lower<p>That&#x27;s not really the &quot;crime rate&quot; that is dropping lower, but rather the number of crimes booked by police officers. Police spent months not responding to, nor intervening in, basically any crimes committed in NYC in 2020. The incidence of crimes committed against innocent citizens in NYC - as well as the gun crimes - all are rising dramatically, as anyone who lives here would be quick to tell you.<p>I am impressed with the amount of disinformation in this post, given how few words you actually wrote.')
