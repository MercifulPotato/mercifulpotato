The &quot;law and order&quot; brigade doesn&#x27;t seem to like &quot;order&quot; when it is imposed on them. And if that order is to stop posting misinformation in the form of crazy conspiracy theories that encourage stochastic terrorism, or racist violence, etc then online forums are well within their rights to moderate that content.<p>Taibbi doesn&#x27;t even talk about the biggest problem with these conspiracy videos: reinforcement bubbles. If you watch one, you will be shown more, and more and more, deep down the rabbit hole. I&#x27;m pretty sure if tech companies changed their algorithm to de-rank subsequent video suggestions of MOAR conspiracy theories, he&#x27;d again claim that they were putting their finger on the scale and that this would enrage Trump voters.<p>The thing is, social media is creating reinforcing but non-intersecting world view bubbles through AI suggestion mechanisms in their feeds, and unless that problem is fixed, you can&#x27;t just allow an infinite amount of this shitty propaganda to be posted, because it will have damaging effects, and none of the viewers will see any counter-claims, and by the time they finally get served a counter-claim, they&#x27;ll be so inside the bubble, they won&#x27;t watch it. Instead, they&#x27;ll go watch a reaction to it, that confirms to their existing opinion and soothes any triggering.  There there now, your worldview is safe.')
