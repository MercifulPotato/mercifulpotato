Satoshi needs to move coins or sign a message. That&#x27;s the only acceptable proof.<p>You claim Adam Back is compromised because the things he writes and does are so contrary to Satoshi and what he believed in that it&#x27;s the only explanation that would make a universe where Back is Satoshi make sense. I much prefer to believe (with better evidence, btw) that Back is just not Satoshi. Boom, no logical contradictions to resolve.')
