(not trying to sound snobby by the way, I just don&#x27;t praise books like these lightly or without good reason)<p>So I love Lord of the Rings, the Silmarillion, Martian Chronicles (and other Ray Bradbury books), Ursula K Le Guin(Earthsea), Kurt Vonnegut (Cat&#x27;s Cradle, Sirens of Titan, Slaughterhouse Five etc), Dune, Game of Thrones series, Neuromancer, Asimov (basically everything but especially Foundation series), Terry Pratchett, and so on...<p>And I consider Gene Wolfe&#x27;s work to be on a par with all of the above, and I would say he takes sci-fi to another realm. The Book of The New Sun is the first sci-fi series I read where I thought, &quot;this is literature,&quot; as in, comparable with books by Dostoyevsky and Hemingway, and I don&#x27;t believe this is hyperbole, it&#x27;s just that good.<p>The other amazing thing about The Book of The New Sun is that each time you read it you realize you missed about 100 things in the previous read-throughs, there is so much &quot;hidden&quot; in plain sight and the subsequent read-throughs are like reading a completely different book.<p>So just read it please.<p>Edited to include Le Guin as another example of &quot;genre fiction&quot; as literature.')
