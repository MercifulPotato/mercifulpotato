It&#x27;s easy to know what the coordinates of the cylinder are. It&#x27;s easy to project them however you want. Doing this doesn&#x27;t tell you much. For the actual problem, we also have to ask:<p>- Is the rest of the world seen normally, or is it &quot;not deformed by perspective&quot; either? If there&#x27;s no perspective for anything, most of what you see will just be blank white, the effect of the many different representations of different distant objects all overlapping one another in your vision.<p>- How are you &quot;looking at&quot; this cylinder? You&#x27;re not using your eyes.')
