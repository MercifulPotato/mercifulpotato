I always avoid new technologies for a few years to let the hype cycle mature (for example, everybody talking about how great mongodb is and writing blog posts about how they migrated, followed two years later by everybody talking about how terrible mongodb is and how they had to migrate to posgresql). As a dev working on a commercial software project, especially if you&#x27;re in leadership, you have to look very carefully at every technology you introduce into your stack, because you are going to be supporting it for years. If it turns out to be the wrong decision, or you get caught out by a bunch of edge cases that weren&#x27;t well known in the early days, you can end up losing millions of dollars in productivity, and possibly killing the company when you can&#x27;t fix bugs and ship new features. So I&#x27;ve been suspicious of GraphQL, but keeping an eye on it. I still don&#x27;t know if the productivity gains you get up front are actually technical debt in disguise, but if that turns out not to be the case, and it really is a matter of only having to write one query instead of making five requests and several dozen lines of types, validators, and async redux middleware, I&#x27;ll be happy to adopt it in the future.')
