So that you can still &quot;make it&quot; even if you don&#x27;t start out as rich, if you&#x27;re not white, or male. Basically, if you want to boil it down to slogans, it&#x27;s &quot;the American Dream for everyone&quot;. Or, equal opportunities – not equal outcomes.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why that is a immediate threat to democracy, free speech, or your way of living.')
