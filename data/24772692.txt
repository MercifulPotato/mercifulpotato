We didn&#x27;t yet have what we called &quot;glass teletypes&quot;, so we would &quot;post&quot; to a newsgroup by writing the post on paper and posting it in the sysadmin&#x27;s inbox (an actual box). He would type it in sometime during the day, and our leased-line connection would exchange messages with MIT several times a day. Each morning, the sysadmin would print out the previous day&#x27;s postings in each of the several newsgroups we followed. One stack of fan-fold, green-striped lineprinter paper for each newsgroup that we cared about (maybe 4-6). During the day, we would pass the &quot;newsgroup&quot; around the office like a daily newspaper.')
