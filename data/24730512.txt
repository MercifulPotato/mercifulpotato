The text makes it very clear that you know that C and C++ are separate languages, and that the archives actually contain separate grammar files for these separate languages. As they should.<p>From past experience I find &quot;C&#x2F;C++&quot; a very grating term. Back when I was reading comp.lang.c, &quot;C&#x2F;C++&quot; was used in questions by particular brands of people, who tried to compile C++ with a C compiler, or compile C with a C++ compiler, or use C++ features in what they thought was C, or in general were confused about the fact that there is no single language called &quot;C&#x2F;C++&quot;, but rather two separate, incompatible languages called &quot;C&quot; and &quot;C++&quot;. Anyway, wouldn&#x27;t it be good to not add to the (potential) confusion?')
