So almost all of this work is configuration and maybe some customization. We worked with another state that almost selected Deloitte but they bombed the no cost bake off and ultimately chose another vendor which completed 80% of the work during the bake off. This approach lowers risk dramatically and youâ€™re able to set an aggressive and a more accurate launch date.<p>I hope we see more govts adopting bake-offs for buying IT.')
