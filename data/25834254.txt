Pretending a problem doesn’t exist doesn’t make the problem go away. It makes you go away as you become irrelevant.<p>There is the AGPL, but it&#x27;s not quite right. It also has the letters G-P-L in it, which spooks a ton of people still influenced by Microsoft&#x27;s billion dollars worth of anti-GPL FUD. (I&#x27;m convinced you could just rename the GPL and all those problems would go away.)')
