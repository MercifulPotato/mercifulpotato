Item(by='tines', descendants=None, kids=[25085146], score=None, time=1605288561, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25084173, text='I appreciate your clarification, and for the record I am not one of the ones who downvoted you.<p>I agree that police being free to enter your house without probable cause of a crime is not good, and I&#x27;m not sure how many people are arguing that those who violate the quarantine should be put in psychiatric care. That just seems like nonsense, I&#x27;d have to have proof that someone is seriously advocating that before opining.<p>However, I think it&#x27;s acknowledged that in dire times such as war and pestilence, the government can temporarily do things it couldn&#x27;t do before until the crisis is over. For example, if an invading force has set up a machine gun on your property and the army attacks them, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be able to sue them for trespassing. On the other hand, we have a constitutional right not to be required to give quarter to soldiers. What&#x27;s the difference? It&#x27;s the duration and immediacy of the danger I think. This is a judgment call.<p>Of course the problem lies in the government usurping power for an unlimited or ill-defined time, such as for the &quot;war on terror&quot; which never ends.<p>The pandemic, on the other hand, should have a definite and quantitative end, and I don&#x27;t think stay-at-home orders or mask mandates necessarily lead to authoritarian progressions or curtailing of personal rights. Nobody is saying that the government should have a right to curtail, for example, the right to peaceably assemble forever; just until thousands of people per day stop dying.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong though, what do you think?')
