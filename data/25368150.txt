I am not saying you did. But I made an observation on how Biden was given a free pass when he literally not just passed racist statements but passed bills that incarcerated tens of thousands of Black Americans and destroyed families. Providing a counter-balance to the biased narrative is important in this day and age. Media is completely biased. So is Big Tech with its censorship. When all streams of information are openly supporting one side it becomes even more important to speak out the Truth. I wouldn&#x27;t have cared much if the media was evenly balanced. If it had taken both candidates to task. Had held both accountable. But the media has completely lost credibility. Even if I&#x27;ll end up being disliked and downvoted for it so be it! But if I feel something is wrong I&#x27;ll say it. No matter what people think.<p>&gt; As I said the fact that actual white supremacists, not from the media via their own boards, believe Trump is there guy tells you all you need to know.<p>This is truly ridiculous to be honest with you. I am a brown guy. Does my view count or only what white supremacists say count for you?')
