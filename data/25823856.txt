Prior to it I worked in both MATLAB (the IDE is so nice, and writing out matrix computations is just great) and Python (for ML). Julia is absolutely nicer to write in than either of the two. MATLAB is slow and at times feels less like a programming language and more like an incomplete and brittle interface with the JVM. Python is also slow, and it feels awkward to use given that it was not explicitly designed for scientific workflows. With Julia I get proper typing, incredible speed, easy parallelization, and a kick ass REPL.<p>The only thing I truly miss in using Julia is the plotting capacities of MATLAB. I haven&#x27;t found an environment that can match it in terms of interactivity. Give me the ability to (easily) save interactive figures for later use and Julia would be perfect.')
