Instead, when you go to access it, there will be a page fault if the page you’re trying to read hasn’t been read from disk yet. The kernel catches the page fault, allocates a page, does the read from disk, and restarts your read as if nothing happened. The user process has no indication that any of this happened other than perhaps a bit of latency.')
