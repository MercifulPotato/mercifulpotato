From someone that has never used flatpak it doesn&#x27;t seem more a mess than apt or the deb way in any way and also manages to have the unstable and stable version installed at the same time (which apt doesn&#x27;t as far as I remember).<p>Am I missing some hidden problem besides that it&#x27;s not available in the manager of choice?')
