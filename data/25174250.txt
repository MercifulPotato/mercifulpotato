TFA cites some research saying that it takes about an hour to completely acclimate to even the smallest of the standardized sizes they propose. I could sort of believe that you&#x27;d have not spent as much time stretching and might not be quite as flexible, but at the same time, I could also see you having had fewer hand injuries and being more flexible.<p>edit: I read more of the linked site. I no longer particularly believe that practice could make you better at reaching larger spans. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smallpianokeyboards.org&#x2F;pain-injury-and-performance-quality&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;smallpianokeyboards.org&#x2F;pain-injury-and-performance-q...</a>')
