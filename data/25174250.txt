TFA cites some research saying that it takes about an hour to completely acclimate to even the smallest of the standardized sizes they propose. I could sort of believe that you&#x27;d have not spent as much time stretching and might not be quite as flexible, but at the same time, I could also see you having had fewer hand injuries and being more flexible.')
