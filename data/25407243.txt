In terms of the results, it seems to me that many more data points are needed. My bubble escape route contained a lot of authors and titles I know of, I&#x27;ve read, or I&#x27;m very familiar with.<p>FWIW my sample trio were Dune&#x2F;Starship Troopers&#x2F;Sword of Destiny and results included a bunch of graphic novels (Preacher mostly) and mangas that I consumed in the past, a Harry potter series and a bunch of crime books that I also tried (and, often, didn&#x27;t find interesting). But there were some genuinely interesting picks too so, again, more data will probably help.')
