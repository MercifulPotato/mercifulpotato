Whole product uses async&#x2F;await or Promises and suddenly you have to switch to this baroque model just to write a test. Reusing logic between production code and tests is pretty much impossible.<p>Dynamic pages etc. often confuse cypress. I&#x27;m actually not a frontend developer, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of insight while exactly that is, but I just know that it has been a huge drag.<p>Other than that, it would be OKish. Being able to test the UI is great, but I would advice everyone <i>not</i> to base the whole testing strategy on it. It&#x27;s just too heavy, slow and unreliable. It doesn&#x27;t not scale even moderately with the product growing.<p>e2e testing is better done on API level, IMO.  You&#x27;ll want redesigns, changes of UX, and suddenly your changes will require updating tests, which otherwise (if done on the API level) would require no modifications.')
