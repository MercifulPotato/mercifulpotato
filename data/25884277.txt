We tried a great experiment letting anybody say anything with amplification of the masses. Based on the results of the great experiment (Qanon, Trump presidency, &quot;stop the steal&quot;, capitol riots) people want to pull back to the tried-and-true pre-web-2.0 journalism (i.e. gatekeepers).<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the invention of the printing press caused massive social change in Europe, and was not looked upon very kindly at the time by many.<p>I think the internet analogy writes itself, and I hope that we maintain the ability of humans to converse about what interests them regardless of how crazy they are.<p>Just remember kids, words are not actions. I can say that I&#x27;m gonna burn Y-combinator down (I don&#x27;t even know where it is, to be honest) but that is not the same as actually burning down their buildings. I worry that we&#x27;re conflating these two things too much in terms of what we see on the Internet.<p>And to be fair, the major driver of the craziness of the Republican party is TV and talk radio, not social media.')
