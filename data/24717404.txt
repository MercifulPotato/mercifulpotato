I&#x27;ve been on teams with people who were lazy or entitled or just bad at their job and didn&#x27;t care enough to change. I don&#x27;t want negotiate as a block with those people because if get less of I did. And frankly, I&#x27;d rather not work with them at all, because they&#x27;re just a pain in the arse to deal with.<p>I think unions make sense when every worker is basically the same (on a production line for instance). That&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t have any leverage otherwise.<p>Right now, my leverage is &quot;give me my bonus or I&#x27;ll go elsewhere and the only other guy on this team can&#x27;t code or troubleshoot for shit and takes every nfl game day off sick&quot;. At best, a union would make me share my bonus with him. At worst it would insist he got a bigger one as he&#x27;s been in this role for years (hint, that&#x27;s a BAD thing) and I&#x27;m newer.')
