Instead, because Wyoming has more Electoral ballots per person than larger states like California and Florida, a vote cast in Wyoming is &quot;worth&quot; about three times as much as one cast in those larger states.<p>A concern about removing the Electoral College is candidates won&#x27;t spend time campaigning in more remote, less populous states. A) We have broadcast media and the Internet, you don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of time in those states.
