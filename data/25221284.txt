It fast enough, easy to learn (we&#x27;ve had new people pick it up).<p>Its my goto for web development, with some of the frameworks, it seems to have a balance of control and automation I like.\nReally like symfony for its forms and twig templating engine. Symfony makes a lot of things easy, but is flexible enough when you want to change something. (We like writing native db queries with pdo). It has a package manager (only 1 really, which makes that choice easier)<p>I continue to poke around with react and view js but if I end up using one, I&#x27;ll just make synfony my json serving backend.')
