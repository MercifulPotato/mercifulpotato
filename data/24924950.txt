This program is almost entirely student-run. \n The club has a minority but not unreasonable percentage of girls (30%), including in leadership roles.<p>My ninth grader has been asked (as part of a grant proposal) to develop ideas to encourage more female participation.  When I search for online articles about this topic, they mostly seem to involve girls-only STEM activities, which doesn&#x27;t seem relevant here.   My main suggestion was to encourage an inclusive culture that is welcoming to participation from everyone  (avoiding behaviors like talking over people, dismissing ideas from new members, or hazing type activities).   Any other ideas from fellow HN readers about how to encourage girls to join and be engaged in technical high school clubs?')
