There&#x27;s no emergent gameplay. The world is simply a beautiful aquarium filled with schools of mindless, swimming NPCs.<p>Think about the rich interactions in Skyrim: you arrive in the town of Whiterun. Your inventory is full of junk so you drop some. A beggar picks up a discarded sword and excitedly asks you if he can keep it. Just as you say yes, a brood of vampires attacks! Peasants run for the hills, but your new friend and the nearby blacksmith joins your side and smashes them to bits with her majestic warhammer! The fight resolved, you decide you want that warhammer. So you wait for her to end her shift, head home, and fall asleep. In the dead of night, you steal into her home and snatch it for yourself. But her husband was awake and saw your robbery! The guards are alerted! You escape town with your life, but just barely. You decide to sleep off your wounds in a bedroll outside of town. But when you wake up, your eyes glow! You have fangs! You&#x27;ve become a vampire! So you decide...<p>I could go on. (Hell, I probably went on too long there.) Point being, Skyrim is flush with these unique experiences. Given CDPR&#x27;s claims, I really, really hoped we&#x27;d get at least a few mechanics for unique encounters. But the world CDPR created is a beautiful corpse.')
