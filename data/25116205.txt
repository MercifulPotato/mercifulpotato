The network effects are real, if it&#x27;s not on Strava it didn&#x27;t happen.<p>That said, the segment leaderboards are complete garbage. I really wish they&#x27;d make an effort to clean them up. There are sooo many feature requests that have been outstanding for many years.<p>I guess they have the metrics to back up the &quot;stickiness&quot; and don&#x27;t feel the need to improve the platform beyond making it more &quot;social&quot;. sigh.<p>Edit: I do also have a TrainingPeaks account for deeper data dives. I just wish Strava would address some of the concerns of it&#x27;s most passionate users.<p>Edit2: OMG, did they get rid of the feature request forum?? \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.strava.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;community&#x2F;posts&#x2F;360073566191-Feedback-about-our-Forum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.strava.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;community&#x2F;posts&#x2F;36007356...</a>')
