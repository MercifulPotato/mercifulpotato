We&#x27;re concerned about speech that is being amplified in a way where there&#x27;s a civic responsibility to ensure that the harmful messages are not being amplified.<p>So public speech should be further limited, provided <i>La RÃ©sistance</i> is still permitted to speak freely as we enter an era with an ever-increasing number of state-aligned location-aware microphones in homes, workplaces, vehicles, pockets and (on) wrists?<p>What could possibly go wrong in that scenario?')
