It didn&#x27;t seem nearly as hard as a lot of people said it was, and I was intrigued about in which ways it&#x27;s safer than C.<p>My best guess is that people are unfamiliar with ADA, unwilling to learn, and most of all believe that hiring will turn into a problem if they switch to ADA. Also they bring up the brilliant programmer theory.<p>The hiring problem seems superficially compelling.<p>There are indeed fewer ADA programmers out there, which of course is a chicken and egg problem if companies are not trying to adopt it.<p>Now the fourth argument often follows the third argument. My problem with it is that most of the programmers I&#x27;ve worked with that I&#x27;d describe as brilliant are the first ones to tell you that we should use a safer language, because they know even they make mistakes. And a lot of the brilliant programmers wouldn&#x27;t have trouble picking up ADA or learning something new.<p>So my answer would be that if you truly have brilliant programmers, you don&#x27;t need to worry about hiring. If you don&#x27;t have those brilliant programmers you really can&#x27;t afford staying with C because you will have huge costs from debugging and being sued for the bugs you didn&#x27;t find.')
