I see this from both the conventional left and right here on HN and elsewhere, probably because the monopolization of social media due in part to network effects tends to invite parallels between these networks and traditional utilities which have long been affected by laws such as net neutrality (and certainly the equivalent for electricity&#x2F;gas&#x2F;...) in many places. I don&#x27;t necessarily endorse bans on censorship on private social media platforms, and perhaps they are not a necessary result of this, but it fits into this mold of regulating social media companies with respect to a broader public interest rather than a sole focus on private ownership. A similar trend can be seen with GDPR or the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz in Germany [1].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Network_Enforcement_Act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Network_Enforcement_Act</a>')
