For the precise quote you mentioned I came up with somewhat format rules which prevented building a framework (code-wise) for this case study. The &quot;caveat&quot; you mention is just an explanation for the chosen ruleset; I believe I haven&#x27;t introduced any general-purpose DOM&#x2F;UI code in the case study and instead only describe patterns (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong!). I agree with your view of framework value as I professionally use React on a daily basis and will continue to do so, for similar reasons :)')
