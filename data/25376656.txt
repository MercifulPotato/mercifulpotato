Work just drained the enjoyment out of programming. What helped me is to get back to my side projects BUT to start really small. Pick a small project, even just a day or weekend build. For me, that sense of accomplishment, even though so many other people have made so much more amazing stuff than me, it made remember why I love programming. And when I start to get bored, I just force myself to watch a tutorial or two or add one small feature, and I get reminded again.<p>Of course, it could be you need to find a completely different hobby to fulfil you. Only you can say what position you&#x27;re in, whether you just need to reignite your passion for programming or whether it&#x27;s gone for good.')
