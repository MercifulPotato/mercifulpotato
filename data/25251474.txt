I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s better to be bothered by it than just exclaim &quot;ok it&#x27;s for science&quot; without any critical view. Anyway: it&#x27;s extremely common especially with mice. You&#x27;d be suprised by the total numbers (which might be hard to acquire having to sift through animal-rights but the order of magnitude should be correct; I&#x27;m guessing a couple of tens of millions rodents per year in the US is ballpark correct). A bunch of reasons like what a sibling commenter says but also because you can usually not use mice which were used for experiment A in experiment B exepcting A had no influence.')
