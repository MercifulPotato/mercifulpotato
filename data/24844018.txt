It proves that you’ve already completed their challenging interview process and it’s also assumed that you picked up some good engineering practices while working there.<p>However, pedigree alone won’t get you jobs at most places. You still have to go through the interview so they can see how you perform on a level playing field.<p>As much as online comments hate the coding challenge interview problems, they’re actually a great thing for people without impressive career pedigrees. It’s the only way you’re going to get to compete on a somewhat level playing field next to the kid who went to an Ivy League and landed all the right internships due to their parents’ connections.<p>Generally speaking, it’s the people who have jobs at well known companies who want to get rid of coding challenges and go back to hiring based on pedigree, mostly because it benefits them greatly and reduces their competition. In reality, anyone talented enough to work at top companies doesn’t have to study much for coding interviews. This idea that coding interviews are somehow filtering out brilliant engineers and selecting for less qualified people is largely a myth. The reality is that engineers just don’t like being challenged on the spot and would rather employers just trust their resume. That is, if they already have a good resume. The juniors love coding challenges because it’s a way to prove your skills without relying on pedigree or university or family connections.')
