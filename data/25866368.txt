For example, no elected federal politician is advocating for the nationalization of all private corporations, or elimination of all for-profit entities, or for a complete cap on individual wealth, or for giving Hawaii back to the aboriginal Hawaiians, or anything like that,<p>so, given this, that NPR is right-leaning, and bernie&#x2F;AOC are &#x27;centrist&#x27;, am I correct in your assessment that basically just about only bolshevism counts as &#x27;left&#x27;?')
