There&#x27;s a part of taxes that has to grow with the economy size because the service is provided by people and they need to be compensated at market rate. Say the army, education, etc. But of course there is a bunch of things the government does that should be getting cheaper, like administration of services, etc.<p>Its the problem with income-taxes, naturally government increases expenditures without need for legislation. It&#x27;s a bad rule. This is why I think government should be financed by flat-expenditures: sum of costs &#x2F; people and send a bill.  This framing would make government very sensitive to increase of expenditures.')
