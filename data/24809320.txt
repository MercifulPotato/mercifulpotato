It&#x27;s not like a for-loop where a &lt;= versus a &lt; can trigger an off-by-one-error.<p>To be in compliance with the license, you need to __substantively__ follow the provisions. If you and I sign a contract that I will build a house under terms carefully laid out in the contract, and I make a change from those terms which is not material and substantive (makes no difference to you), I&#x27;m not liable for anything. The kind of nits OP is pointing at would never fly in court.<p>From there, it isn&#x27;t a question of &quot;triggering provision&quot; and being &quot;liable.&quot; Liability is calculated in terms of damages. Damages aren&#x27;t set to hurt people, but to make things right. If I sell you a defective car, damages are what it takes to fix or repair that car, not ten million dollars. If I use a different type of flooring building your house because the type you wanted was sold out, a court would rule on the difference in value; you can&#x27;t just refuse to accept the house. This becomes really important in commercial law.<p>All of the example OP brings up, if they were in fact problems (and they&#x27;re not), they would have damages of $0.00. There is no liability, so they&#x27;re okay. That&#x27;s how you interpret contracts. Lawyers read, write, and follow contracts with how they&#x27;ll be interpreted in mind.<p>And from there, every other sentence is just technically wrong. E.g.: &quot;Due to its nature, the AGPL is an EULA, not a free software copyleft license&quot;<p>I could write a 30 page paper on the holes there, but at the core, what&#x27;s missing is a basic understanding of how commercial law works. Without that common understanding, it&#x27;s like trying to convince your grandma, who has never touched a computer before, about how Facebook&#x27;s algorithms work. It&#x27;s hard. It requires a common base of knowledge which OP doesn&#x27;t have. At that point, you&#x27;re better off advising people to either take a class in basic business law, or to talk to a lawyer.<p>Actually, a better analogy than Facebook might be data structures in git. Eben Moglen, who wrote the AGPL, is one of the more brilliant legal scholars alive today. That&#x27;s much like a person who&#x27;s never used a computer before trying to poke holes at Linus&#x27; hash DAG structure.<p>At some point, you either have to trust the competence of experts, or you have to educate yourself.')
