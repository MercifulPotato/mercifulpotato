Woz claims somewhere that without naps, his brain is at 60% or somesuch second half of day. Same for me (likely even worse since I usually don&#x27;t get enough night sleep).<p>One reason I never want to work for a normal company is that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to take naps. Not sure how I&#x27;d survive that.<p>One note for anyone reading this wanting to try naps: the <i>timing</i> matters a lot. Woz recommends napping around 7-8  \nhours from waking, NOT at a fixed time of day.

For me, I usually take a nap between 5-7 hours from waking.<p>If you use supermemo&#x2F;are interested in it, it has a thing called sleepchart (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermemo.guru&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SleepChart" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermemo.guru&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SleepChart</a>) in which you can log sleep data and then see some cool graphs spit out (if you also use supermemo for learning, you can very cooly see correlations between sleep and repetition grades).')
