However, the point that vehicles are acceptable even though they cause vast deaths, yet for some reason if one thing someone doesn&#x27;t like causes hardly any deaths, they can strongly condemn anyone being allow free speech and create a slippery slope.<p>If you were to add automobile accidents in all other countries combined with the US figures, you do get obviously a much higher figure. Automobile accidents are very high up on the list of cause of death.<p>(The article also only takes into account US traffic deaths since 2000 being greater than both world wars, and of course there were magnitudes more deaths going back to the 1970s, likely in the earlier decades as well I wasn&#x27;t trying to be super pedantic, which is why I&#x27;ll still leave my above post intact.)')
