Item(by='JasonFruit', descendants=None, kids=[25778871], score=None, time=1610643530, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25778199, text='&gt; Adtech is a cancer and it&#x27;s time to cut it out using every legislative and regulatory option we have.<p>That attitude is the problem: why do we go straight from &quot;This is a problem!&quot; to the government?  Aren&#x27;t there solutions other than making things illegal?  Is it just because making things illegal is easier than talking to our neighbors and friends, and giving them peaceful solutions to their problems, doing business locally, and refusing to do business through online ads that use techniques that lead to results like this?<p>People who call for insurrection are usually plenty aware of where to get things like this anyway. It&#x27;s a bad look for Facebook, sure; but are these ads likely to do real harm? I doubt it.  There&#x27;s plenty of time for sensible people to make a difference without creating more anger by trying to make even more restrictive laws.')
