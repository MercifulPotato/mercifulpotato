But in the end, so long as you can check out any revision (i.e. the repo is functional) then migration should also work, as should updating the repo format to the latest svn repo format. I assume the upgrade to a recent svn format is what&#x27;s blocking?\nEven so, worst case it should theoretically be possible to do a looped checkout+commit from svn to git. Metadata such as commit dates can be rewritten later if needed.')
