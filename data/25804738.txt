Apart from IP rotation theory, I heard that some ISP billing software requires a session reset to flush network statistics to a billing database, because it is accumulated in RAM. They have to do that to block&#x2F;divert clients whose account reaches a limit, because you don’t normally upload payment info to your firewall&#x2F;proxy and only check it for new sessions. (I’m not an ISP guy and this may simply be an urban legend from 90&#x27;s)<p>My experience partially confirms that. I had an ISP who would redirect every syn packet on 80&#x2F;443 to internal “low money” site in the night, but I had to reset my router after sending them money, cause otherwise that crippled session got stuck at their hardware until next autoreset.<p>1 minute may be a technical pppoe cleanup&#x2F;reconnect timeout. Some shitty ISPs reset this timeout even for unsuccesful attempts, and this deadlock can last for half an hour until e.g. a router decides to back off for a while. Could be cured by turning it off for 3-5 minutes to cool off the ISP side. It’s rare these days.')
