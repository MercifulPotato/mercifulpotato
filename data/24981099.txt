This function:<p>1) Obtains the image width and height from the header as 32-bit integers.<p>2) Truncates the obtained values to 16 bit and stores them in a\n`TT_SBit_Metrics` structure.<p>3) Uses the truncated values to calculate the bitmap size.<p>4) Allocates the backing store of that size.<p>5) Passes `png_struct` and the backing store to a libpng function.<p>The issue is that libpng uses the original 32-bit values, which are saved in\n`png_struct`. Therefore, if the original width and&#x2F;or height are greater than\n65535, the allocated buffer won&#x27;t be able to fit the bitmap.&quot;<p>This one could only happen in an memory unsafe programming language. Having bounds\nchecks on the destination buffer would have avoided the problem.')
