Item(by='mcintyre1994', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605035727, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25049079, text='The 13&quot; Macbook Pro lineup looks pretty weird on their store now, at least in the UK.<p>The M1 with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD is at £1299, with a 512GB SSD option at £1499. To bump the RAM to 16GB is another £200(!), so £1699 for 16&#x2F;512.<p>The Intel options are £1799 for 16&#x2F;512 or £1999 for 16&#x2F;1024. So on the Intel side they seem to have cut out 8&#x2F;256 options, and then they&#x27;ve re-introduced them for the M1 only - which makes the M1 look like it has a much lower starting price. It is cool if 16&#x2F;512 M1 is £100 cheaper with more power and better battery life though. Intel can of course still increase the memory to 32GB (for £400 lol).<p>The other downside is only 2 ports on the M1 ones, Intel have 4.')
