While I don’t consider it an insult like you seem to, I agree I like to be hyper precise when I can, and this can be off putting to many. I’ll be less precise.<p>I agree with you. All people should be treated fairly!<p>I hope we can soon live in a world that uses “one person one vote” for all societal decisions, that seems most fair to me.<p>However, whatever your politics might be, please understand: A true “one person one vote” does also mean that both the Senate and the Electoral College need to be rectified.')
