There is money to be made in trying to tear Apple down.  That’s just part of the dynamics of the attention economy.<p>Whether this is <i>just</i> a function of spending on marketing, seems highly unlikely.<p>My understanding is that Google and the Android manufacturers as a whole far outspent Apple in the early years of the iPhone, and didn’t end up with the same perception.<p>In any case, however it was achieved, we do agree that they are <i>perceived</i> differently to the other players, and this is what my comment is based on.')
