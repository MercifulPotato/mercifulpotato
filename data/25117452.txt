I&#x27;m a tech worker and she is not - we both really love the types of housing that&#x27;s available (and the pricing), but my biggest concern was what happens in 2-3 years when (hopefully) COVID vaccines are common and it&#x27;s less of a concern. If the jobs all move back to in-person, I doubt I&#x27;d be able to find suitable employment in Santa Fe. I&#x27;m no super fancy engineer with a big resume, so finding fulltime remote employment when it&#x27;s less popular and more competitive isn&#x27;t a guarantee. Ultimately we opted to not move because of it.')
