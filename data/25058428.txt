It could mean that more cows are farmed, the price of beef goes down, and therefore the demand goes up. It&#x27;s only if beef by-products are relatively worthless that your argument is justified, and from a quick search that doesn&#x27;t seem to be true at all - byproducts are worth 10-15% of the carcass [1].<p>Similarly, if commissioning new nuclear submarines is cheaper because the SMR research has already been done, then defence procurers can make a stronger case to buy more of them as opposed to other military technologies.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.farmprogress.com&#x2F;story-beef-byproducts-buoy-cattle-prices-9-122532" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.farmprogress.com&#x2F;story-beef-byproducts-buoy-catt...</a>')
