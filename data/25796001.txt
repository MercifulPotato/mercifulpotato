Unions can be seen as the backpressure on corporations mistreating the workers, which Amazon has become notorious for.<p>It&#x27;s one of those things businesses have to take into account when trying to compete.  You can abuse your employees to gain competitive advantage over your rivals, but in the long term such tactics tend to result in the formation of a union which is a major competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace.<p>It&#x27;s bad news for Amazon if they can no longer honor next day delivery for Prime members because of strikes at the warehouses.  The workers have some leverage with strikes.  It&#x27;s not like coal miners where strikes were rather abstract because the lights never went out.  This pain will be felt by the customers, and it&#x27;s not like there aren&#x27;t other businesses out there where you can mail order stuff.  Maybe not all from the same shop and maybe you have to pay for shipping, but if Amazon doesn&#x27;t know when it will be delivered because the product is in the warehouse and labor negotiations have stalled it&#x27;s a reasonable tradeoff.')
