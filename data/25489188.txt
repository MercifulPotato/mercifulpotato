And as a former teetotaler with relatively few mental problems who has spent the last six months playing hooky and getting drunk alone at home daily to help cope, with multiple straight friends doing the exact same thing, I&#x27;d be inclined to believe that statistic may even be a massive underestimate when you factor for people who don&#x27;t have a clinical-grade problem yet.')
