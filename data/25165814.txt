Sometimes I consider stop buying Apple products because if their super locked business model does not help developers and it does not support the open web. Google on the other hand with a pseud- open-source mind is not innocent, but again no company is perfect. Apple&#x27;s hardware and software integration provides a superior User experience IMHO, but at the cost of paying a high premium and being locked. On the other hand, Google being able to instantaneously provide an imense amount of useful information through their apps for free is also very handy, but again at the cost of losing our privacy and potentially being manipullated by advertisers, because if it is free you are the product. Perhaps the companies should find a balanced business model, but it also depends in people being aware of how much their time, money and privacy really cost.')
