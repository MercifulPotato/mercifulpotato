I don&#x27;t see why supermarkets wouldn&#x27;t offer this service and pocket the difference.<p>In the UK major food supermarket do deliveries or local collection.\nThey&#x27;re prepared by the supermarket staff in their warehouse, without having to browse the supermarket.\nThey&#x27;re quite reliable (you order online and you have to pick the products manually) but they will apply substitutions sometimes.<p>Collection is free if you order over a certain amount.<p>Covid messed up things (queues got super long &#x2F; expensive) but overall it&#x27;s a well working model.')
