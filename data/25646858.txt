I&#x27;ve been doing this for a a few years and definitely see some benefits:<p>1.  My dependence is way down, sometimes I go 2-3 days without caffeine and I&#x27;m fine.<p>2.  It gives me something to look forward to for certain days (quite needed in the pandemic)<p>3.  Allows me to stop fully without any side effects (I always take January off from caffeine)<p>4.  The caffeine high lasts about 6-8 hours with much higher productivity during this time.<p>5.  For me, the green tea doesn&#x27;t typically give me an anxious caffeine high.<p>I think caffeine intake is highly personal though.  When pushing this to an every day schedule, I definitely feel more addicted and dependent on it.  Once in a while (once every two months maybe) I&#x27;ll feel like the caffeine high tips into an anxious feeling which I hate.<p>For the record, I drink Honest Tea Moroccan Mint which has 56mg of caffeine.  Obama drinks Honest Tea Green Dragon Tea.')
