Whether you are Apple or not, you have to prioritize.<p>If you are doing 2 features, and cannot both well enough, then it&#x27;s better to do one (important) extremely well and one (less important) just to get by, than do two mediocre features. In the former case, you will get at least some happy users who will talk about you and hopefully get you more sales. In the latter case, nobody would vouch for you and mediocrity will drive you into oblivion.')
