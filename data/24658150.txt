You are right in that the language designers went to great lengths to maintain backward compatibility. So all my C++98&#x2F;C++03 skills are still relevant today. When i see kids say how &quot;modern and better&quot; is C++11&#x2F;xx i always reply, go read Coplien, Barton &amp; Nackman, Koenig to understand where it all came from. On the other hand the cognitive overload imposed by the new features is substantial and there is a non-trivial learning curve even for experienced developers. Beginners have even more difficulty getting started. Result? Everybody lives within their &quot;familiar subset&quot; of the language. So codebases can be in C++ and yet two different developers can have difficulty understanding each other&#x27;s codebase.')
