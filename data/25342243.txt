My wife has an O&#x27;Reilly membership through university which I already use, so I don&#x27;t really need books or access to books.<p>Is there some other thing (subscription, course, training, resources, online conference etc.) that&#x27;s worth a sniff for someone in Data Engineering &#x2F; Web Development? Looking more at the Big Data &#x2F; Data pipeline type stuff.<p>Not interested in certifications or anything like that. Tried Coursera but it&#x27;s not really my cup of tea.<p>Also based in Australia, so nothing too US-specific.')
