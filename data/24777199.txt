I know that over the next 30+ years my body will start to fail in more substantial ways, and if I&#x27;m unlucky, so will my mind.  But that&#x27;s fine.  There&#x27;s a whole lot of possible awesome between now and then.  And even the &#x27;then&#x27; will <i>probably</i> not be so bad as to negate the awesome of that time.')
