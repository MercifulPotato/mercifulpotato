That limit can be different for each person, but it will always be there.<p>If you get blamed or shamed for not being able to do more work, just insist. There is no shame in this.<p>Also, working more does not necessarily translate into career progression. And if your job security depends on working an insane amount of hours, unless you are being compensated properly and understand the long-term health implications of what you are doing, just look for another job.<p>What happens if you get a RSI injury such as carpal tunnel syndrome? or some other kind of health issue? If it&#x27;s bad enough, that&#x27;s it, your ability to work is over. If they already do not care about your work&#x2F;life balance and your health, their reaction will surely be &quot;hey, the typing machine on desk #3 broke, please get a new one&quot;.<p>It is fine to be professional, but don&#x27;t drink the Kool-Aid, look after your health and your best interest. If you want to be able to work until retirement, you need a sustainable lifestyle.<p>Also remember that one day you will change jobs, and when you do it is likely you won&#x27;t see your close friends at work anymore. But nevertheless you will have to live with the implications of neglecting your family and friends, or looking in the mirror one day and realizing you are old and you wasted your youth making other people rich for no reason.')
