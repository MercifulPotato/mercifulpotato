Boil the urine in a metal container, connected to copper tubing. The copper tubing needs to be in something cool to convert the steam to water or you will lose it in the atmosphere.  If you have a big enough container, this is fine, you basically build a poor-persons distillation setup.  This isn&#x27;t perfect but it doesn&#x27;t have to be.<p>Another method is reverse osmosis, which is just applying a large amount of pressure and forcing the fluid through a membrane, but this is not practical on the trail.')
