On FB, Twitter, LinkedIn, Insta, etc, you can scroll through your feed and:<p>* No ads!<p>* No tracking! (except what you click, can&#x27;t avoid this)<p>* Auto-block posts matching keywords you don&#x27;t like (politics&#x2F;etc)<p>* Auto-block posts that contain links to news websites (I use this on FB, it&#x27;s great)<p>* Block specific users whether you&#x27;re connected to them or not.<p>* Blocked users don&#x27;t know you&#x27;ve blocked them, because the block is at the network-level, not in the social media service.<p>Bubble is open source [2], our commercial offering is currently in beta.<p>How does it work? It&#x27;s basically a WireGuard VPN with a tightly-integrated mitmproxy. So it works on any device, but the social media blocking only works on the web (native apps are cert pinned, which breaks mitm). AMA.<p>Oh did I mention it works on HN too? I rarely need to block a user here, but when I do, it sure is nice to have that feature!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getbubblenow.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getbubblenow.com</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;getbubblenow&#x2F;bubble-docs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;getbubblenow&#x2F;bubble-docs</a>')
