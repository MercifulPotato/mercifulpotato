It does a poor job at that... the user has to <i>guess</i> when the train will arrive.<p>This is <i>completely</i> missing the point. No one cares where the train is. They care when it will arrive. Whether it is in a bend, it is waiting or whatever is totally irrelevant.<p>You need 2 things:<p>1) A map, whether digital or printed.<p>2) ETA time.<p>Why are they spending all this time and energy for something that is useless and unnecessary?')
