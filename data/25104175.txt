I don&#x27;t see examples on the left. and I don&#x27;t see politicians on the left embracing extremist media.<p>you are right that there has been some looting &amp; some confrontations. I think you overrate the violence. destroying a store front is not, to me, a threat to civilization, especially when the cause for anger is so visceral, so real, so evident, such mass gilovernmental &amp; systematuc injustice. I personally blame the right, blame neonazi &amp; white nationists &amp; other fascist forces for instigating much of the violence that anti-fascist have wound up engaged in.<p>our assessments are very different, obviously, but I am really interested in justifications for perceiving the left media as radical &amp; extremist. my first two questions, what are extremist left media organizations, and what politicians embrace these organizations, stands.<p>in my view, the left is trying very hard to maintain a good civil world for as many people as it can. against enormously bitter antagonistic forces. we used to worry about Fox News as a manufacturer of lies &amp; antagonism &amp; shit, but the right has ratcheted up and up and up the campaign of terror &amp; conspiratorialism it has used to whip up support, to incite it&#x27;s people, and I see no clear parallels on the left.')
