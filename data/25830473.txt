I&#x27;m not worried about &quot;wasted&quot; time or &quot;unproductive&quot; time. I am sensitive to &quot;young kids are hungry because dinner is an hour later than expected,&quot; or &quot;we&#x27;ve got plans to visit grandparents and don&#x27;t want to be out too late because they have school in the morning.&quot; Trying to pretend that there is never any time pressure in life is a bit naive, I think.')
