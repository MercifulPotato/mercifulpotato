I&#x27;m with you in that I don&#x27;t think cops should be able to demand ID and run checks on random people simply out and about in public. Broken tail light? Not sure. Speeding? OK now you&#x27;re breaking the law and arguably creating a public safety threat, but probably not going to be arrested. DUI? Now you&#x27;re in misdemeanor territory at least. When is it reasonable to check if you&#x27;re also wanted for something else? Maybe when you&#x27;re booked at the jail?')
