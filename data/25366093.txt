That&#x27;s the entire point. It&#x27;s an extreme slippery slope and this is already several steps down that slope. The earlier things were censorship of moon landing hoax videos and other such conspiracy theories. People didn&#x27;t have an issue with censoring those as a tiny minority thought those. Now they&#x27;re censoring things a significant double digit minority things (probably).
