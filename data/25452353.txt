You might be surprised, too.<p>I was so surprised that I decided to only ever run the open source command line docker client on my machine, and to avoid any proprietary software that comes out of Docker Inc in the future. It is absolutely not reasonable for them to upload some of the data that they do, and I no longer trust their judgement about what happens on my machine.<p>If they did that sort of stuff in the open source cli app, it would be patched out in minutes.')
