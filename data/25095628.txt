It definitely helped accelerate things, and on 3 occasions I didn&#x27;t have to do their take home test since my GitHub was enough. I don&#x27;t have an up to date CV and my LinkedIn is empty.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard of potential colleagues giving positive sentiment to the hiring manager&#x2F;boss: &quot;oh that guy, I&#x27;m subscribed to his mailing list, he&#x27;s good&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve received a good number of offers, and one thing I&#x27;ve started to wonder: are interviewers thinking I&#x27;m a great dev because all these little side projects supposedly make me a better web developer? Or are they hoping I&#x27;ll increase exposure to their brand since I already do talks and write articles?<p>I hope it&#x27;s not the former, all the time I spend writing, doing talks etc. it&#x27;s taking time away (with the exception of software-based side projects) from me learning about the art of software engineering.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;umaar.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;umaar.com</a>')
