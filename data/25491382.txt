The idea of the cards started when I saw how an AI could generate realistic portraits of people. I tried to apply similar techniques to generating fantasy characters, and got amazing results.<p>The next 2 weeks were spent on designing the card assets, hero traits and descriptions. I borrowed some ideas from D&amp;D (attribute points and alignment). Also threw in a random name generator, of which the names were scraped all over the internet.<p>Once I had the card assets, the rest all fell in place. It was obvious that the Ethereum blockchain was the best market place for such a collectible game. I spent the next 2 weeks writing the smart contract (based on ERC 721) and various pieces to support trading on the site. Fun fact: ETH price took off right before I was ready to deploy the contract on the mainnet. Due to high gas price, I had to spent a fortune... not fun!<p>I had a lot of fun working on it. Let me know if you have any questions.')
