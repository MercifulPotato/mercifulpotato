The piano action sets the hammer moving, and then it flies through the air uncontrolled until it bounces off the string. The only control the player has is how fast they start it moving, and there&#x27;s no reason you couldn&#x27;t do this with a solenoid (although it would have to be a fast one to match the latency of the mechanical action).')
