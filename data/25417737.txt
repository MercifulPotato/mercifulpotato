Airbags go a long way here. Sadly, drivers will often hit less fortunate road users such as pedestrians and cyclists.<p>We already know that pedestrians hit at 30 km&#x2F;h vs. 50 km&#x2F;h stand a much better chance to survive. Sadly, cities are rarely designed for 30, and usually more 50+, depending on the city.<p>Changing cities is, well, possible, but also kind of difficult and unpopular. You know what&#x27;s easier? Making car manufacturers limit cars&#x27; speeds in cities.<p>It&#x27;s not technologically difficult. Lots of new cars already read speed signs. Almost all of them have some sort of GPS component.<p>Geofencing speed limits seems like a pretty easy fix compared to the infrastructure changes of traffic calming (which we should do anyway). You can make it opt-out (and non-trivial enough to do so) so that most new cars on the road have these limits at least in cities.<p>Does this sound crazy? I&#x27;d argue it isn&#x27;t. Consider that E-bikes&#x2F;E-scooters are limited to 25km&#x2F;h in a lot of countries. Similar story with small 50cc scooters. In some places rental E-scooters even have geofenced speed limits already, and the Netherlands is considering a similar plan for E-bikes (ones owned by ordinary citizens).')
