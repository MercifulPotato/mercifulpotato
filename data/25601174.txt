The article talks a lot about distilling knowledge and what it is to “know” a topic, then the example flash cards about the article ask things like “vague prompts result in ______ recollection”, which is trivia about word selection. Although I suppose this just indicates how difficult prompt writing can be, perhaps a section on “what it means to answer a prompt” was necessary. Consider as an alternative: “what is the problem with vague prompts?”')
