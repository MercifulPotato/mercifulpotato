Item(by='presentation', descendants=None, kids=[25925859, 25928960], score=None, time=1611719767, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25922698, text='I love the split layouts, I&#x27;m using a Redox Wireless as my daily driver :) Though I wonder, DIY keyboards usually focus on stuff like nice mechanical keyboard action, which to be honest I don&#x27;t really care about that much. I would kill for a fully wireless Redox-like layout keyboard that has enough keys so you don&#x27;t need to memorize weird chords to do things, just used normal chiclet keys, is as small and light as possible, and had a wireless receiver that doesn&#x27;t suck (my Redox Wireless has a range of maybe 1 foot and freaks out all the time). The Kinesis Freestyle 2 is about as close as I could find (without a thumb cluster), but it&#x27;s still pretty hefty and isn&#x27;t fully wireless, plus I somewhat prefer the responsiveness and convenience of a Logitech-style unifying keyboard USB dongle over Bluetooth; and I found this other split keyboard [1], but it seems to be no longer produced.<p>I just wish there was a mass-market split ergo keyboard with similar form factor&#x2F;polish as the Apple Magic Keyboard or one of any of the common Logitech keyboards out there.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;peripheral-logix-uekb-rf-ultraergo-wireless&#x2F;dp&#x2F;b00hvksosm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;peripheral-logix-uekb-rf-ultraergo-wi...</a>')
