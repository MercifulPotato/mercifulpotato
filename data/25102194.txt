While a higher purpose might be achievable through helping others or religion or whatever, you can also distract yourself and have a really cool time by doing cool shit. And that&#x27;s motorcycles. It&#x27;s feeling the breeze and the road changing and the temperature go down as you go into a forest, it&#x27;s smelling the sea and feeling the breeze in your face, it&#x27;s the speed and the bit of danger and the fact that you&#x27;re part of that curve, you&#x27;re not just steering a wheel, you&#x27;re committed to it. And it&#x27;s camping at the end of a long day riding, and riding with your buddies, discovering new roads just because they&#x27;re twisty. And it&#x27;s working on your motorcycle or being part of a club, or a group of weekend rider friends. It&#x27;s a hobby, and it&#x27;s a cool one at that.<p>And for as long as I&#x27;ve had one, not one bad weekend can&#x27;t be fixed by a short ride.')
