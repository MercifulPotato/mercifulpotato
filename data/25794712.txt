Some suggest the tension between rational constructivism and spontaneous order is a false dichotomy in the real world.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that Hayek&#x27;s conception of the economy as spontaneous order may run into something of a paradox[0], and in the view of some, the emergent and unconscious shaping of the market as we see it today can certainly conflict with other goals - in particular justice. I think most people are interested in at least <i>asking</i> about what can be done rather than sitting down at the command of &quot;don&#x27;t touch that, who knows what may happen!&quot;.<p>[0] Assuming that <i>some</i> intervention in the economy is permissible (i.e. anything but anarcho-capitalism), see section &quot;When Would Hayek Pour The Cement?&quot; here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;tir&#x2F;tir_14_01_1_sandefur.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;tir&#x2F;tir_14_01_1_sandefur.pdf</a>')
