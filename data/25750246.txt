I am CTO of a small online travel company. We provide our users to book different types of trips.<p>Last a few days, I am thinking an idea about publishing our whole codebase as open source but I have 2 concerns:<p>1 - Security issues: publishing server side codebase can make our security problems open for others to attack. I feel closed codes are more safe especially for the first days.<p>2 - Business issues: our competitors can make some benefits by copying our technology for free, it may hurt our business part.<p>Benefits of open sourcing everything:<p>1 - Building trust: our customers and partners will know (or able to know) what they are using, what data we are collecting.<p>2 - Building stronger codebase: opening codes into front of the lots of people will give extra motivation to our team to build cleaner, more secure, stronger codebase.<p>3 - Allowing others to contribute: anyone who is interested our libraries, codebase can contribute our projects in someway(pull request, creating issues, etc.) which enables us to see from another eye.<p>I just want to hear your ideas, advices about this. What do you think? Thanks.')
