Who’s speech does Gab prioritize? It quickly becomes clear that the concept of “free speech” that Gab deploys is not quite the same as what others see it to mean.<p>Gab&#x27;s example seems to undermine the author&#x27;s previous arguments, as Gab is now running on Mastodon, whose founders profess values fundamentally opposed to Gab.<p>&gt; Obviously, exit in a digital context is logistically simpler than in a physical one, but it is still not easy. People critical of Twitter’s policies still use Twitter, not because they are hypocritical but because it’s a lot of effort to migrate to a new platform and re-establish connections from the former.<p>The migration part is because Twitter is a centralized network, which has been ever more draconian with its APIs. Federated and decentralized networks shouldn&#x27;t have logistic issues with exiting. Again, see Mastodon.')
