We didn&#x27;t want the stress of dragging out, and as cases were spiking in August we didn&#x27;t feel confident 2021 was even going to be an option.<p>Some friends of ours lost massive deposits on theirs in 2020, then rescheduled for 2021, and are starting to panic again.<p>It turned out to be a great excuse to uninvite a large swath of extended family we didn&#x27;t really want to include anyway, and the small ceremony with only our closest friends &amp; family was wonderful.')
