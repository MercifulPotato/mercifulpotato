I much prefer ubiquitous communication, at least from a user interaction stand-point.<p>Older messenger applications often supported handfuls to dozens of popular communication systems so you could interact with one touch point&#x2F;interface, and coukd still benefit from the fact the marketplace was forcing some competition while your communication wouldn&#x27;t be strangled by some single private entity&#x27;s policies or actions.')
