Only big problem was thermald&#x2F;RAPL would keep the SOC at 15W after a very short &#x27;boost&#x27; - updating to master fixed this problem... but Linux still requires &#x27;tweaking&#x27;.<p>Another example: sleep on the XPS is not S3, but S2Idle - so it uses extra power when sleeping (A compromise so it wakes up faster). This can be fixed with some tweaking, if desired.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard good things about Lenovo laptops running Linux.<p>I&#x27;d check the archwiki (even if you don&#x27;t want to run arch) for any laptop you&#x27;re considering. There&#x27;s good advice in the articles.<p>If I had to buy again, I&#x27;d look closer at what S76 offers. I really liked my old Chromebook Pixel 1 because of its open firmware (after I re-flashed) and excellent Linux support. I wish I had looked closer at S76, honestly.')
