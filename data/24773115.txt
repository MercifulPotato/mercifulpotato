Effectiveness is measured in relation to a baseline accuracy, which can already be quite poor.<p>Suppose you make predictions about 100 events, and only 25 of these events actually take place. Your baseline might be in relation to these 25 events, and your &#x27;superforecaster&#x27; needs to be better than an existing model, which could be really bad at predicting these odd&#x2F;weird outcomes. Now you&#x27;re better than everything else! :)')
