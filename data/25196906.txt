I think I might have heard something about Intel ME being on the PCH in some cases???<p>Anyway seems like the point is to make it a &quot;more hardware&quot; TPM rather than a firmware one â€“ i.e. the key memory would only be accessible from fixed function crypto hardware blocks.<p>Coincidentally, this might mean that the embedded TPM would still work after me_cleaner destroys most of the ME firmware :)')
