That&#x27;s basically what economics studies.<p>The outputs of a car factory are easy to measure. How many cars came out? We can quibble over quality, but quantity is most of the game and that is measurable. Administration is harder to measure.<p>David Graeber, in his provocateur style, concluded that they <i>are</i> more efficient in the sense that they produce a lot more paperwork... which is their output.<p>Economists would consider this nonsensical as paperwork itself doesn&#x27;t benefit anyone and can&#x27;t be considered an output. He wasn&#x27;t an economist though.')
