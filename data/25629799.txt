There are various minigames with 5-50 second timers, so 10s latency is a lot. Some of the games have a special streaming mode which extends the timers, but not all of them and it&#x27;s best played with regular timers anyway. Obviously for true action games, you absolutely need sub-second latency, preferably &lt;100ms.')
