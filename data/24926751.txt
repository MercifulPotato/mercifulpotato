Isn&#x27;t that between Jeremy and Joel? Joel didn&#x27;t have a problem with Jeremy&#x27;s talk. Why do you think you know better than Joel whether it was appropriate to criticize Joel in the way that Jeremy did?<p>Your belief that, whatever Joel may have thought, <i>your</i> perspective is the one of &quot;regular human empathy&quot; is indicative of a certain narcissism about the superiority about your own moral sentiments. The same narcissism that motivated this farcical CoC accusation and persecution mess to begin with.')
