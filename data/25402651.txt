If I invert the colors, will those parts of the image suddenly compress just fine?  Is it something to do with human perception of dark colors (like how many compression algorithms use more detail in various characteristics we&#x27;re more sensitive to, such as brightness, as opposed to color)?  That wouldn&#x27;t make sense to me, as it seems to be a pretty obvious visual flaw.')
