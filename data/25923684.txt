Most commonly these are used on HPC clusters, but you can use them on any size machine.<p>There are a number of tools in this category, and like others have mentioned, my first try would be Make, if that is an option for you. However, I normally work on HPC clusters, so submitting jobs is incredibly common for me. To keep with that workflow without needing to install SLURM or SGE on my laptop (which I&#x27;ve done before!?!?), my entry into this mix is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;compgen-io&#x2F;sbs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;compgen-io&#x2F;sbs</a>.  It is a single-file Python3 script.<p>My version is setup to only run across one node, but you can have as many worker threads as you need. For what you asked for, you&#x27;d run something like this:<p><pre><code>    $ sbs submit -- wget http:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com&#x2F;foo.json\n    1\n    $ sbs submit -- wget http:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com&#x2F;bar.json\n    2\n    $ sbs submit -afterok 1:2 -cmd jq -s &#x27;.[0] * .[1]&#x27; foo.json bar.json\n    $ sbs run -maxprocs 2\n</code></pre>\nThis isn&#x27;t heavily tested code, but works for the use-case I had (having a single-file batch scheduler for when I&#x27;m not on an HPC cluster, and testing my pipeline definition language). Normally, it assumes the parameters (CPUs, Memory, etc) are present as comments in a submitted bash script (as is the norm in HPC-land). However, I also added an option to directly submit a command. stdout&#x2F;stderr are all captured and stored.<p>The job runner also has a daemon mode, so you can keep it running in the background if you&#x27;d like to have things running on demand.<p>Installation is as simple as copying the sbs script someplace in your $PATH (with Python3 installed). You should also set the ENV var $SBSHOME, if you&#x27;d like to have a common place for jobs.<p>The usage is very similar to many HPC schedulers...<p><pre><code>    sbs submit\n    sbs status\n    sbs run\n    sbs cancel\n</code></pre>\netc...')
