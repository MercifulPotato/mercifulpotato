There are still a few rough edges, but the experience is vastly superior to anything else I’ve tried.<p>One important thing to be aware of: because of their size, you can only fit a single battery cell inside each bud; as I understand it, this prevents any ability to specially manage the lifetime of the battery. I remember hearing something like “expect about 380 full recharges until the battery is no good.”<p>Anyway. Switching between devices is so seamlessly awesome. “Transparency” mode works well and is easy to switch in and out of. They do a great job of detecting if you just pulled them out of your ear and manage stop&#x2F;start. Combined with a cellular Apple Watch, it totally rocks, giving you complete communications hook-in and letting you keep your phone at home. I assume they make you buy the phone not <i>only</i> because it’s technically easier to implement the full experience, but also because the Watch would <i>totally</i> cannibalize iPhone sales. The iPhone suddenly feels like a niche device when you have the AirPod&#x2F;Watch combo.<p>My primary complaint with the AirPod Pros is that no matter which size insert I use or how tightly I secure them, they tend to fall out of my ears when I smile. I wish you could get them in the “peg” form-factor.<p>This has been my mini-review.')
