Undergrad computer science is indeed one of the easiest things to self-teach because of the ready availability of the &quot;lab materials&quot;, i.e., computers are cheap and abundant now.<p>But a structured program will take you through these things, ensure that you understand them, be available to answer questions in a manner other than &quot;bang your head on the problem for weeks&quot; or &quot;just give up&quot;, and provide a structure progression through to more advanced topics.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to keep both sides of this in mind; the universities do not have a monopoly on the knowledge and arguably it&#x27;s easier than ever to pick up yourself, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the structured experience is useless either. I&#x27;ve worked with some very good self-taught people, but they all have also tended to have gaping holes in their education relative to a good computer science education. (I agree with those people that they are much better than some people who end up with <i>bad</i> computer science educations. Unfortunately, if one optimizes one&#x27;s computer science education for &quot;the easiest 4.0s&quot;, one can end up with very similar gaping holes in one&#x27;s formal education!)')
