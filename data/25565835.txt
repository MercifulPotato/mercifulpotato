Item(by='credit_guy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609207290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25564907, text='&gt; This would not have been a subplot in a Le Carre novel.<p>Not sure I understand what you&#x27;re trying to say. Are you claiming your (b) is more likely than your (a)? And it is so because of something to do with the Nord Stream pipeline? That&#x27;s quite some conspiracy theory.<p>I don&#x27;t find this likely. Why? I watched the youtube clip where Navalny dupes one of the members of the team assigned to assassinate him. And what struck me is how charismatic Navalny is. He is a formidable political opponent to Putin. I can certainly see Putin preferring to live in a Navalny-less world.<p>Aside from his charisma, is it possible that everything Navalny puts on Youtube is fabrication? How difficult can it be to get a prop to answer a phone call and read some lines emailed to him ahead of time? It probably wouldn&#x27;t be, but you&#x27;d see people pointing at various inconsistencies.<p>I just found an older youtube documentary created by Navalny about Medvedev [1]. Could it also be a fabrication? I seriously doubt that: New York Times covered this, as well as other prestigious publications, and they don&#x27;t suspect any shenanigans.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;qrwlk7_GF9g?hl=en&amp;cc_lang_pref=en&amp;cc_load_policy=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;qrwlk7_GF9g?hl=en&amp;cc_lang_pref...</a>')
