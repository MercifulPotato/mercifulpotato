FWIW I&#x27;m quite carefully staying behind the line of &quot;death-wishing&quot;, in &quot;it is what it is&quot; territory.<p>Multiple social issues throughout 2020 have together completely exhausted my usual compassion and optimism towards people. 300,000 Americans and 1.6 million people worldwide are dead but many millions more still don&#x27;t see this as a public health emergency. Moreover, beleaguered medical workers have been harassed everywhere online and fist fights and other assaults have been reported across the country that were started by <i>wearing a mask</i>. And then there&#x27;s the cyclopsian intersection in the venn diagram of &quot;people who are aggressively anti-mask&quot; and &quot;people who are unconcerned with or even violently opposed to the health and safety of anybody outside their tribe&quot;.<p>From an entirely pragmatic standpoint, the freedom to choose one&#x27;s own destiny is arguably the most important human right. All of the information necessary to protect yourself and those around you from this disease is now widely available. Most people who wish to minimize their risk of exposure can do so, with the notable exception of the many medical workers who have been, not asked, but demanded, to put themselves at risk in the service of people who believe those same medical workers are part of some vast conspiracy.<p>So, I&#x27;m asking honestly here, to you or whoever else: convince me to care about the plight of terrible people.')
