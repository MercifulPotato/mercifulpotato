You are trying to steal my attention, my time. You don’t get to do that. My time on Earth is limited and you don’t get a millisecond of it if I can help it.<p>If I want to buy something, I seek it out. Anything else is a waste of my time and a waste of the advertisers money.<p>I long ago decided to throw out every piece of physical ad mail I receive without even glancing at it more than long enough to recognize it as an advertisement.<p>I don’t know why you expect me to treat your digital ads any differently?<p>You can call my perspective extremist, but is it any more extreme than the methods used by advertising networks to steal my attention?')
