E.g., you couldn&#x27;t write a module that cranks out autoscaled DynamoDB tables per region because you could only pass scalars to modules, not entire key schemata or tag sets.<p>I really wish Terraform itself were written in Python or something similarly hackable without rebuilding the binary for everyone. I&#x27;ve glanced at CDK but it looks like building blocks for reinventing our own Terraform.')
