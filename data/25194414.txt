Individuals should be treated as individuals and not as members of a monolithic group based on their immutable characteristics.  i.e. I should not be penalized for being a man, a Chinese person should not be penalized for being Chinese, a blind person should not be penalized for being blind, etc.<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem to be what you&#x27;re advocating though.  You&#x27;re defending policies that explicitly favor people based on their immutable characteristics.  I understand you think it balances historical inequality, but  I disagree with that.<p>The US Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes data on job occupation and demographics of the workers[1].  You can see that many occupations are at approximate gender parity (i.e. ~50% women) and some occupations are majority women while other occupations are majority men.<p>Let&#x27;s consider four occupations from this list written as Occupation title, percent women.  Computer programmers, 20.  Insurance underwriters, 51.  Human resource managers, 75.  Pre-school teachers, 98.7.  Why are women only 20% of computer programmers?  Is it because 100 years ago women weren&#x27;t allowed to vote and because today women have relatively few lines of dialogue with one another in popular films?  Well, why do those factors uniquely affect female computer programmers and not other career disciplines?  I don&#x27;t think I would have expected that prior to looking at the data.<p>If relatively few women are computer programmers because of systemic sexism, is there less systemic sexism among insurance underwriters?  And how would you know that apart from looking at these percentages?  As male as the profession of computer programming is, human resources managers are even more female - is that because of a prejudice against men?  And that&#x27;s not to mention the apparently staggering bias against male preschool teachers.<p>In other words, if the only way you can tell that computer programmers are systemically sexist and insurance underwriters are not is because of the portion of women in those respective fields, it seems like that same logic would also lead to there being massive system sexism against male human resources managers and teachers.<p>An alternate hypothesis, which I do believe in, is that men and women tend to have different interests.  Women, for reasons that are an ineffable mystery, like to be around children as an example.  That&#x27;s why they are over represented among teachers, especially teachers of younger and younger children.  I think it is perfectly reasonable to suppose that women, in aggregate, are less likely to be interested in computer programming, and this lack of interest is what leads there to be relatively few female programmers, not the Bechdel test or the history of women&#x27;s suffrage.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cps&#x2F;cpsaat11.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cps&#x2F;cpsaat11.htm</a>')
