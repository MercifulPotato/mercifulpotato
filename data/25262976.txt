It&#x27;s like science has become a religion and you aren&#x27;t allowed to express doubt, no matter how contradictory some of those positions may be. Scientific discussion is tolerated, but only if they agree with these viewpoints. If they don&#x27;t they get &quot;fact-checked&quot; and removed from the internet as soon as possible.<p>Also, it is pretty ironic how Scientific American is crying about science getting less evidence based and more politically motivated. I don&#x27;t remember them staying out of politics in the last American election.')
