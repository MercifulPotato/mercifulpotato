Basically, if you know you&#x27;re not smart enough to figure out if other people are genuine or out to scam you, defaulting to assuming that all strangers are lying is a winning strategy.<p>The same kind of logic fuels conspiracy-minded people. The one thing they <i>all</i> have in common is that they reject the mainstream view, they reject the consensus. And in turn, they embrace outlandish explanations, and the communities around those, because it gives them a false sense of superiority. They know something the rest of the sheep don&#x27;t!<p>So these two psychological defense mechanisms interact with each other, and when the information flow in society is increasing, the threshold for how smart you need to be to keep up also increases. So people in general probably aren&#x27;t getting stupider, but they&#x27;re getting more and more overwhelmed, which looks the same.')
