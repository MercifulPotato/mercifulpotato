Cars suck for liveable cities, but they&#x27;re also better at transportation than anything else regarding cost, flexibility and time. They&#x27;re a piece of freedom, but with high externalities. I can see why the US loves them so much, and why Europe doesn&#x27;t. I also think it is kind of strange that &quot;number of deaths&quot; is such an important metric for some: automatic safety systems will soon be commonplace in all new cars, so this will naturally converge to zero over time.<p>I&#x27;m using car-sharing myself, but finding a car and walking there \nis very annoying. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if you could summon a car when you needed one, out of a pool that is large enough to never have availability issues?')
