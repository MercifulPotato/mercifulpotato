You can type messages out as normal, or send audio, and people on your team can scan&#x2F;read it, and decide to listen, or listen by default. It&#x27;s more human than text, way less stressful than sync video meetings, and enables asynchronous conversations over several days or across timezones.<p>I&#x27;m nearly done building a first version, so if anyone would like to hear more or try it soon, there&#x27;s a website and mailing list signup at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heysync.chat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heysync.chat</a>')
