Julia&#x27;s compilation time is a known quantity. See my comment in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24750559" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24750559</a> about the different phases of Julia&#x27;s compilation and execution (from a user&#x27;s perspective).<p>Obviously, if you are not working on a problem that doesn&#x27;t need Julia&#x27;s speed (and makes it worth paying the compilation cost), and you are more comfortable with a different tool, you should use that. You may in fact be better off using Python, or shell scripting or even Excel.<p>Precompilation time in Julia is akin to `make` in a project with C code. You only compile the library once and use it repeatedly, until you update it. Is it a dealbreaker? Perhaps it is for you (assuming you are using precompilation in the right context). It is not for many who work with Julia day in and day out, and it is something that we continue to improve.')
