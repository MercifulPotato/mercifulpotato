Item(by='jVinc', descendants=None, kids=[24740956], score=None, time=1602341841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24739319, text='The &quot;Open&quot; in OpenAI means that they want their customer to open their pockets, it has nothing to do with Open Source, open core or anything like that.<p>The cultural war of &quot;but they deserve to make money&quot; is misguided. You are free to make money, just don&#x27;t call your projects open source if for one reason or another you do not want to open up the source of your project. And don&#x27;t call it open core if you don&#x27;t want to open up the core of your project. GPT-3 might just be &quot;GPT-2 plus something more&quot;, but a proprietary code based forked off of Linux would also just be &quot;Linux plus something more&quot;, that doesn&#x27;t make it open source or open core, because neither the core nor the source is open.<p>That said, I am not against the OpenAI project going forwards with early releases of proprietary offerings, it seems like a fine way to finance their work, and they can still support the open source community. But criticism of the choice is warranted if they keep trying to brand themselves as open.')
