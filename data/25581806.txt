Apologies for the long quote; I find the whole text goes together, and I can&#x27;t see what part can be edited out.<p>Graeber writes:<p>All these moral dramas start from the assumption that personal debt is ultimately a matter of self-indulgence, a sin against one&#x27;s loved ones — and therefore, that redemption must necessarily be a matter of purging and restoration of ascetic self-denial. What&#x27;s being shunted out of sight here is first of all the fact that everyone is now in debt (U.S. household debt is now estimated at on average 130 percent of income), and that very little of this debt was accrued by those determined to find money to bet on the horses or toss away on fripperies. Insofar as it was borrowed for what economists like to call discretionary spending, it was mainly to be given to children, to share with friends, or otherwise to be able to build and maintain relations with other human beings that are based on something other than sheer material calculation. One must go into debt to achieve a life that goes in any way beyond sheer survival.<p>...<p>To this, most ordinary Americans have responded with a stubborn insistence on continuing to love one another. They continue to acquire houses for their families, liquor and sound systems for parties, gifts for friends; they even insist on continuing to hold weddings and funerals, regardless of whether this is likely to send them skirting default or bankruptcy — apparently figuring that, as long as everyone now has to remake themselves as miniature capitalists, why shouldn&#x27;t they be allowed to create money out of nothing too?<p>Granted, the role of discretionary spending itself should not be exaggerated. The chief cause of bankruptcy in America is catastrophic illness; most borrowing is simply a matter of survival (if one does not have a car, one cannot work); and increasingly, simply being able to go to college now almost necessarily means debt peonage for at least half one&#x27;s subsequent working life. Still, it is useful to point out that for real human beings survival is rarely enough. Nor should it be.')
