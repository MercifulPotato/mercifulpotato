If the paper was wrong or unfair, what is wrong with modifying or removing the coverage which is served today? Is that really worse than printing a &quot;correction&quot; paragraph at the end of the original article?<p>Maybe publishers could implement a sort of &quot;timeline&quot; feature which shows how the organization&#x27;s understanding of an event changed over time. But today, I can&#x27;t see anything wrong with a newspaper accepting petitions to modify outdated coverage.')
