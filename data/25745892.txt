The &quot;steal&quot; claims have been thoroughly debunked in many dozens of court cases. No evidence has been presented.<p>2. Many of the alleged &quot;steals&quot; were in Republican-controlled areas. So, Republicans stealing the election for... Democrats?<p>3. The results of the election closely matched much pre-election polling done by multiple private parties. Polls are an inexact science of course. The absence of major discrepancies proves nothing, but if there was major fraud we would expect to see discrepancies.<p>4. The debate is over. Weeks ago, &quot;stop the steal&quot; may have referred to the need for legal challenges. Today, that is not true. The window for legal challenge is closed. Today it is a direct reference to violent and armed insurrection.<p>5. Constitutional free speech in America is defined fairly clearly (you guessed it) the Constitution. The key thing to understand is the &quot;Congress shall make no law&quot; part. The government is not suppressing anybody&#x27;s right to speech here. Facebook is not obligated to publish &quot;stop the steal&quot; nonsense any more than your local newspaper is obligated to publish letters from any random crazy person.<p>5a. In any reasonable society, even the right to free speech has limits. It does not trump (no pun intended) others&#x27; rights. Yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded movie theater is not protected free speech because your right to yell things does not trump others&#x27; right to safety. Similarly, inciting violent sedition&#x2F;insurrection is not protected free speech even at the government level.<p>Instead of arguing about what FB should publish and not publish one should hope for (or create) a healthier and more diverse selection of social media platforms. While I agree with FB in this case, I think they are a drain on society in general and we would be better if there was more competition.')
