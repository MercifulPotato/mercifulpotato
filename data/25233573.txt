Probably used only Macs as most of his examples are about Mac.<p>By the way, a Mac <i>still</i> lets you select a boot drive in the exact same way. And current Macs still remember the positioning of icons and on a Mac you can still run apps from anywhere (unless the developer didn&#x27;t follow Apple&#x27;s standards but that&#x27;s not Apple&#x27;s fault). If you take his comments purely within the Mac field of view which he seems to do, some of these statements are simply false. And the unrestricted, non-password users? Well yeah it would be nice but the cold dark world of the internet has caught up with that. Good luck with your botnets.<p>I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s ever edited config.sys and autoexec.bat files, struggled with setting nonconflicting IRQs with jumpers and set up XMS&#x2F;EMS high-memory drivers, just to have enough to load all the TSRs you needed <i>and</i> have enough real memory available available to run a program.<p>Or used Word Perfect which required a &#x27;cheat sheet&#x27; with all the different function key combos. Most programs required classroom training for all non-geek people to use them.<p>I loved that time too. But it was definitely not easier than it is now.<p>By the way, someone looking for this simpler experience can find it in the mobile OSes. An iPad already provides most of these things while being secure (but at the expense of Apple deciding what you can and can&#x27;t do with your device). A lot of people already use a mobile or tablet as their sole computing device.')
