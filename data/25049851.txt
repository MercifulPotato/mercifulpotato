We&#x27;ve had provably secure FHE since Gentry&#x27;s 2009 paper.<p>Obfuscation roughly means &quot;encrypting a function.&quot; But here be dragons: since the adversary gets non-black-box access to the implementation of the function (a circuit), and can also learn as many (input, output = f(input)) pairs as they want, it becomes impossible to say that the adversary cannot learn anything else about f in the general case (intuitively, consider a higher-order function f: you could learn a lot about f by computing f(f)).')
