Interestingly, I think software has huge potential for &quot;inward mobility&quot;! Consider the fact that the basic screen&#x2F;memory&#x2F;cpu&#x2F;battery combo has been around for ~10 years, but I believe we&#x27;ve only begun to discover what these devices can do, and most of what we&#x27;ve discovered has been funded by precisely that old guard - and so there&#x27;s been a bias toward centralization and, dare I say it, rather unscrupulous use of information asymmetry and moral hazard to produce systems that are superficially great for people, but are rotten in their cores. It&#x27;s not all bad since this money has explored a lot of useful UI&#x2F;UX space, but...I really believe that there remain huge improvements to people&#x27;s quality of life once they take ownership of these infinitely mutable devices and start organizing that enormous data-space for their own benefit.')
