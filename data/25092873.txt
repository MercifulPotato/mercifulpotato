Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25093575], score=None, time=1605368035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25092412, text='&gt; Actually corporations (companies) are a legal structure invented to allow multiple investors to contribute capital towards a certain goal and have rights guaranteed by law rather than purely contractually. The limited liability is also to protect investors.<p>Untrue; the law of partnerships, which is older than corporations, already allowed people to contribute capital to a goal and have their respective rights governed by law. The legal arrangements are <i>different</i> in a corporation, those differences centering around the limitation of liability—the freedom from accountability—provided to the investors.<p>That freedom from accountability is the central focus of the corporate form. And it&#x27;s arguably an aberrant path dependency; had we had limited partnerships <i>first</i>, the idea of business form where <i>no one</i> is ultimately accountable for the liabilities of the business—rather than one to which investors could contribute with limited liability while the active principals remained fully accountable—might never have seemed like a good idea, even to the investor class.')
