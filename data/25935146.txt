It&#x27;s also incredibly difficult to version.<p>I regret going with this approach even though it results in far fewer tables and classes.  It&#x27;s short term gain for long term pain.  Everything is trade off -- it might well be more than worth it for something not expected to live long or have a lot of changes.<p>Although I agree with your point that not everything needs to be hierarchy.  You can be explicit with your data without having everything inherit from everything else.')
