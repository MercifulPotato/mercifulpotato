Item(by='danjac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608736157, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25507942, text='After playing for some hours with the new Turbo on a side project (with Django as backend), it mostly works fine.<p>One thing that is kind of broken out of the box is form submissions: so a common pattern with server side rendering is to re-render the form with validation errors, but otherwise redirect to wherever.<p>The workaround here I think is to use turbo-streams and just re-render the invalid form HTML snippet rather than the whole page. While this is probably ok for most cases, I have some forms (3rd party library stuff) where this is going to be more work than I&#x27;d like, and due to a bug in the beta release you can&#x27;t override the default form submission behavior - Turbo throws an error if a form POST returns anything other than a redirect. So it&#x27;s probably not quite ready for production yet.')
