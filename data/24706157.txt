It&#x27;s great to hear that others saw this as a potential market as well. Google wasn&#x27;t the first search website, MS office not the first word processor, Apple didn&#x27;t invent the mouse. The market still seems ripe for someone to make a &quot;proper&quot; social media watching product, and I think there is no better moment for it than the current corona times.')
