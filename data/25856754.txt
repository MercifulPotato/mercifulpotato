For some reason my initial reaction was joy that this could be a WhatsApp replacement, somehow. And at the moment, I like keeping my other chat apps in their own app window, for keeping track of what I’m doing In them. I could see myself accidentally responding to the wrong person if everything is in one app. So again, it’s cool what with the tech, and OS, but, as I think about it... am I really going to use it?')
