A lie.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s false equivalency. There is 1000+ page report by the Republican led senate about Trump and Russia. It&#x27;s highly suggestive that the senate was investigating him because of his and his associate ties with Russia. And Russia also interfered in the election to boot. No one knows the full truth yet and we may never know it.<p>As opposed to the election fraud claims from 2020: they are just baseless accusations from Trump that have no evidence to warrant further investigation and got thrown out of every court. If they turn out to be legitimate concerns, I&#x27;m sure the senate will investigate them.<p>BTW, most news media is overly dramatic regardless of which way it leans.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;ap-top-news-international-news-elections-politics-campaigns-5e833a62e9492f6a66624b7920cc846a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;ap-top-news-international-news-el...</a>')
