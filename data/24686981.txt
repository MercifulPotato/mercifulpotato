They allow us fast and easy packaging, easy distribution to our users, as well as regular and fast updates. Flatpak would be another alternative but we didn&#x27;t investigate this yet, nor are we planing to do so in the near future. However, we&#x27;re happy to accept contributions from the community around Anbox to provide necessary changes to distribute Anbox as a flatpak package too.<p>One thing which Anbox currently doesn&#x27;t do is using proper confinement for snaps. Right now it is only usable when installed in the so-called devmode of snaps which disables any confinement. This is something we will work on over the coming months with upstream to allow our snap to be fully confined.<p>Despite snap confinement being disabled, the Android system still stays separate through the use of Linux namespaces from the host system.</i>')
