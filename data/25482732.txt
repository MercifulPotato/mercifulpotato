The editor might have an obligation similar to do that, depending on newsworthiness. But I don&#x27;t see how it applies here anyway. Once ISIS&#x2F;L established territory in Syria they became the most newsworthy topic of the decade.<p>This is pretty circular logic. Her topics are newsworthy <i>because</i> she is covering them, and adjacent un-covered topics happen to become not-newsworthy because she is ignoring them. The NYT editorial staff is def at fault, but she is she, as their designated &quot;Terrorism Reporter [who only covers a certain type of terrorism]&quot; She literally gets to define terrorism by example and undefine it by what she ignores to cover.<p>As an example, most people in the US I&#x27;ve spoken to dont consider the 2011 Norway attacks &quot;terrorism&quot; because they have not been covered as such.
