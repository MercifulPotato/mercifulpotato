That&#x27;s what happened the last two units for me... For two build weeks I was in a team of 8 people, and in both cases only one other person showed up. There were no repercussions for those that didn&#x27;t attend build week and they continued on to the next unit regardless of whether or not they were ready. You grade yourself model and you flex yourself model is horrendous. I know some auto-grading has (very) slowly been implemented in earlier units, but essentially I went through 1&#x2F;3rd of the program without any feedback other than my own, with two terrible teachers that were both new to teaching.')
