Before that point, I had absolutely no idea who Robert Moses was.  I picked that book at random, but as &quot;happy little accidents&quot; go, it melded with my current exploration of themes related to urban planning marvelously.  I particularly love reading Jane Jacobs&#x27;s thoughts on the subject, who learned by observation, not through logical analysis.<p>A lot of my interest in this area comes from a life-long appreciation of (non-pejorative) anarchist philosophical thought.  It&#x27;s a lot harder to build organization from the bottom-up, but top-down organization loses so much implicit knowledge and context that it seems reasonable to investigate the former approach.<p>I&#x27;ll check out your newsletter, it seems so interesting, thank you for linking. :)')
