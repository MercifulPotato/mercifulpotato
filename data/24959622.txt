No need to worry about passwords.<p>Decentralized: The identity system does not require a third party, all identities are generated from the embedded Bitcoin wallet.<p>Privacy: All identities are sandboxed to each app provider by default. Also, no reliance on 3rd party authentication provider provides privacy.<p>It&#x27;s an early alpha, and I would appreciate any constructive feedback.')
