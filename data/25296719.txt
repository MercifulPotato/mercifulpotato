He&#x27;s released some serious scoops about upcoming products, and his verification of a rumour is basically taken as a confirmation in the Mac rumours scene.<p>It&#x27;s of course possible he has some kind of access that Apple don&#x27;t control (like an employee leaking information), but given their extreme focus on secrecy, I&#x27;m sure that this would have long been shut down if it wasn&#x27;t fully authorised.<p>That kind of access does not come without ties, IMO. Though I agree I was coming on too strong when I said shill.')
