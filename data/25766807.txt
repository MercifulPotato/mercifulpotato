I recently dug out an old Asus RT-N16 and the latest Tomato firmwares are all completely broken. WAN DHCP doesn&#x27;t work. Took me a couple of hours to figure out. Turns out it was broken a year or two ago and nobody has noticed (it&#x27;s a pretty old router; I doubt anyone still uses it). The official firmware worked fine.<p>The point is the manufacturers have a much higher incentive to ensure everything works than open source developers.<p>The ASUS firmware at least seems to support way more features than Tomato did, at least without resorting to the command line. E.g. my ISP requires the VLAN ID to be set. I doubt open source router GUIs have a nice option for that.')
