Consider what just happened in the USA: All of the major social media companies blocked a significant portion of the population because of the attempted subversion of democracy in the country.<p>Now imagine if some similar subversion were attempted in another country, say Ecuador? Would these social media companies be as willing to silence a faction in another country?<p>What if it were to happen in a more important country, say Australia? South Korea? Japan? Germany? At what point should these companies be interfering through censorship, and at what point are the issues too blurred or difficult to figure out who&#x27;s right and who&#x27;s wrong? Sir Richard Wharton in Yes, Minster once quipped: &quot;Once you start interfering in the internal squabbles of other countries, you&#x27;re on a very slippery slope.&quot;<p>Naturally, these companies will resist the push towards becoming arbiters of Truth (until they actually BECOME such arbiters, then god help us all).<p>So non-American governments will have no recourse but to plead with Youtube, and then block them when the answer is &quot;no&quot;.')
