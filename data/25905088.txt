Item(by='StreamBright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611592380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903111, text='Guy came in his turck, got a bunch of packages in his hands when exited the vehicle, dropped off some of the packages, he had one package in his hand when got back and left. Few minutes later the notification came that my package was delivered. I was trying to understand who is stealing my packages, maybe neighbours or somebody breaking in after the delivery guys leaves. This was in a gated community. Finally I understood it was the driver. I called amazon about it but nothing happened. They just refunded me and did not do anything about it. Financially this is &quot;optimal&quot; for them (as least in the short run). I have never ordered anything to that address anymore and I started to use the company address in the city in a building that has 24 hour staff.')
