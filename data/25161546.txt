Reusing the frontend skills I learned throughout the years to build desktop apps when needed, instead of having to learn an OS toolkit (and in the case of linux, multiple desktop environments, neve mind Wayland vs X) is the difference between shipping something and not shipping at all.<p>Learning takes time and effort, and the more general the tool I use the better.<p>If I had to implement a desktop app tomorrow, I would default Electron, no contest.<p>A bit of an aside, but I was thinking lately, it would be great for linux to have an SSD benchmarking app, just like CrystalDiskMark, I would never attempt to implement something like this in Qt or GTK, there&#x27;s just too much to learn beforehand compared to simply going with CSS, wrapping the fio command in a JavaScript shell call then publishing everything as an appimage. This way I know it will work everywhere and it will have a consistent look and feel everywhere. I might actually set this up as a weekend project sometime next month. Without Electron it would take me months of intense dedicated time, which I would rather spend on something else.')
