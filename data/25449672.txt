I&#x27;m also one of the authors of the Wikipedia article on Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess); you can see the information I wrote about it here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dwheeler.com&#x2F;essays&#x2F;Fischer_Random_Chess.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dwheeler.com&#x2F;essays&#x2F;Fischer_Random_Chess.html</a><p>I think Chess960 is fun! But many people want to play &quot;traditional chess&quot;, not Chess960. Also, knowing a little about traditional chess openings also helps when you&#x27;re playing Chess960. Memorizing a long list of opening moves isn&#x27;t helpful, but seeing <i>examples</i> of good openings is helpful even when the starting position is different.')
