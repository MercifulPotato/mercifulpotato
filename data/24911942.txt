Protective relaying involves some disconnects sending signals to distant disconnects to tell them <i>not</i> to disconnect. The idea is that when you have a sudden overload like a line down, you want to trip the breaker closest to the trouble, and not others elsewhere upstream. Without this, small disruptions take out too much of the grid. See NYC blackout of 1965.[1]<p>This is why large transmission networks require some capability for fast transmission of data between circuit breakers. Not much data. But it&#x27;s so much cheaper to send it over the Internet than to have separate microwave repeaters or separate cables or gear to send data over high-tension power lines.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Northeast_blackout_of_1965" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Northeast_blackout_of_1965</a>')
