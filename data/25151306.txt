Part of it was because iPhone (or Reddit? I don&#x27;t even know who is to blame here) wouldn&#x27;t let me choose the reddit app I wanted as the default. If a friend sent a reddit link to me it&#x27;d try and open in Safari and I&#x27;d get annoyed and just ignore it.<p>I&#x27;m back on Android now where I can choose default apps and now if a friend sends a link, I click it and read it, then I click over to the homepage, then 20 minutes goes by as I mindlessly scroll. It&#x27;s a blessing and a curse to be able to use your phone the way you want to, I guess.')
