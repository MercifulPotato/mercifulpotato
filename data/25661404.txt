You can&#x27;t watch Netflix streams without paying for them, that&#x27;s trivial to implement.<p>Ah, right, creators want their content to show up for my search keywords, Google won&#x27;t let them have pages only visible to Google bots (though even that is changing with the rise of paywalled sites), and they want the money from that same Google showing ads from their ad network.<p>Google initially promised to deliver a search for the open web unencumbered. It has become a sort of paywall itself (accept our ads or our search results will be useless pointing you to pages that only work if you have ads enabled).<p>Sure, it would be fair if they haven&#x27;t pushed out the competition acting entirely differently (&quot;we have no ads&quot;, &quot;our ads are clearly marked&quot; to current &quot;see if you can tell a difference between an ad and your search results&quot;).')
