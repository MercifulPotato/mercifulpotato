Item(by='vonmoltke', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607722401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390728, text='In general, sellers only need to collect sales tax if they meet the legal definition of &quot;reseller&quot;.  The test varies from state to state, but is generally a combination of gross annual revenue from sales and number of sales transactions per year.  Generally, transactions between private parties are not subject to sales tax.<p>eBay was hit by special &quot;marketplace facilitator&quot; clauses in remote tax laws that have popped up since South Dakota v. Wayfair.  The tax is actually imposed on the <i>marketplace</i>, not the seller.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what the seller&#x27;s status is relative to the above, because it is eBay that is being required to remit he tax.  If the seller is independently obligated to remit tax to a given state as well, they count the eBay-collected tax against their own obligation.')
