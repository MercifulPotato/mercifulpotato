But we don&#x27;t see that, because the network is old, and it is extremely white. Pile that on top of glaring inequalities across the board, and here we are.<p>In my experience as a subcontractor for few extremely large corporations (including one of the &quot;A&quot;s), the largest roadblock was usually an incompetent VP. How&#x27;d they get there? Well, they had connections, friends or family or both. In SMB world, it&#x27;s even more obvious. I&#x27;ve seen millions of dollars wasted on projects and POCs that existed only because one of these folks didn&#x27;t &quot;believe&quot; the research and the vendor specs. And I&#x27;ve seen a room full of VPs all afraid to tell the boss that the product demo isn&#x27;t going well because the product -- the very idea of it -- was garbage.<p>So, worst case scenario, there are a few more incompetent people in corporations already brimming with bad hires and waste, and they come from different backgrounds. What&#x27;s the problem?')
