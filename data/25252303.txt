However, I do think the younger generation is quite a bit more open than past generations may have been, so I expect things to change slowly over time.<p>Personally, the baseline quality of life I&#x27;m able to live here is quite a bit higher than anywhere I&#x27;ve been in the United States.  Wherever I go, I&#x27;ll be more than satisfied with a group of 5-10 close friends, and in a city like Tokyo over over 14 million people, I can certainly find what I&#x27;m looking for socially, even if not every individual person I encounter is a potential close friend.  I tend to to multicultural events here anyway, where people are predisposed to open themselves up to non-Japanese.')
