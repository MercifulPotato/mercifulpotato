Does that mean I shouldn&#x27;t have bothered?<p>Knowing things allows you to take an opportunity when it presents itself. It&#x27;s really hard to know what opportunities are going to show up or which doors will be the doors that you want to walk through. But having more of those doors open is generally a good thing.<p>Of course, there is an opportunity cost to the time spent learning CS versus other stuff you could be learning. But, personally, I&#x27;ve found the CS stuff I&#x27;ve learned to be both personally rewarding and often helpful to my career in unexpected ways.')
