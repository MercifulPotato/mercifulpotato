To use your variable names, someoneElsesObject is <i>inside</i> mu, and is returned by mu.lock. When it goes out of scope, it will unlock.<p>You can also use defer if you want, but I&#x27;ve never seen it in real code, it&#x27;s more error-prone and not as flexible. You can build it on top of RAII.')
