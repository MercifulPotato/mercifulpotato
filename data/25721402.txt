Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=[25721490], score=None, time=1610320541, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720931, text='&gt; Whether or not that&#x27;s the correct decision, it&#x27;s not an inconceivable design.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble with the part of the design where we recognize that a file is selected (such that pressing &lt;enter&gt; causes a file to open), see the &lt;enter&gt; keypress, and then fire an event saying &quot;open any file, whichever one you feel like&quot; as opposed to &quot;open this file right here, the one we can see is selected&quot;.<p>If, as you maintain, the <i>keystrokes</i> are processed in order, then at the time &lt;enter&gt; is processed, we specifically take notice of which file is selected. (Because, as I said above, we only know that &lt;enter&gt; should open a file at all because we see that a file is selected.) We fire the file-opening event after that. This isn&#x27;t a mistake we can make by accident; we&#x27;d have to be making it on purpose.<p>I can see where the assumption that the keystrokes are being reordered comes from; it&#x27;s <i>much less insane</i> than what you&#x27;re proposing.')
