Item(by='username90', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605509806, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25107803, text='&gt; This whole time estimation thing is akin to predicting when the next hurricane or earthquake will occur.<p>This myth needs to die. Can you predict if an item will take closer to a month or a decade? If true then it is far easier to predict than hurricanes or earthquakes. You might not make predictions as accurate as management wants all the time, but most can predict how long things will take within a factor of 3x or so and it will be within that margin most of the time, a person who could do that for hurricanes or earthquakes would be the greatest genius in history.<p>And yes as you get more skilled your predictions will become more accurate. Hence accurate predictions being a sign of skill.')
