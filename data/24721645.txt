So you want to put business people in prison because they supply customers with products that they genuinely enjoy? I enjoy soda, I enjoy being able to drive, I enjoy occasionally smoking, I enjoy air conditioning my home. Perhaps I should go to jail too?<p>If you tell me your job, I could also make up ridiculous reasons about how you&#x27;re personally responsible for starving children, or destroying the environment, or putting the public&#x27;s safety at risk.<p>If you want regulation, pass laws. Don&#x27;t go starting corporate witch-hunts by politically motivated completely unaccountable prosectors.<p>You can&#x27;t participate in civil society if your only solution to problems is &quot;let&#x27;s throw everyone in jail for doing things I don&#x27;t like!&quot; And the outrageous unhinged rhetoric: &quot;poising children&quot;, &quot;killing millions&quot;,  and &quot;destroying the planet&quot;... it&#x27;s obvious what type of leader you&#x27;d be if you ever got any power.')
