Dependency injection seems to me to replicate some of the features of interfaces while introducing complexity because the injection is indirect -- instead of having code that initializes a different object, it all happens dynamically during runtime using reflection. An antipattern as far as I&#x27;m concerned. It seems to achieve little or no gain at a very high cost.')
