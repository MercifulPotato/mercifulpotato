Item(by='dvt', descendants=None, kids=[25901013], score=None, time=1611562092, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25894819, text='&gt; Integer counts and succession seem like human constructs to me.<p>There&#x27;s definitely some &quot;elementary&quot; mathematical concepts that seem native to our universe. For example, in outer space stuff tends to come together in ways that approximates spheres. We see lattices in crystalline solids all the time. There&#x27;s naturally-occurring fractals all over the place. The existence of fractals -- snowflakes, trees, broccoli -- seems to &quot;embed&quot; a successor (to iterate over generations), so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a human construct.')
