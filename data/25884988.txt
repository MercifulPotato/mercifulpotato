The CDC should&#x27;ve know better; in fact, I think they did. I&#x27;m by no means involved in the medical field, but simple physics tells me that a layer of stuff between me and another person means less of my gems get to them. If you&#x27;re a professional in that area of study, I imagine there&#x27;s zero doubt that masks are the right choice. No downside, only upside. By similar logic, Fauci knew. Then at some point it seemed like he realized he would probably get fired no matter what he said, so he grew a pair and started speaking truth.')
