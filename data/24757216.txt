The closest mailbox to my house, for example, is on an unremarkable parking lot in about a mile from my home, in geographical distance, and about two miles if you follow the roads. And I live in relatively dense suburb. If someone lives in a more rural setting, it could easily be further and harder to locate, especially if you aren&#x27;t good with online searches (I would never think to go look for my closest mailbox in that specific location otherwise, there may be some logic in why it&#x27;s there but I for sure don&#x27;t know it). So if you have a location that you know is frequently visited by a lot of people (such as, e.g., church) it may make sense to place a collection point there to ensure you do not lose anyone.')
