I’m so tired of smoke detectors going off when I try to cook a steak indoors, or filling the whole house with burger grease smoke.<p>A real set of commercial kitchen gear, in a room designed for the purpose, to me is the ultimate luxury kitchen.  Beats the hell out of those pot-filler arms and silly islands that pass for such these days in residences.')
