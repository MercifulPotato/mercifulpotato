(I know this article is about schools and in Canada). I&#x27;ve been thinking these tools do violate, but never filed a case alleging it (yet). Specifically, these anti-cheat &quot;algorithms&quot; seem to be &quot;a polygraph, deceptograph, voice stress analyzer, psychological stress evaluator, or any other similar device (whether mechanical or electrical) that is used, or the results of which are used, for the purpose of rendering a diagnostic opinion regarding the honesty or dishonesty of an individual.&quot; I mean, the entire purpose is to determine if the prospective employee is honest. Any thoughts?')
