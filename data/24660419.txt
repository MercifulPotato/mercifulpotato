I couldn&#x27;t afford to be an electronics hobbyist when I was a kid either. The only question here is over whether you actually save any money by using through-hole components. Only the madness of the internet could turn this discussion into a debate about &quot;surface mount privilege&quot;.<p>By focusing only on the transition away from through-hole you&#x27;re missing the fact that <i>everything</i> has got vastly less costly. Temperature controlled irons are much cheaper than they used to be. High quality PCBs are ridiculously cheap. You can buy a microcontroller for $1 that&#x27;s more powerful than an 80s home computer. If you have a limited budget, you want to be doing electronics now, not in the 1980s.<p>I have every sympathy for kids around the world who can&#x27;t afford to pursue their hobbies, but electronics is more affordable and accessible than it&#x27;s ever been.')
