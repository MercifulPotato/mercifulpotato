This wasn&#x27;t quite mentioned in the article. Having faster hardware means you can run automated more security checks and more functional checks, in the same functions that run on less powerful hardware. The performance of your program can also survive some useless checks you&#x27;ve thrown in or some slow algorithm like a bubble sort. This slows down the end program but means that it was much easier to program in the first place. We want to imagine that the extra processing power we&#x27;re building hardware for will be used to do awesome things like machine learning or PQC. But in reality it just lets some lazy idiot like me finish their project faster, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing! Computer technology is expanding like crazy and it&#x27;s almost impossible to keep up with it. Easing the transition from idea to code is worth wasting a bunch of cycles imo.')
