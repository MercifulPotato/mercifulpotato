Alright, if you’re bearish and you think it will go down, put your money on it! Buy put options, sell bitcoin futures, or short bitcoin. Any of it works. Many cryptocurrency exchanges let you short against a USD stablecoin, many brokerages let you sell futures, and half a dozen brokerages let you buy put options (or sell call options). But don’t put any more money on your bet than you’re willing to lose!<p>Heck I’ll even give you an offer, if you want to let me know what your position is, I’ll take the other side!<p>Put your money where your mouth is.')
