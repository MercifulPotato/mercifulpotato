I&#x27;ve ranted on HN about bad documentation in programming before (Lisp being a notable target of my ire recently), and I&#x27;m by no means an expert.  But when you have someone who by his own admission can&#x27;t install node.js, pip, or ruby and yet claims<p>&gt;Because I love building things using code.<p>I mean, someone who &quot;builds things using code&quot; should be able to install ruby.  I&#x27;ve never even attempted to use ruby, don&#x27;t even know what its syntax looks like, but I guarantee you it can be installed by something akin to<p><pre><code>    $ apt install ruby\n</code></pre>\nI can&#x27;t even fathom how a person who has allegedly built things with code can &quot;try and fail&quot; to accomplish this.')
