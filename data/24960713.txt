Most people, given the opportunity, would opt to take the day off whenever they felt like it and come in and leave work as they please. Creatives seem to propose these ideas as universal, but never give even a passing mention about work that is necessarily shift-based. The handwavy answer is &quot;oh we&#x27;ll incentivize that&quot; or &quot;oh we&#x27;ll automate it so they don&#x27;t have to do shift work!&quot; They should just be honest and say that they want special privileges for work and aren&#x27;t concerned about putting any further thought into it.<p>Anyway, this tweet is really someone trying to turn the thought &quot;I don&#x27;t really like my work schedule&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Some people don&#x27;t like their work schedule&quot; into something profound.')
