I don&#x27;t understand how anyone thinks this plan can involve lowering rates, which would crash asset prices, and trigger a wave of defaults leading to a recession (lower income, less spending, lower prices, and less jobs).<p>Notice that assets are conveniently not included in Central Banks&#x27; measures of inflation. Assets can inflate to infinity. It&#x27;s irrelevant. The Fed&#x27;s goal isn&#x27;t to prevent wealth inequality. It&#x27;s to keep CONSUMER prices steadily increasing and people employed. House prices, bitcoin, and meme stocks aren&#x27;t in the consumer price index. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;re appreciating rapidly.<p>Mortgage payments are included in the price indexes, though! They happen to make up a big chunk of the ratio, too. And guess what? Central Banks are making them cheaper for 90% of home owners (now ~67% of the population) by artificially manipulating rates to make their payments lower.<p>What does that mean? The more central banks lower rates and the higher home prices climb, the more likely &quot;inflation will continue to be stubbornly low&quot;.<p>Central banks aren&#x27;t normalizing rates any time soon. They&#x27;re much more likely to print a ton more money because people AREN&#x27;T spending more money on airplane tickets, gasoline, bananas, and (importantly) their mortgages.<p>The solution to the problem is a bigger problem. When all you have is a hammer everything is a nail.')
