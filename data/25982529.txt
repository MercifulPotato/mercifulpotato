That doesn’t mean all human activity reduces to eating food.<p>&gt; I would strongly disagree that the people running the companies are not there to maximise profit: appointments are very often explicitly made for financial reasons.<p>Granted this is <i>sometimes</i> true, but you are just leaving out the fact that in order to increase profit, the business generally has to offer more value too.  There are exceptions to this, but it is generally true.<p>And when they stop adding value or fall behind, unless there is a true monopoly which none of the tech companies have, they become vulnerable to competition.<p>&gt; &gt; The vast majority of companies in a capitalist system are small to medium sized businesses that are constrained in how much money they can ever make.<p>&gt; Right, but the ones who are the original subject are not small to medium sized businesses, and they either are not heavily constrained by this, or actively lobby to remove restrictions that do constrain them.<p>This is just affirming the consequent again, making the assumption that these business all have maximizing profit as their primary goal and that the only reason they haven’t grown giant is constraints.<p>But the elephant in the room is that if profit were the only motive, nobody would bother to start businesses in fields that aren’t very profitable.  The fact that they do, is an existence proof that people run businesses for reasons other than profit maximization.')
