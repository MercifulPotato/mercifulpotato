Clearly the government is allocating more money back into NASA and space exploration so instead of working together, SpaceX will probably hard pressed to get the amount of funding they need from the government now:<p><i>The President&#x27;s Budget Request (PBR) for NASA was released on 11 March 2019, and originally proposed $21.019 billion for fiscal year 2020. A supplemental request was released in May 2019 that proposed an additional $1.6 billion to support an acceleration of the lunar landing goal to 2024. All numbers for the PBR listed on this page include the supplemental request.</i><p><i>- $546.5 million for the Mars Exploration Program, of which $278 million is for the Mars 2020 rover and $109 million is to begin formulation of the next mission in a Mars Sample Return campaign.</i><p><i>- Moves the launch date of the Europa Clipper mission from the late-2020s to 2023, and proposes using a commercial rocket instead of an SLS for launch.</i><p><i>- Walks back the proposal to transition the ISS to commercial operations by 2025: &quot;By 2025, the Budget envisions commercial capabilities on the International Space Station as well as new commercial facilities and platforms to continue the American presence in Earth orbit.&quot;</i><p><i>- Increases funding for technology development through the Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative, &quot;which aims to spur the creation of novel technologies needed for lunar surface exploration and accelerate the technology readiness of key systems and components.&quot;</i><p><i>- NASA is proposing &quot;increasing facility maintenance activities at all Centers to reduce risk to missions. Increased funding will help reduce the significant backlog of facility maintenance projects and requirements.&quot;</i><p><i>- Proposes $1 billion for a Human Lunar Landing System &quot;to enable NASA to begin supporting the development of commercial human lunar landing systems. This acquisition strategy will allow NASA to purchase an integrated commercial lunar lander that will transport astronauts from lunar orbit to the lunar surface and back.&quot;</i>')
