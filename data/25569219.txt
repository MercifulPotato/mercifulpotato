Presumably the legal standard for guacamole is that it contains avocado, without further specification. So obviously supermarkets, knowing that most Dutch people there haven&#x27;t a clue what guacamole <i>is</i>, created the cheapest sauce imaginable.<p>Another story: the process of standardizing chocolate at the EU level was a long one because each country had different national standards. The biggest talking point, IIRC, was whether or not it was acceptable to use non-cocoa fat (keep in mind that adding fat from other sources would often be cheaper). Note that whichever option would be picked, the chocolate industries of the nations with the &quot;opposing&quot; regulation felt like they would lose:<p>- if added fat was allowed, the chocolate from countries where this wasn&#x27;t allowed nationally would be more expensive and have trouble competing<p>- if added fat wasn&#x27;t allowed, the chocolate from countries where this was the norm could not be exported')
