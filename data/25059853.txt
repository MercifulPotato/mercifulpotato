They don&#x27;t just oppose wearing masks, they violently and angrily oppose it.  They make a big point out of not wearing masks.  Anyone who writes an article like this suggesting that I need to compromise with political opposition needs to start here, and explain to me what I need to change about my own behavior in order to meet sociopathy &#x27;in the middle&#x27;.  Sure, mask wearing isn&#x27;t a perfect left&#x2F;right venn diagram, but societal issues and political issues are very much tied together (see religion, abortion, LGBT rights, etc.).<p>I will argue the reason this happens is not because of bad marketing by &quot;Democrats&quot;, &quot;liberals&quot;, or scientists, but because misinformation is highly effective, and backed by what could be one of the most advanced algorithms in the world: The facebook addiction algo.  It is as much a human programming tool as anything that has ever existed, and I wonder if society can maintain stability while it prints money.')
