The starting point you linked to talks about when to do linear searches. Anyone with some experience knows that stuff. It&#x27;s a good thing to tell undergrads in case they missed it, but Blow always acts like he&#x27;s some rebel and conventional wisdom has it all wrong, which isn&#x27;t really the case. Conventional wisdom says there&#x27;s a place for linear searches (after all, lsearch()).<p>Anyway, he&#x27;s just wrong about long functions being a-ok. I suspect he doesn&#x27;t write many unit tests. This is the main benefit of separating the code into smaller functions. You can test each. Even if it&#x27;s just parsing an image file header.<p>That some of the folks here think smaller functions are useless because they would only be called from from one function just shows they don&#x27;t write enough tests.')
