M1 is a 5nm process. Intel is struggling to catch up to TSMC&#x27;s 7nm process<p>- more efficient transistors. 7nm uses finFet. M1 probably uses GAAFET, which means you can cram more active gate volume in less chip footprint. This means less heat and more speed<p>- layout. M1 is optimized for Apple&#x27;s use case. General purpose chips do more things, so they need more real estate<p>- specialization. M1 offloads <i>oodles</i> of compute to hardware accelerators. No idea how their code interfaces with it, but I know lots of the demos involve easy-to-accellerate tasks like codecs and neural networks<p>- M1 has tons of cache, IIRC, something like 3x the typical amount<p>- some fancy stuff that allows them to really optimize the reorder buffer, decoder, and branch prediction, which also leverages all that cache')
