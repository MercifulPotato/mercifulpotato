I think he was the best candidate for the current moment.<p>People have a tendency towards &quot;visionary&quot; politicians, who arrive with agendas and strive to make them reality. Politicians who &quot;flip flop&quot; are derided, because changing your position is a sign that you never had real ideals.<p>But I think we have this backwards—in a representative democracy, the job of a politician is to <i>represent</i> the electorate! The ideal politician, then, would be an empty vessel, who was willing to move to wherever the people are.<p>And that&#x27;s exactly who Biden is. He&#x27;s always been a centrist democrat, but his &quot;center&quot; moves alongside his party. Biden also believes that governing is fundamentally about building coalitions, not smothering the other side.<p>I am worried that Republicans may simply be unwilling to make any deals, no matter how hard Biden tries or what compromises he&#x27;s willing to make. But, <i>if</i> anyone can do it—and that&#x27;s a very, <i>very</i> big &quot;if&quot;—then Biden probably can.')
