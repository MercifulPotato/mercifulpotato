Anyone who wants to manage academic research, technical documentation, textbooks, or web-based reading to build a personal knowledge base.<p>Polar is an integrated reading environment similar to your IDE that you use for writing code.  Think of it like Visual Studio or IntelliJ but for books, web content, PDFs, EPUBs, etc.<p>What makes Polar special is that we’ve built an integrated workflow so that you can read, annotate (make highlights, add comments, pagemarks etc), and convert anything to flashcards. You can then use spaced repetition to review your material directly in Polar or sync it to Anki.<p>My co-founder and I have been working tirelessly on this since the lockdown started to get this shipped.<p>This release represents everything we’ve learned since 1.0 and includes:<p>- Dark mode!! This was by far our #1 requested feature<p>- Both EPUB and PDF supported (originally it was just PDF)<p>- Web pages capture content using Mozilla readability, then saving them to EPUB<p>- Web capture works entirely from our chrome extension so that your cookies, etc get captured too<p>- Easy reading management with flagging, tagging, archiving, pagemarks to mark specific sections in the book, and more<p>- Improved annotations and highlights management, including area highlights, annotation tags, margin notes, etc<p>- One-click flashcards directly from annotations<p>- We’ve greatly improved our Anki sync to make it more reliable, faster, and has more features like support for cloze deletions, front and back cards, HTML, etc.<p>What’s more, Polar is open source so you don’t have to risk being locked into a platform you don’t control!<p>We want to make obtaining an education as easy as possible. In addition, it shouldn’t cost a fortune to get a decent education. Be it tuition or overpriced textbooks. This is why we are building Polar with the vision to truly democratize education.<p>This is still early stage for us of course. Some of the upcoming features will include mobile apps, integrations with tools like Zotero, and much more.<p>If you’re someone who reads a lot and likes to remember the material, give Polar a shot! For power users, we also have a premium version with up to 500 GB of storage. For HN readers, we are doing a 20% discount promotion for a year-long subscription. Use the code hackernews20 to take advantage of that<p>We would love to hear what you think about Polar!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18219960" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18219960</a>')
