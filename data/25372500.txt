Facebook is very much a communications platform that determines what its users get to see. In that sense, Facebook exercises editorial control over its content, and to its users it makes no difference whether that control is automated or manual. Therefore it doesn&#x27;t matter whether we classify Facebook as a &quot;journalist&quot;, the damage done by Facebook&#x27;s editorial control is the same.')
