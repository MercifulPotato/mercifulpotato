Some thoughts...<p>Rust is a blessing and curse. I seems like the obvious choice for data pipelines, but everything big currently exists in Java and the small stuff is in Javascript, Python or R. Maybe this will slowly change, but it&#x27;s a big ship to turn. I&#x27;m hopeful that tools like this and Balista [1] will eventually get things moving.<p>Since the Rust community is relatively small, language bindings would be very helpful. Being able to configure pipelines from Java or Typescript(!) would be great.<p>Or maybe it&#x27;s just that this form of computation is too foreign. By the time you need it, the project is so large that it&#x27;s too late to redesign it to use it. I&#x27;m also unclear on how it would handle changing requirements and recomputing new aggregations over old data. Better docs with more convincing examples would be helpful here. The GitHub page showing counting isn&#x27;t very compelling.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ballista-compute&#x2F;ballista" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ballista-compute&#x2F;ballista</a>')
