Or what about all of the PhD students in Field X, where X is not virology but some other thing that will be at the focal point of the next crisis but which everyone today thinks is unnecessary and figures we should stop over-produce PhDs for? 12 months ago you could probably come to a place like HN, complain that you can&#x27;t find a good paying job with your phd in coronaviruses, and be told that academia is a pyramid scheme, that no one owes you anything and you should just learn to code and go work on a labor law arbitrage product at the center of an even bigger pyramid scheme.<p>Since we&#x27;re on a technology forum, what about the engineers who implement the software&#x2F;hardware that&#x27;s used to manufacture PPE, or run simulations to help design mRNA vaccines, or write firmware for the machinery and devices used to mass produce vaccines? Or even more mundane but none-the-less useful stuff like designing and implementing intuitive UX for no-contact payment methods?<p>Anyways, what&#x27;s the point of drawing this line between &quot;useful resource&quot; and &quot;everyone else&quot;? What if the role of government were to treat humans citizens with natural rights that should be protected by law, instead of as economic resources to be deployed?<p>Also, have you asked any essential workers how they feel about being treated as a useful resource? Instead of, you know, a human with natural and legal rights?<p>Perhaps judges don&#x27;t need special treatment. Maybe, perhaps, personal privacy is incredibly important component of human dignity.')
