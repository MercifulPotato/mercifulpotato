She was an artist (used mostly Adobe) and wanted it for the aesthetics and was adamant to learn to use it and I had to guide her though tear-filled painful year long process of adjusting to macos ... &#x27;quirks&#x27;<p>Just to clarify, tears weren&#x27;t induced by me. I was coming when the tears started flowing to offer solutions and emotional support.<p>She persevered but I think she never was as efficient with mac as she was with windows previously. And I never stopped being occasionally called to task of researching and resolving some inanity.<p>For me personally macos was terrible until I found Terminal. Then I just concluded it&#x27;s just kind of linux with very bad gnome-like gui window and file managers.<p>I know it&#x27;s just my preference but learning gui with windows and then moving to macos for some advanced users is sheer pain that never subsides and some things just don&#x27;t work (for some definitions of &quot;work&quot; like in the article we are commenting).<p>As for the details I remember that on MacOS when you drag and dropped a folder somewhere where folder of the same name already existed, then sub-folders were not merged. Just replaced. So you were loosing files in target location that were not present in source location. That behavior is highly unexpected and destructive for someone coming from windows.<p>If you select 100 files and right-click &gt; show info, you get 100 popups ... hardly desirable.')
