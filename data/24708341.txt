Consumers are not left high and dry if a manufacturer screws them over or was incompetent (such as design defects). Remedies are on sliding scales commensurate with the situation.<p>This is probably partially why I&#x27;m getting downvoted. Cultural differences. Americans are not aware of what&#x27;s possible when things are actually fair for the consumer. They&#x27;re used to &#x27;tough luck&#x27; culture.<p>Upon further reading, I&#x27;m concluding this might not be a massive problem with other precautions in place, but the valid discussion point still remains. If a manufacturer designs a product which turns out to have a problem caused to the consumer which breaches reasonable expectations of its usability, and either needs repairing &#x2F; recalling &#x2F; replacing &#x2F; refunding, many countries offer resource to the consumer. Under this principle, I wonder about unpatchable hardware security defects which cause a major problem...it needs to be explored more.')
