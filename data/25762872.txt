Growing up in this age, it&#x27;s impossible to avoid online interactions of some kind.  So, it&#x27;s better if children learn how to use technology &#x2F; media &#x2F; internet responsibly in a controlled environment.  You&#x27;re like the guard rails in a bowling alley :)<p>One approach might be to let them use TikTok or whatever app is popular, and just try to get them to learn to self-identify 1) how long they spend on the app, 2) how using the app made them feel, and 3) whether or not time on the app took time away from something else they might enjoy.  Help them learn identify the positive aspects and the negative aspects of the platform, and only consider a full ban if you start seeing extremely problematic patterns.<p>If you have any personal self-improvement goals, it might also mean a lot to your kids if you make a habit of sharing your progress with them (in a way they can understand at their age).<p>Good luck :)')
