But it&#x27;s a gamble with more than just Teslas stock, that is what makes Elon an unethical sociopath here...<p>Waymo&#x27;s approach is assuredly safer, there is still the possibility of technical glitches but it the approach doesn&#x27;t create more problems with humans than it solves.<p>Yes, sure, humans can be dangerous, but if that&#x27;s the problem then it&#x27;s safest to just not get on the road period, kinda negates the whole point of an FSD though...')
