Many people are selling their DVD&#x2F;BluRay collections on eBay as bundles. With the rise of streaming services, there is usually not a whole lot of competition on these auctions.<p>I somehow managed to get 30 pretty decent movies&#x2F;series on DVD and 20 on BluRay for 25â‚¬ including shipping.<p>Sure, these are usually not very new movies, but I like to watch older movies and its a lot better than subscribing to dozens of streaming services just to watch one specific movie.<p>As for comfort, sure DVDs are not as comfortable as clicking on Netflix, but if you have a decent NAS at home anyways, Plex still makes a great experience.')
