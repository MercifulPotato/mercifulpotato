The app is <i>approved</i> and the app starts to build an organic following. At some later date, and without any explicit changes to the app or to the terms, Apple decides that the app is in violation of the terms for information that was available upon review. The developer and app are unfortunately the ones to pay the cost, as the organic growth is deterred. Will the new app be able to recapture the same market share? Hard to say. Regardless of Apple&#x27;s action in this case, I think it would be in the company&#x27;s best interest to consider the developer&#x27;s experience when proceeding with issues like this.')
