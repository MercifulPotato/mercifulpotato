But it&#x27;s also probably the absolutely least productive programming language currently in use. Anything which doesn&#x27;t involve twiddling bits or calling a function is tedious to write and hard to use.<p>If you come from Python you&#x27;ll have a shock when you see how little one line of C will get you. C++ and Rust don&#x27;t suffer from this problem. You can go really low level, but you can also build abstractions and perhaps more importantly use existing ones.')
