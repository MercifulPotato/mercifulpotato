People even claim that objects or they by themselves cure diseases.<p>If not much money or effort has been put into a &#x27;treatment&#x27; you have reasons to sceptical, don&#x27;t you think? It&#x27;s like working in the financial services and someone is trying to sell you a $10 e-book that will make you rich in 1 year. It could do the trick but I bet you would be sceptical.<p>Testing&#x2F;clinical trials usually cost a lot and even if the treatment it&#x27;s not great, at least you have some hard data that you can rely on.')
