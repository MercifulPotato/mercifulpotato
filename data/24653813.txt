The net I was using would do it&#x27;s best guess first, then present a limited set of options for me to choose from when it didn&#x27;t know what to do. In general, its first pass would immediately make human faces look correct, but leave everything else really desaturated.<p>I think some of it comes down to the fact that convnets are really good at recognizing human &quot;shapes&quot; (faces, silhouettes, etc) and also the valid color space for human skin tone is pretty constrained if the photo was well lit and you have the luminance value for a grayscale image.<p>The network was particularly bad at getting the colors of balloons in a picture. I don&#x27;t know what the real colors were, but the network was trying to tell me 4 of the balloons in a picture were pale yellow and beige while one was a super saturated red.')
