Main problem was proof of address, I couldn&#x27;t proof it because I didn&#x27;t receive the utility bills and&#x2F;or contract as my employer was paying it. Even having money outside UK didn&#x27;t count at the end my employer had to write a letter to proof I had a job, and lived at address X and then I got a shitty bank account were I could only use the bank&#x27;s ATMs. Luckily a half year later I could upgrade to a normal account once I was able to get a mobile phone plan (similar proof of address issue)')
