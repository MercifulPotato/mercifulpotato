Not just so I don&#x27;t hear my neighbors, but also so they don&#x27;t hear me, since I make music ;)<p>At my current place I&#x27;ve pretty much concluded that anything but deep bass just doesn&#x27;t transfer. Even at 5 in the morning, I can listen to stuff at a reasonable listening volume without disturbing my neighbor, as long as I&#x27;m not pumping out bass below 80Hz or so. And the neighbor recently got a dog and I haven&#x27;t heard her bark even once when she&#x27;s home :)')
