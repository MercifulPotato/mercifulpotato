If my product focuses on a very specific audience (say medicine), but also exposes a way for doctors to store arbitrary key-value pairs, could that be argued in court to be competition?<p>The definition of competition in the Polyform Shield license is never explicitly stated, and in fact, it specifically calls out that &quot;Applications can compete with services&quot;.<p>Whereas the MIT and Apache license are pretty explicitly clear in what the terms of use are, Polyform seems to be fairly vague there, which is potentially something you wouldn&#x27;t want for a legal license.')
