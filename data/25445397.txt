Item(by='liminal', descendants=None, kids=[25446228], score=None, time=1608139823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25443152, text='&quot;Quantitative improvement&quot; is table stakes that I worry have been abandoned with the jettisoning of the Servo team. &quot;Technological pessimism&quot; is a differentiating strategy, but ultimately dooms them to the small subset of users who understand and care about privacy at a deep level. &quot;All encompassing&quot; is a death march. All is infinite and Mozilla can&#x27;t afford to implement everything hoping something turns out to be valuable (Google OTOH can bankrupt competition with this strategy). &quot;A better browser&quot; is where I think Mozilla should focus their attention. They were doing that with their lab experiments, but abandoned them before they could become valuable. Doing this approach well requires commitment to do enough of them that a vision coalesces and then more commitment to see it through. Mozilla used to be audacious enough to invent a new programming language in order to build a better browser. Now they seem to have turned their backs on that initiative and I&#x27;m left wondering if they have any guts left at all.')
