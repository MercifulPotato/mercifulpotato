English is not my first language. Even though I don&#x27;t have any issues in reading English books, I was not able to see the &quot;satirical&quot; aspects. Up until now, I&#x27;ve generally been able to distinguish between satire &#x2F; sarcasm &#x2F; irony etc.<p>If anyone can shed some light on how to &quot;see&quot; the satirical aspects, I&#x27;d be really grateful. :)')
