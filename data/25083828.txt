The tipper &quot;feels&quot; good about tipping, the same way people donate or buy because of donations when there are such campaigns. For a lot of people the utility of that is close to 0, so they don&#x27;t tip. For some its very high.<p>So it makes sense to have tipping as a way to implement price differentiation.')
