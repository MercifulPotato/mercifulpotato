Item(by='gregmac', descendants=None, kids=[25572448], score=None, time=1609263619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25571834, text='&gt; There&#x27;s some truth here, but it&#x27;s important not to use anecdotes too much to guide intuition because the sample size is often too small and too biased.<p>In a community like HN there&#x27;s also kind of a &quot;meta-anecdote&quot; that emerges. If there was a link, you&#x27;d expect to see at least <i>someone</i> posting an ancedote about how their friend got into violent games and then became violent themselves; instead it&#x27;s mainly the opposite.<p>I&#x27;m still not arguing this observation is scientifically rigorous in any way whatsoever, merely that multiple ancedotes can be more useful than a single one. There could be other reasons such as those that are violent or hang out with those that are don&#x27;t post on HN - but that also hints there is something more to it then just or even the violent games themselves.')
