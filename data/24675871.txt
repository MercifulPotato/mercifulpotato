If a u32 is defined in the file and you&#x27;ve only got doubles to work with it&#x27;s a given you&#x27;ll have to deal with it in your tool specific validation. For everyone else it&#x27;s well defined.<p>The downside is it&#x27;s a bit more verbose and if you have all of that info already it&#x27;s pretty easy to jump to just using a binary format which will be more efficient anyways.')
