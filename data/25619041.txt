Yes, the A-10 does &quot;fine&quot; in that situation.<p>It does not do anything approaching &quot;fine&quot; against modern air-defense emplacements. Or against air-to-air missiles, whether radar guided or infrared. (those engine-hiding undulations won&#x27;t do much against an all-aspect missile from the front)<p>And while accepting 1:1 losses against a peer state in a war might be the reality, I&#x27;m pretty sure the A-10 wouldn&#x27;t manage such a record in hostile airspace. (That&#x27;s if you count &quot;tanks&quot; or &quot;infantry&quot; on the opposite side of the ledger, of course - purely air to air the A-10 would lose to the average 3rd gen fighter as far as I&#x27;m aware)')
