There&#x27;s absurd cognitive dissonance many people that somehow this shouldn&#x27;t&#x2F;wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>The controversy shouldn&#x27;t be that Chinese system could implement basic epidemiologic responses, but currently, many western systems are culturally and politically unable to, even during a (hopefully) once in a generation crisis. Systems needs to be flexible enough suspend liberties and adopt certain authoritarian principles periods of exception, see South Korea and Taiwan whose response was much closer to Chinese authoritarianism than not. This isn&#x27;t to suggest the west is brittle, but there are qualities of a pandemic that asymmetrically exploits vulnerabilities in liberal societies.')
