With Maven it&#x27;s more-or-less standardised, because custom plugins are rare (I&#x27;ve come across just one in 20 years, and I wrote it for a special purpose). Embedded Ant was more common, but thankfully rare now. Everyone just uses the same handful of plugins in my experience.<p>Agree that Groovy is awesome.... as a compliment to Java. I&#x27;d learn to dislike it quickly though if I had to write an entire project with it.')
