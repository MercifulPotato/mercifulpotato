Rust async&#x2F;await is a fancy way to write poll&#x2F;epoll. It can limit the amount of time your program is blocked on IO (insofar as the implementation is as you would expect it (not guaranteed by the language)), but it will not do parallelism. For example you wouldn&#x27;t async&#x2F;await a prime number calculation--you&#x27;d have to use OS threads.')
