It&#x27;s just in a much different category than a nice burger.<p>I also like to check out McDonald&#x27;s in different countries. Sometimes in Japan you can get an Idaho burger, which has a hashbrown patty. And sometimes they have an &quot;adult creampie&quot; dessert (yikes). Indian McDonald&#x27;s has masala chicken and veggie burgers, and Israeli McDonald&#x27;s has $15 giant gourmet burgers.')
