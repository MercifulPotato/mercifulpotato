However, some of them, like OpenID connect are not required for several apps that want just simple email password login (an example). This is where our idea of modules (or recipes) come from. If you choose a module which has nothing to do with OpenID connection (or similar spec), then you do not have to deal with it&#x27;s complexity.<p>So essentially the way we hope to solve this problem is through our modular architecture. You can start off simple and then just keep adding the modules you need instead of it all rolled into one implementation')
