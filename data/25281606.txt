It pauses randomly in my browser and Google Home. The &quot;radio&quot; feature repeats songs like crazy, the queuing is super confusing and inconsistent (it depends on the &quot;type&quot; of playlist you are listening to IIUC) and it consistently recommended me the same songs.<p>It had some nice features too, but I decided to quit. Now I&#x27;m just listening to my collection of mp3s but not super happy.')
