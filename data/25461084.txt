The bad thing is when it would be a bug if a value is null, but the language still allows it to be a null.<p>By verifying that only the values for which it would be valid for it to be null are ever null, you can catch a large category of bugs automatically. You can catch even more bugs if the language forces you to check whether the value is null if you are dealing with a value that is allowed to be null.')
