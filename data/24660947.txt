I used to use Gnus, but it&#x27;s (a) really slow and (b) causes Emacs to freeze (since it&#x27;s written in Emacs Lisp, which isn&#x27;t concurrent); in contrast mu4e delegates work to a separate process, and is generally faster (e.g. using an indexed Xapian DB).<p>I&#x27;m a sucker for mindlessly checking feeds, so I only poll feeds every few hours to avoid a drip-drip of new posts throughout the day. I do this with a cron job (now a systemd service). This job also converts RSS and ATOM to maildir, since that&#x27;s all mu4e supports.<p>It turns out there are loads of programs for polling+downloading+caching+converting news feeds, but I couldn&#x27;t find any that <i>just</i> convert; so I made my own by stripping down one of those existing projects ( <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chriswarbo.net&#x2F;git&#x2F;feed2maildir" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chriswarbo.net&#x2F;git&#x2F;feed2maildir</a> ).')
