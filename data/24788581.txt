Item(by='kybernetikos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602769451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24786721, text='I have a multifunction A3 printer &#x2F; scanner from a major manufacturer with an auto feeder and 3 other trays&#x2F;inputs.  It has USB input, network cable, wifi, internal tanks, fax capability, a colour touch screen....<p>The hardware works very well.  The software is weird and inconsistent.  It can do some very useful things if you access the scanning function in one, incredibly convoluted way, but not in other ways.  It can scan to a network share, but you have to put the password in every time. It&#x27;s frustrating because it&#x27;s so good and so bad at the same time.<p>I would love to have an open source firmware in it.')
