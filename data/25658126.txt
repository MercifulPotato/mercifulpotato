I&#x27;m sure we will see the most silly examples from gmail, we have to, because they have the most users, and so the greatest chance of hitting strange edge-cases.<p>And with edge-case, I don&#x27;t meen technical ones only, but also customer-support ones.. If you&#x27;ve got support for many more people, then more people are going to have a bad experience, and even more likely that someone has a rare (in percent of total experiences) terrible one.<p>I&#x27;m the one entirely against any cloud stuff, I just don&#x27;t buy the argument that other providers are necessarily better.\nThe bigger you are, the more interactions you do with your clients, the more likely that you will mess it up big-time for some of them.')
