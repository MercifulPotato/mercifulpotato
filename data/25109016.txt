I reflect on depressive times and I really was in denial; that&#x27;s been clear to me in many moments. I&#x27;d speak to people like everything was AWESOME after leaving my home from a morning of intense self-loathing and resentment - the kinds of gut-wrenching thoughts and feelings you&#x27;d reserve for someone you hate with all your heart. And I&#x27;d kind of believe myself for even minutes at a time. The denial was strong. Denial or pure escapism, I&#x27;m not really sure.<p>What else can you do when you&#x27;re hurting like that though. I mean, if you don&#x27;t have the tools to cope, the mental capacity to endure much more, the experience to draw on to recognize the patterns and trajectories and so on. You&#x27;re practically forced to deny or defer it when you&#x27;re unequipped to manage it.')
