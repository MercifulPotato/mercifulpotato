TAFE rules the region. They then became a shareholder of AGCO and is able to export equipment everywhere. These are very fruitful partnerships. While TVS group of companies had partnerships(mostly Japanese. I am slightly familiar with how these partnerships are crafted..having audited a few TVS group companies way back when I was in India) for automobiles, Amalgamations Group had a more varied interest..ranging from tractor parts to Diesel engines to manufacturing vehicle batteries.<p>Amalgamations<i></i> is a tremendous success story. It was founded in my hometown and we are very proud of it.<p>It is just my bias but I find TAFE better than Mahindra. Mahindra just seems ..flimsy?<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tafe.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tafe.com&#x2F;</a><p><i></i> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Amalgamations_Group" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Amalgamations_Group</a>')
