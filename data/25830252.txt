To say we understand things intrinsically and not through a mechanical, artificial process sounds wrong. The ideal AI would be equal to us, and equally flawed from any sort of objective existence.<p>Discussion of plant feelings strikes me as a dumbed down Chinese room. I&#x27;d say plants are just stimulus response machines with no option for debate of sentience or awareness. That&#x27;s not to say they&#x27;re not intricate, amazing, or beautiful. But &quot;feelings&quot; imply processing of the feelings at some sort of subjective level, and I don&#x27;t see any reason to believe plants have this.')
