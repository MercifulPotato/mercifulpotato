Just made me think that you probably couldn&#x27;t explain that &quot;paradox&quot; to most 6yo who just about learned to tell left and right apart.<p>A typical 6-year old can say what their left-hand is. But if you tell them to point to MY left hand, they will instead point to my right hand. It takes additional effort and training to teach young children how to see from other people&#x27;s perspective.')
