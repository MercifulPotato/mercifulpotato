It&#x27;s now geared toward dynamically modifying binaries for various purposes from code coverage to fuzzing to performance and memory profiling.<p>There doesn&#x27;t appear to currently be a turn-key solution similar to the original Dynamo.  DynamoRIO could be used to put a small conditional tracing stub at the start of every basic block at application startup time, and then do some binary rewriting, similar to the original Dynamo, but it doesn&#x27;t seem there are downloadable binaries that currently do this.<p>This dynamic optimization would be much easier and lower overhead (but less general) with cooperation from the compiler.')
