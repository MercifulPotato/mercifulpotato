They also advertise on certain category pages (e.g. on the page for all TVs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;geizhals.de&#x2F;?o=36" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;geizhals.de&#x2F;?o=36</a> &quot;featured brand&quot; or &quot;featured merchant&quot;), e.g. with amazon links but only for products where amazon has the lowest prices. Additionally, they probably get some money from their regular ref links (there are even webpages that only have good prices when going directly through the geizhals link; but that&#x27;s no secret since it says so on the product listing on geizhals, so that&#x27;s fair by me also).')
