Shitty high schools. Vastly more than your average Ph.D. in classics in current year ever achieves; you can have a great laugh trolling modern classics profs in the US with latin limericks they can&#x27;t possibly understand. Let alone the algebra parts.<p>I snork at the rest. The present Harvard entrance exam is a great test for social signalling that you&#x27;re stinking rich. Not many actual high school students actually form a non profit and get 1600 SAT or whatever; unless mom and dad are loaded and did it for them.')
