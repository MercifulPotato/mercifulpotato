A high-school student with motivation could understand all of it in about 1 week of work.<p>The key idea here is in Lemma 3.3 which is a simplified presentation of Lehman&#x27;s original idea.  All of the &quot;good&quot; algorithms in this class are exploiting this observation.<p>Hittmeir adds a new ingredient, namely applying &quot;baby-step-giant-step&quot; searching.  And Harvey makes a slightly better parameter choice and strategy than Hittmeir to get his result.<p>The new idea and value to me would be the concise explanation in Lemma 3.3.<p>A lot of the feedback is of the form, &quot;who cares, since it doesn&#x27;t push the state of the art in practical factoring&quot;, but for me, there is art in ideas like this.  Lehman, Hittmeir and Harvey have put forth a really elegant and beautiful line of thought here---that is accessible!---and I hope you can enjoy it without too much worry about how much it is worth.')
