They are hard in the same vein as the questions in an old game show &quot;Are you smarter than a 5th grader&quot; were hard. Meaning that unless you came straight from college alot of the concepts you are not using in industry and have forgot. You won&#x27;t use them at google but I suspect that it has a age bias built in as they favor younger workers.')
