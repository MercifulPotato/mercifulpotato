Because I doubt that the little puck has enough processing power inside it to handle speech recognition.<p>This allows Amazon the ability to continually upgrade their servers, without the need to upgrade the puck.<p>And only when the server detects it’s prompt, “Alexa”, will it send a response back to the puck. This is how the little device appears to be so responsive.<p>And not surprisingly, this bit of functionality is not marketed by Amazon. After all, who the hell in their right mind, would want to be constantly monitored, and have all their private conversations at home be secretly recorded by Amazon.<p>In fact, I suspect that all the voice assistant devices from other manufacturers, like Google, are doing exactly this.')
