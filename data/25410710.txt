What I meant to say was that accessing the <i>value</i> of the slot attribute (to either get or set it) on the instance does not require a dictionary lookup, just an array access. But of course finding out that the string (attribute name) is the name of a slot and getting the slot index does require a dictionary lookup (on the class, as you say).')
