It&#x27;s the means of connecting two dissimilar mechanisms. A translation layer.<p>I&#x27;d have argued it&#x27;s more like copyrighting doorknob placement (opposite hinge, at hand height) and operation (twisting) on doors vs. patenting a novel mechanism inside the doorknob.<p>A football playbook is more like the blueprints of the inside of the doorknob.
