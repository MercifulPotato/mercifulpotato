You could be running 1,000,000 $10&#x2F;mo subs, or 1,000 $1,000&#x2F;mo subs and the cost is the same. This pricing model hits high value subscription companies significantly harder, even though Stripe&#x27;s costs are lower.</i><p>While this is true on some level, the challenge is that we&#x27;d have to set pricing at an inefficient point (i.e. we&#x27;d end up charging more than some businesses can afford to pay and less than others are willing to pay). If we charged $1&#x2F;sub&#x2F;mo (say), $5&#x2F;mo subscriptions would be prohibitively expensive. At the other extreme, if we charged $0.02&#x2F;sub&#x2F;mo per month, it just wouldn&#x27;t make sense to invest as much in improving the product, which would indirectly hurt businesses by depriving them of a counterfactual product that they&#x27;d like to be able to buy. Pricing is obviously always an exercise in trying to find a reasonable trade-off between simplicity &#x2F; optimality and this is our best effort.')
