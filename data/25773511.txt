The biggest highlight of my general career was tower defence rushing unsuspecting human players in Warcraft 3 with orcs.<p>With that said: I think that whenever a human or organization has a stable situation with their current affairs, they can afford to take more risk. Attacking weapons don&#x27;t necessarily make a situation stable, they simply give an edge when you have them. However, when you&#x27;re the only one that has them and are stable enough, then you might be able to annihilate entire civilizations (e.g. the Aztecs versus a few hundred Spanish people). But when more people have them, then they can point them at you, making your own situation more unstable if you provoke those people.')
