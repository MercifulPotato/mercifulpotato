Item(by='abahlo', descendants=None, kids=[25592655], score=None, time=1609422129, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25592428, text='Thanks and I don&#x27;t mind at all!<p>To be honest for the application I didn&#x27;t want to expose a database serial (otherwise you&#x27;d know you&#x27;re user #100, for example) or use UUIDs, so it&#x27;s less about scale and more about obscuring ids. The library is well suited for huge scale scenarios nonetheless.')
