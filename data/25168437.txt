Of course if you don&#x27;t know programming at all it&#x27;s harder (even then, 3 months seems like an awful lot - this year I teach programming to graphic design students and in ~15 hours they are already able to do neat things on their own with p5.js).<p>To give my own experience, I&#x27;m almost exclusively a C++ coder but had to do two Web projects earlier this year, a React one and a custom one, and even though both times it felt like eating nails, it didn&#x27;t take more than a day to &quot;get in&quot; ; I&#x27;m confident that it&#x27;s be the same no matter the language except maybe APL and derivatives :)')
