Everything I read says children under 1 year is at higher risk, but then all the statistics group that higher-risk age group with the lower risk age group 2-4. How am I supposed to understand the risk to my child when I know the stats are including lower-risk populations? How much higher is the risk for 0-1? If anyone has any insights into the under 1 year age group, I would really appreciate it.<p>My understanding is that a vaccine for children will not be available for some time. I will have to make some decisions about daycare this spring and want to make the most informed decision possible.')
