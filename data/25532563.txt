Although some of these things are clearly subjective and can&#x27;t be compared, I think the true mark of a concept living up to its hype is how ubiquitous the approach it pioneered has become. IPhone, for example, can be seen as one clear example of this. The others are a bit harder to verify for their impact.<p>Electricity, cars, reusable rockets I think all belong to this category yet due to their popularity people don&#x27;t even consider them as things that at some point were hyped and critiqued.<p>Opinion of my own is that the actor Daniel Day-Lewis is indeed the greatest actor who has ever lived. It is just his dedication to the craft that sets him apart from the rest so clearly by total immersion to the character which I&#x27;ve never seen anyone else replicate. Many other actors still remain &quot;themselves&quot; in the process but he can truly transform in a way no one else can and with such great range of characters. Granted we do not have accurate historical data over the course of the whole human civilization but well, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good guess.')
