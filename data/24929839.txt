In 2020, we can see this vividly with the coronahysterics causing untold and immeasurable damage to societies with arbitrary and poorly calculated lockdown rules.<p>Sowell argues that these intellectuals believe their excellence in one field gives them the legitimacy to talk in depth about other fields in which they&#x27;re not so excellent - perhaps most notably economics, which is Sowell&#x27;s own field of expertise. In <i>A Vision of the Annointed</i>, he describes how these intellectuals have concocted a fantasy world view which is inconsistent with actual evidence, and the academies work to insulate themselves away from this evidence when it conflicts with their world view. This is true in economics, where the current leading school of thought (MMT) pretends they&#x27;re not just kicking the can down the road, and ignores the works of the Austrian school.<p>When he refers to &#x27;intellectuals,&#x27; he doesn&#x27;t just mean anybody intelligent or accredited with degrees. He is referring to people whose results are just <i>ideas</i>, and not products, inventions or scientific breakthroughs. Many &quot;idea people&quot; ultimately face no consequence upon themselves for their poor ideas; they have no skin in the game and are eager to inflict their world view upon society even if there is collateral damage.<p>A slightly older of his works, <i>A Conflict of Visions</i>, suggests there are two prevailing visions: an unconstrained and a constrained vision. The unconstrained vision is that held by many intellectual elite and largely ignores some aspects of human nature. It believes that people are innately good and well meaning (The just-world fallacy). They don&#x27;t believe that humans should have constraints because given the opportunity, they will act in their own or others&#x27; best interests. The constrained vision is one in which humans believe that man is not innately good and has some bad inside of him. In this vision, it is necessary to have some constraints (laws, fears, etc) so that they act in a manner which is in the best long term interest of themselves or the wider society.<p>In the study of economics, it is not possible to ignore human nature because all economic activity is the result of people taking actions in their own self-interest. Praxeology studies how humans behave, without consideration for their thoughts or speech, but merely how they act in the real world. It argues that what someone does tells you far more than what a person says they will do, and even what they tell themselves.')
