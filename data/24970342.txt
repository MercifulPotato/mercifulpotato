We are developing custom modelling frameworks in collaboration with astrophysicists from Durham, to enable us to model a broader range of the tumour biology than is currently possible, and through that enable accurate predictions of therapy efficacy to be made with less data. Our first product is focussed on helping accelerate the development of cancer drugs before they are used in clinical trials. Our later ambition is to develop a tool which greatly enhances a doctor&#x27;s ability to choose treatment for their cancer patient.<p>We are looking for a software engineer to join the core team as lead developer. The role will involve taking the models developed by our bioinformaticians and turning them into a product. The work will initially involve developing a research platform which runs intensive bioinformatic computations, whilst protecting confidential patient data. Later you and your team will go on to develop a system which receives clinical data from hospitals, runs our models on them, and sends the results back to the doctor. You will ensure the software is highly robust, and is built to medical standards, ensuring patient safety (with help from a regulatory advisor). We intend to hire further software developers, and you will be in charge of building the software team, and providing direction for it.<p>If hired we would be able to offer a competitive salary and stock options. We are flexible on working remotely or on-site. Our tech stack is primarily built around Python and Julia.<p>If interested please contact apply@concr.co')
