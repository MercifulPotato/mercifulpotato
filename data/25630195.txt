Lisps do have a lot of syntax. In the Clojure samples in this blog post alone we have:<p>• Parens<p>• Curly braces<p>• Square brackets (why are they here, if Lisp is just s-exprs?)<p>• Colon-prefixed symbols<p>• Quote-prefixed lists<p>• Functions with names like &gt;!! and -&gt;&gt;<p>That&#x27;s pretty obviously syntax. You could argue it doesn&#x27;t have keywords in the way C-type languages do, but magical functions that are defined as part of the language and should never be changed for all intents and purposes might as well be syntax too. So in the end the difference is kind of academic.')
