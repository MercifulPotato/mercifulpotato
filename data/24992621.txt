That means there is still racketeering and wire fraud charges plus there could have been multiple money laundering charges in the original list.<p>This also doesn&#x27;t include any of the shady behavior in which there were accusations of but weren&#x27;t included in the legal case.  Such as the staff of MegaUpload regularly rummaging through the files of users.  That likely isn&#x27;t technically a crime, but it is something that should certainly be frowned on by the HN community.<p>[2]  - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-newzealand-internet-dotcom-idUSKBN15Z07C" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-newzealand-internet-dotcom...</a>')
