Here&#x27;s the title:<p>&gt; Dog Domestication May Have Begun because Paleo Humans Couldn’t Stomach the Original Paleo Diet<p>If they let the wolves eat the lean meat they didn&#x27;t want, doesn&#x27;t that mean too-much-lean-meat was <i>not</i> a part of &quot;the original paleo diet&quot;? Does she imagine that we <i>had</i> to eat it before we started to domesticate wolves with it?<p>&gt; “Because we humans are not fully adapted to a carnivorous diet, we simply cannot digest protein very well,” Lahtinen says. “It can be very fatal in a very short period of time.”<p>Yes, if you eat all lean meat you won&#x27;t last long on that. But nobody thinks that was the paleo carnivore diet that we adapted to. Our ancestors, if current hunter gathers are a guide, ate nose to tail, prioritizing the fatty parts and eating the lean parts only as necessary, else it became scraps for scavengers.<p>It&#x27;s like saying we&#x27;re not fully adapted to a plant-based diet because it&#x27;s dangerous to eat too much (insert toxic plant food here). Well sure, but that just means we&#x27;re better adapted to other plants or plant parts. Like we&#x27;re better adapted to eating a nose-to-tail animal than just the lean meat.')
