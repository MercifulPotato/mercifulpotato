I remember getting a ballot that was the size of a 4&#x27; x 6&#x27; card.  Put a check next to the candidate you want as the MP in your riding.  Done.<p>The US ones can be multiple pages where you end up voting for a dozen candidates across multiple federal, state and local offices, plus a number of ballot initiatives.  It&#x27;s kind of nuts.<p>But I agree the old fashion paper and pen is the best system.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how theoretically secure some high-tech digital voting system is - unless every voter can understand how it works you&#x27;ll always have people who think it&#x27;s fixed.  Actually, even with paper and pen people will think it&#x27;s fixed, but you at least eliminate a ton of the unknown because of the physical record.')
