It&#x27;s also hard to get enough training examples, especially since you&#x27;d either want these to be in strict logical language or train a system to recognize whether a hundred page proof in natural language is rigorous or not.  So it&#x27;s like a very long maze where noody knows if you&#x27;re getting closer to the exit or not, and in most rooms you have to come up with something original or discover a new dimension.  And there&#x27;s the aspect whereby a lot of significant research is: create a new abstraction, realize and convince others that this abstraction is useful and gives you new intuition that lets you solve new problems.')
