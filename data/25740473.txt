Item(by='delecti', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610411145, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25739222, text='That&#x27;s a good point, but I think it actually services to show just how bad this situation was. It&#x27;s not a stretch to say that faithless electors are a &quot;feature&quot; of the electoral college. One of the stated reasons behind choosing electors rather than voting directly is that the electors could exercise their own discretion in the choice. I agree that it&#x27;s unscrupulous to attempt to coax electors like that, but it&#x27;s at least within the bounds of the framework of presidential elections.<p>This was a crowd of thousands of people, many armed, attempting to interfere with the actual process of counting the votes of those electors. More than a couple members of the crowd had zip ties, which can only be reasonably explained as hostage taking paraphernalia. A literal gallows was erected, and members of the crowd were chanting for violence against Pence and Pelosi (the next two after Trump in the order of succession). A couple IEDs were found on the premise. A police officer was beaten to death. If security hadn&#x27;t managed to evacuate congress and the VP before the crowd got to them, it seems likely that there would have been deaths among them.<p>Treating those two things as equivalent is absurd.')
