Don&#x27;t hold back if you have some criticisms, I will be happy to address them with you. I also know that the claims in the paper are rather bold and might cause some &quot;crackpot alarm bells&quot; going off. Have some patience with it though, I did a PhD and Posdoc in Quantum Gravity so at least I am not your average crackpot. Especially the first derivations in section 2 should be easy enough to follow if you have university level physics or mathematics knowledge. But after you understand that, you understand why complex numbers are used in Quantum Mechanics and where the concept of the density matrix comes from (the density matrix is a generalization of the wave function). Let me know what you think!')
