I purposefully tried to avoid characterizing Cybersyn as a success or failure. There just wasn&#x27;t enough of <i>anything</i> to make sweeping claims. Contrast that with cybernetics or AI, for which the long history of falling short does justify some sweeping, qualitative assessments.<p>I read and enjoyed the book Cybernetic Revolutionaries, which contains the most substantive history of the project. But my critique of the book is that the author left out too much historical material (which will doubtless be lost to history unless she archived her notes and work product somewhere) in service of the author&#x27;s political narrative (which, FWIW, is academic and not partisan as far as I can tell). But that approach makes sense given that 1) the book is really a Ph.D thesis in political science and 2) it&#x27;s difficult to make any deep, qualitative assessments of Cybersyn precisely because not much ever came of it. We can draw some useful conclusions about particular aspects, e.g. regarding data uploading, but they&#x27;re mixed.<p>&quot;CIA-backed coup&quot; implies that the CIA provided material or other substantive support. There&#x27;s no evidence for this whatsoever, nor any reason to believe it existed. Allende&#x27;s short ride was a slowing moving train wreck. (Though, to be clear, that says <i>at</i> <i>least</i> as much about conservative stonewalling as it does the theoretical viability of his policies.) I push back against mentioning of CIA involvement because I think it&#x27;s condescending and, notwithstanding the political leanings of those who like to point it out, reflective of a paternalistic attitude that doesn&#x27;t even have any historic roots--the U.S. never had a relationship with Chile that could even be remotely characterized as imperialist. Allende&#x27;s attempts at socialism failed in Chile because of Chilean politics, for better or worse. Moreover, its history is instructive to Americans precisely because the constellation of political sentiments in many ways mirror (by coincidence, not by a shared political history) those in the U.S. Whenever conservatives friends or acquaintances like to point to, e.g., Chile&#x27;s use of personal savings accounts as a better alternative to Social Security I like to point out that the &quot;success&quot; of Chile&#x27;s system is mostly a myth crafted by conservatives. Conservatives come to wrong conclusions because, knowing that American economists consulted on Pinochet-era economic reforms, they&#x27;re strongly motivated to see in it vindication of their own political preferences as Americans. They really have no interest in knowing anything about the Chilean system, just as mention of the CIA regarding the coup betrays foregone conclusions that have nothing to do with Chile and everything to do with making a point about American politics.')
