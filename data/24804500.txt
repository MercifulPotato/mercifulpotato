Right now courts are applying the liability so broadly that companies aren’t liable even after they are notified about illegal behaviours on their site.  In a court case involving Grindr refusing to take down a profile created by someone’s ex-bf that was being used to harass him, their refusing to so even after contact by lawyers was protected under section 230 and the case was thrown out.  I’d be all for a modified version of section 230 that required sites to have a contact email and made them liable if they don’t address certain issues in an appropriate time period.<p>It’s also worth mentioning that before section 230 if you didn’t moderate you weren’t liable so in certain senses it’s a censorship bill rather than a free speech one since it protects removing speech.  That being said I do understand the need to moderate sites and remove some content, hence my proposal of the modified version rather than a call for its elimination entirely.')
