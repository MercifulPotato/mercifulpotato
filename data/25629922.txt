Was it intended as &quot;look at these stupid ideas like the one you&#x27;ve just suggested&quot;, or something else? If it&#x27;s something else, I&#x27;m not sure I understand what it is from what you&#x27;ve written. Otherwise it feels like a bit of a straw man you&#x27;re arguing against, because I didn&#x27;t understand the blog post in the way you&#x27;re characterising it.')
