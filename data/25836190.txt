I honestly have had mixed Opinions on this, but I finally settled on Dual licensing and&#x2F;or BSL 1.1 as a nice compromise. I think open source developers create a lot of value, and should have the facility to be compensated and have their passion become their job. Plus this whole Re-Licensing trend toward SSPL&#x2F;BSL&#x2F;Dual is IMHO the natural evolution of open-source strategies.')
