In Qu√©bec, plans seems cheaper in general. Koodo has good promos regularly. There was one a couple of weeks ago where you could&#x27;ve got an iPhone 11 for $648 total by staying with them for 2 years.<p>Promo was you pay $288 up front and the rest is paid with the $15 monthly tab on top of a plan, which starts at $40.<p>So for $288 and then $60&#x2F;month you could get an iPhone 11 with unlimited calling&#x2F;SMS and 5Gigs of data.<p>Obviously I know plans are much cheaper still in some other countries, but in Canada that was a good deal.')
