I have worked in large orgs with many developer and engineer titled employees that can’t code at all. Zero coding skills. And their title would be things like “Senior Enterprise Application Engineer”. Unfortunately their resume doesn’t read that differently than a similarly experienced engineer that actually writes code.')
