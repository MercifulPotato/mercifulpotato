Over here (Finland), both are available in shops; the &quot;bilberry&quot; (V. myrtillus) is bought for distribution from people who gather it from forests (often Asian or East European guest workers and even sometimes even retirees who do it for fun and additional income) while V. cyanococcus (V. corymbosum)  is imported from commercial farms in Central and Southern Europe, and I suppose is mechanically harvested.')
