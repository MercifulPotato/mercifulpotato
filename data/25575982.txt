Item(by='dahart', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609281805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25574661, text='If the author is here -- the extra features compared to IQ&#x27;s version are nice! I might make this my bookmarked default version.<p>If interested, here are a few thoughts:<p>- It might be good to link directly to IQ&#x27;s version of GraphToy, rather than his homepage.<p>- I dig the white background option!<p>- The create link feature is a bit smoother than the original.<p>- The download image button is a great idea, though I just realized with both versions you can right click to save the image, without needing a new tab. One thing that occurred to me -- it would be <i>killer</i> if the download image version popped up an SVG render with a higher sampling rate, instead of pixels! A little text or UI could clarify how to save a pixel version vs a vector rendering.<p>- I like the escalator function used to demo the time variable! I&#x27;ve used that very function on ShaderToy.<p>- It would be super nice if the plot window used a flexbox or grid layout to stretch to fill the window. It&#x27;s currently a bit smaller than IQ&#x27;s and doesn&#x27;t resize.<p>- Might also be nice to have the help box be a popup you can click (the way it works in ShaderToy), and maybe put the variables underneath the plot, to allow the plot to expand to basically full screen?')
