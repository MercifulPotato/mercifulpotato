Standards were all about advocating for common interfaces, even if the implementations were proprietary. Proprietary software was more a thing in the 90s and 00s.<p>Nowadays, common practice is to use open <i>implementations</i>, not just open interfaces. Nowadays, we only see widespread initiatives for standardization when people are trying to cement the long-term survival of their implementation&#x27;s interface.<p>See, for example, the Open Container Initiative, put forward by Docker (a company that engineers were concerned about betting the barn on, in 2015).<p>Contrast that with S3, which does <i>not</i> have a corresponding commitment to an open interface standard. Their interface has been copied nonetheless by several vendors (DO, Linode), making it a de facto standard, albeit a fragile and autocratic one.<p>Basically, I&#x27;m not sure if standardization has evaporated, I think it&#x27;s diffused, and OSS is (ironically?) a contributing factor.')
