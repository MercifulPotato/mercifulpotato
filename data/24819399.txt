How frequently would you say it&#x27;s a better use of a software engineer&#x27;s time to carefully reimplement a commoditized library that already exists for a speed improvement or to understand it?<p>I don&#x27;t really understand arguments that you shouldn&#x27;t introduce convenience and quality of life features because programmers will lean on them too much. Leaning on them is the point; the implicit thesis is that programmers no longer have to understand what&#x27;s happening under the hood. It&#x27;s specialization and division of labor applied to programming.<p>And if you really care, you can probably just look at the source code or pick up a book to learn how it works?')
