I am unable to create an account.  The signup screen&#x27;s &quot;next&quot; button does nothing.<p>Is the Parler backend down?  Their website <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.parler.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.parler.com</a> does not have a status page.  I found a news report saying that the app was overloaded earlier today after Twitter banned Trump.<p>Their signup page asks for email address and phone number.  Maybe their backend purchased my profile from Axciom or another analytics company and is silently refusing me an account.  Or maybe they don&#x27;t let people in San Francisco sign up?')
