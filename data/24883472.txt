Or how important it is to use java or python because there are lots of java or python programmers (what a sucker move!). Or maybe someone will tell me I can’t manage memory so I need rust to tell me how. Or I need libraries because I can’t (or shouldn’t) be “trusted” to write certain kinds of code. And so on.<p>Most programmers (people really) are downright toxic to anyone not like them, and maybe it’s really the fault of the bullies who came before you, but it is you, the reader who can help stop it.<p>It’s like in 1984 how they reduce language so it is harder to express yourself, so it is with software. But <i>we</i> are truly free so thoughtcrime is only a crime if you let it be one. Of course there will be people (programmers) looking down on <i>the others</i> and will use their doublespeak to lock people down and prevent anyone from getting the idea they can do something else with their stuff.<p>What if we simply stop telling people how not to code — and call those that do out for their bad behaviour — then maybe more people will start coding. And maybe <i>just maybe</i> our “government” will demand an end to the other walls and ceilings in software.')
