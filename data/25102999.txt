However, a theory:<p>Many of the HN crowd here are quite likely to live in an urban area, in an appartment without a fixed parking space. There is no &#x27;charging at home&#x27;. Sure there&#x27;re a decent number of plugs around - but for _everyone_? Not by a long shot. What this law is basically saying is that there will be no practical way for these people to own a car - not least without significant infrastructure work and public investment (and corresponding political will), which is, not always something you want to bet on. Given the healthy dose of skepticisim anyway - I&#x27;m not entirely surprised this is being received with less than universal excitement.')
