But that approach brings in a huge potential for abuse. We&#x27;re in a bind.<p>If we can solve this, this will be the biggest breakthrough for civilization ever since the invention of hierarchical structures many millennia ago. Hierarchies and codified laws were what allowed us to stop living as isolated groups of ~150 people[0] and go on to build a global civilization. But these came at the cost of not being able to exploit our innate social skills to cooperate with each other. Bureaucracies, rules and metrics are thus an inefficient and barely adquate mechanical substitute for trust.<p>If we could somehow scale trust, scale social skills, so that people would naturally respond to incentives that are uncomputable and not expressible through bureaucratic apparatus - like &quot;don&#x27;t do stupid shit&quot;, or &quot;really, don&#x27;t cheat&quot; - we&#x27;d enter a golden age.<p>Alas, I have no clue how to do that.<p>--<p>[0] - Yes, the Dunbar&#x27;s number.
