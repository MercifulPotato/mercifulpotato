That&#x27;s quite a geoip tracklog dataset, and AFAIK you can&#x27;t turn it off.<p>It&#x27;s to the point now that to keep my city-level location private from Apple, I&#x27;m not putting SIMs in any of my iPhones&#x2F;iPads any longer, and carrying a battery powered VPN travel router (with a SIM uplink in it) for them to talk to.  Super annoying that it has to come to this.')
