The ingredients list includes “natural beef flavor” which it says is wheat and milk derivatives.<p>To clarify: old school McD fries were fried in beef tallow at the restaurant. Now it’s vegetable oil at the restaurant, but are par-fried at the processing plant in vegetable oil with some “natural beef flavoring”')
