The 4 2P nodes in 2U is great. Good way to share some power supies, fan, chassis, ideally multi-home nic too.<p>Turn those sleds into blades though, put em on their side, &amp; go even denser. It should be a way to save costs, but density alas is a huge upsell, even though it should be a way to scale costs down.')
