I write unit tests for that all the time. But all possible sources of error are discovered by end-to-end tests.<p>Citation needed, sounds anecdotal. If this really is how your app behaves then you&#x27;re going to run into problems eventually because end-to-end tests are slow as well as difficult to write+maintain, and you&#x27;ll need hundreds (if not thousands) of them to cover all the important business logic in your app. This will slow down your developer productivity (PRs take long to merge because people wait for CI to finish) and ability to deploy quickly.<p>If your code is well-structured, your important business logic should be easily testable with unit and&#x2F;or integration tests, and you don&#x27;t need an end-to-end test to discover that, for example, a calculation is wrong. The pattern of functional core&#x2F;imperative shell embodies this really well, I think.')
