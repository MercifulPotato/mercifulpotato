As long as there isn&#x27;t a negative tone, I don&#x27;t think you need the introduction. &quot;Tried this, expected this, got this&quot;, with a title containing a clear summary.<p>I&#x27;ve created and maintained some libraries, and I think if a library maintainer takes issue with totally neutral, fact-stating bug reports, that&#x27;s entirely on them. If you&#x27;re stating nothing but the technical details, there&#x27;s really no implied sense of entitlement or bitterness. Maybe it comes across as cold, but it&#x27;s an issue tracker, and posting issues is the point. It fits the context.')
