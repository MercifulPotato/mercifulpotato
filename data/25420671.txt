And the thing I don&#x27;t understand is why Openlibrary shows me books that aren&#x27;t available to borrow. In this case I was expecting that books in search result will be available to borrow. Now after searching for a book you have manually search for a available book. Why don&#x27;t they put a checkbox &#x27;Show only available books&#x27; that would automatically filter out unavailable books?')
