Polling involves lots of assumptions and making adjustments based on expected turnout of different demographic groups and people with different voter registrations. 95% of people called do not take polls, so itâ€™s not just a truly random sampling like people assume.<p>This year, there are some truly weird things happening. For example, Trump is losing ground along seniors while gaining ground among non-white voters. He is polling 10-20 points better among Hispanic people in Florida, for example, than in 2016. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;trump-is-losing-ground-with-white-voters-but-gaining-among-black-and-hispanic-americans" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;trump-is-losing-ground-...</a>. Trump is significantly outperforming Romney or McCain among non-whites, and significantly underperforming among seniors. Polls do lots of adjustments based on assumptions about <i>e.g.</i> voter turnout by race, and I don&#x27;t know if pollsters have really gotten their arms around this situation.<p>The explanation of the &quot;16% chance Trump wins&quot; got a little unscientific in the media last time. To be precise, that&#x27;s the probability that Trump wins based on the statistical distribution of the different polls and the margins of error within polls. (Roughly speaking, it&#x27;s &quot;measurement error.&quot;) It does not address the possibility that there are systematic methodological shortcomings in the polls. Both things happened in 2016: there was a significant chance of Trump winning anyway, but there was also systemic errors in assumptions regarding low-propensity voters, voters who haven&#x27;t gone to college, and undecided voters. Pollsters have seemingly fixed those errors, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t other ones.')
