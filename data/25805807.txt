It doesn&#x27;t need replacement with something else that does the same but encrypted. The whole skeuomorphic concept of electronic mail is just not great and needs to go away. What we need is federated chat, like Matrix maybe.<p>Apropos: Is anyone aware of an email client that groups mail by sender, like a chat client? That would make email far more usable for me, as addresses that send a lot of mail and addresses that send little mail would get the same amount of screenspace. Currently my company email is drowning in automated internal semi-spam.')
