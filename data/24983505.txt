I know it seems crazy daunting, and even impossible, but they are excited and entrepreneurial so I support their efforts to help the problem.<p>I&#x27;m especially excited about their Rivers[1] project, and their recent sunglasses[2] made from plastic they removed from the Pacific ocean (worth noting, only 95% of the product is recycled from the ocean).<p>Disclaimer: No affiliation, but I like what they do, have donated in the past, and just bought 2 pairs of their sunglasses.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theoceancleanup.com&#x2F;rivers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theoceancleanup.com&#x2F;rivers&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;products.theoceancleanup.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;products.theoceancleanup.com&#x2F;</a>')
