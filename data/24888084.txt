The EU will cooperate with the US if they want an extradition.<p>In all seriousness, move it to Russia, China, or some other country that has better freedoms in this particular regard and won&#x27;t take crap from the US about silly copyright concerns.<p>Or put the source code on the blockchain and it will never be eraseable.<p>Even better, build a decentralized Github that is actually based on a blockchain but allows transparent interaction via the &quot;git&quot; command. No matter what the DMCA or RIAA want there is nobody that can erase anything from past commits.')
