It&#x27;s tested in a wind tunnel. It&#x27;s got good coverage and won&#x27;t turn inside out even when it&#x27;s windy. It&#x27;s got a curved handle which makes it easy to use it as a walking stick when it&#x27;s not raining.<p>It&#x27;s pricey but worth it to me. Now if I feel like going on a spontaneous walk, I&#x27;m not deterred by the weather forecast or the sky being a little cloudy. I can even do silly things like riding a bike while holding an umbrella.<p>I also have some waterproof doc martens on the way. The most annoying thing about being out in the rain is your feet getting soaked through canvas shoes. Hopefully this will solve that issue.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gustbuster.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;gustbuster-classic-48-inch-automatic-golf-umbrella" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gustbuster.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;gustbuster-classic-48-inch-a...</a>')
