People viewing the world through fundamentally different filters.<p>The problem is that if you focus on race, gender and&#x2F;or sexual orientation as an important factor underlying interactions, if you&#x27;re not careful you can soon come to see race and gender as the primary driving force that dictates the outcomes of all interactions, and soon all issues get reduced down to a matter or racial, sexual, or class struggle.<p>The problem is the real world doesn&#x27;t work that way, it is a complicated interacting network of events that are often only  2nd or 3rd order events from other completely different decisions made long ago.<p>To try and reduce all interactions and societal problems to a matter of a 1 or 2 factors is like trying to make money on the stock market solely by looking at the Fed&#x27;s monetary policy. Sure the Fed&#x27;s monetary policy is an important overall factor, and in some cases the most important factor in certain changes in the stock market, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t a thousand other moving parts to focus on.<p>The problem is when we interpret every event through a single filter, or give one filter primacy in all interpretations of events that filter now colors everything we see.<p>So for example if my primary filter for understanding the world is race relations and&#x2F;or critical race theory, any time someone disagrees with me I really do feel as though it is a racially motivated attack. Why? Because I have chosen to interpret everything in my world through the filter of race, and every event that occurs will in my mind be race related.<p>Note this applies just as well to any filter, christian extremists will interpret all events that happen as a sign of the times and the devil coming to power. If my filter is the class struggle than I will see every issue be between the haves and the have-nots.<p>My point is not to discredit people that want to bring gender and race in to everything I think there are many discussions where examining the role these factors played is important. My point is to caution and warn against getting into a single filter mindset, that is the cause of much of the divisiveness we see,  we have people that really are living in totally different worlds because the way they choose to view the world is totally different and they refuse to ever consider there might be other filters to view the world through.')
