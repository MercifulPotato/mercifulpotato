I got this from a quick reading of this paper and related papers.<p>Relevant section:<p><i>Recently, Ta3N5 and Y2Ti2O5S2 have been reported to split water into hydrogen and oxygen under visible light. These materials absorb visible light with wavelengths of up to 600 nm and 640 nm, respectively, and the STH efficiency can reach 10% once the EQE is improved to a level similar to that of SrTiO3:Al. The suitable photocatalyst design presented here should provide impetus to the development of particulate semiconductor photocatalysts for practical solar hydrogen production from water.</i>')
