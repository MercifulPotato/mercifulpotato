It isn&#x27;t even a political issue.<p>The right to vote is valued differently in different nations of course. In some nations it is literally above everything else, while in others it isn&#x27;t. This &quot;ranking&quot; of rights reflects the values within the societies.<p>Edit: And to add another commonly used argument: If you don&#x27;t understand the right to vote as a super-right that cannot be taken away, someone <i>will</i> take it away at some point. Maybe they will just take away somebody else&#x27;s right first. Probably a minority that nobody likes anyways. But this is a slippery slope which gives governments the incentive to criminalize things based on whether it will help them in the next election or not. Better not to have that incentive and criminalize things because they do <i>actual</i> harm to the public, than making it a political issue.')
