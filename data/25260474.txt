Item(by='dvt', descendants=None, kids=[25260687], score=None, time=1606779433, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25260323, text='How you make the leap from &quot;ignorance&quot; to &quot;illiteracy&quot; -- especially when I mention the internet (where literacy would be a prerequisite) seems disingenuous. There&#x27;s a lot of evidence showing that internet &quot;siloing&quot; exacerbates phenomena like the Dunningâ€“Kruger effect[1][2]. I know this is a controversial opinion (especially here on HN), but I don&#x27;t think Wikipedia is a net positive for society. It democratizes knowledge in the worst possible way and its bias (which ranges from the far left, to the far right -- although more often the former -- depending on the article) is obvious to anyone with a discerning eye. There&#x27;s a reason you can&#x27;t cite Wikipedia in college (or heck, even high school) papers.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffpost.com&#x2F;entry&#x2F;the-age-of-ignorance_b_11666646" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffpost.com&#x2F;entry&#x2F;the-age-of-ignorance_b_116666...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecut.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-internet-isnt-making-us-dumber-its-making-us-more-meta-ignorant.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecut.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-internet-isnt-making-us-d...</a>')
