If you get knocked out, heart attack, your arm cut off, whatever (i.e. a lot of the expensive stuff) you just go to the nearest hospital, no consumer market finagling is even possible other than trying to live near a good hospital.<p>Other times with chronic conditions where theoretically price discovery could help, the problem is that you need care badly so all the chronic care providers jack up the prices super high beyond what is needed. Treating this as a market in any way is a crazy system. If the government pays market rate, they jack it up even more. So the solution has to be that the government has to set the prices either directly or by negotiating with an entire population at its back and no competitors (i.e. monopsony in the public interest).')
