On the one hand, people can jump into a show after missing the first season and hearing good things about it. On the other hand, something I might have started watching every week on network tv, I might decide to wait and see. I know I can watch it later for no additional cost if it turns out to be great.<p>Now the show is under a lot of pressure to maintain a level of buzz around it. But I also might not watch it if it seems like an okay show but the moment has passed.<p>I low-key wanted to watch GoT when it was on. Now I wouldn&#x27;t bother, because all the people I could talk to about it have already watched it and are sick of it.')
