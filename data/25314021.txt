Do you immediately draw parallels in your mind that makes us PHP-ers incompetent and basically dumb, while having a language that lets you mash the keyboard and it works?<p>Honestly, after having used most of the languages at my disposal for past 22 years I&#x27;ve been doing this job - they were nothing special compared to PHP (or PHP compared to others).<p>You still have to figure the problem out before solving it with algorithms. No language or framework will help you do that.<p>I&#x27;m keen to hear why there are comments that demean one tool and elevate the other, when in reality - they&#x27;re all just programming languages.')
