(Except if you do certain thinks with unsafe code).<p>The difference is I guess that in rust I normally encode much more <i>simple</i> invariant in the type system and as such most times a bug happens I often can pin-down it&#x27;s rough position by the way it appears (i.e. panics&#x2F;errors not subtle timing bugs). In turn I just need to get a nice formatted printout of this one or two values. Instead of having to consider all the other ways things might have cone wrong in python which can&#x27;t happen in rust (through python3&#x27;s type annotation + linting can help).')
