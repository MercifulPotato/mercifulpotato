I don&#x27;t want a toothbrush subscription or a laundry soap subscription and I don&#x27;t want a Photoshop subscription.<p>I worry about what happens to the things I&#x27;ve created should my subscription lapse.  I&#x27;d rather budget for a one-time purchase than have a yoke around my neck forever.  A tiny yoke, sure, but add that to all the other ones and they are taxing to carry around.')
