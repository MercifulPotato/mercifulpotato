Just have a bunch of irons in the fire: negotiations with different people, PoC projects, that kind of thing, and see if any of them grow into something larger.<p>Depends a lot on what your main job is of course. But I would think a lot of office jobs have some sort of downtime where a quick context switch can be done thanks to being at home.')
