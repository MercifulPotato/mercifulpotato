You can then turn it around and use it as an excuse to ban whatever you want.<p>I could easily read through any of the front page posts on Reddit, and find what I consider to be hate speech, and if I were in a position of power, I could just use that as a justification to ban the entire domain.<p>Moreover, it easily allows adversaries the ability to plant hate speech in forums they dislike, and then pressure the authorities to ban it.<p>At the end of the day, I am an adult, and I reject the notion that sites need to protect me from speech.')
