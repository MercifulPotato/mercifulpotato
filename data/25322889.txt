You’re just saying you ignore it as best you can.<p>That is still a situation where you’re using something even though you realize there’s a lot of nonsense because there’s value to you. LinkedIn still takes advantage of this dynamic whether you choose to ignore it or not.<p>I liken it to the fact that porn sites can get away with extremely intrusive ads because people demand their service and have little alternative.
