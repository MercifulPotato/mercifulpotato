Item(by='FireBeyond', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606347695, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25207494, text='&gt; I don’t know that the “Apple tax” moniker is really fair anymore, either.<p>Apple on the new Mac Pro that I got a month ago: 192GB memory? That will be $3,000. NewEgg? We&#x27;ll sell you the same specced memory from the same manufacturer for $800. And you get to keep&#x2F;sell the baseline 32GB memory.<p>8TB SSD? $2,000, thanks. OWC and NewEgg? Here, have a PCIe 4xM.2 card and 4 2TB SSDs for $1,100. Oh, and they&#x27;ll be 50% faster, you just can&#x27;t have them as the only drive on the system (my Apple SSD runs at around 2800MB&#x2F;s, the alternative, 4500MB&#x2F;s).<p>So they are entirely marked up, and look in any forum - by far most people are not doing what I&#x27;m doing, and just &quot;going straight Apple for convenience&quot;, though the memory installation was less than 1 minute, and the SSD installation less than 5, including unboxing, seating the 4 drives, reinstalling the heatsink on the card and installing. I get &quot;my time is money&quot;, and &quot;it just works&quot; (which, as we know, more and more is less the case with Apple), but really, for me, that was a $3,100 savings for &lt;10 minutes effort.')
