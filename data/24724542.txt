HTTP3 offers no new features or capabilities over HTTP2. existing extensions &amp; tools ought be unaffected.<p>&gt; All that effort to get a tiny improvement.<p>imo QUIC+HTTP3 is a straightforward &amp; sensible simplification over what we had, &amp; was a natural route to enhancing the existing systems.<p>http2 wanted to share a connection, allow out of order serving of requests in a better way than the obsolete &amp; complicated&#x2F;painful &amp; largely removed http1.1 pipelineing, so servers could start working on upcoming work before finishing the current request.<p>quic has been an attempt to take a lot of the good work already done on http2, &amp; to drive it further down the stack, enabling a) others to use the transport&#x2F;session layers now distilled into quic for their own uses, and b) radically simplifying the http specification&#x27;s responsibilities by separating out quic transport&#x2F;session concerns from http.<p>beyond making http3 much simpler, there are other benefits. a capable replacement for WebSockets is forming via WebTransport[2], and a lot of people are hoping the complex SCTP-based WebRTC stack can be re-designed to use WebTransport&#x2F;quic, once webtransport advances[3].<p>overall, the greatest proof that this is a simpler, better, more natural path than what we had comes from a quick look a the QUIC active &amp; related documents[4], where we can see a number of different frontiers of innovation for other ways QUIC might be improved &amp; enhanced, including topics such as multicast, load balancing, unreliable connections, &amp; more: quic is a flexible, interesting, compelling extraction of really neat &amp; interesting http2 technology, &amp; decoupled from http, we are seeing amazing innovation take root &amp; allow all sorts of good frontiers to open. quic is itself a big improvement to what was available for transport &amp; session protocols, and it is throwing open the doors to colossal levels of innovation that were not conceivable before.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brandolini%27s_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brandolini%27s_law</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;w3c.github.io&#x2F;webtransport&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;w3c.github.io&#x2F;webtransport&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloggeek.me&#x2F;who-needs-quic-in-webrtc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bloggeek.me&#x2F;who-needs-quic-in-webrtc&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;wg&#x2F;quic&#x2F;documents&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;wg&#x2F;quic&#x2F;documents&#x2F;</a>')
