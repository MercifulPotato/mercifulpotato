EPYC Embedded is still stuck on Zen 1. Intel hasn&#x27;t upgraded their comparable line of mid-range server CPUs (e.g. Xeon D line), either, but AMD won&#x27;t win on performance alone. Intel has a <i>huge</i> SKU lineup, <i>much</i> <i>more</i> volume, and a <i>much</i> <i>richer</i> vendor and platform ecosystem. If the vendor demand isn&#x27;t there to push AMD on EPYC Embedded, Ryzen Emedded, and other market segments, AMD should <i>build</i> demand, otherwise they&#x27;ll just recapitulate their rise &amp; fall during the 2000s.')
