ElasticSearch being a prime example, yes AWS eats a large share of their pie, but who cares, the pie is absolutely huge.<p>Another example is GitHub and Gitlab. Both got big by leveraging the open source community for marketing. Imagine all the resources GitHub spends to enable open source, that&#x27;s a cost center that will never go away. If they hadn&#x27;t done it though, they simply would never have become big.<p>And then Gitlab one ups them, sacrificing an <i>even larger</i> share of the pie, allowing free private repos and free on site deployments. And still they&#x27;re carving up a big chunk of pie for themselves.<p>In my opinion it&#x27;s the only way the future is going to make any sense. It&#x27;s not a race to the bottom, it&#x27;s a race to more balance between the rewards of beating the network effect.<p>If you want to build a new company in a space that another company is already offering significant value, then you are going to have to offer even more value. And if there&#x27;s no more value go squeeze out of your functionality, and you&#x27;re already not charging your users, that means you&#x27;re going to have to give part of your company to the users. It&#x27;s a mathematical inevitability.')
