(E.G. most bignum representations also use little-endian, even though they don&#x27;t have to.)<p>Some operations start at the least significant end, some start at the most significant end, and it&#x27;s equally easy to loop over the words in either direction, so i don&#x27;t buy this.<p>&gt; Little endian also allows you to truncate integers more easily.<p>What do you mean by truncate an integer? If you mean go from 32 bit to 16 bit, that&#x27;s still trivial with big-endian, you just shift.')
