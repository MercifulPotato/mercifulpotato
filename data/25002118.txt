I firmly believe that the speed limits are too low (unsafely so), but this is reckless even if drivers don&#x27;t have makeshift gas tanks in their back seat. I can&#x27;t believe their excellence at driving negates these additional risks--not even in the same ballpark, and I certainly don&#x27;t think the observation that no bystanders have been killed&#x2F;injured supports your position.<p>&gt; anyone thumbing their nose at the cops like this is going to get at least a little respect from me.<p>Get an &quot;ACAB&quot; bumper sticker if &quot;anti-police&quot; is your schtick. Don&#x27;t put innocent lives at risk.')
