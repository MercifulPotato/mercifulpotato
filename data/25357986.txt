Too often people parrot the same stupid line about Obama and drone strikes without the context here. No, trump is not some dove who cares about minimizing suffering. He did more drone strikes, with more flimsy justifications, resulting in more deaths and destruction than any president in history including Obama.<p>Yeah, and trump has not started any additional wars. That is true. However, the constant saber rattling vs iran as well as the &quot;bloody nose&quot; option vs north korea (a premptive nuclear strike) were openly floated by Trump and his administration. Trump would go for war if he believed it would be good for him.<p>Honestly, trump may still be president if he had attacked iran... Trump&#x27;s own miscalculations are ironically what kept him being so &quot;dovish&quot;. Republicans talk a good game about being doves but they want a hawk. They might not admit it openly because dear leader didn&#x27;t attack iran yet - but if he had - trump&#x27;s base would claim that iran should have been invaded forever ago...')
