Item(by='fock', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607111614, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25306088, text='now that we have this inevitable discussion venue after everyone has digested the PR (and some of the people her might have even had a chance to ask some questions to deepmind) some remarks (questions - if anyone from the team is here):<p>- I thought that open code was becoming the standard and also being pushed by Google? But apparently this does not apply to deepmind, because of $$$s? For the original Alphafold (which actually was 3 models) no code is available except, where it had to be (their nature publication on one of the three models used in the competition).<p>- why did they not participate with all the available proteins? I guess it&#x27;s some loophole in the rules, to allow for greater &quot;improvements&quot; even when models are not super general, but from a naive scientific view that is absolutely stupid.<p>- maybe they went fully generative this time, but in CASP13, 2&#x2F;3 of their models were just blackbox-predictors, which they optimized with simulated annealing. Given that the configurational sample space for the protein is huge, doing that seems still rather costly. I wonder how the actual spectra fitting works and compares to that and why experimentalists could not go this route as well? (just do simulated annealing, until the spectrum fits).<p>- they already trained on all known proteins, yet with some they are still far off. Seems like it&#x27;s not solved really, though results are certainly impressive and it could be a great tool for any person interested in frozen protein structures.')
