One is merely legal, one is a necessity.  People make terrible life choices <i>constantly</i> and selecting heroin -- once prescribed for asthma -- as a no-go is just hating the newcomer versus giving traditional old alcohol, a civilizational favorite, a pass.<p>We should spend the money from the war on drugs on instead trying to prevent the root causes of these kinds of disastrous decisions.  We don&#x27;t even have a great grasp on why people make some of these choices yet.  I&#x27;m not saying we just set up a Needle Park or anything, but frankly we&#x27;ve lost the war on drugs.  It&#x27;s time to re-evaluate our priorities.')
