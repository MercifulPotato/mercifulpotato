Drugs of necessity, like insulin, are provided to avoid liability. Society, on the whole, is not OK with providing recreational drugs or their equivalent to anyone, much less those pending criminal charges, and correctional officers are average members of society, and thus share its general position on providing recreational drugs or their equivalents to users or addicts, including those they are paid to oversee whilst incarcerated. This is a rational way for society to be. Saving everyone from the consequences of their actions is not a viable nor tenable survival strategy for any population or species.')
