She and I agreed to ground rules, [but] I could not commit to the consequences even though the 1st order consequences came out in my favor. The second-order consequences would be that I&#x27;d tricked her, intentionally or otherwise, which is decidedly unhealthy in a partnership. I had contributed 2&#x2F;3rds of the income but 2&#x2F;5ths of the debts (the latter being the main sticking point) so while &#x27;fair&#x27; was not going to be 50:50, I&#x27;m not some monster who&#x27;s going to buy high end electronics while my partner is eating ramen.<p>I expected worse news for myself after re-doing the numbers, and in fact I ended up with a little bit more spending money with the new numbers.<p>I mention this only because I have come to expect policy people to stick to their initial narrative a little more enthusiastically than I could. Getting them to review data and policy unless there is a clear benefit for themselves is difficult. It&#x27;s very common for people to get promoted by challenging this friction in ways that benefit everyone (because the deciders couldn&#x27;t connect the dots). It&#x27;s always newsworthy, and I wish it weren&#x27;t.')
