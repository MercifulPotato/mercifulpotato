Item(by='harry8', descendants=None, kids=[25193505], score=None, time=1606173195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25192236, text='&gt;If you don&#x27;t manage your memory precisely, then sure, C is probably not the language for you.<p>I agree with everything above that line and probably the intent of that line too.<p>However I&#x27;d phrase it as:<p>If you don&#x27;t want to be forced to make a large effort managing memory for the given task, C is the wrong tool for that job. Even when you&#x27;re great with C. Even when C is wonderful for a different job because you do it fabulously well.<p>I use C and like it. I don&#x27;t use it when python is good enough for the job because in those situations python is likely to be actually better than C because you&#x27;d incur a debt to pay for something you don&#x27;t need and as a result you just might miss one of those payments. The interest rate on a missed payment can get pretty steep.<p>Prefer shell, ruby, perl, something jvm, whatever? - Great. Exactly the same point applies.<p>I&#x27;m sure this point does &#x2F;not&#x2F; apply to your comment above but it could be (mis)interepreted that way - C programming macho arrogance is not helpful for good quality software. C macho arrogance is pretty destructive, in fact and IMHO the worst thing about the use C (&amp; C++ etc.)')
