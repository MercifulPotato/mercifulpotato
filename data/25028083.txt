Your productivity gains are mostly due to technology and rise of Asia.<p>IMO the average person hasn’t gotten enough of the gains from tech and it’s one of the things that worries me.  As automation accelerates we can’t tolerate a handful of elites reaping all the benefits from that.<p>I don’t know much about the USA tax system.  I’m Canadian.  We pay high taxes and I don’t have a problem with it.  In general though, I think the wealthy elite in the world have been capturing a disproportionate amount of the wealth &#x2F; productivity gains since the 80s.<p>I also think the rewards for “success” are way too high for CEOs, etc..  They claim to be irreplaceable, but whenever something bad happens and they get called before Congress they act like they barely know more than the janitor.  I think their only real value is in knowing all the other rich people.<p>I believe in capitalism and think hard work needs to be rewarded, but that the rewards are skewed too much.  Once you have 100x the standard of living of the average person in the wealthiest countries in the world I think that should be enough.  Everything else is just pure greed.')
