Item(by='didibus', descendants=None, kids=[24919942], score=None, time=1603873372, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24915699, text='Actually Amazon knows precisely what items was shipped and if it came directly from the merchant or if they used some other merchants for the delivery (aka comingled). So when a buyer complains about an item, they know if it is the merchant&#x27;s item or some other merchant&#x27;s item.<p>Comingled doesn&#x27;t mean that they just bunch them all up in some bin and then can&#x27;t tell which is which and where they were from. It means that if some warehouse closer to the buyer has a similar item, they&#x27;ll ship that one, because shipping will be cheaper and faster coming from the closest fulfilment center.')
