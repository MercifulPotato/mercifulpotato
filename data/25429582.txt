Could it be that you have never really learned shell programming or read the man pages? Or can you give an example? We have lot of production code with many test statements and I don&#x27;t remember when we were bitten last time by some &quot;surprising feature&quot; of test.<p>I agree that test works differently than comparisions in many programming languages. So you need to understand how it is different. And you need to be disciplined about quoting, otherwise surprises will happen when you have user-controlled input and the shell starts to do word-splitting. But if you use shellcheck you will be reminded of quoting everywhere. It&#x27;s not a problem specific to test anyway.')
