Item(by='president', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602095960, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24703364, text='&gt; There is a lot of political science research that speaks to growing xenophobia when immigration is unleashed.<p>From my experience these days, many statements or positions are deemed xenophobic or racist when they are actually not. Even your example of the Canadian immigration requirements could be deemed xenophobic or racist towards foreigners that don&#x27;t speak English. Then there are the &quot;open borders&quot; people  that believe countries should hand out visas willy-nilly to everyone that wants one and that any opposition to that idea is xenophobic and racist. Do you think that is warranted?')
