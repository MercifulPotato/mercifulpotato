No one talks about the BS that Asians have to deal with let alone know about them (i.e. affirmative action + minor minority myth = discrimination towards Asians, discrimination&#x2F;crime towards Asians by blacks), but we&#x27;re not gonna whine about this because that&#x27;s just not what we do, we carry on working hard and not succumbing to victim mentality (i.e. when was the last time you saw an ALM organization).')
