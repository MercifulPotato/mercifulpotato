I bought a cheapish 34-inch curved monitor that had great reviews, but it has almost as much light coming through gaps in the rear housing as the screen. Text looks like crap on its &quot;not quite retina&quot; resolution, especially when it&#x27;s next to a retina macbook pro, although videos look very nice. I really do wish Apple would make a monitor more reasonably priced than the Pro Display XDR.')
