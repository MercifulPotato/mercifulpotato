I got my parents to use a VPN because Netflix was hounding them when they would watch movies at their second house. I installed ad blockers (and at the same time privacy badger and HTTPS everywhere) in their browsers. We&#x27;ve talked a lot about surveillance capitalism and they&#x27;ve always quoted Goebbels (unknowingly). But after some time they now excitedly tell me about how wrong the ads are that they get in the mail or on their phones. The same thing has happened with several of my friends (many of whom I&#x27;ve gotten on Signal). The fact that they see wrong flyers in the mail has really also opened their eyes about how much they are tracked. Though I&#x27;ll admit they&#x27;re trending a little more towards the paranoid side now, but it is unsurprising when you consider Boomers grew up with Orwell, Huxley, and the Cold War (they also watch Fox).<p>It became clear to me that &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot; was actually &quot;I don&#x27;t think I can fight it.&quot; It was a justification for an apathetic view. Which I understand. If you try to fight a team of psychologists, mathematicians, and super computers, it seems like you have no chance. I think this same thing goes well beyond just privacy too. But most people need to consider that most people are not tech literate and it is a very daunting idea for them, one that they are pretty embarrassed about.')
