You can also only perform the action when specific files are changed: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;actions&#x2F;reference&#x2F;workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;actions&#x2F;reference&#x2F;workflow-syntax...</a>. This shouldn&#x27;t require admin access, assuming admins allow you to use GitHub Actions.<p>I generally don&#x27;t bother looking at master&#x2F;main for code changes unless there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m looking for specifically. I set up CODEOWNERS so that teams get notified when their files are changed in PRs - this is how I get notified of potential changes to files that I care about.')
