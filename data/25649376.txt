I think “incompetent” is the correct term because aside from not being honest with one’s self on these “do good” issues, people can also just be very ignorant about it.<p>Being ignorant about the actual, measurable, demonstrable humanitarian side-effect of your beliefs and actions is rightfully seen as moral incompetence and should be harshly criticized.<p>I like a quote from Robin Hanson about this (paraphrased):<p>&gt; “I wish people felt more of a social obligation to believe accurately and less of a social entitlement to believe whatever they want.”')
