The other says it&#x27;s a state-run business (which, I mean, lots of people disagreed with that). That&#x27;s miles away from saying something is a security threat [edit: it&#x27;s worth saying, for those not clicking the link, he compares it to Saudi Aramco, which is, I mean, I&#x27;ve never heard that IPO described as a security threat either, so there&#x27;s not really even any implications I can detect]. Nowhere in there is the narrative you&#x27;re describing.')
