How many countries in the world manufacture automobiles sold around the world (don&#x27;t forget a lot of &#x27;foreign&#x27; cars are manufactured in the United States)? How many countries in the world has a private company manufacturing re-usable rocketry capable of carrying crews to the ISS?<p>I&#x27;ve been reading these scaremongering stories all my life. First it was Japan eating our lunch. Where are they now? Then it was Mexico poised to take all our manufacturing. Didn&#x27;t happen. Now everyone is scared about China. Pretty soon they&#x27;re going to realize they don&#x27;t want to be in the business of manufacturing screws, either. There&#x27;s simply no money in it.<p>Meanwhile U.S. manufacturing has been <i>growing.</i> That&#x27;s something the NY Times is conspicuously silent about.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the U.S. doesn&#x27;t have social and political issues we need to get sorted out - but there&#x27;s never been a time in our history that we haven&#x27;t had social and political issues we need to get sorted out. I&#x27;m not saying we don&#x27;t have progress to achieve. I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;m sick and tired about hearing how the U.S. no longer manufactures screws and consumer electronics. There&#x27;s a bigger picture to consider.')
