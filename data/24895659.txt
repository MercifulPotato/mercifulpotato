We still probably can only roughly model the physics of fire, especially since at the end it&#x27;s governed by QM effects, but we don&#x27;t need that in fact we don&#x27;t even need to understand combustion that well to utilize it.<p>But if you want single electron tunneling then yes it&#x27;s possible there have been papers about it for a few decades with the latest ones also including some experimental work <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;ftp&#x2F;arxiv&#x2F;papers&#x2F;1204&#x2F;1204.5539.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;ftp&#x2F;arxiv&#x2F;papers&#x2F;1204&#x2F;1204.5539.pdf</a><p>Single electron transistors are also being actively worked on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Single-electron_transistor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Single-electron_transistor</a>')
