Most people are relatively unhappy;<p>2. The root cause is our tendency always to want <i>More</i> [money&#x2F;power, love, recognition] -- which stems from evolutionarily adaptive traits;<p>3. The remedy is to live in the present moment -- which one can learn to do by deliberately practicing three closely-related things:<p><pre><code>  1. Compassion  \n  2. Attention  \n  3. Gratitude  \n</code></pre>\nThe book is (sadly, inexplicably) out of print, but it&#x27;s popular enough there are plenty of used copies for sale. I first encountered HTWWYH in a 5th-edition hardcover, and it was transformative. Highest posaible recommendation.')
