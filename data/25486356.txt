Now the push to cope with two architectures more will be more prominent in design of software as well as support.<p>That all ends up laying the foundations that will only go to help alternative CPU architectures more over the one x86 size fits all that many avenues have and are still based around.<p>We have been slowly reaching a plateau in CPU performance and been case of adding many cores and riding the process node for that performance leap as more space for more cores at same power limits.   That has almost already plateaued and now seeing lower power usage as already have enough cores, start to become more viable for desktop.  So many timing factors do start to play out now and RISC V or whatever others are out there will now have a better chance to compete upon a playing field in which their worst case would be good enough for many tasks and their best case would be able to shine and not be held back as unable to scale as easily due to limitations as those limitations eroding away, albeit slowly it is a case that we are slowly by surly seeing things move in the right directions.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;d perversely love a CPU that had multi architecture cores on-board - even if was two CPU&#x27;s architectures on the same SOC core.<p>That all said, still waiting for ECC memory to become more mainstream consumer wise.')
