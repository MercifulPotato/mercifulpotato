I set out to create a service &#x27;for life&#x27;[0], it is 15 years old next year, it has loyal clients and it&#x27;s getting an update (rewrite, modern skin, app, modern features, launching 1&#x2F;1&#x2F;&#x27;21) for it&#x27;s 15th birthday. But although I promise never to sell (out; no ads, no data sales etc) and have the entire product (source etc) in escrow, anyone can break their word + contract obviously. I keep promising lifetime anyway and hope that others who do do not break their word easily either.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flexlists.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flexlists.com</a>')
