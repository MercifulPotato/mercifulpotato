People who say, “oh I can just take whatever loopholes I’ve been given” don’t understand the sheer complexity and ambiguity of the tax code.<p>I wonder if it&#x27;s laziness or by design.<p>&gt; While I’m disappointed that we “lost” that money (one could argue it wasn’t ours to begin with), and disappointed that others are morally flexible enough or big enough to get away with it, I am left with the feeling that we did the right thing for the country as a whole. I am sad that more companies and individuals don’t consider that in their moral calculation.<p>That&#x27;s the thing: Moral should never come into play. If it does, that means the law wasn&#x27;t written properly.')
