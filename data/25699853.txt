Hopefully there will be a WASM backend for GHC... I mean, it&#x27;s bound to happen right? :)<p>If you want statically checked types, I&#x27;d probably say that Scala is better at the server+client game (i.e. when you want to have both). Of course, Scala has its own drawbacks wrt. Haskell: lack of typed effects is a big one for me.<p>(Just for context: I work on a website+SPA written entirely in Scala which has been around for years and years. I also have quite a lot of experience in Haskell.)')
