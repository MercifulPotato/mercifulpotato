The main issue I have about performances is Akonadi, it&#x27;s eating CPU, memory and lot of disk space (and I have disabled files indexing in settings, as I don&#x27;t need it, so I don&#x27;t get why it&#x27;s taking GiO), so I often just kill the server and it works well after that.<p>By the way, does anybody know a method to disable it cleanly, or at least make it for resources friendly? The article I&#x27;ve found after quick search are years old and not relevant anymore.')
