To me, the tl;dr of this post is: Kubernetes removed the need for Docker just to run container images in a k8s cluster, ergo, Docker is dead.<p>But Kubernetes is <i>super complicated</i>. The author seems to assume that everybody wants to run everything in Kubernetes, but if I want to run some backend on some server (or maybe on a few servers), then it feels like extreme overkill.<p>Now, I&#x27;m no guru in this field at all. In fact, one thing I always liked about Docker is it made you feel able to atomically deploy software without having to become an expert at anything first. But what&#x27;s the current &quot;don&#x27;t have to be an expert&quot; way to ship software if Docker is, supposedly, dead? Do we all have to learn Kubernetes?<p>I&#x27;ve never used Swarm but I&#x27;ve been told that one thing it had going for this is that it allowed you to do smallish setups pretty easily. If that&#x27;s true, then I&#x27;m sad it lost the popularity war.')
