Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607445812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345507, text='&gt; Why would you want these then? What about your current headphones isn&#x27;t good enough that you are willing to pay $600?<p>Can&#x27;t speak for others, but I simply want good quality over ear headphones for sitting at my desk listening to music while coding. I have a set of decent AKG over-ear headphones, but I&#x27;m tired of the cable and there are times when ANC would be nice. It would also be nice to have a set for watching TV in the evening.<p>Not sure why so many people have their panties in a twist about this. Apple makes arguably the best wireless tech in the business. People keep comparing these to high end wired headphones (without ANC) which completely misses the point.')
