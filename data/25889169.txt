Make watching the board a habit, one you &quot;pull&quot; rather than that is pushed to you. Or use a company provided chat-bot&#x2F;tool to help surface changes as they happen, if you need that. The issue tracker should better dashboard whatever activity is happening, in general- indicate branch updates, pr changes, &amp;c, clearly, across the board.<p>There&#x27;s some value to using social processes to radiate all the changes happening, but I&#x27;d really like to see some camp out there that makes a go at mechanizing themselves. I think there are a lot of interesting possibilities, more enduring &amp; valuable forms of communication that we have failed to even begin to explore.')
