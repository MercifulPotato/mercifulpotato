Yes, I think other people are using other definitions, which is causing confusion.<p>&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t the second category be more less CSPRNG?<p>The website says PCG is &quot;Challenging&quot; to predict and ChaCha20 is &quot;Secure&quot;. So I think this means that PCG isn&#x27;t a CSPRNG, but still is harder to predict than Mersenne Twister.<p>But is this useful at all? I don&#x27;t know. This thread started by andreareina asking that exact question: &quot;What applications require unpredictability where you wouldn&#x27;t go full csprng?&quot; People immediately then misunderstood the question because they misunderstood how the word unpredictability is being used.<p>A player not being able to mentally predict enemies and not seeing visible patterns sounds like it might fall more under the website&#x27;s definition of &quot;Statistical Quality&quot;.')
