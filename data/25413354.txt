One day a gang knocked on her parents door (they owned an apartment) and pretty much gave them a 2-day notice to get out.<p>They packed their stuff, and left. Their senior neighbor did not - she ended up getting killed. Apparently gangs like that just seize apartments, and use them for criminal activities (prostitution, drugs, kidnappings, torture&#x2F;executions, etc.).<p>Her parents eventually managed to get to the US, but her uncle died on the way - victim of some kidnapping scheme, where gangs&#x2F;cartels snatch up immigrants on the way, and blackmail their families in the target countries.<p>Suffice to say, we never visited Honduras - but it&#x27;s pretty surreal to know that this is the everyday stuff a lot of people go through, in Central America. One day everything is normal, the next day you&#x27;re a refugee, just like that - and there&#x27;s no justice in sight, because that would mean getting yourself or your family killed.')
