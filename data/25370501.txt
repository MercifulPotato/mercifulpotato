What does Jennifer Doudna think of the probability of catastrophic bioerror? (I hope that&#x27;s in an interview somewhere.) Or perhaps there&#x27;s a retired national security expert who could weigh in on which groups are most likely to attempt that sort of bioterrorism.\nBut these two are only in a position to make uninteresting and unconvincing arguments on behalf of their respective positions.')
