I understand why those can have an impact on end users and so I do think that SPAs have their place, but I&#x27;d much rather the interface was rendered from the server and worked through links if it means it&#x27;ll work faster. In fact, half the time I&#x27;m not even using the web interface; I&#x27;m using the SDKs.')
