There are many cheaper alternatives. (Sorry, budget does matter for me!)<p>There&#x27;s the STOIC Natural Standing Mat on kickstarter right now. It looks cool.<p>Aeron-brand Chairs are supposed to be really good -- but at $1000, I can only say, &quot;Ouch&quot;! Supposedly &quot;Gaming Chairs&quot; are similar -- designed to support you ergonomically for many hours -- and only a third of the cost.<p>I&#x27;ve got to say, my lower back is starting to hurt from working at a desk all day, and if I knew one of these options would help, I&#x27;d go for it. I wish I could try them out for a while before plunking down a chunk of change. (I was also told that, in some places, you may be able to write them off of your taxes as a work-from-home business expense).')
