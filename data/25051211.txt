Last year they had ~40 minute coverage of SCS for ~5 passes per day. They&#x27;ve accelerated launch schedule and probably reached ~8 hours of daily coverage with 06-07 group this year. A few more launches away from full optical SCS persistence, though I think current combo of optical, radar and electronic detection has SCS mostly covered.<p>China also just released video of Jilin-1 tracking planes in Atlanta airport. It&#x27;s part of Gaofen group for commercial use (Yaogan explicitly military) , so they&#x27;re trolling civil-military fusion capabilities. China moves fast, maybe they couldn&#x27;t find a USN carrier reliably 5 years ago, but they should now.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;HenriKenhmann&#x2F;status&#x2F;1325377922228629507" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;HenriKenhmann&#x2F;status&#x2F;1325377922228629507</a><p>There&#x27;s also... 10s thousands of Chinese commercial ships in SCS.')
