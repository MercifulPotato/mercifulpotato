Part of having experienced psychosis is regaining trust in my own mind, afraid of &#x27;the bottom falling out&#x27;. I feel I&#x27;m doing well there.\nI&#x27;m also wondering if they have diagnosed me correctly. I pretty much haven&#x27;t had any depressive symptoms for at least five years now, it stopped a long time before I ever had a psychotic episode. In fact, the depression was in line with my living conditions, it was something that made perfect sense at the time. Sounds like a question for a psychiatrist.<p>Unfortunately, like you experienced too, part of the healthcare industry still has a parent-child relationship between doctor and patient. I notice that the doctors which worked out, never really had that aspect, but treated me as someone with valid input. Especially for me, I like to understand things, dive into them, see what the mechanics of medication, disease and diagnosis are all about. It doesn&#x27;t really work well with a doctor that just wants to prescribe whatever they think is right. I&#x27;m sure you can relate to that.<p>Thanks for the well wishes. I can say that I&#x27;ve been pretty much completely symptom free for a year now, and it does feel like I&#x27;ve only now started to really explore myself, and find out what I want out of life. All the best to you as well.')
