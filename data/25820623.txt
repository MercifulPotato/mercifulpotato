Of the things I use regularly, that arn&#x27;t for work, that have a 2FA option - I think two (Google, and my password manager) supports U2F.<p>For either of those methods, stealing two SMS&#x2F;TOTP codes isn&#x27;t that much harder than stealing the first one - you just display a fake error saying that it failed, and try again.<p>For all but the most attentive folks - getting a &quot;Whoops, try again&quot; error when authenticating is probably going to be a semi-regular occurrence anyhow, so adding a fake one in there probably won&#x27;t trigger any mental alarms.')
