Item(by='blunte', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604351317, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24970395, text='Almost half a million bikes were stolen in 2019 in NL, and there are reports of organized groups specifically targeting e-bikes now.<p>But in general, any bike that doesn&#x27;t look like it could sell for 15 euros on the street is a target.  The nicer it looks, the more likely a target.<p>If you&#x27;re out on the streets often enough at night, you&#x27;ll inevitably be approached by someone offering to sell you his bike for cheap.  Hint: it&#x27;s not his bike.  But the nicer bikes get sent off and sold elsewhere.<p>Most people I know either keep their bike in their house at night, or they just accept the reality and buy old crappy bikes that they won&#x27;t cry over when they go missing.<p>But the expensive features I would like are a comfy but light saddle, a light but sturdy frame (double butted steel tubing), belt drive, and ideally a small motor&#x2F;battery combo for times when the wind really sucks.  Since you asked.  Christmas is coming up soon :).')
