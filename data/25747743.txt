I understand that making a company pay for something free is a challenge. But come on, they can pay vast amount of money for getting support for open-source softwares, support they will probably never use... :)<p>(Project on which I received donation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mockoon&#x2F;mockoon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mockoon&#x2F;mockoon</a>)')
