I first got tripped up around<p>&gt; Trait methods can also take self by reference or mutable reference:<p><pre><code>  impl std::clone::Clone for Number {\n    fn clone(&amp;self) -&gt; Self {\n        Self { ..*self }\n    }\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nWhat&#x27;s the asterisk doing in this code? I guess it&#x27;s destructuring the struct somehow, but I don&#x27;t see that syntax elsewhere:  destructuring was introduced but looked like it worked without the star. Alternatively, it&#x27;s dereferencing the reference, but that seems less likely.')
