If you do, is the chip enabled without drivers control? I&#x27;d be surprised at that.<p>&gt; License plate readers?<p>To some extent I guess these are necessary, but they are a usable so you have to deal with this at the level of government rather than directly.<p>&gt; Face recognition cameras<p>This has to be tackled at the legal level, and yes, it does concern me. Fortunately in a democracy you have some say. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think you will make the effort.<p>&gt; Chip in the credit card...<p>Oh for heaven&#x27;s sake, it&#x27;s not broadcasting your location it&#x27;s RFID, and if you want to disable it you can find instructions online. You basically make a small cut into the side of the card which breaks the antenna loop (or whatever it&#x27;s called). I literally have done that and it took me a few minutes.<p>&gt; Friends with my phone that have your number<p>Is this a serious objection? They can&#x27;t track you via somebody else&#x27;s phone -- did you even think about this before writing it?<p>&gt; ID cards that swept into places<p>This really is scraping the bottom of the barrel. I&#x27;ve had worked cards like this, they simply let you in and out little more than an old-fashioned metal key, with a record being made. You can&#x27;t be tracked by them other than when swiped.<p>You seem to have embraced failure while resenting it but it&#x27;s clearly what you want.')
