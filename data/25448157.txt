Once that&#x27;s fixed (and more importantly, with many people shifting to work from home, so they don&#x27;t have to care about people staring), I expect it to become a pretty popular thing.<p>If the virtual monitor is overlaying a camera feed of your environment(AR style), this will be amazing. Imagine a headset not much heavier than sunglasses sitting on your desk, rather than a big (or multiple!) monitors. Put it on, you have as much screen real state as you would like, and can be made to look like an actual monitor.<p>That&#x27;s with our current 2D thinking. We can probably do more useful visualizations in 3D.')
