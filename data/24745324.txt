Instead they&#x27;re just guessing that it&#x27;s RF-related... but then the article goes on to discuss a bunch of sources of low frequency acoustic noise?<p>&gt;  For instance, multiple Hum hearers, if in the same room together, will match the Hum to different acoustic frequencies. “That never, ever happens with standard acoustic sources, of any frequency. It just simply never happens,” he says.<p>If only we had some kind of machine that could objectively measure acoustic frequencies...<p>If it were high pitched, we&#x27;d write it off as tinnitus. If there&#x27;s no low-pitched equivalent (is there?) then it&#x27;s probably just a sampling of people who live within a block or two of someone with a high-powered subwoofer on their stereo.')
