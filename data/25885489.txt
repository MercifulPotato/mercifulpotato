In other words, you can expend a great amount of resources sending goons to wreck thousands of DCs, and exchanges to little effect.<p>Physically denying regime&#x27;s access to network exchanges will work.<p>Same with cell networks. Easy to jam locally, but even a big city is practically impossible without massive expense to physically take down cell towers. Idlib in Syria is a good example how a cutoff segment of cell network managed to stay online for a remarkable amount of time under military aggression.')
