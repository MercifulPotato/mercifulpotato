So your browser basically makes a big empty placeholder box that the renderer will render into.<p>It’d be neat if something like that were available for web fonts. Each paragraph gets its own “block” that the installed font uses (and contains padding), and when the font downloads, it won’t reflow. But I’d assume it’d be <i>way</i> too complicated to deal with (different screen widths is the first to come to mind).')
