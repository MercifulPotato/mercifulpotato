Old person after old person, except for an ultra quick image of a younger man with Down syndrome, unseen by the reporter.<p>The doco was in released in April.<p>Why is there &quot;raising calls for early vaccination&quot; in December? This should have been decided months ago.<p>I&#x27;m not sure &quot;10 times deadlier&quot; makes sense either. For young people it&#x27;s ~0. So 10 times 0 is still zero. But people with Down syndrome often work with others with Down syndrome so I think it&#x27;s obvious what to do.')
