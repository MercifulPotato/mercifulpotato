If you still don&#x27;t have a job that pays well enough to cover your loans and living expenses, then bankruptcy is totally appropriate.  Doctors and lawyers won&#x27;t be eligible until well into their career.<p>That prevents people from immediately declaring bankruptcy.<p>Also, bankruptcy sucks a lot more now than it did in the 70s when this policy was put into place.  Bankruptcy now prevents you from renting apartments, buying cars&#x2F;houses, or getting certain jobs.  Anyone declaring bankruptcy after college is looking at being in their 30s before they become truly financially independent.<p>I can&#x27;t think of a worse system than what we have now.  Bankruptcy is a really important component of a functioning financial system, and, IMHO, the lack of bankruptcy for student loans is one of the primary drivers of excessive student loan debt.')
