What was their plan? And how would that be accepted by the every authority and the people?<p>I have no idea! As I stated above, it seems like it was mostly a dumb angry mob that didn&#x27;t think this through! That group in Michigan thought they could kidnap the governor and hold her hostage to remove covid restrictions, so maybe they were hoping to do something like that.<p>The fact remains, that they <i>did use</i> violence against people and property, and they might have done worse if they had managed to get their hands on politicians, or if the IEDs planted at GOP&#x2F;Dem party headquarters had gone off.<p>If you want to call it a &quot;mostly peaceful protest that featured one attempted violent coup&quot; then knock yourself out.')
