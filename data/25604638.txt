Then every client could know the load of every backend, and could continue to use P2C or something like that, without needing to maintain a socket for every backend.<p>There&#x27;s still a problem to solve, because you don&#x27;t want to be opening and closing connections to backends all the time - you want to reuse a small number of connections. So maybe you keep a set of connections open, distribute requests between them using P2C or a weighted random choice, but also periodically update the set according to load statistics.')
