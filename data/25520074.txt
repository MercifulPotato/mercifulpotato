I think it is only now beginning to become more widely accepted or noticed by the broader community, which is both a blessing and curse.<p>That said, I&#x27;m going to continue to opt for Ext4 or XFS for the time being, even on distros where Btrfs is the default. Probably in a few years I&#x27;ll get around to upgrading to Btrfs.')
