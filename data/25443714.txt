I don&#x27;t know how our landlords went 6 months without knowing they weren&#x27;t getting paid.. but once they told us I called the bank and they were able to contact the owner of the account it was going into and pull the funds back to the correct account.<p>Now sure if the owner of this &quot;wrong&quot; account was doing something sketchy it would have been more complicated, but there still would have been as full of recourse as possible. It&#x27;s not your money just because the bank puts wrong money in your acct.<p>And sure wire&#x27;s are a bit more complicated..<p>But yeah- end of the day the banks are able to do something if it&#x27;s legit.')
