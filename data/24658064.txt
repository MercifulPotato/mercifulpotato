Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=[24661447, 24662905], score=None, time=1601604440, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24655839, text='There is a rights-based approach in which (a) yes, someone inflicting a harm on you gives you the right to inflict a proportionate harm on them; (b) you can then go to them and threaten to inflict this harm, and <i>usually</i> get them to agree to pay you a fine instead, thus benefiting both of you.  Labor could be used to substitute for a fine if someone can&#x27;t pay, although I think in today&#x27;s prisons the prisoners don&#x27;t necessarily do work.<p>There are problems.  For example, breaking a professional tennis player&#x27;s arm may be much more career-damaging, and arguably &quot;worse&quot;, than breaking a professional chess player&#x27;s arm; and excessive retaliation is itself a crime.  In that case, it may be good to get a judge or some such to evaluate the severity before carrying out the retaliation.  That also goes for judging the evidenceâ€”obviously, punishing someone for a crime they didn&#x27;t commit is itself a crime.  So one could imagine this turning into something at least vaguely resembling today&#x27;s court system.')
