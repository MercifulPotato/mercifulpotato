Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609546725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25607744, text='&gt; Dealing with children is incredibly taxing and difficult<p>No surprise it&#x27;s difficult if you already sour the relationship by treating them poorly and give the kids a reason to hate you from day one. Maybe things will be better if you don&#x27;t start by making up petty rules that don&#x27;t help anyone?<p>---<p>In middle school I remember we had a maths teacher who was very good, in the sense that she let us do pretty much whatever we wanted as long as we weren&#x27;t disrupting anyone else. This ended up working out well for both sides; those who wanted to learn and engage with the coursework could do so, and those who gave up on it and weren&#x27;t interested could relax and entertain themselves to make time fly instead of being bored and dreading the class.<p>In comparison, we had a very severe history teacher, who&#x27;d give you spiteful extra assignments (which would escalate further if you didn&#x27;t do them) if you were lacking in one way or another. Did it help? I don&#x27;t think so; I remember more about dreading the class and making up excuses&#x2F;strategies to get away from the class or the assignments than the content of the coursework itself, and I can say for sure that the class was universally hated and dreaded.')
