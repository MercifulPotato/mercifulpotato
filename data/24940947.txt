Every Facebook employee is laughing their asses off at <i>you</i> personally right now. &quot;LOL! Look, HN is complaining about Facebook again! Hysterical!&quot; They&#x27;re emailing the link above with laughing emojis and dollar signs, while they customize their new Tesla order in another window.<p>The fact is, they will all lose money if Trump isn&#x27;t reelected.

One click and no more Fox News hatred from your crazy uncle. But we don&#x27;t have that option. Why?
