Just hypothetically, if Obama&#x27;s health secretary said that being transgender was largely a mental illness, or his head of domestic policy said that we need to close the southern border, does he need to tolerate that? Just to be very clear - those are completely hypothetical - I am not sure what actual &quot;dissent&quot; caused Trump to fire his various staff members, but it is unrelated.')
