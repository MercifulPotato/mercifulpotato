They have at the same time always had an additional ability to do so mitigated by the need to get other private parties (including, but not limited to, “corporate titans”) to relay their speech, whether it was newspapers which existed before the founding and expanded over time, broadcast media starting in the early 20th century, or online media starting in the late 20th century.<p>And it&#x27;s <i>not</i> a new phenomenon that some subset of current incumbent politicians might lose some degree of the favor they have had with one of those mechanisms that relies on the exercise of First Amendment rights by some intermediary.')
