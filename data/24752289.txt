Item(by='cheph', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602488791, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24751786, text='I was playing around with doing this from Wikidata and made a basic POC.<p>There are some limitations in expression there, new properties are needed to better express symptoms locality and severity, like pain in the head, pain in the arm, pain in the stomach.<p>Data quality is not that great, better pipelines are needed from sources to extract symtoms and locality.<p>What I did on wikidata is extract all valid symptom items with SPARQL, and then allowed the user to select from this and then selected items with these as symptoms again using SPARQL.<p>It mostly came up with some radiation poisoning because the symptoms for those conditions are quite broad (e.g. pain, fever, vomiting) and there are many variations of radiation poisoning on Wikidata. But I also did not spend that much time on it.<p>But ultimately this is a problem best solved by Semantic Technology and the majority of challenges are solved once you have a good ontology and good data matching that ontology in RDF. Then the questions can be expressed as simple SPARQL queries and a much better UI can be made where you don&#x27;t have to rely on NLP.<p>EDIT: some causality may also useful to exclude radiation poisoning, like saying the condition is preceded by exposure to radiation exposure so that users can then say they did not have exposure to radiation. This may already be supported by some wikidata properties.')
