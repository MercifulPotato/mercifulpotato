I had to replace the battery twice already and the touchpad hasn&#x27;t been properly working for a while. Even replacing it has not fixed the issue of it stopping to work a few minutes after booting up. I also get regular Bluescreens and the microphone is not working anymore. Now, my keyboard is starting to act up.<p>Hence, I&#x27;m looking for a new daily driver. Ideally, it should be lightweight, since I&#x27;m a student, but powerful enough to run more complex statistical algorithms. It should also not exceed 1500€. Ideally, it will be a bit more durable than my current device. At least it&#x27;s 13&#x27; form factor is quite nice.')
