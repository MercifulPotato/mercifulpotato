He gives two generations as the length for instability to dwell up, and if you move that like a sliding window over American history most of the time it&#x27;d probably be true depending on your definition of violent upheaval.<p>However if you expand it to other countries I think it quickly breaks down. In Latin America or the ME you have these cycles on a per year basis if they actually ever stop, in some regions you have way more piece and stability for hundreds of years.<p>The &#x27;two generations&#x27; logic makes sense if you sneak into your assumption that you&#x27;re in what I&#x27;d call moderately violent, fairly stable society like the US, but the reasoning is kind of circular.<p>Also assuming cliodynamics actually did have predictive power far beyond common sense then you have fully entire Foundation territory because then you&#x27;re in some sort of strange loop where the acceptance of cliodynamics likely diretly impacts cliodynamics.')
