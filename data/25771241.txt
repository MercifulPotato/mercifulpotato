The same applies to the rest of the engineering team. It&#x27;s been the same at my previous two companies as well. No, it&#x27;s not the norm at companies but there&#x27;s plenty where that&#x27;s the case.<p>In my experience, the US is a place where little is given to you but you can get a lot. But you cannot take anything for granted. If you value vacation then you need to grill potential employers on that point and be willing to take a job that pays less. Most people value money so if you value something different you need to be proactive about getting it.')
