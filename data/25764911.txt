I think is this: search for a definite term (like a site name) and get no result, where previously you got many results.<p>This happens all the time, but is not noticeable for large numbers of people.<p>This may be argued as acceptable when it comes to political speech (as it is the fashion these days). This is also not new at all, historically. Whenever an authority adopts or makes a map of a territory, the authority defines what exists and what not. Google is a map making company.<p>But when there is no obvious political reason? Then there is copyright (Sci-Hub), or other private entities interests into play.<p>You may argue that everything is political, though...<p>My blog [1] mentions that since October 2020 most of my recent posts are no longer discoverable via google or ddg search. Why? perhaps because I repeatedly made comparisons with the East India Company :)<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chorasimilarity.wordpress.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chorasimilarity.wordpress.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;</a>')
