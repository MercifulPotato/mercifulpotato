If one is sold directly by amazon then I&#x27;d pick that one over the third party. Why? It&#x27;s so much easier to get a replacement&#x2F;refund&#x2F;return with amazon than third party sellers.<p>If third parties are all selling the same thing then amazon can probably make more profit than the third party as well, so that&#x27;s why amazon will also do it.<p>Now I do wish Amazon would pay more tax etc etc, but people like me make it easy for them to operate and do things like this.')
