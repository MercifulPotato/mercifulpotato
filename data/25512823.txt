I might have to check out the HEY trial on web and on mobile.<p>I think this HTML SSR approach have different tradeoffs and uses compared to Single Page Applications.<p>The HTML SSR works best with a stable connection and being close to the server for good enough latency. Higher cost on the backend is a tradeoff on how much computation&#x2F;complexity you want to offload to the client, and also what language&#x2F;framework you want to work with more.<p>Some HN comments from previous related topics suggest these approaches (Hotwire &#x2F; LiveView &#x2F; Blazor? &#x2F; StimulusReflex &#x2F; Intercooler &#x2F; HTMX &#x2F; Unpoly) fare better with apps targeting a specific region so roundtrip latency is lower. One can optimize the reads with DB replicas + app servers closer to any user, but the write DB is the bottleneck (I think). This also ties in with the feedback that US&#x2F;EU HEY&#x2F;BC users perceive the app as snappy enough while AU users feel the latency a lot more.<p>SPA (properly built) should be more resilient in regards to network stability&#x2F;condition&#x2F;latency and expose a lot more offline capability.<p>I feel like the ideal app is HTML SSR + an app shell to serve some offline capabilities. Scaling the write DB globally is a hard problem though.')
