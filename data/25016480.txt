Item(by='johnisgood', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604769667, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25015676, text='I know someone who has fried GABA receptors or God knows what (he actually has brain lesions), and in its natural state he is the same as if someone took lots of amphetamines. It is not good. He uses opiates to balance it off, and works for him, he is productive and so forth. Opiates do not make him nauseated nor euphoric. We do have an antidepressant named tianeptine that is used as a nootropic in the US, and it is an antidepressant here that affects the same receptors as opioids. I do not know if tianeptine would work for him, but opioids do, and who am I to judge? People have all sorts of reasons for drugs, some are more harmful (the reasons, I mean... the drugs too, but that is a different story) than others. If it makes him functional and &quot;normal&quot;, without any side-effects (apart from some constipation he can fix if necessary with magnesium), then why not? I just typically live and let live. I never judged him for it. You cannot even tell. You can tell when he is in his &quot;normal state&quot; though, that is horrible, and I am not talking about the opioid withdrawal. He is anxious as heck, shaky, very reserved, cannot focus, and so on. He occasionally goes through voluntary withdrawals so he has to take less doses. He has no cravings through withdrawal (probably because he is not taking it recreationally or for escapism), and the only withdrawal symptoms were sweating and diarrhea that disappeared after like 4 days or something like that. I do not keep a tab on him, we just talk. Fascinating stuff.<p>I guess the moral of the story is that there are many and legit reasons to take drugs that can affect people very differently, and who are we to judge? I will repeat this because I really found it to be nice to live by: live and let live, and whatever you do (context), do it responsibly and safely.')
