I spend a lot of time on research, very little on development (i.e. finding out what makes a good story).<p>The website has about 1k users&#x2F;month, at 1.5 years old, with little marketing except for posts like this and topping Bing searches. It&#x27;s something I intend to make money from eventually. I&#x27;m looking for a tech co-founder who&#x27;s good at prototyping crazy ideas, or a writer co-founder who understands the field deeply. Ideally 50% share, with someone who cares about the problem as much as I do. We&#x27;ll probably go slow&#x2F;part time until we figure it out.<p>Longer story at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;random-character-generator.com&#x2F;whatisthis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;random-character-generator.com&#x2F;whatisthis</a>')
