I shouldn’t use the defaults, with no command line flags, should I? I keep reading through the man page trying to figure that out, but the options are numerous and confusing. I love using rsync but the interface is what gets in the way compared to scp. There are too many different rsync workflows that are all given equal weight in the documentation.')
