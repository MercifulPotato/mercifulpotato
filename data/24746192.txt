Does a blog count? Does it have to be a &quot;traditional&quot; media outlet (eg. tv station, newspaper)? Do op-ed&#x2F;letters to the editor&#x2F;&quot;contributor&quot; sections count? How does reporting by a third party vet anything, if they&#x27;re just repeating the person&#x27;s claims? eg. &quot;Local business is racist, customer claims&quot; provides the same information as a yelp review saying &quot;this business is racist!&quot;.')
