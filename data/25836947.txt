But since that would become dangerous if the permissions were loosened later, AWS would wind up creating two classes of keys, public and non-public, in order to know whether to warn about loosening restrictions. Simpler just to forbid making keys public.<p>To publish such a key anyway without having to go to the trouble of unwinding an AWS auto-quarantine, breaking it up in code (like &quot;part1&quot; + &quot;part2&quot;) might be enough to foil the AWS bot. Can anyone confirm?')
