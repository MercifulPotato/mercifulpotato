One way to find them would be to find an authorised distributor in your country for larger projects like the Raspberry Pi and see if they sell the components you need. Chances are if they&#x27;re an authorised distributor for a recognisable product then they&#x27;re probably not going to risk losing their spot on that products website just to sell some fakes or dodgy components.<p>The key thing is to not buy directly from China or random eBay sellers from abroad if you can help it, return postage to China is prohibitively expensive and Chinese stores or marketplaces like Aliexpress won&#x27;t always agree that you&#x27;re entitled to a full refund without returning the item even if that item happens to blown up in your face, and likewise you can&#x27;t really expect that small random foreign eBay sellers are going to be liable for selling you items that adhere to your countries safety regulations for instance.')
