I have large hands (my hand span, thumb to pinky, measures 26 cm). I have an iPhone 7 for work, and while it does fit in my palm, it does so much less comfortably than my SE. Going even larger is a non-starter.<p>Yes, there are people with hands large enough that phablets fit in them, but only if you loosen the definition of &quot;fit&quot;.')
