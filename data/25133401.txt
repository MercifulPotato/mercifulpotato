I&#x27;ve worked with too many great coders who were terrible at communicating. This includes engineers who were fluent at English. Communication is an extremely important skill.<p>This is a reality of life. If I moved to Nigeria and could barely speak the language, should I expect people to accommodate my poor communication skills? Or would I get passed over for a local who is possibly sub par in terms of coding quality but is more effective in all parts of their job?')
