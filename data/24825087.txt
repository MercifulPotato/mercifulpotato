In the UK the main party got 51% of seats with 36% of the vote in 2015. Their share actually went up 5% in the next election two years later but they lost a bunch of seats as the opposition votes weren&#x27;t split between multiple parties as much.<p>Voting reform _should_ be the long term goal and choice would come from it but the main reason the US is in a rot to the level it is is probably more down to the various areas of control (specifically the Senate, judicial system and the utterly insane amounts of money running through the whole political system).')
