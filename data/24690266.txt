Never so much where I&#x27;ve had an accident, but bad enough where I&#x27;ve scared myself badly.</i><p>This is pretty selfish. If you&#x27;re falling asleep at the wheel enough that you want Tesla&#x27;s Autopilot to save you, you have a problem.<p>I&#x27;ve seen Tesla cars do absolutely insane maneuvers on the freeway that no sober driver would ever consider doing, only to find out that the person behind the wheel is asleep or doing another task other than driving.')
