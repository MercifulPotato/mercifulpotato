A &#x27;super expert&#x27;?  What do we call Francis Chollet, or LeCun, or anybody else? What&#x27;s the differentiation between an expert from the roadmap and the team of individuals deploying GPT-3 into Google Assistant? Are they the same?<p>As a hiring manager and team lead for a large fintech firm in London, I would happily see an individual who had really mastered the above path(s) as a strong candidate for an intermediate or upper junior role in applied data science&#x2F;machine learning. But ... it&#x27;s not enough to be a senior, and certainly not an expert. Just my two cents.')
