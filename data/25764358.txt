An EC2 instance is just a Linux system, as is a Lightsail system.<p>Other systems like MinIO and Ceph have S3 interfaces for object storage, so the code could be kept. Operationally you&#x27;d need to retrieve it from Amazon S3 and re-store it. RDS is an export, transfer, and import away from being loaded into a normal database server, but that can take quite a bit of time.<p>Getting geo-sensitive DNS and implicit testing of backends out of Route 53 isn&#x27;t so simple. Getting stuff out of Lambda and onto a commodity platform isn&#x27;t quick and easy. If you have data in Glacier there&#x27;s a substantial lead time to recover your first byte.')
