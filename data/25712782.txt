Got burn out and now I&#x27;m studying again to get a engineering degree in data sciences (yeah, the full hype thing). It feels so good to study (with 20 y.o. kids :-)), and it sure dwarfs the lack of money coming in (I&#x27;m not working because studying is a full time job).<p>So it&#x27;s a totally risk career move but that&#x27;s either that either being sad at my workplace. Hopefully I&#x27;ll feel empowered by the degree and be able to move on professionnaly.')
