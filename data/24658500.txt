Instead of forcing interaction, most of my time is spent observing the cats.<p>I imagine part of it could be a stressful environment, but my hypothesis is that in the cat-cafe-shelters that allow for adoption, the most personable and social cats end up getting adopted. This is probably the case with regular animal shelters as well.')
