Which it pretty sad - with different leadership with technical vision, who knows where computing power would be today? But that&#x27;s business...<p>Intel took it too far though, and didn&#x27;t seem to see AMD catching them up in their rearview mirror. IMO it serves them right, and I&#x27;m so happy there is a underdog challenger that is outpacing them in so many areas. The desktop I bought last year has an AMD processor - the first in my household in many years, but hopefully not the last.')
