I&#x27;m not at all putting crap on Displaylink. It&#x27;s been fantastic, I just upgraded to 20.4 and hit a few small issues.<p>Ubuntu&#x27;s been really solid. Boring even. Which may not seem like a compliment, but I don&#x27;t nerd out on OS stuff, I just want a computer that I can do stuff with when I need it. And I personally found previously with mac and windows my ability to &#x27;just do work&#x27; wasn&#x27;t there.')
