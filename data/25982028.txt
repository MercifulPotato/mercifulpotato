I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll find some success but to call it something that will become one of the most important platforms, I don&#x27;t see it. And perhaps I&#x27;ll be proven wrong in the next decade on this.<p>I&#x27;ve recently started using twitter again (after initially using it in 2010&#x2F;2011) and I feel that there&#x27;s so much self promotion all the time disguised at knowledge sharing. It also seems like everyone (most people) have a podcast, a newsletter, a youtube channel, etc. I understand that on a surface level people are doing this to increase their &#x27;surface area&#x27; but there&#x27;s just too much and while I&#x27;m sure it does a some&#x2F;a lot of good for the people putting it out there, most of it just seems like noise to me. So that&#x27;s my reasoning to think that clubhouse won&#x27;t really become as meaningful as you - it just adds more noise. Sure I can hangout in this room or listen to some folks talk about x&#x2F;y&#x2F;z topic, etc. but honestly I feel that after some time people will realize that their time could be better spent.')
