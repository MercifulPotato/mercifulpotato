But if the proof-of-works are valuable outside of their purpose within cryptocurrency as proof-of-works, then the attacker can re-coup some of the costs of their attack by selling the results of their proof-of-works. Double-spend attacks will then have higher benefits and may be profitable to attempt now.<p>Additionally, proof-of-work systems used by a decentralized cryptocurrency can&#x27;t rely on a centrally-produced dataset. If the Folding@Home group produced workloads for the cryptocurrency miners to solve, then the group could construct fake workloads that they already knew the solutions to, and then secretly insta-mine those workloads themselves to earn mining fees or to do double-spend attacks on the network.<p>I think it&#x27;s better for cryptocurrencies to instead focus on developing solutions that just don&#x27;t need proof-of-work mining to happen at all, like proof-of-stake.')
