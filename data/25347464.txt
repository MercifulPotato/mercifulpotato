I&#x27;d rather China have my data than the US government or US corperations.<p>Edit: Why should I care if China has my data? Everyone seems worried about it, but I can&#x27;t think of a good reason. I can think of a lot of reasons why I would prefer my own government from having it, though. The only scenarios I can think of, is if I become rich or powerful, or if China takes over the US.')
