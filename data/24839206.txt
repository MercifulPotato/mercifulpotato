I know people have a tendency to get defensive, when they believe someone insults their craft. I am not doing that. I am arguing that what google has really going for it is inertia. It is similar to the world of OS, where Windows still rules supreme. Note that DDG was built fast, but it struggles against G search engine based on familiarity. But ok, DDG has issues other than familiarity. What about Bing? MS had to actually pay people to encourage adoption. That is how strong the force of inertia really is. So yeah.
