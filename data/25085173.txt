We can absolutely do that, <i>after</i>.<p>What I want is to know why we had a seated president who could get away with so much shit. A smarter autocrat would have taken us to a scarier place much faster. Mercifully, Hitler&#x27;s dumbest lieutenant could talk circles around His Cheetoness. I&#x27;d like to know why the Executive branch had so much privilege and what we can do legislatively to make sure nobody else can do a few of those things ever again.<p>Unfortunately without flipping the Senate, the only way that&#x27;s going to happen is if Biden pulls the same shit. The Senate Majority leader will get over the Ends Justify the Means, remember &quot;checks and balances&quot; and move with uncharacteristic speed to redraw the lines.<p>That&#x27;s not a jab at the Right, that&#x27;s a jab at Congress. When &quot;our&quot; asshole does something within their rights but ethically sketchy as hell, it&#x27;s okay because we Had to Do It. When the other side copies us, well that is an affront to the Constitution and we must stop it.<p>Nobody ever learns a goddamned thing, whether they live in Germany, the US, or in a small remote tribe.')
