The most important among them is oil. The only way to buy oil is dollars. That&#x27;s the reason their economy is set up to export to America.<p>The minute oil producers start accepting other currencies (which is what trade blocs such as this could accomplish) or they reduce their dependence on oil (which is what Chinese companies are offering for cheap), these countries will not even try to export to North America because population-wise, America can never have as many consumers as Asia and Africa.<p>Our wealth in America is only because we are the reserve currency. We are not producing goods and services of the future any longer.')
