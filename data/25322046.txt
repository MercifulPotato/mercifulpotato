Like-ratio is definitely an unnecessary way to say &quot;percentage liked&quot; (numLiked &#x2F; (numLiked + numDisliked)).<p>The green line indicates the like ratio of episodes over time.

The redder the line is, the (relatively) lower the like-ratio.<p>Again, perhaps my copy is a little too terse; I&#x27;m not the best communicator.')
