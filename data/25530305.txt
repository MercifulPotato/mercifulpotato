Figure 1GB (50 20MB pictures) per customer.  Just add another 2TB, then 4TB, now 8TB or bigger drive.  That&#x27;s about $250 or $300 each time.  Double that for a sync&#x27;d drive somewhere in the office.<p>Now they should be doing 3-2-1 backups. With S3 they&#x27;d be paying $160&#x2F;month (for storage, not counting other costs) for 8TB or $40&#x2F;month for BackBlaze B2.   That&#x27;s 8,000 customers.<p>They&#x27;re in England so some variance in pricing.  But it would be relatively inexpensive to buy big drives, sync them to a set in the office, and back them up online.  Where the doctors or whoever is running the clinics can SEE the data is still there whenever they want.<p>I agree that there should be increasing worry about keeping information that you don&#x27;t need, whether it&#x27;s intimate pictures of your surgical clients or people who bought from you 5 years ago and not since.  But it seems like keeping things handy will be an impulse that&#x27;s hard to overcome.')
