The only <i>specific</i> reason for this that I could find was a mention of LiDAR and how Waymo sees it as indispensable.<p>&gt; Krafcik says that Waymo has largely completed technical work on its self-driving software and is now focused on scaling the technology up.<p>...cool? Again, no mention of a SPECIFIC reason Tesla cannot do the same work as Waymo outside of not having LiDAR sensors. They attack Tesla for not developing a fully autonomous vehicle from the get-go, but don&#x27;t seem to explain why this makes it any harder for them to make the finished product.')
