The middle dielectric layer, or &quot;prepreg&quot;, is <i>way</i> thicker than the dielectric layers in the outer layers. This doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal, but for the speeds that a DDR interface runs at, it creates a higher impedance return loop for whatever you end up routing on layer 3. (Typically DQs, in my experience.)<p>You can avoid this entirely by building with a six layer stackup, and routing your DRAM signals on layers 1&#x2F;2&#x2F;3, keeping layer 2 as an unbroken ground plane. The result: nice, low impedance return tracks.<p>Yes, Jay is right - <i>most</i> of the time, this doesn&#x27;t create problems. But when it does, it&#x27;s pretty challenging to fix without a board spin, and when you&#x27;re doing this professionally, that loses you time, creates risk, and is <i>generally hella stressful</i>.')
