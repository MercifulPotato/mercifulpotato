E.g. having some processing options in camera can speed up your workflow (but then again all the &quot;toys&quot; like this are removed from pro cameras because most people didn&#x27;t use them). Also, the same magic Apple or Google use doesn&#x27;t really exist outside of their phones (yet at least, I assume Adobe is working on this).<p>There&#x27;s also some obstacles that I know of:<p>- bigger sensor, slower readout, slower sensor processing<p>- much bigger raw, needs big expensive CPU, heating problems<p>- hiring engineers that can do this (it took a long time for Apple to catch up to Google f.e.)')
