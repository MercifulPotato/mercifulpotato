Now I can no longer see myself driving any car that is not electric. This from someone who loves the sound of a good muscle car even to this day.<p>GM&#x27;s issue has always been they have played the compliance game while claiming otherwise. Even Ford is doing it now with the Mach E by limiting availability to 50k models, a number a third of the sales of vehicles they have cancelled for low unsustainable sales.<p>I never bought my TM3 to save money, buying any new car pretty much is a losing proposition. I bought it because it was cool. It was the closest I have even seen to those dream&#x2F;concept cars from the seventies and eighties. All those cars with radical exteriors and even more radical interiors. Well someone built it.<p>Is it perfect. No. However as an EV is had my most important feature. Range. I could care less about its 0-60mph times. I want range. I want to drive to my friends in the boonies and back in all seasons without having to divert to charge. I want to be able to skip chargers because I have the range to do so.<p>Plus remember, every range number given should be hedged by multiplying it by 0.90 as no manufacturer suggests charging to 100% all the time.<p>On a side note : Do not buy FSD. Tesla will not let you transfer it to another Tesla and even right now trade ins to Tesla are hit and miss as they have been giving ZERO dollars on trade for the feature. You don&#x27;t need it for lane keep assist or traffic aware cruise control. I don&#x27;t care if you believe Tesla can or cannot deliver it, the simple matter here is they don&#x27;t honor you by giving you anything for it on trade; something that Elon claims to be looking into')
