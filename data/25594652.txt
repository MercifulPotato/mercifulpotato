The with-passenger rates are already high enough that drivers make well above minimum wage at 100% utilization. When the effective wage (with-passenger rate times utilization rate) is higher than the market wage, drivers enter the market, driving down the utilization rate until the effective wage equals the market wage. If the policy is only changing the with-passenger rate, the utilization rate will just drop until the effective wage equals the market wage.')
