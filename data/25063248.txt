By that I mean fossil power plants will need to be destroyed by aggressive acts. If these acts are via domestic drone attacks by your own populace - so be it. It is possible that the situation will become dire, so countries will attack fossil fuel emitters in other countries as their own people start to starve by lack of crops. One hopes it will never come to that.\nThere is, of course, the elephant in the room - stored methane clathrates (a complex of methane and water that forms under fairly low pressure-300 psi or so). They are mainly accumulated under permafrost areas, and as the earth warms and melts the permafrost, the clathrates decompose into methane and water.Large amounts are being exposed in the arctic, where they were formed under the ice caps over millions of years, and stayed metastable until lower pressure&#x2F;warmer temps allowed them to decompose.\nLarge areas in Northern Russia are now emitting methane from this.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Methane_clathrate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Methane_clathrate</a>')
