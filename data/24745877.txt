The argument I was addressing was the consideration on utilitarian grounds.<p>It&#x27;s possible that there may be second order environmental affects on the utilitarian calculus. I.e. the loss of sharks, causes enough ecosystem imbalance that it out-weights the direct suffering caused by species X. But that&#x27;s specifically an empirical claim, and simply claiming that &quot;sharks feel pain&quot; isn&#x27;t sufficient.<p>In general there&#x27;s no reason to believe that the current ecological balance is the utilitarian optimal. Darwin selects for inclusive fitness, and doesn&#x27;t give a hoot about animal suffering. Imagining that the pre-existence of a large predator population exists to improve the lives of the prey population is succumbing to the fallacy of group selection.')
