Its energy density by unit of mass is very good, though energy density by volume isn&#x27;t as good as methane. The cost of hydrogen containment is a function of surface area, and containers ships have large fuel tanks.<p>Cryogenic storage may be feasible for ships, since the ship is surrounded by water which makes heat exchangers work better. Cryogenic storage works by constantly releasing a bit of the fluid to keep temperature down. In the case of a ship crossing the ocean, fuel is constantly being siphoned off to power the boat anyway.<p>Methane is easier to work with, but the sabatier process (synthetic methane) requires a source of carbon. By comparison, it&#x27;s feasible for costal nuclear power plants to desalinate water and create hydrogen through thermochemical reaction. The energy used in desalination isn&#x27;t wasted, since bringing the water up to temperature is the first step in thermochemical hydrogen production.')
