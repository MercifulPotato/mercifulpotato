The whole thesis of the F-35 is apparently an airborne sensor fusion and electronic warfare platform as well as a modern BVR jet - it&#x27;s going to be harder to jam because of both redundancy and the amount of hardware real estate the designers can play with to counter said jamming.<p>On the subject of electronic warfare - I assume it&#x27;s still very classified but given that the current teen series aircraft apparently have some serious EW magic in them (I don&#x27;t have any citations for exactly what they can do other than I read some comments by IIRC an Australian ground radar operator and apparently they were completely outgunned - i.e. fake formations rather than mere jamming) I think we will be reading about exactly they can do at great length on the hackernews&#x27;s of the future.')
