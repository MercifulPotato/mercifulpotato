Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=[25800343], score=None, time=1610774688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25799980, text='Many Americans say they have more freedom than Australians, because (among other reasons) there are a lot more hoops to jump through in order to legally buy a gun in Australia than in the US (and the range of weapons you are legally allowed to buy having jumped through those steps are narrower, and the regulations around storage&#x2F;carry&#x2F;etc are more restrictive.)<p>On the other hand, in the US the government (federally and in 28 states) has the right to kill you if it can get 12 jurors to say you&#x27;ve done something so bad you deserve to die. So, it seems Australians may not have the same right to own guns, but they have a greater right to life. Why count one right and ignore the other?')
