I mean, it&#x27;s not like everyone in USA personally met Joe Rogan or Elon Musk (not sure if these are the best example, since I am not from the USA, but I&#x27;m guessing they must be good enough), but you probably are kind of familiar with them and vividly remember their voices. You don&#x27;t have to be a CIA agent spying on them to recognize them over the phone.<p>That being said, as I already told, I think it is plausible. People often don&#x27;t recognize other people by voice, despite being very much familiar with each other.')
