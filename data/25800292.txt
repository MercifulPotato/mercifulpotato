Remembered that Michael states &quot;The main use for swap on modern systems is to have a place to store\na memory dump should the system panic and crash.&quot;<p>I think this is reason enough to enable swap even if you do not plan on using swap for system memory. It&#x27;s always nice to have a memory dump if the system crashes so you can check what the issue was and correct it. If you wouldn&#x27;t want to fix those kinds of issues why would you be running FreeBSD anyway?')
