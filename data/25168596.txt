With 30 years of development, the situation today could also be interpreted in such a way that Linux devs just can&#x27;t stop to add code. Time will tell if Linux can be maintained if the original generation of devs step down. I&#x27;d feel more comfortable if we&#x27;ve let kernels stay minimal rather than becoming kitchen sinks. Apart from better portability, this would&#x27;ve also enabled younger devs to start from scratch rather than having to maintain daddy-o&#x27;s monstrosity.')
