I mean, even a Tesla has over 40 computers on the CAN bus. Cars may look simple when they just have a touchscreen interface, but they&#x27;re really a small network of computers that can be driven. Engineering, and then building a car is really hard. Tesla has proven an upstart can do it, but they&#x27;ve been at it almost 20 years and Musk himself says it is very hard to build cars.<p>I&#x27;m sure Apple can do it if they put the resources in, but they&#x27;re less than 1000 people deep at this point. 1000 people is a small department working on something you&#x27;ve never heard of at a large automaker. I don&#x27;t even mean top secret stuff, I just mean day-to-day shit that most people don&#x27;t think about, like drafting repair routines for each possible thing that can go wrong that someone in the field needs to fix in a timely manner. You take your car into get repaired and only 2-3 people may touch it, but that&#x27;s nothing compared to the hundreds of people that worked on the information and software that those 2-3 people used to fix your car.<p>Not to mention the different software that is running in all of the 40+ computers in the car... or the hardware and software that&#x27;s used to communicate with&#x2F;diagnose problems with&#x2F;update those computers.<p>Even after the car is engineered, it takes over a year to then engineer all of the tooling, equipment and processes that will be used to mass produce that car, put that tooling in place, configure it, test it, train people to use it, etc.<p>Modern cars are marvelous machines, and there&#x27;s a nearly unbelievable amount of effort that goes into designing, building and repairing them.')
