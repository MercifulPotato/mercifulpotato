I currently use Workplaces as my daily driver but keep evaluating the alternatives.<p>One thing that ProtonMail really needs is automatic detection of calendar events in emails and creation of calendar events. It is a real blocker to have to manually create calendar entries. When they release a new iOS app that supports their calendar, if they support automatic calendar entries then I will likely switch back.<p>The other big win with Workplaces is Cloud Search, which is also a big time saver, but I could reluctantly live without that.')
