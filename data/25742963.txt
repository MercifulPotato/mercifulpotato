Can I not ever talk about my opinion to anybody? Can I share it with my wife? Can my wife look at what&#x27;s going on in the world and disapprove, or is that not allowed? Are people who believe as I do simply to not exist? Should we be exterminated? Should our lives simply be made so miserable that we&#x27;d rather we were killed in Gulags? Exactly what are you attempting to accomplish here, because right now, I am not allowed to talk with people on facebook (group bans); I can&#x27;t talk on reddit (subreddit bans); I can&#x27;t talk in church (lockdowns). As we saw with Parler (which we were promised was safe, because now the central authority was not someone who didn&#x27;t like me), I also can&#x27;t make my own app or service with my tech skills, because they&#x27;ll be banned too. I can talk with my wife and family, so I guess I&#x27;ll just keep on breeding to make more people to talk to, until you decide that the school system ought to be used to take my children, nieces, and nephews away, as we&#x27;ve seen in other western countries already, or until we&#x27;re not allowed to have kids, as has been proposed by some journals and implemented in other countries (to much applause, mind you).<p>That sounds like a really great world you have planned for us. I am so glad my parents fled a third world country where our ethnic group made us be treated like trash to escape to this! This is exactly what they had in mind when they left :)<p>I guess I just don&#x27;t really get it. I&#x27;ve accepted that my ideology has lost; all I ask is to be left alone to work, garden, own my home, have my children, raise my children, and let them do the same. I have already unregistered to vote, and have no more interest in politics, other than to complain about it online. Am I allowed to do this? What more must I do to not be considered an evil monster? Honestly, my treatment on Hacker News over the past year has been worse than the combined effect of racism growing up brown in a mostly white neighborhood during 9&#x2F;11. This is insanity at every level.')
