They keep arguing among each other about which operating system or programming language is best, and why should we take their advice when software security vulnerabilities keep being discovered?<p>Not disagreeing with your point - it&#x27;s become too easy to just randomly click &quot;agree&quot; on any TOS and trade away your privacy&#x2F;security for convenience - but don&#x27;t make it an &quot;us vs them&quot; type of thing. To me, this is purely corporate interest being prioritized ahead of public needs because most politicians either have no spine or answer to lobbyists more than the common person.')
