But I am genuinely passionate about this kind of thing.<p>The gist of the thesis is that all these dynamic and interdependent aspects (e.g. lack of sleep, stress, social pressures, even for athletes before, after and during a race, even if we think about the influence on self-perception in relation to other people and related expectations on personal performance) can lead to somatization which can come in the form of concussion, but also to burnout or multiple injuries (as my friend is researching on the thesis) and as it happened to me too, in my life.<p>All of these are very interesting talking points and the inherent dynamics behind vicious cycles (echoing @raghuveerdotnet&#x27;s comment) is still not crystal clear and needs further research and experimentation.<p>What are your thoughts?')
