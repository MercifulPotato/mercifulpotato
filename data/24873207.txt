I&#x27;m working on expanding smgmusicdisplay.com. SMG&#x27;s a tool used by Twitch streamers to display what music they&#x27;re currently playing.<p>I&#x27;m designing a song played history page for streamers where their viewers can browse through their most played songs, their history, favorites etc... But I really like this idea of adding community moderation into the mix as well!<p>Streamers are known for having tightly knit communities. So far I&#x27;ve been excited about building this idea, but I ran into a roadblock where smaller artists would still not get much more exposure... But in this case, if an individual streamer likes a particular artist, that can actually result in a lot of exposure, even for small artists!<p>Thanks for this suggestion!')
