Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609708530, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25615510, text='&gt; Technically it would be no big problem to enforce speed limits widely<p>More than you suggest.<p>&gt; The technology for speeding cameras isn&#x27;t exceptionally complex<p>But speed cameras are just one piece of enforcement. With those and automatic license plate reading you get a piece of evidence that a car violated the limit at a particular time and place, but even if the law is that a set limit is a hard limit (which is not the case in much of the US, where posted limits are often prima facie but not dispositive limits), that&#x27;s not all you need for enforcement. You also need legal process to weigh potential counterevidence, to deal with contested identity of actual drivers, etc. This isn&#x27;t technically complex, but it adds a lot of overhead, which is why even places which legally allow this mechanism deploy it selectively, not comprehensively.')
