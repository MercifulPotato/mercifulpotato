Unfortunately this might have had some inadvertent, unhelpful effects, including “making you less confident and less capable of facing difficulties, therefore [leading you to] exhibit poorer leadership skills”,</i><p>Actually, for many parents it is not about THEIR intentions but that the <i>child protective services</i> can take your children away if you are not hovering nearby at all times whether needed or not.<p>Go out to the park across the street by themselves?
