But more to the point in order to replace you they have to pay market value for your job. They can only find someone cheaper if your job is beneath you.<p>Parlaying offers is fine as long as the work they need doing is worth that money. Who are they going to replace you with? Hiring is expensive even if they find a sucker. The only risk is if your market value is higher than they need to pay to get your job done.')
