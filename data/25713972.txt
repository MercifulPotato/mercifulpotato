But can you really beat the &quot;are we aligned in the same direction&quot; from the CEO and the other executives? Especially on the 2nd day.<p>You can spin it however you want, come up with some great arguments, but if the CEO decided to fire people, I don&#x27;t think he takes that decision lightly so when he&#x2F;she presents that decision you can count that it really is the last option he has.<p>It all comes down to trust. Trust your CEO that he has no other choice, maybe explore alternatives. But if he is a really good CEO, even if you fight it and argue for it, you&#x27;ll wind up at the same conclusion he did. In fact, 9&#x2F;10 you&#x27;ll wind up at the same conclusion he did. Remember, it&#x27;s his job to convince and lead people so he&#x27;s probably better than you at that.')
