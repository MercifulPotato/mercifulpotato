Kind of like a theremin but with cheap sonar modules (distance sensors like they use on toy cars).<p>It&#x27;s incredibly fun to play. It&#x27;s not accurate enough to control a pitch with precision but for a controller, to drive filters, modulators, etc. it&#x27;s perfect.<p>Also, my kids love to play with it -- not in a &quot;musical&quot; way but to control the music while they dance. It&#x27;s a way of using it I hadn&#x27;t anticipated and it&#x27;s super nice to see them do it.')
