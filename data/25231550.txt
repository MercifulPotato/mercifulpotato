The has never been a Palestinian country before 1948 when Israel was created.<p>I don&#x27;t get the point here. Whether it was named Palestinian  or not, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that Israel occupied those territories! We are talking about land, not names.<p>Well, in those books that you read, was it mentioned why Hezbollah was created and what it is doing now? Would you say they are terrorists but Israeli government is not? And what would you say if someone acts directly in a terror operation or via proxies? Does it matter?')
