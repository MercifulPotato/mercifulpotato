At social gatherings over the years, a not-uncommon question, asked by immigrants and born-citizens alike, was &quot;Where are you from?&quot;<p>There was no quicker way to become his mortal enemy, and to ruin a party!<p>He thought people were trying to parade his otherness, with the intent of making him feel out of place, not welcome, lesser-than, etc.<p>From another perspective, each question was an opportunity to educate people on his heritage, and an objectively-fascinating <i>component</i> of his identity (that of &quot;The Immigrant&quot;).')
