I can only speak for myself but I would only be interested in investing in a very small number of funds and they don&#x27;t want my money (or sometimes anyone&#x27;s money). Unless you are convinced a fund adds value after fees it&#x27;s very hard to justify when you can construct your desired market exposure with passive products which are much cheaper and more liquid. It&#x27;s painfully boring to do that so like everyone else I&#x27;m tempted to punt on sexier things every now and again but most of the time I don&#x27;t.<p>To answer your last point, there&#x27;s some of that for sure - in many parts of finance complexity is good for margins. And yes it&#x27;s tough to demonstrate much value if your investing process amounts to placing buy orders for index funds. It&#x27;s not all bad incentives though, hedge funds can offer uncorrelated (to the wider market) returns which are very valuable in a portfolio.')
