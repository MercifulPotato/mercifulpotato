The whole idea of venture capital is to fund many companies that will fail with the hope of finding the one unicorn that will make up for all the losses.  A lottery just the same.<p>It&#x27;s true that if you&#x27;re taking out loans to fund your bootstrapped company you could be left holding the bag.  But it&#x27;s also true that you can build an IT startup without taking a lot of big loans for capital expenditures.  You only grow when you&#x27;re making money, so it&#x27;s a slower path, but for some businesses it may make more sense.')
