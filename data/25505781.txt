React has had this for a bit. So, we decided to port the react-notion project to Vue and are introducing the same functionality to Vue!<p>I hope there are some Vue &amp; Notion fans here, we would love to get some feedback on this new package!<p>Let us know what you think – Have a great day everybody!')
