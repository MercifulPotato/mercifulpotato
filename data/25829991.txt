Item(by='ergocoder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611030451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829817, text='&gt; Why is it an inappropriate comment?<p>This is the same as saying &quot;Stay safe homies looters are about&quot;, or &quot;Stay safe homies black people are about&quot;. The tone is distasteful, to say the least.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a generalization that is harmful since nazism is a strong accusation. When accusing someone with things like this, you should be specific.<p>As an improvement, he should have used a more precise language in a sensitive issue like this like &quot;Stay safe. There are some nazis in the protest, and the situation might be escalated to violence.&quot;. To be honest, this is like social skill 101.')
