My university class group depends on Messenger, several family members and friends do too. It may be easier to incite individual people to change messaging services, but when it comes to groups or common social connections, it becomes quite difficult. I can&#x27;t ask everyone in a group to stop using Messenger just because I don&#x27;t want to, and neither can I ask my family to contact me solely on Telegram or Signal if other family members refuse to switch. Having everything at the same place is so convenient for most people that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to provoke this kind of change.')
