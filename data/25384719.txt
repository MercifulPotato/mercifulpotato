These are not &#x27;small difference&#x27; only of interest to geeks, these are large user visible differences that could make everything non-Apple look inferior.<p>I don&#x27;t see x64 suddenly getting competitive on this front any time soon, so are the &#x27;traditional&#x27; laptop vendors (e.g. Lenovo) going to have to pivot to ARM as well? Possibly segmenting so that &#x27;gaming&#x27; or &#x27;workstation&#x27; are different market sectors that stay on x86. Even if they do switch there&#x27;s going to be lag for development, and there&#x27;s no guarantee that the software landscape will be as set up for it as on Apple.<p>As someone whose purchases are &#x27;second hand thinkpad, install Linux&#x27; I&#x27;m all for it. If you pick the right distro, Linux has supported ARM well for a while.')
