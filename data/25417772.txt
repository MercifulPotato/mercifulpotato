The bootcamp had several key advantages over self study:<p>- Easier to put in 40-60 hours per week in a structured environment vs having the discipline to do that at home week after week\n- Less time wasted on figuring out what topics you need to study in the first place\n- Daily access to a senior engineer that you can ask questions to\n- Good advice on how to land the first job<p>In my case I think those benefits were absolutely worth $20k+. Yes, I could have gotten the same result on my own given more time to study, but every job and promotion I&#x27;ve had since then would have come a few months later.')
