That said I feel companies like Riverlane or Q-CTRL are way too early in the market. There are still so many open questions regarding which architecture and technology is best suited for quantum computing, and there isn&#x27;t yet a single practically relevant problem that can be solved on a NISQ quantum computer (to my knowledge). Building a software company on such a shifting hardware landscape is quite bold. Having built several technology companies with novel, albeit much less cutting-edge technologies I would be very wary getting in so early into a field that&#x27;s barely starting to get commercialized. But again, kudos to them for being so early in the game, I hope it&#x27;ll work out for them.')
