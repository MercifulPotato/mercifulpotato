I can almost guarantee they won&#x27;t be able to answer those questions, because they haven&#x27;t bothered to actually try to <i>learn</i> CSS. Their knowledge of CSS is built from a set of &quot;how do I do X in CSS&quot; searches and the resulting stylesheets are hobbled together messes.<p>If you learn the box model, if you learn the reasons behind selector specificity, and how cascading works, you&#x27;ll really earn a true appreciation for CSS. It does not take long to learn, you just have to spend a day reading through the &quot;boring&quot; stuff.')
