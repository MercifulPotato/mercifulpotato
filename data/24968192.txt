You can&#x27;t search message content.  gmail is very good at this, so I&#x27;ve had to become more organized to make sure that I can find a particular message in protonmail.<p>2.  Notifications on mobile do not clear if I&#x27;ve read the message on another device.  I have to open up the app and sync to stop them from popping up with outdated information.<p>3. I wish that there was a way to mark a message as archived and read from the mobile notification.<p>Other than that, I can&#x27;t complain.')
