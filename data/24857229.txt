Item(by='whatrocks', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603369481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24854097, text='Thanks - I&#x27;ve been reading a lot &quot;about writing&quot; recently, mostly as a distraction from editing my novel about robots and childhood. I think this is a common pattern for struggling writers - &quot;if I just READ about WRITING, then that&#x27;s almost as good as actually sitting down and DOING THE WORK.&quot; All that said, I just finished John McPhee&#x27;s &quot;Draft No. 4&quot; and highly recommend. McPhee&#x27;s a master of &quot;creative storytelling&quot; and I tried to incorporate some of his advice into this post (plus some gifs).')
