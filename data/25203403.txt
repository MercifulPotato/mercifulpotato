We also get several of the random bank holidays as holidays.<p>Another thing I like is they bought us a Linux Academy subscription, and we are given time during the day to us it. Which is nice as I like to learn new things, and this way I don&#x27;t have to use my time to do it.<p>I actually chose this job over another that paid more because of little things like this.')
