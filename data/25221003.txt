Also the post itself, its writing and visual style, are surprisingly well executed. OP must be working 24&#x2F;7.<p>So, I don&#x27;t want to be that guy but every time I had disclosed my secret sauce in the past, e.g. how my recent venture sky-rocketed, I disclosed it <i>when the growth was over</i>, never, really never, before. Why should I hand out my treasure map which was months of work to everyone?<p>However, the author wrote that she wants to reach 20K and this will be still a challenge and so she seems quite credible but still, reading this post took some time and I am not sure if it was well invested. I feels like the typical r&#x2F;entrepreneur post how-I-made-x-in-y-weeks but, again, much better executed.')
