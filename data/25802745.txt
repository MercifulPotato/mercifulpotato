Item(by='input_sh', descendants=None, kids=[25805147], score=None, time=1610810596, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25802184, text='I do both within the same app (Obsidian) with some plugins, so let me explain the difference from my perspective.<p>Wiki, in my mind, is more suitable for somewhat long and detailed notes about concepts. Random titles from my notes: conspiracy theories, neoliberalism, borders, norms, monopolies, habits, addiction, time management...<p>Zettelkasten is kind of the opposite of that. It&#x27;s more about making connections between concepts than thoroughly researching certain concepts. Random titles from my notes: news kills creativity, inequality generates status anxiety which generates ecological damage, relationship between paywalls and echo-chambers...<p>These connections made in zettelkastens have no place in a wiki page because the point of wiki pages is to have a somewhat detailed explanation of concepts. Zettelkastens are much shorter (usually between 5-10 sentences and 1-3 sources).<p>Another way to look at it: zettelkasten is for stuff that you write once and rarely have a reason to expand upon (other than to create a new link to something similar), while wiki is for stuff that you know you&#x27;re gonna have to return to with the goal of adding more stuff.')
