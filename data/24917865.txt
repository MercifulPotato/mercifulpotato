To pretend that illegible evidence of authenticity is okay is disingenuous.  <i>Everyone</i> knows that Amazon is full of fakes.  You would think scammers would try to have reasonable proof of authenticity so that when the banhammer comes swinging down, they&#x27;d have a saving grace.<p>Plus, the article is clickbait.  I don&#x27;t see how the man is homeless. He&#x27;s not a rough sleeper.  He&#x27;s staying with family.  To call him homeless is absurd, it cheapens the word and erodes our communal empathy.')
