They gave 1 month notice to some people before almost doubling prices, and others apparently didn’t get any notice at all. Left them for a more expensive service— large and sudden price increases send a message of instability and bait and switch  dynamics whether or not it’s actually the case. Gitlab, on the other hand is using a phase in approach. It gives customers time to adjust and prepare. Whereas they could have just hiked prices and exploited customers who didn’t have time to react. Of course you get pricing wrong sometimes (I guess even by 2-5x). But really you have to be careful with how you raise prices. Personally I’d rather have happy customers, although captive ones pay the same.')
