Beyond a basic 1:1 audience 50&#x2F;50 exposure test, Facebook also lets you upload offline sales (or use their pretty effective pixel for real time online sales) and then feed into their system. Using the data your purchase data FB matches to ads delivered and you (with PII but also purchase value and frequency). Then the advertiser can define lookback&#x2F;conversion definitions to get a measure of incremental lift. E.g. those who clicked ad bought __ right away, those who viewed ad within 1, 7 or 28 days bought __.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth the adtech forums I participate on view Uber as incompetent idiots on this issue (which has been reported on like last year) - all they had to do was measure beyond the initial install for say did these installs actually pay to ride...<p>Install fraud from SSPs and resellers is huge, doing this basic measurement and quality control is the reason Facebook and Apple have huge and growing app install business.
