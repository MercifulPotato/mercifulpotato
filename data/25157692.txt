But is it sufficient to actually justify that time vs working on other projects?  Can we quantify how much difference that extra polish will make several months down the line?<p>I find it hard to fight myself, because no small part of me sees my work in the same way Durnik does:<p>&gt; &quot;Always do the very best job you can,&quot; he said on another occasion as he put a last few finishing touches with a file on the metal parts of a wagon tongue he was repairing.<p>&gt; &quot;But that piece goes underneath,&quot; Garion said. &quot;No-one will ever see it.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;But I know it&#x27;s there,&quot; Durnik said, still smoothing the metal. &quot;If it isn&#x27;t done as well as I can do it, I&#x27;ll be ashamed every time I see this wagon go by - and I&#x27;ll see the wagon every day!&quot;<p>I landed a huge improvement on a product at work about 9 months ago, after months of work on it.  Cut execution times down by a huge amount and made the customer experience more consistent.  Managers look at it and see what I achieved.  I look at it and see all the things I don&#x27;t like about it, all the ugly hacks and things that make it work.')
