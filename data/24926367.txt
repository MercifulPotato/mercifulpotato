One of the biggest problems with flutter is the IDE integration for the design aspects. In my opinion, the development experience is much worse than Xamarin, .NET&#x2F;Mono, Delphi, Lazarus etc.<p>2. The documentation is not very good and can be quite out of date.<p>3. The components are mostly all UI&#x2F;layout related. There aren&#x27;t good components for DB integration etc.<p>4.  I have noticed is that between version upgrades of flutter, there can be multiple problems - but this is not surprising that flutter is still quite new.')
