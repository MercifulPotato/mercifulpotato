Wow. And it often talks about issues which have been resolved, or haven&#x27;t been relevant in ages, or are not a concern for most people out there.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itvision.altervista.org&#x2F;why-windows-10-sucks.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itvision.altervista.org&#x2F;why-windows-10-sucks.html</a><p>And some things from it are outright cringe-worthy, e.g. &quot;Ineffectual read-only permissions semantics&quot;. Windows ACL for files&#x2F;directories is 100 more powerful than what Linux offers.<p>Some Windows advantages are shown as shortcomings, e.g. case-insensitive filenames vs. case-sensitivity in Linux which in absolute most times just leads to confusion. In my 20+ years of using Linux I haven&#x27;t found a single usecase for case sensitivity.')
