But this is harder to do than you&#x27;re thinking because the problem with education was both weighting <i>and sampling</i>.<p>So, yes, you can play with the weights and get a corrected result. (That&#x27;s literally just tautological though -- of course in a parameterized model you can wiggle weights around to give the perfect result when you already know what the result should be...)<p>But, no, that doesn&#x27;t tell you about what the effect of increasing the <i>sample</i> of these voters would be, and improving <i>sampling</i> is the only real way to get closer to ground truth.<p>So, some pollsters are sampling larger numbers of less educated people and also weighing those votes differently. But no, we can&#x27;t know what the combined effect of those two things would&#x27;ve been in 2016. Why? because we can wiggle around the weights post hoc but can&#x27;t go back in time and resample. And the question about correcting without resampling is kinda uninteresting because the fact that you can get the correct result by <i>just</i> wiggling around weights is literally just a mathematical tautology.<p>Hope that helps.')
