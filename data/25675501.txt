To think he&#x27;s right you need to believe that certain speech leads to violence or hatred and that trying to suppress that speech prevents violence and hatred. And even if speech can lead to violence and hatred, some could argue that it&#x27;s not enough to justify taking away someone&#x27;s individual freedoms. Like how someone not being able to responsibly drink alcohol isn&#x27;t a good justification to take away my right to drink it. If you commit violence because of intoxication, you&#x27;ll get punished for the violence. But it&#x27;s not a good reason to take away my right to drink alcohol.')
