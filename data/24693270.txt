Item(by='kbenson', descendants=None, kids=[24693433], score=None, time=1601941062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24691821, text='&gt; There is no way you are tired enough to be actually falling asleep without realising you&#x27;re far too tired to be driving safely.<p>Except I was, and I did.  And now I can recognize the signs that weren&#x27;t obvious before, so I don&#x27;t anymore.  You&#x27;re saying there&#x27;s no way, and I&#x27;m giving you a concrete example of an instance.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not as if it&#x27;s a close thing where one minute you&#x27;re alert and driving responsibly and the next minute you&#x27;re out.<p>There&#x27;s a huge range between &quot;alert&quot; and &quot;asleep&quot;.  I&#x27;m tired after a long day, yet I can drive responsibly.  Even a the point where I could lay down and easily go to sleep if I chose to, I&#x27;m fine to drive for quite a while after that (preferred sleep time is not necessarily the same as responsible driving time, there are many factors that go into it).<p>&gt; Anyone who can&#x27;t make that determination reliably is demonstrably unfit to be in charge of a vehicle and should hand in their licence.<p>So, have you been in that situation?  Or just always stopped before you got to that point?  Or not even driven over a long enough period to be in that situation?  You haven&#x27;t even presented any anecdotal evidence, you&#x27;ve just made assertions that what I said I personally experienced can&#x27;t be how I described it (and implied I was demonstrably unfit to drive at the point I said this happened to me).')
