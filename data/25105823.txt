We came to being the exact same way every other current living species did, thru natural selection. So then how can we be living, as you say, somehow outside this &quot;Nature&quot; you speak of?<p>Hell, I know I may be in a small minority who says, by definition, nothing that we do is &quot;wrong&quot; because we are simply doing what our brains, which are 100% a product of this Nature, are telling us to do.<p>Post-modernism is quick to tell us there are no absolute rights and wrongs...that only culture makes it so.  So why then can some say that its immoral to create and study these creatures that our nature-created brains have led us to create?')
