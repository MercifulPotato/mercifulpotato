This list started as a collection of links for a bunch of my friends that are into both art and storytelling but none of them have the programming experience I have so I tried to link the more user-friendly stuff up top and get generally more esoteric going down, though I haven&#x27;t gone though and really enforced that ideal into the list yet.\nI think there&#x27;s an interesting balancing act going on here as some of the appeal of these tools is their inherit complexity and strangeness acting as a sort of creative propellant as it puts you into a different mindset. I think that tools that are on the surface approachable but still let the user get into the really deep aspects have a lot more potential to allow for artistic revolutions (for lack of a better way to put it).<p>I also don&#x27;t think it has to be just for newcomers as Processing and the like try to be, For example- the multiple Rust frameworks on the page.<p>Honestly I&#x27;m not even super into the generative art scene much beyond being a general nerd and observer. I am really into generative music, with tools like Orca [1], the various modules in VCV Rack [2] being my go-tos but I still love looking into and toying with other generative and&#x2F;or live coding music tools too.<p>I think there&#x27;s a certain nostalgia for the demoscene that while I completely understand, clouds the reality that it was at it&#x27;s core about pushing hardware beyond it&#x27;s limits for the sake of creative uses. If we have all the compute we could ever need now then I think it&#x27;s great that people who may have been into the demo scene are instead able to spend their time on making cool, usable tools and art with those tools. Besides, for the people that crave the highly technical, it&#x27;s not like esolangs or ioccc or making Quines etc. are going anywhere. Plus, the demo scene isn&#x27;t even truly dead, if you look around there&#x27;s definitely still plenty of the same old-school stuff going on. Some of it on the old hardware of the era, some of it pushing today&#x27;s micros or even beefy x86 systems to their limits.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hundredrabbits&#x2F;Orca" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hundredrabbits&#x2F;Orca</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.vcvrack.com&#x2F;?query=&amp;brand=&amp;tag=Random&amp;license=" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.vcvrack.com&#x2F;?query=&amp;brand=&amp;tag=Random&amp;licens...</a>')
