All major cities (NYC, Amsterdam, Paris, etc etc) suffer from reduced tourism and tax money. There&#x27;s no question that a city like SF would suffer more than many other cities given high percentage of its tourism is business travel. But the city still has a lot going for it besides tech. And at least FAANG for the most part will still attract many people to the area as the majority of them are not going fully remote yet. The city can also try to attract more diverse industries such as pharma companies that still require office space. They can also increase property taxes for a few years if they need to. Yes, SF as the center of tech as we know it is probably dead, but it doesn&#x27;t mean the city is dead.')
