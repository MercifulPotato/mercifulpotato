That&#x27;s one side of the whole thing: Where can I run it, when I am done or when I want to deploy?<p>It would be interesting to learn more about the available libraries and frameworks as well. Of course standard compliant Scheme code can probably be used. What else? Where can I get libraries from? To get to the need to run the software somewhere, one first needs to write it. Of course libraries can be of great help here. I would like to know, what the ecosystem looks like.<p>And the readme links to cyclone-winds package manager, which does have a few packages at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cyclone-scheme&#x2F;cyclone-winds&#x2F;wiki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cyclone-scheme&#x2F;cyclone-winds&#x2F;wiki</a>. A little statement about being able or not able to use libraries from other Scheme&#x27;s ecosystems might be good to add.')
