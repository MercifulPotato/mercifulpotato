I live in a town of about 7,000. We had a &quot;labor of love&quot; local paper for a while but haven&#x27;t for a long time so Facebook or Next Door is pretty much my only source of information about what&#x27;s happening in town. But it&#x27;s not hard to do the math and see why it&#x27;s really hard economically.<p>How much would it cost to produce a weekly newsletter&#x2F;newspaper for the town with a sustainable income for one or two people? Maybe $100K&#x2F;year? Now you&#x27;re talking about every town resident paying over $10&#x2F;year--and most won&#x27;t. Can maybe knock that down with some advertising--of course, now someone has to sell ads too and we have very few businesses in town.')
