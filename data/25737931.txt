The claims in 2016 was that it was for all intents and purposes stolen by a foreign adversary&#x27;s interference, the investigative focus being if the candidate knowingly colluded to that end, not if it happened (many presumed it was the determining factor.) The claim in 2020 is that it was stolen by on-the-ground cheating, bending of the rules, exploitation of weaknesses in mail-in ballots, and, on the craziest track, a foreign government manipulating our election machines.<p>In both cases, voters on the ground lost trust in the outcome of their election and felt foul play resulted in their loss. Democrats felt that the Russian government tipped the scales. Republicans now feel that Democrat bad actors tipped the scales. The semantics you state here are far afield from the thing that matters: distrust in elections as a pure expression of the will of the people and our government and media&#x27;s inability to unwind that distrust.<p>Where we sit now is those who feared foreign interference in 2016 are likely nowhere near they were in 2016 for two reasons. First, they had an investigation, and this probably mitigated a lot of people from believing their worst fears. Second, they&#x27;ve had another election which went their way and no such interference is being claimed, so at the very least one ought to conclude that this isn&#x27;t enough to control an election.<p>Where we also sit now is the newly aggrieved parties (approximately a third of the country if you believe polling) feel the election&#x27;s outcome was determined by fraud. This is a real problem that will not go away, and needs to eventually be unwound somehow unless you want a war. I don&#x27;t know how it happens, just like I would have had a hard time predicting how the former one unwound. But just like we shouldn&#x27;t have ignored the first one, we can&#x27;t ignore this one or pretend suppressing it will solve it: it won&#x27;t.')
