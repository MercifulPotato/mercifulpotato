Typically that its a bell-curve distribution &amp; ratio style data. The more you move away from that parametric style of data, the more conventional statistical functions simply have no meaning.<p>To use an example. I worked at a shop where we had a freemium model. About, let&#x27;s say, 50% of our customers paid $0.00. About 2% paid over, say, 10K. Between those two points we had a reasonably clean exponential curve, clustering at key product price points.  (I&#x27;ve goosed the numbers for confidentiality purposes, but this is close enough for discussion).  In this scenario, what was the average ROI per account? <i>Well</i>, truth is, that&#x27;s not a useful answer, as it was roughly $0.01.<p>I wound up building a small set of non-parametric data tools to assess the customer base. It was a fun journey, but a critical lesson is:  the kind of data you have and its shape determine the statistical functions that have meaning, <i>and</i>, they didn&#x27;t teach that kind of data analysis in your basic calc-based stats class in college. :)')
