Said from experience.<p>I share your frustration. I worked on election and voting issues for a decade, fulltime for two years. I was slow to realize that my Mr Smith Goes to Washington folk theory of politics has no basis in reality. The only successes me and mine achieved were thru bringing pressure.<p>I highly recommend Camp Wellstone&#x27;s training for organizers. (Please share recommendations.)<p>Electeds, leaders, and partisans to effect change is a misunderstanding of what they do. They are in a neverending knife fight for power. Any actual policies are merely the playing cards in the game. Sure, many pols do hold one or two firm positions, for which they will expend &quot;political capital&quot;.<p>Leah Stokes&#x27; recent book Short Circuiting Policy is a very good, data driven explanation of policy formation. I collect books about politics, policy, etc. Mostly to better understand and learn from own experiences. Many very good.<p>That said, Stokes most closely matches my understanding of how legislators behave wrt policy.')
