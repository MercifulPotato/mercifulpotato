Like many here, I think it&#x27;s a great service&#x2F;client but probably has some security issues (although they are largely trade-offs). However, I don&#x27;t agree that my example backs your view: there&#x27;s no way I could get my other friends and family to switch en-masse. I still only use it pretty much with that one friend and a small group around him. And all the others say the same: they hate on the guy for being a pain despite liking the app.')
