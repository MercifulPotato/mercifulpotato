That&#x27;s common sense. Don&#x27;t make your coworkers so angry that they&#x27;d rather be jobless than spend time in your presence.<p>The freedom of speech isn&#x27;t the freedom to speak without consequences.  Frederick spoke her mind in a public square, and signed her name to those statements, and other people freely chose not to associate themselves with her.  That&#x27;s bound to happen from time to time.  It&#x27;s a free country.')
