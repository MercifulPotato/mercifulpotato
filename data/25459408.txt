Everything else should have been the wild west.<p>If you want to see what that is like, take a look at voat.co.<p>Wild west sties usually end up with three kinds of content.<p>1. Content about things that you&#x27;d also find on mainstream sites, and with decent user comments.<p>2. Content about things that you&#x27;d also find on mainstream sites, but the comments are full of talk about Jews and black people and gay people and the terrible things they have done to hide the truth about whatever the thread is about.<p>3. Rants about the need to take control back from the Jews and blacks etc, often by killing them all. All the usual insane conspiracy theories, although often spiced up with ties to Jews, blacks, etc that you don&#x27;t see in the mainstream versions of those conspiracies.<p>#1 is usually low traffic. If you are interested in this stuff, the mainstream site will serve you far better.<p>#2 is often a decent amount of traffic. But if there are any useful comments they will be embedded among a bunch of the racist, antisemitic, anti-gay etc stuff. As with #1, you will probably find mainstream sites much more useful.<p>For an example of a #2 type discussion, see the comments to this voat.co &#x2F;v&#x2F;science [1] thread on pilot wave theory.<p>The end result almost inevitably is that the site ends up being only interesting to, and largely only populated by, those who are there for the racism, antisemitism, etc, or for the conspiracy theories.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voat.co&#x2F;v&#x2F;science&#x2F;4152241" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voat.co&#x2F;v&#x2F;science&#x2F;4152241</a>')
