Item(by='morelisp', descendants=None, kids=[25599375, 25599816], score=None, time=1609457195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25597627, text='&gt; All of mathematics can in principle be derived from ZFC.<p>Even this isn&#x27;t true; many useful (as in often-used) statements are independent of ZFC, and not even in the semantically funny way a Gödel sentence is.<p>Or maybe ZFC is inconsistent, in which case all of mathematics surely can be derived from it - but so can all mathematical lies. Gödel also proves we can&#x27;t know if it is or isn&#x27;t (at least by the standards mathematical formalists seek).<p>&gt; not part of mathematics in any reasonable sense.<p>This is an aesthetic claim about what theorems get to count as &quot;real mathematics&quot;, and one both Gödel (who believed in the literal existence of mathematical objects and therefore actual truth of his sentences) and contemporary hardcore formalists (whose goal was to find some extension of PA both complete and consistent) would disagree with.<p>Gödel quite literally proved mathematics is &quot;beyond&quot; (as in its truths cannot be wholly captured by) and &quot;above&quot; (as in mathematical rules seem to be able to characterize the whole of) mathematical logic. Whether that makes it &quot;magical&quot; or not is something we will probably debate for another century.')
