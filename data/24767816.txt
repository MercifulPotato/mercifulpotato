Combine with maybe inner compartments for standardized space containers for whatever else? This could be completely passive and autonomous, where the attached engine modules for deorbitng could detach and climb back up to some parking orbit or space dock before reentry happens. By choosing the right dimensions of that lifting body(surface to weight) you could avoid much of the reentry heat, down to about 400Â°C.')
