Item(by='cushychicken', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610128134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25686928, text='<i>It&#x27;s a cost of doing business that would be ameliorated by telling people how to use the product, because then they&#x27;re not the only ones able to do the work</i><p>...if you&#x27;re talking about processors, sure. But only talking about processors gives  a really narrow view of TI&#x27;s business, and doesn&#x27;t add any context into why they sell the way they do. They make a <i>ton</i> of money on analog applications that require no OSSW support at all. They know how to sell chips that way - they&#x27;ve been doing it for fifty plus years. They are an analog company that didn&#x27;t get into the processor business until comparatively recently.\nI&#x27;m sure a bunch of this cloak and dagger around datasheets is legacy holdover from an analog sales world. They know what they are doing in that department, without doubt.<p>As to why they&#x27;re DMCA&#x27;ing someone for a 50 year old datasheet - I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s as simple an explanation as someone in Legal carrying out their boss&#x27;s mandate. Nothing more, nothing less.')
