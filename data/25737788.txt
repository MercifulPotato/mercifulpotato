Sometimes I will find a political article written by somebody whose views I disagree with but the author attempts to be thorough, doesn&#x27;t reason backward from their conclusion and tries to account for their own biases and limitations. It&#x27;s frankly heart warming what that happens.<p>Most of the news that seems to gain popularity on social networks is not that though. It&#x27;s not really news, it&#x27;s pandering and it&#x27;s reinforced by the echo-chamber nature of said social networks.<p>I&#x27;m lucky enough to be able to read several languages and I found that the best way to find consistently decent news coverage is simply to look for it on the outside. See how the Russians or Brasilians report the Capitol riots. See what the Ukrainians have to say about the British elections. Of course these news outlets are not without their own biases, but at least they tend to be less emotionally involved and don&#x27;t have a horse in the race, which in my experience leads to more factual reports.<p>For instance while most European news outlets will lean anti-Trump, they are unlikely to consciously or unconsciously silence or downplay pro-Trump or anti-Democratic news simply because they don&#x27;t really have any direct influence on American politics. Meanwhile a journalist at CNN or Fox News is in a different position, because their reporting will be de-facto politicized and could have direct consequences one way or an other.')
