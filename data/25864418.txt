I remember fees going as high as $80 for a transaction back in the day, so that means you could only reasonably use bitcoin for a minimum of $1000-$10,0000 when fees were the worst. But in reality, Bitcoin can be .000001% (I put a random number of zeroes don&#x27;t take it literally).<p>Additionally you&#x27;re trying to &quot;protect the blockchain&quot; by having people never able to use it. Surely you see the absurdity.<p>If Bitcoin ever hit Visa scale, there&#x27;d be no problem with only well-capitalized miners maintaining a full chain. It&#x27;s really not an issue, but frankly you should cross that bridge when we get to it anyway. In actuality Bitcoin was hard limited at 3-7 transactions&#x2F;sec for no reason whatsoever.')
