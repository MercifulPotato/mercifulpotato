I can’t say for sure one of my great-grandmothers participated in this, but I can’t rule it out.  I had two great-grandmothers living in the lower east side then. Ethel arrived in 1892 with her family from Pinsk, Belarus and would have been 17. Her mom Annie would have been 36.<p>It could have also been my great-grandmother Rachel who’d arrived in 1897 with her family from Romania.
