Unfortunately the devices on eBay are going for prices outside of my budget since I suspect my exploration will last all of half an hour. I see a lot of refurbished models from China, so hopefully their prices drop over the next few years. I&#x27;m interested to see if Meego could have been the viable competitor that Windows Phone wasn&#x27;t.')
