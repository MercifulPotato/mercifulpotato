So, rather than calling func(some(3)), you&#x27;d just call func(3) and the compiler would automatically wrap it up. Func would be declared this way: def func(int?) to indicate that it&#x27;s an optional type. IMO you get the best of both world. And then, in many places in the code, you&#x27;d have to do &quot;r?.foo()&quot; if r is an Option type. It&#x27;s different than javascript where the &quot;?&quot; isn&#x27;t enforced by the compiler.')
