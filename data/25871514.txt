By your own admission in our past interactions you have stated there are certain topics you remove because you think they lead to flamewars.  That may actually be a good thing, and your reason for doing so may be justified.  However, this also means there are indeed topics that cannot be discussed on HN.  Therefore, it is false for anyone to claim PG&#x27;s forum does not enforce some form of censorship.')
