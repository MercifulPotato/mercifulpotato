Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=[24713163], score=None, time=1602107087, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24708241, text='I don&#x27;t think you understood what I was saying.<p>I basically agree with everything you said about saving some people and murdering others.<p>But &quot;saving less people&quot; is a totally different situation.  If I donate some money to charity, and I&#x27;m asked to donate more money, it&#x27;s okay for me to say no.<p>So the question is whether these features fall under &quot;saving some people and killing others&quot; or if they fall under &quot;saving less people&quot;.<p>You believe it&#x27;s the former, and I believe it&#x27;s the latter.<p>Remember that even pure safety features are imperfect and they are subject to the butterfly effect.  Anything you change about a car design will cause <i>some</i> shift in who dies while driving that car.  You have to determine if there are really two separate risk groups, one sacrificed for the other, or if it&#x27;s all really one risk group.<p>As a thought experiment, imagine we made a car that was all-around much safer, and then we let 14 year olds drive it.  Well that actually happens, with mini-cars that have strict speed limits.  (Usually they&#x27;re legally not cars.)  We <i>could</i> only allow normal licensed drivers to use them, and they&#x27;d be very safe!  But then, purely for convenience, we let younger teenagers use them.  Is that a moral abomination?  Some of them are going to die.  But I think it fits into the normal risk of driving, and as long as a 14 year old in one of those is safer than a normal driver in a normal car, I&#x27;m satisfied.')
