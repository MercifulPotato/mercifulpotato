I never realized they were both so temperate.<p>They are both 10 degrees of latitude further North than me here in Iowa, yet they both look to rarely dip much below freezing.<p>I knew London&#x27;s temperature was buffered by being so close to the ocean, but I always thought Berlin was far enough inland to not have that benefit.<p>And then on top of that they both have milder summers than here.<p>That&#x27;s all very interesting to me.')
