Instead you get a public-routable IPv6 block.<p>No more split-routing issues.<p>No more &quot;gateways&quot; or &quot;peerings&quot; or &quot;service endpoints&quot;.<p>No more Private DNS Zones that may or may not work across virtual network boundaries.<p>No more copying DNS records into on-premises Active Directory DNS.<p>Every VM can get a globally unique address. So can every service, of any type! No more conflicts. No need to carefully &quot;carve up&quot; and &quot;allocate&quot; addresses. Just let the system take care of it...<p>No more sharing IPs with other customers. Every resource, <i>no matter how tiny</i> can get a dedicated address. Got an S3 bucket with 1KB of files in it? You get your own IP!<p>Every VM or service sees the real client IP, not the reverse proxy IP.<p>No need for SNI, ESNI, or even host headers since every web server can have a dedicated IP.<p>No reverse proxy means that load-balancers can simply set up the TCP handshake and then everything runs directly at wire speed. There is never a need to &quot;scale&quot; a load balancer.<p>The IPv6 addresses are consistent, globally. The IP address of the cloud VM is the address you register on-premises to SSH to it. No NAT magic involved at any point.<p>Adding a private link (e.g.: ExpressRoute) doesn&#x27;t change your address ranges. They&#x27;re the same, only the <i>routes</i> change. This would be a completely transparent change to your firewall rules of whitelisting setup.<p>Etc...<p>PS: The current Azure IPv6 architecture reproduces all of the limitations of their IPv4 architecture. They even NAT the addresses! You literally cannot have any of the above, <i>ever</i>, with Azure using IPv6 as it is now. They even limit the number of IPv6 addresses to further restrict you. If they do fix it, you&#x27;ll have to redo your entire IPv6 setup. It&#x27;s insanity.')
