December 13, 2008. That&#x27;s astonishingly long agoâ€”only (checking the data...) 1.5% of HN accounts existed back then. Yet the &quot;classic&quot; frontpage is not that different from the main frontpage. This was the main conclusion when pg launched the feature: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=607271" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=607271</a>, and again in 2011: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=2073513" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=2073513</a>.<p>What that tells me is that the forces creating the HN front page don&#x27;t have much to do with changes in the userbase over time. That&#x27;s a major finding, and I think to most people (me included, and pg probably included) a counterintuitive one.')
