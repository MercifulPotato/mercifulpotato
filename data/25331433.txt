We settled on a solution where both parties would invoke a etherum transaction and would provide the details of the (business) transaction from their POV. I.e the goods (electricity) provided and the payment etc details. If there was a difference the data for that transaction would be flagged as &quot;needs inspection&#x2F;resolution&quot;. Otherwise the smart contract would distribute the payment tokens as agreed and record the data in the ledger.<p>But yeah all the data eventually has to come outside of the blockchain itself. This is always the weakness and shifts the trust issue to whoever is providing the data. Blockchain itself is no Magic bullet to resolve the fundamental issue of &quot;trust&quot;')
