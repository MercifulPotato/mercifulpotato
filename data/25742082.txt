I have close colleague in Taiwan and he was so excited to inform me that he’s now working for Ubiquiti. I was sorta shocked because I thought Ubiquiti was a US based R&amp;D team. When it first started, I remember watching the video of all the awesome engineers that left Cisco to start this new revolution. It’s sad to hear how the company is now being driven into the ground (merely for profits over innovation). I always thought that Ubiquiti would champion something in the 5G realm that would give US an edge over everyone else.')
