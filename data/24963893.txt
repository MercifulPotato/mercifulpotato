But that principle doesn&#x27;t sound specifically related to animals (or mammals, as this article mentions mice, rats and rabbits, but not fruit flies etc).<p>Should the same apply bacterial or fungal cultures? What about outside of biology? Should someone studying psychology of personality who gets a non-result from a survey of psych department undergrads publish it? Should a materials scientist who builds a bad battery describe it in detail? Should I create a PR for every branch which I don&#x27;t want to merge?<p>At some point, any new endeavor can only start by choosing to not spend 5 years reviewing all the one-off failures.')
