It&#x27;s also 500g lighter than the 16&quot; MBP. Lots of other properly tuned modern x86 laptops can perform similarly. For example the 14&quot; 1.48kg 18mm 56Wh battery HP EliteBook 845 G7 manages &gt;12h on NBC&#x27;s wifi websurfing test: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notebookcheck.net&#x2F;HP-EliteBook-845-G7-review-AMD-laptop-is-also-better-with-Ryzen-5-than-with-Intel.502343.0.html#toc-energy-management-strong-battery-life-for-business-work" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notebookcheck.net&#x2F;HP-EliteBook-845-G7-review-AMD...</a><p>&gt; This isnâ€™t how memory works :&#x2F;<p>Fair point that free might not be the best way to measure things, I have more tabs open now but still not doing work (obviously), so let&#x27;s compare:<p><pre><code>                total        used        free      shared  buff&#x2F;cache   available\n  Mem:       65328424    26679236    31393956     1165140     7255232    36284812\n  Swap:      67108860     3197072    63911788\n</code></pre>\nWith totaling per-process shared&#x2F;private memory (I uses memstat.sh for this). And the total I get is: 18.37 GiB - lower, but actually not so far off.<p>This is only with a two browsers (a few hundred tabs) and some resident electron apps open, mind you. Before upgrading (w&#x2F; 16GB memory) I was often hitting swap, and now I&#x27;m not. But if you don&#x27;t ever need &gt;16GB of RAM, lucky for you I guess.')
