The &#x27;turbo&#x27; in &#x27;turbojet&#x27; refers to the turbine.  Not all turbine engines are jet engines, and strictly speaking not all jet engines are turbine engines (though <i>by convention</i> &#x27;jet engine&#x27; is taken to mean an air breathing turbine engine specifically, excluding rocket engines which also use jets of hot gas for thrust..)<p>This naming convention is also broken by ramjet and scramjet engines, which breath air and produce jets, but do not have turbines.')
