Item(by='Arelius', descendants=None, kids=[25865851], score=None, time=1611268253, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865356, text='&gt; Just the other day I found a case someone had rolled their own priority queue with a sorted array instead of a heap.<p>I feel like this story needs an ending? Did somebody re-implement it using a heap and found significant performance wins? Or was the sorted array used on purpose to take advantage of some specific cache constraints and actually end up being a huge win?')
