Reliance on domestic food production is obviously something they&#x27;re very concerned about, especially with the history of agricultural disease outbreaks. I suspect the seizure of Chinese owned&#x2F;controlled property under US jurisdiction (or areas of influence) would be a significant blow, with respect to that. (As archaic as starving the enemy might be- we&#x27;re talking about war.)<p>As much as I hesitate to suggest a new govt database:<p>We need a system tracking all foreign ownership of US land. Including owned by companies with Chinese stakeholders.<p>An incredibly difficult task, given the majority of US land records are kept at the county level.<p>It might actually be easier to track it based on crop production, commodity trading, exports, or financial transactions, all of which all at least have some extant system for national data collection, but this is way over my head.')
