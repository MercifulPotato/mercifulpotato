With appropriate credentials you could speak on radio, TV or publish a story in a newspaper. With the internet and social media your ability to propagate stuff (and go &quot;viral&quot;) depends on your story (even if not truthful) not on your credentials. This is the reason why almost half the population now believes in and acts on conspiracy theories. We need to bring back the world where how far your story propagates (or how powerful the weapon you can own) depends on your credentials.')
