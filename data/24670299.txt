People want peace of mind.<p>Backup codes are not like passwords in at least two important ways:<p>* The site picks them, not you, so they&#x27;re random nonsense different for each code, rather than inevitably being password1234 and being the same on Instagram, Twitter and your bank account.<p>* You don&#x27;t need them usually, so there&#x27;s no reason you&#x27;ll have them to hand, which then makes it harder to steal them. Even for a social engineering attack, you increase the friction because now to help the attackers a user needs to go find their backup keys which is a hassle.')
