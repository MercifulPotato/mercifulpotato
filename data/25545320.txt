Who don&#x27;t even work for the same agency.<p>The agency issuing the rules is concerned with compliance in a way in which actual security is not a factor which mitigates or alters, which is the conclusion made, and is <i>entirely factually correct</i>.<p>The whole story is that important decisions are made extremely remotely (in all of time, organizational structure, domain, and concern) from the project.<p>Now if this was an argument for a specific alternative, or even just generally against the practice without an alternative replacement, it would need to go farther and address whether the approach deals with different, potentially even more serious problems (corruption and&#x2F;or ineptitude in over-empowered public agency managers, for instance) whether it was a net positive of negative in that context and whether, if it was a net positive, either the specific alternative proposed (if any) or any conceivable alternative would likely be a greater net positive.<p>But that&#x27;s not what this piece seems to be trying to do.')
