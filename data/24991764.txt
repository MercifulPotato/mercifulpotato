Fresh out of graduate school (almost), with work experience as an analist at a large energy firm in NL. Furthermore, I have a special interest in ML&#x2F;AI, did a few Kaggle competitions to familiarize myself with the field (HPA competition, top 20%). At this moment finishing up a thesis on Variational Bayes in &quot;large&quot; (in a macroeconomic setting) parameterized models. A traditional statistic education with an interest in ML&#x2F;AI has helped me get to grasp with the subtle differences between the two distinct fields (with each its benefits and detriments). After these years of studying I am eager to start! I am quite interested in applying the latest theoretical work to practical problems in any space (with a slight preference for non-finance)<p>If you think it is an interesting match, let me know!')
