Item(by='theptip', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607542205, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362159, text='&gt; that is just managerial incompetence<p>Isn&#x27;t this making a bit of a leap? Management could be correctly measuring that keeping load times below 1s will cost them $10m&#x2F;year and yield them $1m&#x2F;year in increased revenue (made up numbers for the sake of example, of course), i.e. making improvements would have negative ROI.<p>I&#x27;d love for the console to be faster, but it&#x27;s already way better than AWS (I haven&#x27;t tried Azure so can&#x27;t comment there) so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to increase my cloud spend just to get better load times.<p>There&#x27;s a general cognitive bias on HN where performance is assumed to be a feature that your product _must_ have, because we bias heavily towards individuals that appreciate good craftsmanship in our tools. I like well-crafted tools too, but it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that the ROI on polishing a tool isn&#x27;t always there, and that&#x27;s one of the realities of life in a world of scarcity with limited resources to be allocated.<p>This is just speculation of course, it could well be that GCP&#x27;s management is incompetent, and they haven&#x27;t measured the dollar-per-unit-performance tradeoff; my point is that I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve substantiated the claims of incompetence, rather you&#x27;ve assumed that the ROI on performance improvements must be positive. I know Google has done such experiments on the loading time for search results, I&#x27;d be interested to hear if anyone knows the details about whether this has been done in GCP.')
