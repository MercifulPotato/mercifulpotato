Item(by='jart', descendants=None, kids=[25557374], score=None, time=1609138724, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25557273, text='Cosmopolitan doesn&#x27;t use the &quot;red zone&quot; because these binaries boot on bare metal and operating system code can&#x27;t assume a red zone. GCC supports this. Otherwise the Linux Kernel wouldn&#x27;t work, since it&#x27;s compiled the same way. So invoking call from inline asm is perfectly safe. The only real issue is that the called function can&#x27;t assume the stack is 16-byte aligned. But that&#x27;s fine, since Cosmo only using asm(call) to call functions written in assembly.')
