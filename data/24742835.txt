I saw a variant of it a year or few back at Harvard, and IIRC, he suggests Phys101-flavor Amontons&#x27;-laws friction was dominated by interfacial debris mechanics. Rather than by boding or direct interference.  He told a fun story of a historical experiment replica, which gave unexpected results, until taken to a K-12 outreach event, where finger grease was helpfully added. Amontons&#x27; laws of large objects sliding on pig fat.<p>There&#x27;s often a large gap between education content and research understanding.  The pipeline flows neither smooth nor fast.  Even simple things, like the color of the Sun, can be pervasively wrong. Let alone hard things, like friction. And there&#x27;s almost no use of deep research understanding to craft novel learning progressions.  If anyone has heard of efforts with this kind of focus, I&#x27;d appreciate hearing of them - thanks!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;landgreen.github.io&#x2F;physics&#x2F;notes&#x2F;force&#x2F;friction&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;landgreen.github.io&#x2F;physics&#x2F;notes&#x2F;force&#x2F;friction&#x2F;</a> \n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fCe6UyNyPTg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fCe6UyNyPTg</a> [2]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;online.kitp.ucsb.edu&#x2F;online&#x2F;suspensions-c18&#x2F;robbins&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;online.kitp.ucsb.edu&#x2F;online&#x2F;suspensions-c18&#x2F;robbins&#x2F;</a> (with less than wonderful slides)<p>Addendum: re &quot;Examples of visible thermal radiation: [...] the yellow part of fire (not the blue)&quot;, my understanding is this is another common misconception, and that candle yellow, while having a spectra shaped similar to blackbody radiation, is actually the mess of soot C-C bond emission spectra.  It&#x27;s way too cool to be blackbody - you&#x27;d have to be able to put a bit of metal in the flame, and have it too glow as bright and white-rather-than-red.  Err, well, just since we&#x27;re here, re &quot;thermal emission [...] hottest to coldest: blue, white, yellow,&quot;, the Planck curve doesn&#x27;t go through yellow: blue-white-red.  It&#x27;s a quick way to see if software is getting its chromaticity math wrong, though that happily seems less common now than it was a few years ago.')
