Whenever you encounter #pragma once you check if the file is already present in the bloom filter and return early if it is. If it&#x27;s a new file you add the file name to the bloom filter and continue processing.<p>It probably even more memory efficient (albeit insignificant in the grand scheme of compiler memory usage) for the compiler to just maintain the bloom filter and not have to deal with hundreds of otherwise unused preprocessor symbols, one per include file.')
