Item(by='harikb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603824919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24910528, text='For interactive queries &#x2F; surgery, you do have an option with a transaction (begin&#x2F;commit&#x2F;abort).<p>If it is Postgres (don&#x27;t know about other dbs), you can go a way long way using &quot;savepoints&quot; and &quot;rollbacks&quot; to truly have a trial-and-error safe surgery on db. Still dangerous, but quite helpful. I hate working on any other db without those features. Postgres also allows schema changes to be within a txn envelope.')
