My understanding is that CentOS is mostly RHEL with the all trademarks replaced.<p>So if that&#x27;s the case, what&#x27;s the difference between a free RHEL without a commercial support contract&#x2F;license and CentOS other than Red Hat not having to maintain those IP-related changes for CentOS?<p>The alternative scenario that most people seem to be assuming, where there will be no free RHEL or RHEL-like OS, seems impossible to me as somebody somewhere will just recompile RHEL source and release it under a new name just like CentOS did before.  And of course Red Hat knows this.')
