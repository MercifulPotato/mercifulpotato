What propaganda or fake reporting?<p>China initially denied there even was a virus or that it was dangerous. Just like Europe. Just like the US.<p>What kind of weird conspiracy websites are you getting this information from and how did you end on this site? Don&#x27;t those places have comment sections too where you can discuss with like minded people that are also shopping for confirmation basis data points for their xenophobia.<p>China has a very scary government but that&#x27;s no reason to for us here to just make shit up. It actually dilutes from the real risks and criticisms.')
