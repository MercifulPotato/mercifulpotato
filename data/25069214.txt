I am aware though that it&#x27;s not easy to actually make it strongly typed for various reasons.<p>For a component-based framework, it&#x27;s way too tedious in Angular to actually create components. Too often I create big components because I can&#x27;t bring myself to split it into smaller components. In React it is so natural to create components you can do it even while you develop a feature (without it being overhead). I hardly do that in Angular because it&#x27;s just too much work.')
