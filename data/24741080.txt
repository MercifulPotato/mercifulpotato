Understanding multicollinearity, overfitting, dimensionality reduction, convergence, and time series issues like assumptions of stationarity or conditional independence effects.<p>Any engineer can crank out neural network software - that has pretty much zero value.<p>Value lies in realizing some stratification error in the data and following that lead to use a multi-level model to control for it. Value lies in realizing several key feature inputs are correlated on a seasonal basis - leading to multicollinearity - and then setting up some adaptive feature aggregation to mitigate it and dashboards with things like variance inflation factor to be able to raise alerts on it across time.<p>Value lies in working on small data problems and using literature review to determine the best prior to use for a Bayesian model, and doing robust posterior predictive checks to validate it.<p>These things require many years of education and experience dealing with statistical irregularities, understanding confounders and causal inference, understanding missing data treatments, understanding time series forecasting.<p>You cannot learn that in 101 courses that overly focus on the mechanics of how to type Tensorflow or sklearn code - that part can be picked up by anyone in a month or two. And mere intro to data cleaning and plotting distributions or proportions of missing data is not a substitute for actual statistical knowledge.')
