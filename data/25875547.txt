Typescript to Babylon to JS. Sass to css.<p>These are workarounds for native JS warts.<p>That&#x27;s why Im excited about NATIVE web components and future releases of JavaScript becoming sophisticated enough that we can ignore all of this framework insanity.<p>Or even better...web assembly somehow taking over and making all of this pointless. Native Typescript. Yes please.<p>But to address your point, you&#x27;re locked into JSX a lot more than someone writing in native browser code that doesn&#x27;t need transpilation and can be ported between other frameworks at the end of the day.')
