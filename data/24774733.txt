At least to me. \nCausing an accident and having your car burning out would ruin all previous considerations, no matter what type of car.<p>Having a car that breaks down often, that is technological to involved for proper repair, like hybrids and evs, will wreck all previous considerations. You will plug out components and put new in, effectively producing involved trash and buying your car again over time. \nYou can of course be lucky, or you can buy the ongoing repair problem.<p>So basically the cheapest car, considering all costs, including repairs and recycling and governmental taxes, would be the best in the long run. This is hart to predict and everyone has that problem, when deciding on a car to buy.<p>Taking any old giant diesel Mercedes limousine, that is already run for 30 years, for a 1000$ upgrading it to lpg or ethanol and using it for another 30 years, could be argued to be far more environmental friendly than any new electric car or hybrid.<p>If direct co2 output is your only metric, it will be the cheapest electric car you can find.\nJust don&#x27;t crash it or drive it in way that causes lots of repairs.')
