When I use Emacs, it&#x27;s more I need to go through hundreds of lines of others&#x27; Emacs Lisp configurations to figure out how to do the thing I want to do or spend many times 5 minutes Googling how to do &lt;x&gt; in Emacs. A good example of this is Elixir&#x27;s helpful coloring and tab completion in its help documents. When I tried running Iex in an Emacs terminal, it just didn&#x27;t work, and after Googling, it&#x27;s just a mess of solutions. It literally <i>just works</i> in Visual Studio Code&#x27;s terminal.<p>I forced myself to learn Emacs for a class, and it was really quite painful. I get the power of the bindings and all that, but it&#x27;s really a mess of an ecosystem, and I encountered plenty of bugs. Even then, I never got things to work just right, and it worked poorly when doing things across Windows and WSL boundaries. Another thing was that any time someone used my Emacs, they couldn&#x27;t because it wasn&#x27;t like <i>their</i> Emacs.<p>So I&#x27;ve just gotten used to Visual Studio Code because I spend more time doing the thing I wanted to do than finding out how to do something simple in the editor. I add a single custom keybinding for toggling between the terminal and the code window, which can now be synced using a Microsoft account. I just install whatever extension I want (through <i>one</i> extension manager) and go at it. Combine this with the extremely powerful and useful extensions of Remote - SSH and Remote - WSL that allow you to use Visual Studio Code on basically any other computer <i>with</i> your extensions as they work on Windows, then you have a one-stop shop for development.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;remote&#x2F;remote-overview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;remote&#x2F;remote-overview</a><p>And by the way, Visual Studio Code can do graphical tasks: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=hediet.v...</a><p>Is Visual Studio Code perfect? No. Can someone be more productive in Emacs than Visual Studio Code? Yes, but likely only if they&#x27;ve spent an inordinate amount of time learning Emacs and Emacs Lisp. But Visual Studio Code provides a nice balance of a single environment across languages that evolves with users&#x27; needs and basically anyone can be productive in it <i>today</i>.<p>My personal preference is to use the standard IDE with whatever language I am using, and then to default to Visual Studio Code whenever there is no such standard. I also use a fair amount of visual languages that text editors do not work for.')
