More times than I could count the first person would speak and I would think &quot;Wow, this person has a rock solid argument&quot; and then the second person would speak and tear it all down.  I would sit there stunned thinking &quot;I would have been so mis-informed if I had only heard the first person in a vacuum.&quot;<p>When something is still an active topic, it&#x27;s extremely important to have all the sides at the table.')
