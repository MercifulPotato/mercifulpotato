Occasionally they have an ad on the home screen, but it&#x27;s small and not obnoxious (right now there is one for The Hunt on Amazon Prime). They mainly have ads in the app store as they sell content, but I rarely use that.

Compared to an external device it&#x27;s actually better, as you can configure picture settings per app. I have Netflix with a more cinematic settings, where as YouTube is toned down a little and not so bright. I have been thinking of getting a Chromecast so it&#x27;s easier to share content from my PC (the TV supports Miracast but it&#x27;s not great), but that&#x27;s it.')
