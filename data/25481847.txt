I chose to use JavaScript and Node.js as alternative to Java or C#, which are often used in comparable literature. After reading it, one should understand the fundamental concepts, how to apply them and how they can work in code.<p>You can access a free sample of the book on the webpage in different formats.<p>I worked on the book for four years as a side project. In 2016, I had worked in three different projects that applied either some or all of the concepts. The last one was the main motivating factor for the book. It was a startup that was settled on DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing, even though the developers had limited knowledge.<p>Together, we learned, experimented and applied as much as we could. We read &quot;Domain-Driven Design&quot; by Eric Evans, &quot;Implementing Domain-Driven Design&quot; by Vaughn Vernon and whatever we could find from Greg Young. With the knowledge we picked up and the experimentation we did, we felt in a good position. Still, there were many unanswered questions on how to put everything into code.<p>In 2016, before leaving the startup, I first thought about writing a book. Effectively, I wanted to create the guide the startup would have needed in the beginning. When I started, I was overly confident about my knowledge. However, throughout the years, I learned many details. Today, I know that I could not have written it in 2016 at once.<p>The final book is different from what I envisioned it to be at first. My initial goal was to write a short book with approximately 150 pages. The published version has now over 450 pages. However, I consider this a good thing. The book provides enough context to be read without any prior knowledge in DDD, CQRS or Event Sourcing.<p>I&#x27;ve written a blog post that covers my motivation on writing the book in even more detail: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alex-lawrence.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;why-i-wrote-a-book-on-ddd-cqrs-and-event-sourcing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alex-lawrence.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;why-i-wrote-a-book-on-dd...</a><p>I&#x27;d be happy to discuss your thoughts on and experiences with DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing. Regardless whether it is about their combination, their sometimes counterproductive conflation or one of the concepts. Finally, if you have any input or feedback for me, it would be highly appreciated!')
