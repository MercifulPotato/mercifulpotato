I&#x27;ve been using modules in my current project (new codebase) since the start of the year and so far have run into no problems whatsoever when it comes to modules.<p>Mind you, a big plus, I think, is that Go doesn&#x27;t have the ridiculous library ecosystem that others I&#x27;ve worked with (JS&#x2F;Node, Java) have; I only use a handful of libraries at the moment (for REST api, .env file handling, database interaction and logging, and some additional ones for development like mocking, neat diffs for tests, and code generation (xsd &amp; swagger to code).')
