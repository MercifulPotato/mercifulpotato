It&#x27;s mostly the banks right? When you borrow money, they don&#x27;t need to go to the government to create the money for that loan in your account.<p>And this is a mostly a good thing. I know a lot of people think it&#x27;s not, but what it really does is democratise borrowing. Your ability to borrow money is mostly only limited to your own ability to make regular payments.<p>A slight inflation also incentivises people to borrow and invest, so it&#x27;s often good for economic growth.<p>Maybe it won&#x27;t be so good in the future when the population and economy starts to shrink consistently. But I&#x27;m not convinced that cryptocurrencies is the answer there either.')
