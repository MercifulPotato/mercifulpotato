I really can’t believe someone thought it’d be a good idea to make this. I have no confidence that they’re distinguishing between rioters, and media, passerby’s, police, and genuinely non violent people. If you’re someone cheering this on ask yourself how long before it happens at a protest you support, your kids are at, your friends or you. This is a pretty fucked up thing these people made.')
