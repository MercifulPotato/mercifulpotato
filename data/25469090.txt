Yes, you need a lot of knowledge, but the rules and outcomes are still clear.  Compared to writing a novel or painting, it&#x27;s very clear when you&#x27;ve reached success and it&#x27;s hard to argue that you&#x27;ve been successful.<p>IMO the &quot;unkind&quot; work that a typical engineer does is things like writing specs.  The work itself does not give you any feedback about if you&#x27;re making progress or doing a good job.<p>Of course it&#x27;s all on a sliding scale, and if your perf issue takes four weeks to surface after each deploy then that&#x27;s a much less kind environment.  But, in general, anything that you can put clear metrics around is much closer to the &quot;kind&quot; bucket to me because those metrics give you a clear path for improvement and iteration (the major risk is getting stuck in some local maximum).')
