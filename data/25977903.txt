Like pigeons pressing a pleasure lever, they were relentless, until their bodies and brains were overcome, and they died.<p>But Alexander wondered: is this about the drug or might it be related to the setting they were in? To test his hypothesis, he put rats in “rat parks,” where they were among others and free to roam and play, to socialize and to have sex. And they were given the same access to the same two types of drug laced bottles. When inhabiting a “rat park,” they remarkably preferred the plain water. Even when they did imbibe from the drug-filled bottle, they did so intermittently, not obsessively, and never overdosed. A social community beat the power of drugs.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychiatrictimes.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;what-does-rat-park-teach-us-about-addiction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychiatrictimes.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;what-does-rat-park-tea...</a>')
