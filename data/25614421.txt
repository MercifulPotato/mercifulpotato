I looked up his phone number on the internet (this was long before doxxing was a thing), cold-called him, and he picked up the phone.  We talked for about half an hour.  That&#x27;s the kind of guy he was.  I more or less asked him how can a smart guy like you buy into this conspiracy theory?  His answer was: he wasn&#x27;t buying in to the conspiracy theory.  He was not endorsing the idea that HIV did not cause AIDS.  All he believed was that there was not yet enough data to conclusively show that HIV was the cause, and so people should keep an open mind.  And frankly, given what was known at the time, I thought he had a valid point.')
