This is the objective function it is optimised to maximise while it is being trained, how close did the prediction match the actual text which came next.<p>This is done mostly because it&#x27;s very easy to get a huge amount of data and score its performance numerically on that data without any manual process of deciding what the correct answer is. It turns out given enough data and a large enough network, it becomes very good at it, even to human eyes.')
