When reporting a supposedly objective fact, you have at least the benefit of multiple independent points of view over it- something observable happened and multiple people reported on it. When you hear a personal experience, you&#x27;re often hearing an unconfirmed and un-confirmable recount of things that are entirely outside of public verification.')
