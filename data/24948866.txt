It&#x27;s completely out of the scope of the conversation to require me to explain how you are deficient in your understanding of the nuance of what was actually said by the Congresswoman.<p>The conversation of Climate Change, Global Warming, whatever has been going on long before AOC even ran for Congress so I really don&#x27;t see the point you and the original poster I was responding to are actually making by invoking her as some boogie man.<p>Yes sure talking hyperbolic doesn&#x27;t help and can turn people off.  Ok agreed.  Excellent points all aroud.')
