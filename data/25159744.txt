There is very little difference in the quality of teaching. Guess what, when teaching only staff is asked to teach 6 courses in an year, they teach the same as a research prof who spends half their time in research and half their time teaching 3 courses.<p>I think there are many things wrong with academia and with university structures, and teaching quality is one of them. But the problem is not what you think it is. The problem is capitalism, and money-optimizations being the final decision maker rather than quality of teaching or research (which is also much worse than 50 years ago).<p>This is the same reason school education is so mediocre. You overwork school teachers, and don&#x27;t pay them enough. And so even the best can&#x27;t do much good.<p>You need more money from the state to go into education. And yes, full time teaching staff [1] to conduct recitations and office hours would help a lot. Smaller classrooms would help as well.<p>I don&#x27;t agree at all with lecture recordings. As much as you want people in society learning, you also want a lot of people in society learning to teach. The long term intellectual benefits to society where people learn to teach others are enormous. It creates a culture of intellectual inquiry, which is different from attending a pre-recorded lecture or engaging in research or all the other things students&#x2F;faculty at universities do.<p>[1] I have been told in German unis these are people with Masters who are waiting to go for a PhD. But they are essentially kicked out after 2 years because the uni recognizes that long-term full-time teaching staff degrades in quality.')
