In fact, what you are describing is the position known as anti-realism - that quantities that can&#x27;t be measure are not real, a major feature of the Copenhagen interpretation.<p>But in other theories (those termed &quot;realist&quot;), such as Pilot Wave or Superdeterminism, the uncertainty principle is exactly an artifact of measurement. A particle has an exact position, momentum, energy, spin etc, but they can&#x27;t be reliably measured all at once.<p>In the end, these are philosophical positions, outside of our current mathematical and physical tools. Perhaps in time we will be able to settle these questions, but for now there are no definitive answers.')
