With early virtualization support, Linux can be run in a VM.<p>Plus all-day battery life and proper docking support for external peripherals.  This has the least compromises of any device in the last few years. MBA has a good keyboard, smallish bezels, ESC key, TouchID for auth and is relatively affordable with same weight and less cost than iPad Pro + Magic Keyboard.  MBA is now the perfect &quot;thin client&quot; that also works offline.<p>As an example: the usable and powerful iOS video editor LumaFusion is now available on M1 MacOS via app store.  It costs a fraction of traditional video editors and works well. Looking forward to a new class of prosumer apps that can raise the bar for both iOS and MacOS.')
