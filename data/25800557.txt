Ambiguity about goals, or uncertainty in whether one&#x27;s work is even worthwhile is an astonishingly effective destroyer of productivity. Never treat employees on a &quot;need to know&quot; basis, feeding them the bare minimum that you think they need.<p>#2) There is no known method more effective at improving overall product quality than mandatory peer review of all code. Not only does this have the obvious direct benefit, but it also helps cross-train senior staff, bring junior staff up to speed, and helps improve consistency.<p>#3) There is no known method more effective than checklists at improving the quality of manual processes. Sure, if you plan to do something a hundred times, automate it. But you know what is really easy to turn into automation? A checklist. For non-automated processes, a checklist allows junior staff to confidently produce quality. Checklists are a training aid as much as they are a tool for quality improvement.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s a very long tail of things one can do on top of those basics to improve productivity, especially of junior staff. Use an IDE. Use a code linter. Use automatic tests on checkin. Etc, etc... But none of those hold a candle to the above three in terms of raw effectiveness.<p>To put things in perspective: I&#x27;d rather have those three things and <i>no source control</i> than source control and none of those three things. You can meticulously track every version of a piece of garbage and it&#x27;ll still be garbage...')
