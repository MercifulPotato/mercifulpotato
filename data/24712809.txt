First, you get Windows for everything else (if you use the machine for personal stuff, gaming, need Office desktop apps, if you need Photoshop, etc).<p>You get a lot of that on Mac though (well, less so on the gaming front, but Macs have some apps that aren&#x27;t on Windows too). But that&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; Linux, so you don&#x27;t have to spend time installing GNU tooling or fighting with brew.<p>Dual booting can get annoying, because you have to, well, reboot.<p>You don&#x27;t have to worry about hardware. Linux has come a long way, but there&#x27;s still the random peripherical that doesn&#x27;t work, or some where the configuration software is Windows only. It&#x27;s pretty easy to avoid hardware that won&#x27;t work with Linux, but in this world you don&#x27;t even have to worry about that. Especially relevant in the desktop space where you have to look at every component.<p>WSL2 also has some interesting benefits, like being able to install a couple of different distros, or wipe out and start over in a few seconds if you screw things up. It&#x27;s kind of the docker experience without docker.<p>In the corporate world, it also means not having to convince your employer to get a Linux install they&#x27;ll support. The company I work for only allows Windows or Macs. Sure, I&#x27;ve worked at big companies where after some back and forth with IT we could get Linux on the PC machines, but it&#x27;s nice not even have to go through the hoops.<p>There&#x27;s some drawbacks: interop between the WSL2 file system and the Windows one works fantastic, but it&#x27;s FREAKISHLY SLOW. If you&#x27;re trying to git clone a big repo or npm install a big library and you&#x27;re crossing boundaries between the two system, you&#x27;re not going to be happy (as long as you stay within the WSL world you&#x27;re fine though).<p>GUI apps are an issue. It&#x27;s pretty easy to get most apps working using a Windows compatible X Server, but hardware acceleration is an issue. It looks like it might be possible to get working, but I sure as hell haven&#x27;t been able to. The team is working on an official way to run GUI apps without going the X Server forwarding path, but it&#x27;s not there yet. For now it works fine for simple things, like terminals and text editors, but trying to use Google Maps in Firefox is simply not useable (but it does work!).<p>I&#x27;m one of those weird people who actually likes Windows, and for 99% of my development use cases, Windows + WSL2 let&#x27;s me do everything I need with zero compromise, and without having to reboot all the time. I can have a Windows-only game running with my Linux terminal open to do some development while I&#x27;m waiting for a group in my favorite MMO. Docker + WSL2 is great too.')
