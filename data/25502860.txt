Those seemingly mundane details are just more interesting to me. A lot of things are said about the permanence of things we post to the internet. However, I wonder if we actually forget to remember the early decades of the true internet? I&#x27;m not talking about a few random web pages, I&#x27;m talking about recording say 10% swaths of each of the 10%-sequentially least-to-most visited websites by year (or something similar). It&#x27;d be a shame if we did not save anything for future signal archaeologists to analyze.')
