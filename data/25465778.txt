Item(by='matesz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608287589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465716, text='&gt; We inherited a py2.7 codebase, written by one dev. It uses a library written also by that dev. We had absolutely no idea what worked how. Sure, looking at the code gave us a very rough big picture, but adding typing helps with the details.<p>I see how this could be helpful for legacy codebase - add typings, run mypy and see if it breaks. Good point - thanks.<p>How many lines of code that inherited codebase had btw?')
