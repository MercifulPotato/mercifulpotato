Conversely,\nthe deficits in cases who were not put on a ventilator, particularly those who remained at home, was\nunexpected.&quot;<p>This effect on those hospitalized is not the primary thrust of their paper. Instead it was the observed effects on those who were not hospitalized or had mild to no respiratory symptoms. They raise many possibilities about why this may be the case and only assert that this effect at least proceeds into the recovery phase. I did not read any claims about this being permanent, broadly speaking.')
