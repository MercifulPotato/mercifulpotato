Even if the muscle is the limiting link in the lift, if your body isn&#x27;t using it, it won&#x27;t get stronger.  For example, my mid-upper-back was lax because of typical nerd posture.  Even though it limited my squat, years of squatting didn&#x27;t force those muscles to do anything.  I just had a really weak squat that relied on other muscles compensating.  Then one day I ran across a suggestion to do bat wings and hold at the top for 20-30 seconds, and I became close friends with some muscles in my back that I barely knew existed.<p>A web site showing you how to discover each muscle or muscle group in your body (bat wings for deep mid-back, glute bridge for glutes, etc.) would be AMAZING, and I bet people would get referred there all the time from places like r&#x2F;Fitness where people go for advice.')
