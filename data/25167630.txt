The naming makes slightly more sense in that context.<p>* Windows 1&#x2F;2&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;3.1&#x2F;3.11&#x2F;WFW3.11 - 16-bit (with 32-bit extensions as win32s), ran on DOS<p>* Concurrently, NT 3.1, 3.5, and 3.51 were marketed for servers instead of home users. They were fully 32 bit and separate from DOS.<p>* Windows 95&#x2F;97&#x2F;98 started naming after the year. This line eliminated DOS (from the user&#x27;s perspective) and was 32-bit without the need for installing extensions.<p>* Concurrent with Windows 95 was NT4 which had 95&#x27;s new interface based on Cairo<p>* At this point it was clear NT was the future for the desktop, so keeping with the year naming came Windows 2000 (which was really NT 5.0, but desktop users were by now used to year naming). But there was one more release of &quot;old&quot; Windows, as Millennium Edition (ME)<p>* The two names that dont fit are XP and Vista; these are NT 5.1 and 6.0, respectively. And now Windows 7 and 8 make more sense; we are back to the versioning we had starting with NT 3.1<p>* To make things more confusing, the server versions now started getting named after the year when previously that was the desktops. So we&#x27;ve got Windows Server 2000, 2003, 2008, 2011, and so on.<p>* Windows 10 is the oddball, skipping 9. I like to think someone at MS was poking fun at Apple, which skipped OS 9 to go straight to OS X, which two years later got the version 10.0. Mac OS 9 came after OS X but before OS X 10.0.  I recall reading that 8.5 was originally supposed to be end of the line for classic mac os, but I don&#x27;t have a source.  So now there&#x27;s 8.5, X 1.0, 9.0, and X 10.0, and everyone seems to think the X is a 10.')
