For example, travel from Russia to the US is currently allowed, despite Russia having &gt;3 million COVID cases, but travel from Finland (&gt;37,000 COVID cases) and China (&gt;97,000 COVID cases) is prohibited.<p>China is doing great if those numbers can be trusted.<p>But Finland having 80x fewer cases when they have 25x fewer people isn&#x27;t a big enough difference that I would say &quot;much lower levels&quot;.')
