I know exactly what you are referring to. The ui behavior is similar to mobile app, where I implemented kinda “force touch” in order to scroll right within that section. And regular scroll does page Navigation. I admit it’s takes some time to get used to. Regarding top navigation, I’ll need to research on what’s a better ui experience for mobile users.<p>I did experiment with list based home screen, but I thought the information density is low for mobile screens. However for tags and authors it’s list based as you suggested.<p>That being said, I’m planning an update in near future to include public domain audio Books where I can reform Home screen section behavior better for new users.')
