The companies stick them in the license clauses anyhow, because when you can just stick a severability clause [1] in there, why not grab things willy-nilly?<p>Plus a lot of people simply assume there&#x27;s no recourse even when there in fact is (&quot;the US is an anarchist wonderland where consumers have no protections at all&quot; is a harmful and false meme, what we have is the widespread <i>assumption</i> that consumers have no protections), and of those who don&#x27;t, who really wants to spend a ton of time in any sort of legal or arbitration resolution over 40 books, which almost certainly total far less than any possible legal or arbitration battle will cost?<p>The legal system, US, EU, or otherwise, doesn&#x27;t have a good answer to when a company bones .01% of several million people to the tune of several hundred dollars, or bones its entire customer base for $1 or something. By the time you bust through their contract clauses against class action and even find everyone affected you&#x27;ve long since eaten up any value you&#x27;re going to get from the lawsuit even if you win big and win punitive damages. Computers make it so much easier to do this kind of thing on the company&#x27;s side, but they don&#x27;t help anyone trying to fight it anywhere near as much. Very asymmetrical advantage for the companies to hit people like this at some scale.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;s&#x2F;severability.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;s&#x2F;severability.asp</a>')
