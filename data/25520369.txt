Maybe rewrite some parts Go or Rust? Anyway if you use the template system, you&#x27;ll have a much harder time doing this than if you&#x27;re only slinging JSON around.<p>Another advantage is that you get right from the start is having the ability to modify purely display parts of the UI without having to touch the back-end, it doesn&#x27;t sound like much but is incredibly useful when prototyping&#x2F;testing new ideas.<p>For an SSG though, for me that&#x27;s the wrong use case. For that I would use Zola which is incredibly fast and uses a template system that&#x27;s basically a Rust port of Jinja, so a Django developer is right at home.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getzola.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getzola.org&#x2F;</a>')
