Disarmed okay, but for what? Nuking a size of the US or Russia is ending the world, even without nuclear subs or allies striking back.<p>That Russia plays the US right now like a fiddle: hell yes. Disarming the nuclear weapons: not important. It is at best distraction.<p>Actually, I am pretty sure, in that regards they would prefer more stability.
