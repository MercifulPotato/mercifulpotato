Apple&#x27;s hardware is expensive crap compared to other. I can make at least 50% cheaper from parts desktops&#x2F;laptops having the same performance.<p>Quote 2: &quot;...but we were running VMs...but I was the only team member who could build&#x2F;test the iOS builds because I had a Mac.&quot;<p>I call this another BS. My machine is running Windows as host OS. My VMs are Linux(Ubuntu and Mint)&#x2F;Android(both Vm and emulators - Bluestacks an Memu)&#x2F;Raspbian and MacOS (at least 10 MacOS VMs starting with Mountain Lion 12 years ago and copy&#x2F;upgrade a new one every time a new MacOS was released). I can run any flavor I want and do cross-platform build at the same time.<p>Conclusion - you&#x27;re lying.')
