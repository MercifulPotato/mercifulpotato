Item(by='bilbo0s', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606924517, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25277103, text='<i>consequences applies to corrupt officials just like it applies to everybody else</i><p>But consequences may not apply to everyone else. What if local bosses make a law that firearms holders have to turn in their firearms? What if local bosses make a law that blacks have to be slaves? What are the consequences that the local bosses are living with? (Assuming no interference by non local authorities.)<p><i>How are they going to prevent people from leaving? If the only resources they can draw on are local</i><p>Local bosses make law that it&#x27;s illegal for anyone other than his henchmen and women to have firearms. Local bosses also make law that leaving town is illegal. Local bosses also orders searches of homes to confiscate firearms. Finally, local bosses authorize deadly force to deal with law breakers.<p>In this scenario, no outside help is necessary for the local bosses. (I suppose the factory they buy their guns from might be from outside the locality, but that&#x27;s about it.) Heck, the bosses might even have the support of many of the pearl clutching local citizens. Some of whom might even, gasp, sell me out to the local bosses.<p>This example is contrived, but has happened often enough in human history for me to want to know how the local citizens can leave before I would concede to living under such a system. There has never been an example of such a system in modern history where non-local powers were not involved in liberating the local citizenry. So if you can outline a <i>credible</i> method for the unarmed citizenry to exercise the freedom to move away, I&#x27;d certainly be interested in hearing it.')
