So it&#x27;s possible my information is out of date.<p>I gather things are in the process of changing and lots of people will, say, just hook up via an app. But, generally speaking, it is my understanding that it tends to still be the norm that the man typically pays for a date.<p>We do have the term <i>Dutch Treat</i> to mean each person pays their own way. Someone on HN from the Netherlands once described that as evidence of what cheapskates the Dutch are (or something along those lines). Personally, I am inclined to interpret it as related to the fact that the Netherlands has a reputation as having a better than average track record on women&#x27;s rights and are moving away from social norms rooted in men paying for sex and implicitly treating women as nothing but sex objects for purchase.<p>(Edit: I&#x27;m American. Sorry for doing that American thing and acting like &quot;everyone I talk to on the internet is also American.&quot; I&#x27;m really tired today. Oops!)')
