I&#x27;ve been writing CSS for about 15 years at this point, and I still can&#x27;t remember the order of any short hand, I have to look it up every time, so I just type it all out instead. At least then I know what I&#x27;m looking at when I look at the code next time &#x27;round.<p>I&#x27;d rather see something like named parameters, e.g.:<p><pre><code>    margin: top(1rem) left(2rem) right(2rem) bottom(1rem);\n    margin: vertical(1rem) horizontal(2rem);\n    margin: all(1rem);\n</code></pre>\nOr some such â€“ I dunno I&#x27;m no language designer.')
