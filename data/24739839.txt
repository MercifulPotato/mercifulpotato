Employers in low COL areas might lose out to those in high COL areas.<p>&gt; <i>Employees who voluntarily quit or are terminated are free to take any other job paying at least what the sponsor&#x27;s job paid, provided they do so within 3 months.</i><p>3 months is generally not enough time to find a new job, finish immigration transfer formalities.
