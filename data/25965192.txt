Item(by='timr', descendants=None, kids=[25965496], score=None, time=1611971177, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25964272, text='&gt; Today, our state is at 24 days of zero community transmission of covid, managed largely via a small lockdown after a small outbreak from interstate. Before that small outbreak, we were up to 80-ish days of zero community transmission of covid, after a much much larger outbreak which was brought under control by a robust lockdown which began in March and continued into December. Lockdowns work, if people obey them. And weâ€™re proof of that.<p>So let&#x27;s re-phrase: you had one of the longest lockdowns in the world (110 days), spanning the fall, winter and spring...and then it came back in the summer, and you had to do it again. And you&#x27;re in an isolated island nation with almost no international travel.<p>Your story does not encourage me about the feasibility of the strategy you advocate -- it underscores how tenuous the situation actually is.')
