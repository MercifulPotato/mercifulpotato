Item(by='newbie2k', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1612133443, title='Ask HN: How do I develop depth in any technology', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hello all,<p>am new here, i am certified in cloud and databases, have worked extensively on the same, but more like Jack of all and master of none :( which explains the title!  i feel like i always lack in the depth of anything while i can talk 10 mins on any topic under cloud.  How do i develop this? i cant do this in my work, because they do use exceptional tech like k8s or docker, but every Cloud interview i attend ask these in one way or other, like k8s or EKS . I can theoretically speak about how this works or try to convince that am a great learner and they should give a chance believing that.<p>how do you handle such situations be it in interview or anywhere, how did you develop your depth in your field.')
