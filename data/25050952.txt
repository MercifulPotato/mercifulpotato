Wasn&#x27;t at least one crash cause by MCAS activation in the phase of the flight that was not even described in most of MCAS explanations initially (that reflected the decision behind the initial introduction of MCAS, not the later modifications)?<p>Therefore I believe the interpretation that MCAS &quot;just augments&quot; is too simplified from what it really was supposed to do. And the &quot;fixes&quot; could still leave plane as not behaving as it should, neither with MCAS active, nor when it is not active when it was supposed to be.')
