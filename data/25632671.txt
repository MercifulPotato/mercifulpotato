This normally isn&#x27;t anything meaningfully repeatable and is essentially ~~the algorithm~~ arbitrarily deciding it dislikes some certain email, email address, or server. Those emails will eventually get to their recipient but effectively get frozen in time for a bit before getting delivered.<p>For normal person to person emails, this boils down to bad luck and occasional inconvenience however for any heavily templated email (like say an email containing one-time links), this means something on the site&#x27;s side is causing the emails to appear as spam or spam-like to the recipient server. So technically it is the user&#x27;s email server causing the delay but it&#x27;s usually due to something in particular on the site&#x27;s side be it a domain or server configuration or something about the email contents.')
