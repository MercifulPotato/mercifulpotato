Do you know if it&#x27;s better, faster, have you measured it? I haven&#x27;t and MM&#x27;s goal also wasn&#x27;t to be better or faster, IIUC the main drive was user editing content in new ways + painterly style of rendering.<p>And btw. artists absolutely hate modeling with nurbs, splines and anything similar. :) They love sculpting in ZBrush, or editing polys directly (for man-made and city objects). SDFs are +&#x2F;- compatible with it (but come at huge memory and disk space costs - think of it this way, with meshes you encode &quot;surface&quot;, so O(N^2) complexity, with SDFs volume, O(N^3), implicit representations not really...')
