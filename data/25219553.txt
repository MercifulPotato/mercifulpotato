If you find yourself arguing with Git most of the time, I recommend doing this:<p>1. Get a good night&#x27;s sleep and wake up early, pour yourself a nice cup of coffee or your favorite beverage.<p>2. Open a copy of ProGit (free here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;en&#x2F;v2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;en&#x2F;v2</a>) and read it cover to cover, while using something like Learn Git Branching (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learngitbranching.js.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learngitbranching.js.org&#x2F;</a>) to try out what you&#x27;re learning to get a better understanding.<p>3. Take a few walks and do your best to read the book cover to cover in a day.<p>4. Get a good night&#x27;s sleep to cement the information in.<p>Git is not simple, but it&#x27;s very powerful. But I also believe it doesn&#x27;t take much to become an &quot;expert&quot; (if you already know how to edit text files and know basic command line usage + syntax). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a lot to ask to block out a day or two to learn how it really works (at the very least chapter 10 in ProGit, Internals).<p>I see too many engineers arguing against git from a lack of understanding what commands actually do. Like it or not it&#x27;s a corner stone of modern software development, and for some good reasons too.')
