The right thing to do is to take each of the areas where Google is a monopoly and break them out, and prevent the broken up pieces from providing overlapping services (at least for 20&#x2F;30&#x2F;50 years).<p>I would break out at least:<p>Ad network\nWeb search\nOperating systems<p>And put everything else in a separate company. That would contain their other consumer services (gmail, finance, docs), whatever g-suite is called now, cloud services (until they shut down), their internet balloons and what not and maybe Waymo.<p>You can allow the baby-Gs to contract with each other (web search needs an ad network), but require the terms to be public and frand; maybe with some sort of second source requirements.<p>This doesn&#x27;t eliminate any of the monopolies, but it eliminates the use of one monopoly to entrench another.')
