Changes that are not considered consistent with, and furthering the purpose of, Proposition 22 would need voter approval [0]<p>This means if the law passes with a simple majority, any future amendments require 87.5% of the legislature which is basically impossible.<p>This proposition re-writes the democratic process, not just the law.  It manes Uber and Lyft get to decide not only what the law is today but how it evolves forever.<p>That&#x27;s not how democracy should work and we should not pass this prop. If you believe drivers should be contractors, fine, but let&#x27;s not hand over the government over that point.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;California_Proposition_22,_App-Based_Drivers_as_Contractors_and_Labor_Policies_Initiative_(2020)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;California_Proposition_22,_App-Based...</a>')
