I started it to scratch my own itch after spending lots of time on r&#x2F;worldnews but yearning to have a way to chat with other readers in real-time in a more &quot;slack-like&quot; experience.<p>It&#x27;s focused on simplicity, readability, and low-friction. Anyone can view posts&#x2F;conversations simply by going to the url. There&#x27;s also no voting and ranking is by conversation activity etc.<p>It&#x27;s small but have had some great people stop by so far &amp; you&#x27;re welcome to check it out.
