And the cost of living is a fair bit higher in France to boot.<p>Now that companies are cozying up to remote work, I think I’ll jist do more frequent 3 month trips and work in the evenings when I run out of vacation days. Then I can keep my cushy American salary and afford to travel, avoid dealing with VISAs, and France get my cost of living &#x2F; tourism money without me taking a Frenchman’s job. Seems like a better arrangement all around.')
