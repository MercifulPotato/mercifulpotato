Often you just need a few servers, a load balancer, a database, some file storage, internal networking, user permissions, and some level of security&#x2F;firewall. That is very easy to set up on AWS in a day or two, and you don&#x27;t need all your engineers to simultaneously be devops experts.<p>The scale can happen once you&#x27;ve validated your startup, and when that happens it&#x27;s a lot easier to just turn on 30 more EC2 instances than to get on the phone with Dell.')
