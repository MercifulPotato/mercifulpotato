That&#x27;s why x86 won, despite &quot;more efficient&quot; machines (Itanium, SPARC, DEC Alpha, PowerPC, etc. etc.) being developed.<p>One of the few architectures to beat x86 in price&#x2F;performance was ARM, because ARM aimed at even smaller and cheaper devices than even x86&#x27;s ambitions. Ultimately, ARM &quot;out-x86&#x27;d&quot; the original x86 business strategy.<p>-------------<p>GPUs managed to commoditize themselves thanks to the video game market. Most computers have a GPU in them today, if only for video games (iPhone, Snapdragon, normal PCs, and yes, game consoles). That&#x27;s an opportunity for GPU-coders, as well as supercomputers who want a &quot;2nd architecture&quot; more suited for a 2nd set of compute problems.<p>-----<p>FPGAs will probably never win in price &#x2F; performance (unless some &quot;commodity purpose&quot; is discovered. I find that highly unlikely). Where FPGAs win is absolute performance, or performance&#x2F;watt, in some hypothetical tasks that CPUs or GPUs don&#x27;t do very well. (Ex: BTC Mining, or Deep Learning Systolic Arrays, or... whatever is invented later)<p>Computers are so cheap, that even a $10,000 FPGA may save more electricity than an equivalent GPU, over the 3 year lifespan of their usage. Electricity costs of data-centers are pretty huge.<p>The ultimate winner is of course, ASICs, a dedicated circuit for whatever you&#x27;re trying to do. (Ex: Deep Blue&#x27;s chess ASIC. Or Alexa&#x27;s ASIC to interpret voice commands). But FPGAs serve as a stepping stone between CPUs and ASICs.<p>------<p>If you have a problem that&#x27;s already served by a commodity processor, then absolutely use a standard computer! FPGAs are for people who have non-standard problems: weird data-movement, or compute so DENSE that all those cache-layers in the CPU (or GPU) just gets in the way.')
