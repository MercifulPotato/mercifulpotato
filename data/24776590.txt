Overly overt, unnecessary, &quot;tell me don&#x27;t show me&quot; themes about how women are strong or whatever. Or a villain whose primary purpose is to make you think of Trump.<p>That space force comedy with Steve Carell comes to mind<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a political agenda. I think a sizeable portion of people just like seeing this stuff that affirms their beliefs or gives them an example to point to. Conservative leaning stuff does it too, and it&#x27;s even more annoying when you disagree with its themes. I recall Logan Lucky (movie) was an especially aggravating example of this on the conservative side.')
