You can only loan out your share of stock once,  but the person who buys the stock can lend it out again.<p>So let&#x27;s imagine there is one share of a stock and person A owns it... they lend it to person B, who sells it to person C, who lends it to person D who sells it to person E....<p>Now, person E is the only person who currently holds an actual &#x27;share&#x27;, and is the only person who can lend it out. Person A and C will have an IOU saying they will be given back their share at date x... they can sell the IOU, since it has the same value as a share, but they can&#x27;t lend out an IOU.')
