If that&#x27;s proposed as a goal for CBDCs, they won&#x27;t happen (at least not without far more significant reform of regulations and incentives surrounding lending)<p>In theory, CBDCs could be just a back end representation of the existing financial system for more efficient settlement though, which would be a different technical tool to achieve the Fed&#x27;s current goal')
