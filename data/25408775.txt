Item(by='brandmeyer', descendants=None, kids=[25410604], score=None, time=1607883974, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25406211, text='Chinese also has an interesting sentence structure that doesn&#x27;t quite fit with European languages.  In addition to subject.verb(object) form, there is also a kind of topic-comment form that might be reasonable to use in some assertion-like contexts.<p><pre><code>    ensure(foo), !empty()\n    require(bar), open()\n</code></pre>\nChinese also has a word that can transform some kinds of statements into a question.  `ma` is used to form yes-no questions.  Imagine if languages with truthy values required you to use an explicit keyword&#x2F;character in postfix position to take a non-boolean value and use it in boolean context.<p><pre><code>    if predicate:\n        pass\n\n    if non_predicate ma:\n        pass\n\n</code></pre>\nTo be clear, I&#x27;m not actually advocating for such constructs.  The topic-comment form breaks down as soon as you want a predicate on multiple objects.  The automatic truthy values concept is already falling out of favor in preference for explicit predicates like file_handle.is_open().  I don&#x27;t actually want to program in &quot;Cobol, but Chinese&quot;.  But it is interesting to explore the space.')
