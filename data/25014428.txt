Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604747422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25014048, text='For PKIX (and thus in your web browser) leaf certificates the X.509 Common Name is only permitted to be textually equivalent to one of the SANs (Subject Alternative Names, the Internet&#x27;s way to write a name for a machine) in the certificate. So that&#x27;s either a dnsName or an ipAddress. This is grandfathered in because it&#x27;s how Netscape worked last century before PKIX was standardised and thus before SANs existed to do this properly.<p>So it would be prohibited to issue leaf certificates with a CN that&#x27;s a human meaningful name like &quot;Google&quot; or &quot;Hacker News&quot; because that violates PKIX.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter anyway, the only enforcement that really matters for HTTPS is the mechanical enforcement by the user agent, because there are way too many HTTPS transactions for the human to realistically assess the certificate shown for each transaction and decide if it&#x27;s OK.')
