Item(by='c22', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607313011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25321126, text='Personally I am not worried that flat-earthers will turn all of us, so I am not uncomfortable, but I agree that such a regression would be quite unpalatable.<p>Rather, I believe that the majority of people will continue to understand the earth as &quot;round&quot; and will be more likely to believe the (also minority) science pedants when they say &quot;actually, it&#x27;s more slightly egg-shaped&quot; than they will the ravings of someone who does not believe in satellites.<p>The beautiful trick of decentralization is not that it has any ability to prevent wrong-information from being disseminated, but that it ensures that correct-information <i>will be</i> disseminated regardless of any co-existing propaganda campaign to the contrary. In a centralized <i>censorable</i> system this guarantee cannot be met.<p>I believe that as long as correct-information is available the majority of humans will eventually find consensus with it.<p>I am not convinced that fringe ideas like flat-earthism are necessarily growing or that they would be doing so <i>because of the web</i>. It is likely that the web is just exposing, for the first time, the true extant of the population that is willing to accept fringe theories which while I agree is a disconcertingly large percentage, still does not seem to be the majority of people.<p>That said, roughly half the people I talk to still seem to fully accept and believe in some sort of literal sky god and roughly a third still seem to take in earnest the existence of actual ghosts, luck, karma, or other such poorly supported meta-think as obvious truths. But I believe this number is way way down from 50 years ago, 100 years ago, 1000 years ago... I believe more people are finding consensus with actual truth due in large part to the awesome power of decentralized messaging systems we&#x27;ve built to date starting with language and so far culminating at the internet and the nascent social and technical overlays that are being built on-top of it.')
