To support them, we simply need to stop cutting trees and plants. We should plant public fruit trees everywhere possible, instead of concrete ground. We should support permacultures instead of mono-cultures (they impoverish the ground, plowing or burnings are just earthworms massacres) and other kind of farming. Yet, the recent emergence of vertical vegetable farms seems interesting.<p>just as personal note: I kinda stopped eating honey, mostly because it&#x27;s good but it&#x27;s highly concentrated goodness, and as I tend to eat one thing at a time, I could end up eating too much. Eating fruits, leafy vegs is more natural for me, mostly raw, you hit satiety more naturally and get plenty fibers.')
