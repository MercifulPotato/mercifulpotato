To simplify digital nomad life I tried to use one laptop for work and personal tasks. And it becomes tricky. Different employers require to install some proprietary software for communication, work, and security audit. I don&#x27;t like to do that on a personal laptop. Some proprietary software running as root is a bad idea. On another side, it is not so convenient to travel with a lot of hardware. I tried virtual machines, but they are slow and drain the battery quickly. I tried docker but without systemd support, it doesn&#x27;t allow us to run a lot of software. Then I discovered LXD, wrote helper scripts, and configured profiles to pass X.org, Pulse Audio, Video devices, etc. It solved the issue, but it is not so user-friendly as it should be. I like the QubesOS approach and UX, but I don&#x27;t use it because the same reasons VM doesn&#x27;t work for me.<p>What do you think about domain-based applications environments Linux distribution with UX similar to QubesOS but based on LXD? For instance, I need the following isolated domains: &quot;work&quot; with Ubuntu 20.04, &quot;personal&quot; with Archlinux, &quot;secops&quot; with KaliLinux for another employer, &quot;media&quot; with Ubuntu Studio. And my host OS just list applications inside domains in applications menu. For me it looks like Firefox Containers (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;multi-account-containers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;multi-account...</a>) but for the applications.')
