JPEG2000 is mainly a lossy format, comparing its rarely used lossless mode to other lossless formats is pointless.<p>While JPEG2000 doesn&#x27;t catch on, it&#x27;s still used moderately in some fields, particularly medical imaging and some other scientific imagings. And the use of wavelet-transform based algorithms in compression is adopted in lots of other formats too.')
