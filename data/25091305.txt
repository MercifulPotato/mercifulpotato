(Of course, then streaming music arrived and was a whole other can of worms.)</i><p>The apogee on the Music DRM side was in 2005 when Sony released a music CD that actually installed a rootkit on your PC[0].<p>As it turns out, &quot;Don&#x27;t buy music from Sony, it will put a virus on your computer&quot; was a pretty effective way to hit Sony&#x27;s public image and pocketbook.<p>After that, it was no longer hyperbole to describe DRM as malware, and it was apparent that the logical endpoint detractors were pointing to was not, in fact, dismissable as a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>.<p>It was downhill for DRM from there. In 2008, Microsoft shut down their PlaysForSure servers[1], rendering protected media purchases useless,  demonstrating that you couldn&#x27;t rely on DRM systems to continue to work, even if the DRM vendor was the richest and most entrenched software company in the world.<p>One year after that, iTunes went DRM-free, which was the final nail in the coffin. At least for music DRM.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sony_BMG_copy_protection_roo...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Microsoft_PlaysForSure" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Microsoft_PlaysForSure</a>')
