It&#x27;s been a labor of love, and sometimes frustration, and it&#x27;s really encouraging to see people using it and giving great feedback. It has a long way to go but I&#x27;m hopeful to realize the vision of a new alternative for open discussion.<p>I also wanted to share the first post I made on Sqwok, dedicated to my late friend Thom Simmons. The reason I want to share this is because you never know who you&#x27;ll meet and what impact they&#x27;ll have. I met Thom when I was learning python and hanging out in #django on freenode a decade ago. We went on to become good friends and he helped me learn how to program beyond html, while we constantly plotted what our next project would be. He introduced me to Reddit around ~2009 which at the time wasn&#x27;t nearly as popular or known outside of tech. I had just thought of the idea for Sqwok about two weeks before his passing, but opted not to mention it on one of our last calls because he was going through some personal struggles.<p>I know he would have been excited for it.<p>In this crazy year of 2020, I hope more people can find positive connections, however that may be, and that we learn from each other, grow, prosper, and thrive.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqwok.im&#x2F;p&#x2F;TsuqjEqi3OwXiA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqwok.im&#x2F;p&#x2F;TsuqjEqi3OwXiA</a><p>I&#x27;m very grateful, thank you.')
