People like Trump don&#x27;t need doctored satellite photographs and elaborately constructed propaganda that the press will fall for - they can use social media platforms as a very public podium from which to spew lies. And, perhaps because of the viral nature of social media, and perhaps because of the inherent terseness of Twitter, people are bombarded by these tiny nuggests of &quot;truth&quot; from &quot;trusted&quot; people who &quot;obviously&quot; wouldn&#x27;t lie, and the become &quot;truth&quot; for those people.<p>I think the key difference now is that it&#x27;s never been so easy to put out &quot;news&quot;, and it&#x27;s never been so easy to consume so very many sources of &quot;news&quot;, or so frequently.')
