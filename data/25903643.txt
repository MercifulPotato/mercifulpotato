The Earth orbits the Sun, humans evolved from ape-like ancestors, etc. These were once debatable topics but now the issue has been settled and debate is pointless.<p>* Some arguments do not really have two sides because in reality there are multiple viewpoints. Global warming is not real because how can we know if it is, global warming is a deliberate hoax, global warming is real but not that bad, global warming is real and bad but not man made, global warming is real and bad and we can do something about it. How does your site help with this kind of topic?<p>* Trolls. The design of your site encourages trollish behavior. I am not sure how you plan to moderate harmful or offensive content but if you think that people will step up to shout down offensive topics you are very wrong. The sensible people will just leave and you will be left with only the trolls.<p>* Moderation. If you site gets any sort of traction you will need moderation. Moderation of topics, moderation of comments, outright banning users. Put simply, you are going to have to take sides defeating the whole &quot;both sides&quot; approach you are trying to foster. At the moment, one of the front page topics is how the Holocaust could be used for population control - a real nice way to introduce your site.<p>Good luck, but I will not be joining.')
