DHS gets this information.  It is determined the individual &quot;exposed others to Coronavirus&quot;.  A &quot;common sense&quot; remedy is applied like, say, prohibiting the individual from boarding airplanes.<p>Individual is now on a possibly secret &quot;no fly list&quot; with terrorist connotations.<p>Macro:<p>Minority groups are skeptical of the government because of historic abuse.  They tend to take fewer tests.  Majority groups trust the government because of being treated well historically.  They tend to take more tests.<p>More cases are found in majority groups per capita because they took more tests per capita.  Data shows more cases in majority areas.  More resources are sent to majority areas.  Minority areas are neglected and do not receive the resources they need.  This perpetuates the experience of mistreatment and discourages future cooperation.<p>The chilling effect is real, and concern is reasonable on the part of individuals.  Who wants to defend a group of bioterrorists anyway?')
