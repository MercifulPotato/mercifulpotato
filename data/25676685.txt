If I gave you a link to ocdtrekkietube.com&#x2F;s8fsj2 (not a real link), and it worked as well as YouTube, I&#x27;m not sure any user would be particularly upset about it.<p>The biggest reason YouTube is as powerful as it is is that video hosting is expensive and few companies can eat that kind of bandwidth and storage without being an ad giant.')
