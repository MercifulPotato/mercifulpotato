It&#x27;s only a small step from that to saying that someone can upgrade an old car with a new engine and sell them.<p>From a government perspective, as long as these cars are niche, they probably don&#x27;t mind so much.  I can go and buy a 1955 Morris Minor fairly easily and it won&#x27;t have seatbelts, but the assumption is that I would be aware the car doesnt meet modern safety standards.')
