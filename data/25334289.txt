WFH might not stick widely, and some firms will pick a hybrid model (i.e. partial WFH) over going fully remote.<p>Not to mention that few places can match all the benefits of SV, i.e. unenforceable non-competes, fantastic weather and surroundings, an educated and diverse population, cultural activities, very high compensation, etc. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be as easy to displace SV as these articles regularly imply, despite the downsides of living here.')
