This kicks off many hours of phone tag between my family, the insurance, and the doctor.  Eventually the insurance company will pay up, but usually well after we&#x27;ve already paid out-of-pocket for the first month, which then requires another few hours on the phone to get reimbursed.<p>This isn&#x27;t a single insurance provider.  This has spanned decades, 4 employers, 5 insurance companies, and at least 3 medical providers.')
