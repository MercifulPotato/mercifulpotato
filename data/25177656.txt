I think we could have guessed this is the ultimate stage of IIT JEE rat race that&#x27;s getting more and more aggressive over some years.<p>While I don&#x27;t subscribe to all ideologies of socialism, I can only think of free high-quality education by government as a solution to this aggressive game-the-system and FOMO mentality so deep rooted here.<p>For context I studied in Rural Governement schools till 10th and even after that I didn&#x27;t have to pay 20% of what an average Urban &quot;Middle class&quot; peer pays for education. The education quality is not much different. Only when I had to study engineering I came across stupid expensive not-worth-the-cost education.')
