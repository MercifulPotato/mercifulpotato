Happy to spitball this with you.<p>(Un-)fortunately, we started in a place where we already had plaintext-ish documentation (we never started with PDFs), so we were converting text to PDFs, not the other way around.<p>People edit the files in markdown and &quot;publish&quot; them in pdfs.<p>Generally, we do comments in a combination of google docs views of the PDFs (not-preferred, because they die with the document version) and our code review system (preferred, because they live forever, but unfortunately exclusive to engineers).<p>I actually don&#x27;t know to what extent pandoc supports the conversion of existing PDFs with comments to markdown, but that sounds like a really hard problem!<p>The way I&#x27;d move from your situation to mine, is to say &quot;no more comments in pdfs&quot;, convert the manuals to plaintext at once, make a comment-less PR of the plaintext manual to the repo, and then hack the comments in as comments on the PR, in a way that depends on your code revision tool.<p>This might be very hard depending on your CR tool.\nLet me know if you have any more specific questions, though, I&#x27;m happy to help.<p>I&#x27;ll also add contact info to my profile. :)')
