I feel like Airbnb hasn’t been proactive enough is addressing the negative issues at all.<p>For ex I’ve personally not heard anything much from Airbnb w.r.t impact on local real estate markets eg higher prices or low rental inventory. I’ve only heard them actively deny that they put pressure on real estate prices.<p>And they’ve only recently invested more in safety and attempting to ban house parties after the shooting in Oakland last year when that has been a problem for years.')
