Low-alcohol or non-alcoholic cocktails are still going strong, though they&#x27;ve been eclipsed by ads for a very particular kind of faux-athletic shoe (pretty sure they&#x27;re <i>exactly</i> the same shoe even though it&#x27;s a dozen companies). I have to admit, after a while I sometimes do get a bit curious. The frequency itself makes some part of my brain think this must be A Thing, and that I must pursue The Thing, even though my rational brain knows it&#x27;s entirely otherwise. It&#x27;s a powerful effect. Whether intentionally or not, I think Facebook&#x27;s ad-selection algorithms create these &quot;category waves&quot; even across multiple products and vendors because they do work. Therefore it&#x27;s not surprising that such a wave related to the most controllable of minds is the biggest of all.')
