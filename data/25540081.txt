It used to be the only product at the company, now it&#x27;s just the oldest.<p>I also think there&#x27;s a disconnect between how new algorithms are evaluated and real world results. Reverse image search is total trash now. Mostly returns annotations &quot;red, dress, girl&quot; instead of the pages where I can find the image.<p>Unless it&#x27;s a brand name product, then it&#x27;s exact matches.<p>So you&#x27;re getting less than excellence in engineering, plus influence from shopping and ad dollar focused PMs and not much care is actually given to the search experience.<p>And it shows')
