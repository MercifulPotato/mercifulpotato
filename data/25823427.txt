I am actually into the machines at the moment, so a lot of it is spooled up, reasonably fresh.<p>The blink implementation will work when video does.  Pretty much independent of CPU state.  That whole circuit works on phase 2 of the 6502 bus clock and is basically transparent to the CPU.<p>That kind of thing normally takes wait cycles, or multi port RAM.<p>Bonus points:  Doubles as RAM refresh.<p>The only impact is a slightly longer cycle every 63 (I think) cycles to make the video line up with the clock to allow for the artifact color hack to work consistently.<p>To the CPU, there are no waits and it runs at full speed.  In physical time, that long cycle takes a bit longer than the other ones which can complicate things like bit banging audio, if not done on a long cycle multiple.')
