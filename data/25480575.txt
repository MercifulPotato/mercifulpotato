I agree with the retraction. It was required, but it&#x27;s really more of a follow-on than a retraction. An apology to Canadian police would moreso than a retraction. That&#x27;s a no-fault too though, in my estimation.  They had to keep quiet while investigating, and temporarily absorb criticism. That&#x27;s a hazard of the job though.<p>I see nothing wrong with this tweet, never mind &quot;career-ending.&quot;<p><i>&quot;1. Big news out of Canada: Abu Huzayfah has been arrested on a terrorist “hoax” charge. The narrative tension of our podcast “Caliphate” is the question of whether his account is true. In Chapter 6 we explain the conflicting strands of his story, and what we can and can’t confirm&quot;</i><p>Shades of uncertainty. This is honest journalism. Whether or not she felt overconfident in any given detail or narrative, the we got to hear the account, suspicions, reasons to dismiss or believe the source (chaudhry). I don&#x27;t think anyone reasonably concludes that his account is mostly honest or accurate, just that it may <i>contain</i> truth. He literally gets outed and confronted about being a liar.<p>I am not a journalist. I can tell from that podcast that there are reasons for the strong reaction that look different from a journalistic perspective and a layman&#x27;s one. I think the difference (to me) is frame.<p>If in episode 3, she totally believes his account and by episode 6 she&#x27;s dubious... that&#x27;s the nature of doing investigative journalism as a temporal series.')
