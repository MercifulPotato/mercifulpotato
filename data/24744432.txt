Pipes are usually below the frost line, so pretty much the same temperature year round.<p>You’re right that if your meter is in the sun and it gets warm that probably warms the gas somewhat.  How much, I’d be curious to know.<p>And I also have no idea if gas companies adjust for it at all.  I assume not since most meters are pretty basic.')
