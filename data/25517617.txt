And no. Kanban does not count. Is the monopoly of stuff like Clio and others so much that noone is attempting open source alternatives? Cliniccases which has seen no development in years seems to be only one.<p>When you can have accounting packages and ERP software for million dollar orgs running on Foss software like erpnext, akaunting? Its not like lawyers are a niche market in the world.<p>The interesting thing is, I can find dozens of &quot;dental practice&quot; software and packages on sourceforge and github but none about lawyers.<p>Dont open source advocates&#x2F;lawyers need open source tools?  Anyone from the EFF legal team here? What do you guys use in house ?<p>Edit: I would be glad to assist in development by giving time and inputs.')
