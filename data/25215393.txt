Some of them simply disappeared after we locked their accounts (temporarily, with explanations), but many of them would launch aggressive harassment campaigns at the company. They&#x27;d start with support, then attempt to escalate support tickets, then move on to trying to contact management via LinkedIn or guessing e-mail addresses. A surprising number of people would find creative ways to contact our CEO with carefully honed  stories claiming innocence. We started removing employee&#x27;s last names from customer communications after someone started doxxing support employees and arguing with their family members on Facebook.<p>Those who had social media clout were virtually guaranteed to use it against us. The stories they published were always distortions of the truth with convenient omissions.<p>The worst part was that after watching this play out 50 times, everyone starts to grow unsympathetic to any complaints. It&#x27;s a challenge to maintain some empathy and perform diligence on complaints, otherwise you get legitimate errors slipping through the cracks.')
