Deciding to have children after spending a weekend together (&quot;it felt like a date&quot;) is foolish, and a recipe for a disaster, in my opinion.<p>The article (and overall, the idea) is also dangerously ambiguous about the logistics:<p>- the decision to have a child with someone [...] in most cases, choose not to live with<p>In real world, this equates to parents choosing other partners in the mid&#x2F;long term.<p>This is therefore radically different than an arranged marriage.<p>I&#x27;d define this as an arranged patchwork family. Whether this is better or not than an arranged marriage (in an extended sense, e.g. two people staying together only because of the children), it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to say.')
