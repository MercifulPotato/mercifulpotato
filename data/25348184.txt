You are assuming these don&#x27;t offer a better experience than Sennheisers et al. and that the only reason they are more expensive is &quot;because Apple&quot;. Maybe true, but also hard to justify contextually given Apple just released the best bang-for-your-buck laptop on the market.<p>2. The audio market is pretty competitive. If Sennheisers up their prices without improving anything, someone else (with equivalent quality) will come along at Sennheiser&#x27;s old price point.
