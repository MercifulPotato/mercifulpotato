It might be easier on the eyes, sure, but to really understand how the first one works, you&#x27;d have to look into all the defined helper functions, and see which outer-scope variables they touch (global&#x2F;module&#x2F;class scope), and also, probably, have some knowledge of where x is called. In a style closer to the second example, there are less outside dependencies.<p>Of course, this is all very abstract. I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t cases where a few variables in global (or class) scope that get mutated by bare functions can&#x27;t work at all, but as a rule I don&#x27;t consider it a good style.')
