Item(by='gknoy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607039350, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25296953, text='Based on the prices at a local theater, $20&#x2F;viewing is about par for one ticket + snacks, and $30 is generally better than two people + snacks:<p><pre><code>  n=1: $13+food\n  n=2: $26+food\n  n=4 (2 kids): $46 + food\n</code></pre>\nWhen you factor in being able to have cheaper food, not to mention intermissions whenever you want (bathroom break, making popcorn, etc), I feel like streaming is still better than theater, price-wise, even at $30&#x2F;movie.<p>Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t _feel_ that way. We still haven&#x27;t seen Mulan yet, though, and I&#x27;m not sure if price is a factor in that. I suspect it&#x27;s a small factor -- we subscribed to Disney+ to see Hamilton, for example -- but it just hasn&#x27;t come up in months. I forgot about it until writing this comment.<p>It&#x27;s hard to convince myself that I should pay $20 or $30 for a screening, when a year from now I can likely rent it on Prime for $10 or less.')
