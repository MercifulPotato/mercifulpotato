I thought the new app wasn&#x27;t accessible like that, so how was this database generated?<p>&quot;In early April, the Ontario government passed an emergency order that allowed police to obtain the names, addresses and dates of birth of Ontarians who had tested positive for COVID-19. The portal was aimed at helping to protect first responders.&quot;<p>Ah, it&#x27;s not any sort of database off the App, just a regular old violation of our health privacy rights like any other day.')
