I get the motivation for including this, and I understand Emacs&#x27;s roots. But IMO this mindset â€” the one that motivated including this disclaimer - is also why efforts to &quot;modernize&quot; will pay an extra tax, possibly preventing its success.<p>Emacs has a prioritization rubric that places freedom above mainstream utility. That&#x27;s perfectly fine, but it inherently limits 1) its audience size, and subsequently 2) its contributor pool and 3) financial upside - either direct or indirect (used to support the project).<p>This means it will always lag behind the projects that are setting the bar for what &quot;modern&quot; means.')
