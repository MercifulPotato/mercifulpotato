Item(by='bumby', descendants=None, kids=[25256995], score=None, time=1606755577, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25255453, text='Your point is well taken on future returns and how starting the compound interest cycle is a major contributor to success.<p>&gt;<i>that has never happened</i><p>This is the part that I disagree with. Talk with anyone who planned on retiring around 2008-ish. As a hypothetical, if the market is the proxy measure they lost around 5-8 years of retirement because they had to have &quot;more time in the market&quot; to re-coup losses. If they actually retired and were drawing down their money, it&#x27;s even worse. Granted, the hypothetical is biased because someone of retirement age shouldn&#x27;t have that much market exposure, but the point still stands that, while true at the population level, waiting for the market to recover doesn&#x27;t always work out well at the individual level. I tend to think the people who tout long-term averages of market returns tend to ignore the long periods of sideways or downward movement that may align with an individual&#x27;s specific circumstances.')
