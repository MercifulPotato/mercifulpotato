Item(by='api', descendants=None, kids=[25835566], score=None, time=1611073057, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834485, text='&gt; From the point of view of the FOSS world, the issue here is not a problem; creators having an exclusive ability to monetize software as a service isn&#x27;t a purpose open source is intended to serve; in fact, avoiding the lock-in that results from such exclusivity is a big part of the point.<p>If the creators get nothing, then why bother? Why slave away to make software just to give free labor to billion dollar companies while you get nothing? Is free labor for Amazon what open source is about?<p>If open source refuses to adapt to the realities of today&#x27;s software ecosystem, it will die out... or at least &quot;serious&quot; open source projects will die out and all that will remain is hobbyist level stuff, abandonware, and half-done academic projects.<p>Personally I do think FOSS in its present form is going to die <i>for most major projects</i>. You&#x27;ll still see FOSS libraries, building blocks, academic projects, and some major projects that really are large and old enough to have enough real grassroots contributors to keep them going. For major projects in the future you&#x27;re going to have something more like a shareware model but with source-available.<p>Nobody creating a new large-scale project today is going to give it a license that they know will result in somebody else productizing it, making a fortune, and giving them nothing. At least Amazon acknowledges where things came from... in some cases the productizers even rename the project and don&#x27;t even give the author <i>credit</i>.<p>FOSS and its gift culture ethos just isn&#x27;t working in today&#x27;s world. The software market of today is a dark forest.')
