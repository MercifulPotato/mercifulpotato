Sometimes mpv randomly stops working on a machine, or gets undermined by codec support (OpenSUSE, I&#x27;m looking at you). So when that happens... I just open my media in VLC. Because VLC works everywhere, on every system (oh, that reminds me that it&#x27;s the best Android media player), on every format.')
