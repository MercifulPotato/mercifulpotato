Could be painting, coding, dancing, chess, languages, music, karate... anything that they enjoy doing that involves being an active participant in the process. Because by the time they are in their late teens &#x2F; early 20s, they&#x27;ll have thousands of hours of practice under their belt and opportunities available to them by dint of that mastery.<p>I don&#x27;t regret my childhood largely because it&#x27;s immutable, but when I reflect upon it I would&#x27;ve preferred to have spent a lot less time playing video games.')
