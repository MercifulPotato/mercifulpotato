It&#x27;s pretty deterministic where additional calls are inserted by the compiler, and you can use --expandArc or look at the generated C.<p>As a single anecdote -- I&#x27;ve studied Rust before and it&#x27;s been a while. Pretty familiar with C++ move semantics stuff. I decided to read the Rust book again while also learning Nim simultaneously; and I had an entt wrapper and graphics rendering in Nim without GC before I finished getting through the borrow checking chapter in the Rust book.')
