Most of the &quot;funny comments&quot; are tired, derivative, old, or predictable riffs on things we&#x27;ve seen far too often.  Some of us have been around a long time, and when we see things like this we just sigh.  It&#x27;s tedious.<p>Your comment (2) above, for example, just really isn&#x27;t funny.  It&#x27;s common, unoriginal, uninformative, unhelpful, and just ... not funny.')
