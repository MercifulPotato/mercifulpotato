Item(by='josteink', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603662265, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889488, text='&gt; I understand that firmware malware is a legitimate cause for concern, UEFI seems to me to have been more about locking Linux out of the laptop market to insure that Microsoft Windows remained dominant.<p>Ignorant nonsense.<p>UEFI, while overengineered, allows for a computer-OS to tell the firmware how to cleanly boot it, so you can have several OSes installed in parallel without anyone stepping on anyone else’s toes.<p>Basically it simply and cleanly solves the dreaded and always unreliable dual&#x2F;multi-boot situation which almost exclusively Linux users have had to endure, with Windows update accidentally overwriting their bootloader every now and then.<p>But who complains about UEFI and the solutions it brings and clings to legacy BIOS boot with all its warts and complications? Yup. Linux-users who are so politically opposed to UEFI that they cannot bother looking into the actual technology to see if their political opposition is warranted at all. Talk about FUD, eh.<p>It’s a sad sight. And I say that as a happy (UEFI booting) 100% Linux desktop-user.')
