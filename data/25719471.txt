Someone can acknowledge that companies have the right to run itself however it wants but disagree with this particular decision. It is possibly incoherent to argue that Twitter <i>may</i> ban people but Visa <i>may not</i> ban anyone; it is perfectly coherent to argue that Twitter <i>should</i> ban certain people and Visa <i>should not</i> ban these particular businesses.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a contradiction even to say that Visa <i>may not</i> ban anyone. Running a website is a form of speech. Every website absolutely must be moderated beyond what is required to remove spam or what is required by law. Telling them what kind of community they are allowed to run is an excessive infringement on their freedom of speech. This is similar to why I support net neutrality but fervently oppose any sort of mandatory neutrality on websites. It would take a tortured argument to claim that routing packets is a form of speech (particularly when these packets are encrypted), while running a website always requires taking an editorial role.<p>No one would find it strange if a book store decided not to carry a particular book. People would find it very strange if their credit card company refused to process a payment for a particular book.<p>I neither support nor oppose banning payments to Pornhub since I don&#x27;t know much about the website. I have no skin flicks in the game.')
