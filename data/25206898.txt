All technical analysis.<p>Only stocks. Pure technical analysis. Main items we focus on are price-action and price-volume. In essence, for every minute the price goes up, what&#x27;s the volume? For every penny the stock goes up, what&#x27;s the volume? For every 100,000 shares what&#x27;s the change in price?200k? 300k? 1m? and so on. Also, weighted factors for all the different indicators, MA&#x2F;SMA&#x2F;CCI&#x2F;RSI&#x2F;VWAP being of most pertinence. Pitch fork trends weighted at a lower level. Also several other proprietary indicators based on stock correlation (i.e. BABA vs AMZN, if AMZN is moving down, BABA should as well because of what it relies on).<p>I have been getting killed the last month but still up over 100%. Just hit on GS (100%+), and likely will on TSLA. Also did 1500% on TSLA this year on a trade which was my biggest so that helps.<p>TSLA seems ready for a similar move to when I made my last huge run.')
