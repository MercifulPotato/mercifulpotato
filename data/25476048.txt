The difference is only in the level where the discussion is set.<p>Having said that, personally I&#x27;ve seen a tight correlation between those who criticize about design patterns and those who criticizd software architecture.<p>In fact, the higher the abstraction, the higher the criticism. It seems the furthest the subject is from the critic&#x27;s comprehension and experience, the more their criticize.')
