Lots of people get to wanted status simply because they knew the right folks or were lucky.<p>It isn&#x27;t so much originality or that there wasn&#x27;t a supply of art. There <i>is</i> a supply of art. Good, well done art that will meet your needs and slews of folks that will do commissions if you do. If anything, there is more art than there is demand, even if you are into non-mainstream stuff. If it were different, art school would be an excellent choice for your financial future.<p>As another reply said, there is a lot of money laundering in the art world as well. I imagine there are some questionable tax dodges in it too.')
