I don&#x27;t think we are in disagreement, just mostly in different interpretations. You are talking about a car, with likely 200-300 embedded systems backed into it.<p>If the light sensor or the braking module goes into a completely unexpected state where it can no longer be communicated with, it has corruption, etc, you <i>need</i> to do something about it.<p>The solution isn&#x27;t to reboot the car, it&#x27;s to reboot the individual module and quickly get it back into working order. Rebooting the braking or lighting module should take on the order of milliseconds (if done correctly), and that is much, much better than having a piece of software in a corrupted state for seconds&#x2F;minutes&#x2F;hours.<p>In a car, there is a mothership board that is orchestrating everything, pinging every module, and ensuring everything is in working order. Just like a kubernetes setup, if any one piece fails to ping or looks off, just reboot it and get it working ASAP.')
