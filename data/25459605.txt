Item(by='devwastaken', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608234872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25454831, text='&quot;There is no greater evil than a movie pirate, who steals food from the mouths of hardworking film crew members and their children, in order to avoid paying the fifteen bucks or whatever it is now to see a movie during its theatrical run, or waiting a bit to pay an even smaller amount to see it on DVD or streaming. Therefore, you can&#x27;t give a pirate an inch of quarter, lest they consign the entire glorious film industry to the dustbin of history.&quot;<p>There are far greater evils.<p>1. You have to define who you mean as pirates. People at home recording on VCR a TV show are not in fact stealing food from anyone, you have no proof of this because the underlying factors for why this kind of piracy happens results in there being little to no loss of revenue.<p>2. The overwhelming majority of pirates do not have access to the digital product because they cannot pay for it. Therefore there is little to no loss in revenue.<p>3. Equating digital goods to physical good theft is an outright lie. Digital goods are infinitely copyable without cost.<p>4. Anti-piracy is a business not because it works but because film makers want to believe it does. It&#x27;s snake oil that those who don&#x27;t understand the digital world continually fall into.<p>5. &quot;Anti-piracy&quot; is an act used to suppress Fair Use of content so people cannot transform it. Especially for criticism.<p>6. Actual commercial pirates should be prosecuted. But if you lump all kinds of pirates together then you don&#x27;t have the legal resources to target the actual harm.<p>7. Piracy is not as evil as you want to cast it. Piracy only looks evil if you&#x27;re creating products people can&#x27;t pay for. If people are overwhelmingly pirating your content even when it&#x27;s affordable, accessible and good then your product isn&#x27;t actually affordable, accessible, nor good.<p>8. People pay for quality. As you can see time and again movies originally on VCR have been resold on DVD and blue ray dozens over. Many people have both VCR recordings and retail DVD&#x27;s. That goes against the spirit of what you&#x27;re saying.')
