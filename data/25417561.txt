Watching them land was incredible as they appear to move incredibly slowly and touch down very gently. They&#x27;re also amongst the noisiest aircraft I&#x27;ve ever been around.<p>One of the commanding officers organised a camp photo infront of one of the U2s - we were shuttled outside a hangar with this enormous plane behind us. We were told we were strictly not allowed on the other side of the aircraft that they had &quot;sanitised&quot; for us as not to reveal any state secrets, somehow.<p>I still have that photo, it&#x27;s a great one, but it&#x27;s also technically OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE and we&#x27;re not allowed to show it to anyone. Our &quot;official&quot; camp photo was infront of the Red Arrows, which would have been cool enough - but our secret photo was cooler.')
