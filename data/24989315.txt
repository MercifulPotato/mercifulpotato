Germany has a public-private mix, Netherlands has a purely private universal healthcare system, Switzerland has a purely private universal healthcare system, Australia has a public-private mix (44% choose private), Singapore has universal catastrophic coverage but everything else is driven by savings accounts and private insurance among the upper-middle class, etc etc â€” Belgium, South Korea (technically &quot;single payer&quot; but only covers 60% of costs, private insurance fills in the gaps), Japan, etc.<p>Even &quot;Medicare&quot; in the US, is a public-private mix: roughly 37% of Medicare beneficiaries are on a private health insurance plan (Medicare Advantage), and we expect that number to reach 50% by 2025.')
