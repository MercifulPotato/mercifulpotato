Can you help me understand? I don&#x27;t think any of the things I mentioned were set up or advanced by developers to kneecap effective policies, but I&#x27;d love to learn more!<p>If anything, I would naively expect most of the relevant policies here to be things property developers would be quite strongly against. Perhaps you can enlighten me with critical factors I&#x27;ve overlooked?')
