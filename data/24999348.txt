Then stack depths are bounded of course, and also it is not Turing complete anymore.<p>My understanding is that Turing machines assume infinite memory -- could you help me understand how this differs? I&#x27;m guessing that I&#x27;m not understanding your point, but if &quot;finite memory&quot; is a disqualifier then Turing machines aren&#x27;t Turing-complete.')
