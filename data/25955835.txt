I suggest you read about chaos theory, statistics, probability, quantum mechanics etc. Something which is random is by definition unpredictable, so, no, you can&#x27;t predict whatever through randomness. Even if you picked a pattern from a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) and somehow you successfully predicted something using that pattern it wouldn&#x27;t mean anything insightful or deep, it&#x27;d mean you were <i>very</i> <i>VERY</i> lucky.<p>In sum, we as beings were shaped by the forces of evolution and that made us biased on all sorts of dimensions (visual, cognition, etc). Our perception of reality is completely different from that of another creature, for example. Humans are not &quot;perfect.&quot; (Whatever that means.)<p>There&#x27;s also a fine line between <i>what seems to be</i> correlated patterns and schizophrenia. Pareidolia phenomenon among others also come to mind.<p>Please read about those subjects - I assure you there&#x27;s a lot of interesting stuff about them and there&#x27;s equally a lot of gaps about it as well - but that doesn&#x27;t mean that &quot;occult&quot; or &quot;magick&quot; or whatever is real. It just means not enough resources were spent trying to understand these phenomena. Because most of the time these things do not return something useful to people at large and science is - in principle - meant to benefit humans in general.')
