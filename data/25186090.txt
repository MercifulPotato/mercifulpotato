How is what I said wrong and misleading? Most people aren&#x27;t going to associate an email address with an account because like other users here we&#x27;ve seen the mods consistently biased in how they enforce their policies. Why not just notify them when they login, or disable the reply feature altogether instead of wasting their time thinking they are posting?<p>You also use the word troll but I&#x27;ve seen people get shadowbanned that weren&#x27;t trolls, but people in the thread simply didn&#x27;t like their comments because they were advocating for open source solutions or for sharing negative criticism about a company based on their real-life experiences.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are legitimate cases to ban users, but shadow-banning is just poor ethics. Just ban people if you don&#x27;t want users that may go against the typical pro-corporate yes man type agenda rather than mislead and say that they are trolls, when apparently (based on my experience) your definition of troll is someone who doesn&#x27;t go along with the topics general opinion even if they have legitimate reasons not to.')
