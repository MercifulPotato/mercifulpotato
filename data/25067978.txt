There&#x27;s not anywhere near as much well-priced second-hand hardware available outside of the USA, either.<p>I refreshed mine recently, and I went for an ASRock DeskMini H310 (not <i>much</i> bigger than NUC sized, but takes a full desktop processor), an i7 9700, 64GB of RAM, 2x 2TB SATA SSDs and a 1TB NVMe SSD. Runs Linux + KVM&#x2F;qemu, is near silent, and overall works very very well - for a total cost of about Â£1200 incl VAT.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced it makes me directly more productive - really it&#x27;s a hobby. But it&#x27;s very useful for educational purposes - it teaches a <i>lot</i> of skills which are helpful professionally - especially if you work in smaller businesses and not FAANG.')
