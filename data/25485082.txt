In my understanding, you&#x27;re effectively &quot;republishing&quot; abstracts, possibly altering or remixing them too. Presumably the site isn&#x27;t a commercial concern yet, so there&#x27;s probably little issue.  If the site starts to generate revenue, even if it&#x27;s just to cover costs, or if it becomes a registered business, does this change the copyright situation for you?<p>I see that you&#x27;re using several sources of open data, so perhaps all the data you&#x27;re using is free from copyright, or has highly permissive copyright e.g. CC0.<p>For those wondering about open-access, in my understanding that&#x27;s about _reading_ papers. Putting papers on a website might make the website provider subject to copyright. This applies even to abstracts.<p>As a minimum, it might be necessary to have a button on your site, weishuhn, to report any paper that has restrictive copyright. You&#x27;ve already noted one example of misclassification, and I know that Crossref and other sources provide their data with a big caveat that it might have inaccuracies. Responsibility cascades to you, unfortunately.<p>This inevitably leads to a trade-off between completeness of your data vs usefulness of your service. It&#x27;s a problem I&#x27;m wrestling with too!<p>None of this is criticism, just thoughts from someone working in a similar area. As others have said, it&#x27;s always good to see innovation like this in literature searching. Good work!')
