So I posted it here to see get see if I get some feedback.<p>I am specifically curious about<p>1. is it clear what the page does and why it&#x27;s useful?\n2. does anyone else think it&#x27;s useful?\n3. any suggestions to make things better?<p>The backstory is that I wanted &quot;noscript&quot; on Safari&#x2F;iOS as I&#x27;ve found a lot of sites is simply nicer to visit without javascript. No popups, no GDPR consent screens, no ads etc.<p>The option of globally disabling javascript on Safari is not really realistic, so I was for some time thinking about solutions using content blockers, but never got that working.<p>Then I happened upon the sandbox feature of iframe&#x27;s and decided to see if I could make it work. This is the result.<p>It&#x27;s a hack and often breaks, but sometimes it&#x27;s nice to be able to share a fast-loading version of some website which loads way too much javascript for little benefit.')
