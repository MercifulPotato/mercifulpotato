Yes philosophers gave us the ability to talk about facts rationally and to consider facts as facts in the first place. It is easy to dismiss the labor of countless lives of philosophers who worked their whole life on problems that you now by the privilege of your modernity can consider trivial. Yes, now that the work has been done and distributed by art and education and has become part of the common sense, now its easy to dismiss and replace it with your own ignorant impromptu kind of philosophy.<p>Philosophy isn&#x27;t what you think of topdown or bottom up, but Enlightenment was much more of a bottom up process where individuals prosecuted their whole lives have made efforts that benefits us all to this day. Philosophy is above all an insistence on seeking the truth for its own sake, which today is desperately lacking in every pore of our society, software not excluded.')
