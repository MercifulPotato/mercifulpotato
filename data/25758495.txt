Including DDOS protection in that is to ensure that you can&#x27;t be taken offline even if every hosting provider in the world hates your guts and you have to self-host (as might be the case for a lot of the people and organizations being banned these days). And I&#x27;m not an expert on DDOS mitigation, so it might be that you don&#x27;t have to require even them to serve everyone.<p>I was pointing out the irony that net neutrality was repealed under this same administration.<p>I am yet to be convinced that &quot;neutrality&quot; or a requirement to provide service regardless of content should be enforced by any government regulation above the network layer.<p>Companies IRL have the right to discriminate against their customers based on their speech. If I walk into your bar and start insulting other patrons it&#x27;s totally legal for you to kick me out. And in fact if you fail to do that, your other patrons might leave and never come back.<p>I don&#x27;t see why that shouldn&#x27;t extend online. Except at the network layer. Because if you don&#x27;t have that, you can&#x27;t have <i>any</i> speech online. Which is also unjust.<p>I think this is self-consistent. Feel free to tell me if there are any holes in it.')
