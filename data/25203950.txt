GM, at least, isn&#x27;t falling behind like Ford seems to want to.<p>There are RV hookups somewhere in most random woods a few hundred km from any town in the US. Many of them are already 220V (&quot;dryer plugs&quot;, good for a &quot;Level 2&quot; charge) and all you would need is a plug adapter to charge from any one of them. Everyone thinking of chargers like gas pumps is underestimating how many &quot;chargers&quot; currently exist in the wild. The auto industry hasn&#x27;t helped matters by over-engineering (&quot;for safety!&quot;) their plugs so much, making it seem a lot less like a plug is just a plug is just a plug (just like the early 1900s used to make and everyone has on almost all their walls).<p>I think when a changeover occurs, there&#x27;s going to be a huge re-evaluation of the parts of the electric grid we&#x27;ve already built. I don&#x27;t know if that means that RV plugs everywhere will need to be &quot;upgraded&quot; to credit card reading &quot;proper chargers&quot; or if we&#x27;ll see a growing industry of &quot;dumb plug adapters&quot; from the dumb fancy EV &quot;charger&quot; plugs to more classic situations like dryer plugs. There&#x27;s already a lot more plugs in the world than gas stations.<p>(Also the Volt has a very tiny battery compared to what is being released today. The equation is very different when you factor in current EV ranges rather than trying to extrapolate from your current Volt&#x27;s range.)')
