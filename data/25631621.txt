Item(by='ocdtrekkie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609770048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25631197, text='&gt; I suspect that there are many at Google that would happily join a union, just look at how high the attendance of Google&#x27;s walk outs have been.<p>You&#x27;re assuming a lot here. The Google Walkout had a huge attendance because it had zero teeth and zero commitment. People took their lunch break outside to say &quot;I don&#x27;t like sexual harassment&quot;. Then they went back to their desks and back to work. Google refused all but one of their demands, fired or drove out all of the organizers, and went on with it&#x27;s day.<p>Essentially, very few people who walked out would put their cushy Google job on the line for what they believe in. The organizers did, they&#x27;re gone. A handful of other people since then have also put their jobs on the line for their principals, they&#x27;ve also now been fired. Every time Google has fired organizers, it has made it much harder for the remaining workers to organize, both because the people who would organize are gone, and those left have a cautionary tale of what happens if they do.<p>Everyone at Google today is someone who had a chance to stand up for what&#x27;s right in a manner that risks their employment, and has chosen not to do so.')
