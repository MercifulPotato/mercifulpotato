Cars are incredibly dangerous, even with all of the safety that goes into them. People don&#x27;t treat them with the respect they deserve or demand.<p>Edit: I was specifically referring to how the danger of everyday things are under estimated by people. That people e.g. text while driving a 1Â½ ton vehicle at 55+ mph is a great example of that. The danger isn&#x27;t high enough to be &quot;common&quot; but definitely higher than people estimate it to be.')
