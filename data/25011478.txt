It is a policy to prevent conflict in places with low levels of societal trust and high levels of political polarization, it has spread to a location where social trust is healthier, and in doing so has exposed in a strange symbolic way the consequences of low societal trust.<p>Do I even need to say it? 2020 has laid bare this trust is very uneven in its distribution.\nI think that different levels of societal trust has had a large impact on the progression of the covid pandemic in different parts of different anglophone countries. I&#x27;m singling out anglophone countries, because I believe the levels of individual freedoms we enjoy mean that despite official mandates, our compliance with preventative measures was essentially an individual choice that reflected our faith in our fellow citizens, and the sincerity (though I would not go so far as to say competence) of our governments.<p>In Australia remembrance of past wars has been politicized, but I can still see a person wearing a poppy and see it as a sincere act. It hasn&#x27;t yet become a symbol of partisan affiliation.<p>We still describe our preference for a political party with a layer of indirection as:\n  I vote for X, \nrather than \n  I am X<p>I hope this lasts.<p>EDIT: &#x2F;u&#x2F;reaperducer reads the article - pops conjecture bubble')
