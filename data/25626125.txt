Item(by='mschuster91', descendants=None, kids=[25627405, 25628511, 25627134, 25626705], score=None, time=1609715003, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25625160, text='&gt; Both are propped up - actually maintained - by huge and vastly expensive brand management strategies.<p>In the case of Coca Cola, I agree - in the case of Apple, <i>not at all</i>. &quot;Keyboardgate&quot; aside, their products are vastly superior to the competition in build quality and life time. A typical Windows laptop is unusable after two, three years (almost all are made from plastic which breaks or looks extremely ugly rather sooner than later), and has next to no resale value while in contrast even old cheesegrater Mac Pro&#x27;s fetch many hundreds of dollars today. iPhones are supplied with firmware updates <i>far</i> longer than most Android phones outside the flagship Pixel line are. OS X is, while it has gotten locked down a fair bit over the last years, still way better than Windows as it doesn&#x27;t do tracking bullshit and start menu ads and decently better than Linux because no matter which device, stuff usually Just Works (tm) without having to fiddle for hours to get something as basic as a Bluetooth headset working.<p>Apple built themselves a loyal following with pure quality superiority over the competition, unlike HP or Dell who are only surviving because of enterprises who follow the &quot;no one got fired for buying IBM&quot; line.<p>And that doesn&#x27;t even touch that it&#x27;s <i>Apple</i> who&#x27;s at the forefront of innovation. iPods, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watch, AirPods, now the M1 CPU - these entire <i>device classes</i> were created by Apple. When was the last time you heard about something truly innovative from the Windows&#x2F;MS&#x2F;Google side of IT? Only thing I can remember is the Google Glass.<p>What Apple is doing is not a &quot;brand management strategy&quot; per se - it is <i>delivering actual value and innovation</i> instead of rent-seeking. And for what it&#x27;s worth Tesla are doing the same thing.')
