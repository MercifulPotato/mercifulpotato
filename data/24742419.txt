This pipeline is extremely sub-optimal, but it&#x27;s what most people probably do.<p>All because nobody has really provided off the shelf usable deployment libraries. That Bazel stuff if you want to use the C++ API? Big nope. Way too cumbersome. You&#x27;re trying to move from Python to C++ and they want you to install ... Java? WTF?<p>Also, some of the best neural net research out there has you run &quot;.&#x2F;run_inference.sh&quot; or some other abomination of a Jupyter notebook instead of an installable, deployable library. To their credit, good neural net engineers aren&#x27;t expected to be good software engineers, but I&#x27;m just pointing out that there&#x27;s a big gap between good neural nets and deployable neural nets.')
