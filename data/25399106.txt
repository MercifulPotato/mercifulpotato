It&#x27;s not censorship in the slightest...they don&#x27;t stop him from making an ass of himself. They combat the free speech lies with some free speech of their own: the truth.<p>That being said, I wish this sort of Twitter treatment extended to people that aren&#x27;t the president, who enjoys some sort of special exemption from the normal ToS.')
