First of all, the US does have a public healthcare system, Medicare and Medicaid. Second of all, there exists other developed nations with fantastic healthcare systems that are driven by purely private systems: namely Switzerland (widely regarded to be one of the best healthcare systems on the planet) and the Netherlands. Even more perfectly fine developed nations operate on public&#x2F;private mixes, including Germany and Belgium.<p>&gt; it also has the highest healthcare costs of any nation on earth. Coincidence?<p>In this case, it is indeed a coincidence. In order to attribute &quot;privateness&quot; to the high cost, you have to show a causal relationship.
