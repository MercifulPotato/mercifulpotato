The cosmic microwave radiation background, for comparison, was emitted at a redshift of about 1100. So a redshift of 11 only covers 1 percent of the expansion of the universe since the CMBR was emitted.<p><i>&gt; we&#x27;ve seen 97% of the universe&#x27;s history</i><p>No, we haven&#x27;t. See above.<p><i>&gt; Including the microwave background in that pushes the number to 99.997%.</i><p>No, it doesn&#x27;t, because even though we can see the CMBR, we can&#x27;t see anything useful in <i>between</i> its redshift and the redshift of 11--not because there&#x27;s nothing there, but because what&#x27;s there is too distorted and faint to see. (The only reason we can see the CMBR is that it&#x27;s black body radiation at a temperature we can independently predict from our knowledge of the physics of recombination, so we can tailor extremely sensitive instruments to looking for its precise signature.) So there is a <i>lot</i> of universe that we haven&#x27;t seen.')
