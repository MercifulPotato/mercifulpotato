I remember years ago the radio was generated as you went and you could up- and down vote songs as you listened, slowly tuning said radio to your personal liking. Nowadays any electronic music radio just turns into a generic EDM playlist in my experience, even if I stared with something fairly niche.<p>That and the fact that their queue after years and years still sucks compared to competitors made me move in recently. It feels like Spotify has declined over recent years. I still miss their addons as well.')
