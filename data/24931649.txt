I wish you luck!) is it’s wrong. Governments and populations can and should walk and chew gum at the same time. Trump appointing a competent NASA administrator who just put a competent woman in charge of  crewed space flight and who is also deftly bringing on international partners and trying to show progress with the  Artemis program so the next administration does not change course and waste resources does not mean we can’t and shouldn’t address climate change or any other problems on earth. Hell the tech we put up in space is critical to the science of climate change.<p>In any case the ship is going with or without the US government given the resources being poured into commercial space flight and the progress made the last ten years.')
