I am not being snarky -- all the things you say sounds like something I would have said until I pulled myself together and learned how to use it properly. And granted, that did take a bit of effort but now my perspective is that Docker is extraordinarily easy to work with.<p>A Dockerfile is almost exactly like your requirements.txt file, only it works for everything. Need Imagemagick installed on your server? Just add it to the Dockerfile. Need to run a pre-start tool that was written in Ruby? A line or two in the Dockerfile can add that. And if it turns out that you don&#x27;t want it after all, you just remove the lines and feel confident that no trace is left behind.')
