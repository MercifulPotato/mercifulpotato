Even if the entire operating system is vetted and locked down, and only vetted and audited apps are run on the system, there will always be zero day exploits.  Science has come up with no possible way to provably secure network connected computers.  So do not trust them any more.\nPlease prove me wrong, but I doubt you can.  The most trusted computers in the world have repeatedly been hacked.  And even if you could make a secure computer, people can not be trusted because there is always some way to compromise them.  Maybe the best we&#x27;ll ever be able to do is assume a system will eventually be compromised and concentrate on minimizing damage and fast recovery.  Removing the incentive to compromise computers could be a solution, but that seems even less likely given our million year history.')
