Thanks for posting. It really resonated with me, since I’m going through a similar period of self-reflection, and searching for the true meaning of life and what makes me happy.\nFor the longest time, I have been telling myself why my job is good, but that “not right” feeling has never gone away.<p>Since I’ve been remote due to COVID, my life has been remarkably better. I don’t work any less (perhaps more), but I am much happier. It is far more compatible with my lifestyle. I love being at home with my wife and my pets, I love being able to cook all my own food. Like the author, my physical and mental health have both improved; at the start of the pandemic, I could barely hang from a bar, and now I can do multiple pull-ups in a row. Same with squats, bench and everything else. I was never able to build a workout routine, but now I have. And I haven’t eaten any fast food or low quality food in this time, is all been homemade from scratch, and way more delicious and nutritious.<p>I feel the same about my company and my team, I really have made friends there and have built a great career, but they have made it very clear that remote work is not an option going forward. This is just not compatible with the way I want to live.<p>If you’re reading this and are in need of a technically skilled, motivated, hardworking individual with many years of experience, have an interesting project to work on, and support remote work, please reach out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lukep.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lukep.dev</a> for more info on me. I am experienced at building teams, delivering products, and leading others, and am looking for a management level role.<p>Again, thanks so much for the post. It’s difficult to articulate this feeling when things just change for you and there’s no going back, but I feel you and I know that you’re making the right move. Best of luck at CISCO!')
