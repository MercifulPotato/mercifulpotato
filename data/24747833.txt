I say this because there&#x27;s a backwoods road on my commute which I cannot avoid and which gets skinnier and skinnier as the storms add up. It reaches a point where two lanes become something closer to one and a half, and where I suspect a difference in vehicle height is occasionally the only thing preventing side-view mirrors from clipping. Drivers remain unfazed, or at the very least they do not slow down.')
