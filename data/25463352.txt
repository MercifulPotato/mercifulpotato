This reduces total disk I&#x2F;O and improves File&#x2F;Save performance, enhancing the user experience.<p>How would this work without breaking the conventional &quot;Save&quot; paradigm? Unless the app tracks all incremental changes to apply when the user clicks &quot;Save&quot; instead of dumping it all back to disk, which seems difficult and error-prone to implement.')
