You sort of inherently act differently if you were bought up rich. Its hard to describe exactly but you tend to be more (blindly) self-confident and just behave a bit differently compared if you were brought up in a lower class family. Having worked in banking I&#x27;ve seen this myself (although anecdotal experience always tends to be biased in itself). Some of the more brilliant entry recruits&#x2F;interns but from low income families just tend to have trouble fitting in and sometimes end up not getting a return offer. It&#x27;s unfair and kind of sucks but I don&#x27;t really see a solution for it either.')
