Item(by='nine_k', descendants=None, kids=[24775039, 24764444], score=None, time=1602572842, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24762675, text='Mining an asteroid far away and then spend fuel to shuttle material from it to GEO or Moon seems rather uneconomical.<p>I would suggest finding a small enough (a few dozen kilotons) space rock made of a valuable &#x2F; precious metal, and brought to it a large solar array and an ion gun. Metals make good ion gun fuel. Slowing the asteroid down to fall to an elliptic orbit around Earth, and then righting the orbit to put it on GEO or drop it to.the Moon seems doable with a rather limited use of mass. Technology permitting, a large enough solar sail could help slow down &#x2F; steer the rock on its way towards Earth (or Moon, or Mars).')
