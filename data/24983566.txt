I don&#x27;t know how much lower is dramatically lower, but I think it might be orders of magnitude.<p>Maybe for what you want to see on the shoes you could use an even lower dose than the new dental x-rays. I mean, these old shoe store x-rays were trying to make the image directly visible to human eyes with a fluoroscope or something, right? Isn&#x27;t that going to be orders of magnitude more radiation than modern sensors that aren&#x27;t using the energy from the x-ray radiation to actually render the image?')
