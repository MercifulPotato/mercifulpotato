This was the reason Nixon had to take the dollar off the gold standard and make deals with Saudia Arabia and OPEC to ensure oil was priced in dollars, otherwise many countries would have used other currencies for their trade. Since then we have been importing consumer goods, first from Japan and more recently China, to the detriment of American workers. The rest of the worlds growing share of GDP needs more and more dollars, and we can&#x27;t satisfy that demand without continuing to debase our currency and causing problems at home. More and more countries are making deals outside the dollar system, countries that are too big for us to blow up easily.<p>This is what ended the British pound as the worlds reserve currency, and the Dutch gilder before that. Their share of world GDP shrunk rendering their position untenable.<p>I can&#x27;t do this topic justice, but I thought this was a really good write-up, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lynalden.com&#x2F;fraying-petrodollar-system&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lynalden.com&#x2F;fraying-petrodollar-system&#x2F;</a>')
