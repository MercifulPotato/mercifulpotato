The plugins I use are CPU heavy and you can run limited number of them on a single core. I am not interested in low latency - I am running 1024 buffer, however I would like my projects to play smoothly even if there is latency. Ableton unfortunately does not work well with such use case as it won&#x27;t parallelise where it could and sandboxing does just that and I can run more plugins, even if it seems less efficient.')
