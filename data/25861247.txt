Item(by='bluGill', descendants=None, kids=[25863104], score=None, time=1611249040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25860696, text='As Adam Smith observed, excess money tends to go into rent. The poor in India sleep on a sidewalk. The poor in the US have a 2 bedroom apartment with running water and a TV. Both sets struggle to make ends meet (I struggle to make ends meet sometimes, and I&#x27;m clearly well above average in the upper middle class with 6 months of emergency savings that I dare not touch), so struggle to make ends meet is NOT what it means to be poor.<p>Everybody will try to make their lives better. Anyone who isn&#x27;t careful will end up spending so much on little things that they can&#x27;t afford the basics at the end of the month. I&#x27;ve been poor (for the US - a much higher standard than poor elsewhere!), and I have no desire to go back.<p>I will agree the poor who cannot take care of themselves are a minority. However I maintain that given money to the rest won&#x27;t help because they will spend it on things like a nicer apartment.  Worse I fear that their attempt to get a nicer apartment will make rent go up and in the end they spend more money on the same apartment - thus making that extra money an indirect handout to the rich.')
