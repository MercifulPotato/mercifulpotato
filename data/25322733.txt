At least in EU consumer has lots of rights and is pretty well protected. I have no idea how that is in Switzerland (though what you report surprises me). That said, legal action in Europe... good luck. :)<p>If this happens to you a lot, go for a credit card. &quot;Chargeback&quot; works worldwide (afaik) and it puts you in the position of power, where merchant has to prove that you are in the wrong instead of the other way around. Simple solution and no real drawback.<p>EDIT: ...and change your CC company. They seem incompetent.')
