I&#x27;ve learned a LOT about myself just in the past couple years by reading up on additional ADHD symptoms that aren&#x27;t just school-related (since the diagnoses really just focuses on how my disability impacts others, like teachers and parents). I have a 10mg Ritalin prescription that I was supposed to take twice a day in grade school, one in the morning and another at lunch. I&#x27;ve found that it lasts for about 5 hours. Recently, I started cutting them in half and only taking 5mg whenever I need to do work. Not sure if that sounds bad, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with any of my symptoms when I&#x27;m not doing work I&#x27;m not passionate about (most homework). The point is, you don&#x27;t have to always be on meds once you get them, and you can get a low enough dose to have control over it instead of being on it all day every day. Also, just like the other comments on here, I don&#x27;t lose my hyperfocus at all when I&#x27;m on meds. It just helps me stay &quot;on a roll&quot; instead of wandering off to do other stuff or getting super spaced out. 10&#x2F;10 would recommend getting diagnosed. Anything you can do to deepen your self understanding is going to be beneficial in the long run. I know I&#x27;m only 21, but please trust me on that last part, if nothing else. Best of luck:)')
