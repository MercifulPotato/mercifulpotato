The whole 10nm thing is a fiasco at this point. Who could&#x27;ve pictured 10 years ago that Intel would&#x27;ve even considered outsourcing their fabrication? Intel&#x27;s core strength was their seemingly unassailable lead in chip design and fabrication.<p>From various articles over the years it seems that what&#x27;s happened to Intel internally is fairly typical: internal fiefdoms, empire-building, turf wars and the like. This is something you have to actively prevent from happening.<p>This is going to take someone with deep experience in fab engineering to figure out, not a bean counter. And it should probably involve a massive house cleaning of middle management.<p>And no the answer isn&#x27;t just another reorg. Unless you actively prevent it reorgs become a semi-constant thing. Every 3-6 months you&#x27;ll be told how some VP in your management chain you&#x27;ve never heard of let alone or met now reports to some other VP you&#x27;ve never heard of or met. There&#x27;ll be announcements about how the new structure is streamlined and better fits some new reality. And 6 months later you&#x27;ll go through the same thing.<p>This is a way of essentially dodging responsibility. Nothing is in place long enough for anyone to be accountable for anything working or not working.')
