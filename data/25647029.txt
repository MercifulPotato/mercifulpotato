No one wants to take responsibility.<p>The FDA&#x27;s job is not to decide which lives are more valuable than others, or what our society&#x27;s risk tolerance is. Their job is to keep people safe and to present the data and the options to political leaders.<p>The FDA clearly has a goal of not tarnishing their reputation. If they make the wrong decision here, then they lose credibility with approvals for future drugs that come out to treat Alzheimer&#x27;s or diabetes or whatever else.<p>Ultimately, I think we look to our scientists to make many decisions that aren&#x27;t really their place to decide. A scientist can tell me that vaccine X is this effective based on their data. Or even that they have a hunch that treatment X will do Y. But ultimately, I think it&#x27;s on our elected leaders&#x27; shoulders to hear the scientists out about what the various risks are and then make a decision. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have faith that our current elected leaders can adequately listen to our scientists counsel and then make wise decisions accordingly.')
