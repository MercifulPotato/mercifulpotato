Item(by='hansvm', descendants=None, kids=[25799269, 25798721], score=None, time=1610757940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25797950, text='I know a lot of people don&#x27;t like overloading in general because they&#x27;ve been bitten by people abusing it, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s where Zig is coming from. Rather, the project places a high value on being able to understand a snippet of code in isolation, particularly the performance implications of that snippet.<p>Especially in math-heavy domains I don&#x27;t think anyone is arguing that &quot;vec1.mul(vec2.plus(vec3))&quot; is cleaner code in the abstract (and I know I&#x27;ve personally written pre-processors _entirely_ to avoid having to write that kind of garbage when doing math-heavy code in an environment unfriendly to such syntax), but the function calls make it crystal clear that something non-trivial is happening under the hood.<p>Do I want to to give up operator overloading in Python? Absolutely not, and to be frank I wish that portion of the language were even more dynamic. Do I care about Zig not having operator overloading? Not in the slightest. It sits at a different point in the language design space, and I&#x27;m super excited about it.')
