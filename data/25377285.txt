You need to build something great to have a chance of winning, but building something great is not a guarantee that you will win. I realize that goes for most business ventures, but I think it is more true for mobile games than most.<p>What captures the imagination of an audience is in large part a guessing game and a matter of luck. You can look at past successes as a demonstration of that. Flappy Bird was a hit for a bit but it wasn&#x27;t exactly clear what was so different about it than so many before. Angry Birds started an insane franchise, but I&#x27;m not sure if the same game were launched today whether it would capture the same share of the market. It is just really really ephemeral.<p>But making games is fun, like really fun! I had more fun in those years than I have at any other point in my career. We were banging out a game a month and having a blast doing it. This was very early so we knew there was audience enough for each of those to pay the bills, but I wouldn&#x27;t count on that these days.<p>So all of that to say, do it! But don&#x27;t expect to pay the bills doing it. Maybe you will, maybe you won&#x27;t, but it is very much either rags or riches with very little predictability on where you arrive.')
