Line employees are hired all the time in new companies, regardless of the wreckage they wrought at their previous employer(s). No need to wait 6-12 months even. The only thing missing is a big payout on leaving but that is more a function of c-level managers having good leverage and negotiation skills than a result of their competence or lack thereof.')
