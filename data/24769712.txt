Does any other package manager allow such a thing?  I know Arch&#x27;s pacman has no autoremove - you have to gather a list of unneeded packages then remove them as a separate step.  And Gentoo&#x27;s emerge builds a dependency tree rooted in the @world package set, so if kde-plasma&#x2F;plasma-meta is there it will never be removed by an automatic depclean.')
