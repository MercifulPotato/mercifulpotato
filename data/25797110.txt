It didn&#x27;t have any pretense to realism but it really worked well as a non-game about just being a tiny speck in a galaxy much, much larger than you can really begin to comprehend.<p>Every update added more &quot;gameplay&quot; and made the player feel more important. And I guess that&#x27;s more of what people want. But there was a magic to the pre-patch NMS that it&#x27;s lost, and it&#x27;s pretty much what that quote describes.')
