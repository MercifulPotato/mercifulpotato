We started tracking time spent to get the results of these simulations. Most of our engineers&#x27; time was spent finding the right models, setting them up, and configuring these simulations. They didn&#x27;t have much time left to do modeling and testing work.<p>At first we just created some &quot;Bill Of Models&quot; to define systems and simulations. Slowly we&#x27;ve expanded the scope. Each BOM contains a system definition, components, subcomponents, interfaces, and some metadata. There&#x27;s pointers to different repositories, parameter databases, and scripts to configure runtime environments. We have a small tool that reads BOMs and instantiates them as full simulations.<p>When someone wants to test a new system variant, they can usually just modify an existing BOM. If they have a new feature, BOMs give them an easy way to see and create every variant simulation to work with. We had to do a lot of standardization of our models, but that helped our efforts to move toward fully automated tests and CI&#x2F;CD. We now have a web-based catalog of models and BOMs that are automatically generated, run, and tested. All of this has also helped get new people to use simulations for their work.')
