Right now it runs Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Does this mean that distros will drop support for it?<p>IMO instead of dropping support, LLVM should get support for fat multi-versioned binaries, providing a graceful fallback if an extension is not available. You don&#x27;t have to multi-version everything, only the functions which actually do end up getting autovectorized.')
