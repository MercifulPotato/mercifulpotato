Who among regular people are really fooled by the difference? If you are none the wiser about MB why would you be fooled by ratings listed in Mb? I would think most people&#x27;s cognizance about that extends no further than, e.g., 100Mb is less than 200Mb and that is less than 300Mb and I want the highest number I can get.<p>I guess what I am saying is that all things are really relative and humans operate on generalizations, e.g., in this case assumptions that a higher number is better just like a higher number of apples is better than less apples.<p>It&#x27;s usually the technical obsessive types, most prevalent in the modern era that are obsessive and work themselves into a frenzy about things that are both inconsequential and also only really matter in the bubble they have constructed around themselves. &quot;We must save the poor innocent people from the evil deceptions of MB vs Mb!&quot; decries the obsessive modern â€¦ while the regular person just shrugs and says &quot;I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m buying the biggest number I can for the credits I have. I don&#x27;t understand any of this anyways. I just want my drug of empty stimuli as fast as possible. I have Disney content to watch.&quot;')
