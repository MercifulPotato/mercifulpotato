Maybe not in an &#x27;evil&#x27; way but they think that idea is neat and others will find it also cool.<p>I found it in a way where I was setting website for a local hobby club. I have started initial web page, posted couple articles and wanted others to pick up and participate. After 3 months of initial &quot;oh that is so cool we have a website&quot;, no one ever cared beside me, I operated website for 2 more years and moved on with life to other hobbies because of life.')
