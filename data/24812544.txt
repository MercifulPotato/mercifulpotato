The key difference is that in empathic alcoholics, this behavior will cease if&#x2F;when they give up drinking.<p>I used alcoholism as an example because I couldn&#x27;t really think of anything apart from addiction that would make an empathic person engage in a somewhat comparable behavior for prolonged periods of time, despite feeling remorse.<p>It&#x27;s normal for all people to lie from time to time, but that&#x27;s not &quot;consciously doing sociopathic things&quot;. ASPD&#x2F;NPD manifests as such a massive, sprawling, unpredictable and destructive web of manipulation, lying, gaslighting and callousness that I&#x27;d personally say it&#x27;d be impossible for an empathic, healthy person to even come up with something that mimics it.')
