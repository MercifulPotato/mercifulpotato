No. It has to exist to be destroyed.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in two places with busses. One is my current location in Norway, and I don&#x27;t need a car to do my everyday stuff. The other was in Indiana. You couldn&#x27;t always get home if you worked second shift and you couldn&#x27;t get home from the bar: they also didn&#x27;t run on sundays.<p>Slightly more common were taxis (but I&#x27;ve lived more than one place without this as well). The taxis were never reliable in the US: For example, my car broke. I called the cab company, who told me that it was impossible to order a car ahead of time and they couldn&#x27;t give me a decent time to call - waiting time could be anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours. As you can imagine, it makes getting to work or to a doctor appointment difficult - especially if you are stuck outside before they opened.<p>City to city public transportation just doesn&#x27;t exist most places.')
