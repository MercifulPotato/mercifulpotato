They must have assumed he had already had been given opiods because he didn&#x27;t look like he was in that much pain (before the reduction). I wonder if he wasn&#x27;t guarding his shoulder (because of the spine injury), which would probably make him look like he had already been given painkillers. Dislocated shoulders are incredibly painful if they are in the wrong position. And not particularly painful in the right position.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine having a shoulder reduced while having a broken back and ribs (and wrist!). The forces required (and precise positioning) to do it comfortably would be hard if they had a broken back. My shoulder was reduced via the Snowbird method [1], which was not very painful. It requires a ton of force on your spine (and an assistant pulling on you ribs!), so obviously a no-go in this case.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emdocs.net&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;Shoulder-Reduction-Techniques-Yuan.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emdocs.net&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;Shoulder-Re...</a>')
