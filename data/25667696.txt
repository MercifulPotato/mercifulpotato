Item(by='orblivion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609998653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25667077, text='The media consistently uses &quot;incorrectly&quot;, &quot;baseless&quot; and other such qualifiers when talking about the fraud allegations which they have NO DAMNED BUSINESS doing as a supposed neutral reporter of news. CNN cut away from one of the president&#x27;s conferences on the matter, I guess because he was lying too much or something. Even Fox News turned off a feed of his press secretary, if I&#x27;m not mistaken.<p>I think it&#x27;s <i>perfectly fine</i> for them to add commentary by pundits. If they believe the president to be lying, they have to do their best to give a competing narrative. But they can&#x27;t be sticking their narrative into the objective part of the story. Trump said this. Election Official XYZ said this was incorrect because of that. That&#x27;s it. If they claim something is <i>objectively</i> incorrect they&#x27;d better have a very solid basis for it.<p>I don&#x27;t know if left-of-center people just don&#x27;t notice it anymore, but anyone right-of-center feels like they&#x27;re reading Pravda all the time these days.')
