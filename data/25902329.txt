The point of the Chez backend is to improve maintainability and portability, not to increase speed [1]. Racket used to have a custom Scheme interpreter with a lot of custom C that was difficult to work with, so instead a lot of that code was ported to Chez - easier for everyone, especially Racket devs, even if it might take a while to smooth out some of the (very modest) performance hits.<p>And since you’re obviously totally ignorant as to why Racket decided to do all this work, it makes it hard to take your rant seriously.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utah.edu&#x2F;plt&#x2F;publications&#x2F;icfp19-fddkmstz.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.utah.edu&#x2F;plt&#x2F;publications&#x2F;icfp19-fddkmstz.pdf</a>')
