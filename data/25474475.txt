But I’m gonna explain my confusion anyway because it might be an opportunity for me (and maybe others) to learn.<p>I would assume that all of the forces have to be delayed. Being a force, inherently in relation to some other thing, there’s a transfer that has to occur for the force to interact. That has to travel through space. Even in my (admittedly lay) understanding that we don’t have a full explanation of gravity, I would assume it’s subject to those same basic (spatial) principles.<p>Is that assumption way off base?')
