It&#x27;s simply faster, but also there is a lot of supporting technology in the form of workflows and tooling.<p>Third - there are more algorithms now; these are often derived from AI research (DNN, RNN, Bayesian things..)<p>The first two definitely mean that linear regression can generate much more value than 10 years ago.<p>The third one is a product of the frustration with linear regression and many other &quot;traditional&quot; algorithms. In many domains (speech, images, text processing) the community smashed its head on the wall for 30 years before the computational resources and algorithmic tricks that came out in 2010-&gt;now came on stream. You just can&#x27;t do much with TFIDF or similar with text - I tried very very hard; on the other hand using a transformer is like bloody magic.')
