If this gets through it will make europe unattractive for hardware companies. It advocates for the accessability of replacement parts, and that devices have to be designed with commonly available and easy to replace parts even though none of that is the responsibility of the device designer &#x2F; manufacturer, but rather the responsability of parts manufacturers. So this makes it impossible to design devices with cutting edge electronics, which are only made by one company, for example (e.g. an ARM SoC or a display module). There is also the requirement to share details about your hardware design with repair 3rd parties which means you could be forced to reveal your IP. Europe already over-burdens hardware companies with ROHS&#x2F;WEEE and with organizations who have the exclusive right (by being appointed by the government) to ask for recycling fees (which you need to become a member of, which costs $$$), and with very strict and expensive to fullfill EMC compliance requirements.')
