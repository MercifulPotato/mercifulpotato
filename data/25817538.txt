This can be only a temporary measure in case of justified suspicion. That&#x27;s nothing new and most companies of course comply. That&#x27;s also why the fine is so high: That company behaved <i>exceptionally</i> bad.<p>This regulation is also less about the right to privacy (in the end it&#x27;s about working environments) but about general personal rights. Constant monitoring at the workplace is just not compatible with the notion of human dignity.
