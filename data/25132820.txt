I will point out that although valuable, it is not easy reading.  for example:<p>&quot;To lead an effective life, we need to be able to make things happen -- to engage with our world so it will supply us with the experiences and results we seek.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the first sentence of the book and seems like something an engineer would write.<p>So, I sort-of-implemented GTD a few times over the years.<p>One thing Allen said is that is VERY true is that you need a trusted system to put everything into.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Omnifocus since it came out and it works well.  I can put everything in it - and I do.<p>It is macos&#x2F;ios based and you can self-host your data with webdav. (awesome, omni folks!)<p>Yet I probably do NOT implement getting things done correctly.<p>Omnifocus is sort of like a giant outline where you can arrange your life in a big tree structure, then look it up by context or just search it.<p>I would say that 90% of the stuff I put into the system is over-categorized but really languishes and is not used.<p>The other 10% is critical to my life.<p>I go to the grocery store and remember the 20 things I needed to get.<p>I go to my doctor for my annual checkup and have a list of questions.<p>I have a time-crunch project and as I&#x27;m working on part 1, ideas for part 2 or part 3 are recorded and removed from my head and I continue.<p>and nothing is forgotten.')
