The simulation would be like an entity-component system, basically a universal database. The voyagers coordinates are very far from Earth, but no new entities have to be created for that. Their coordinates can continue rising until they reach whatever the max possible value can be within the simulation, after that it would probably overflow into negative values and the voyagers would be on their way back toward where they started.')
