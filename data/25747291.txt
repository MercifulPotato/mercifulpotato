(If instead, I try to finish what I&#x27;m working on before heading home, sometimes I&#x27;ll accidentally still be working 3 hours later).<p>For this to work, the next day I need to be able to remember what I was in the middle of before I left.<p>What techniques do you use when coding, to make sure you can pick up from where you last left off (without spending half an hour trying to get back into the flow)?<p>Personally I write &quot;here&quot; in the IDE to break the compilation, so the IDE will bring me back to that place in the code when I next try and compile. Sometimes I also add a line or two describing the very next thing I want to do e.g. &quot;finish this off and then maybe move it to the viewmodel&quot; etc<p>Anyone else?')
