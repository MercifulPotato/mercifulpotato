Frankly, my assessment is exactly the opposite from yours.<p>United States is the country that&#x27;s most likely to go to shit. All of us wealthy professionals here are sitting on a powder keg of inequality and delusional politics, and nobody will be decoupled from it when it blows up.<p>I plan to stay for a few more years, then return to my safe North European home country with a solid stash of savings. My kids can go to good schools where teaching is in their native language. When they get older, they can go to free college if they&#x27;re willing to put in the effort. When I retire, I won&#x27;t need to worry about exhausting my savings because I&#x27;ve got a home fully paid and a sufficient baseline is guaranteed from the national pension system. There doesn&#x27;t seem to by anything that would make me want to stay in America â€” perhaps the worst place on Earth to retire.')
