HBO Max may have been over subscriber fees instead, but the overall jist of when Roku doesn&#x27;t have an app is that given their market share, Roku tends to insist on extra terms. For ad supported channels, some percentage of ads are served by Roku instead of the channel provider, and I believe when signing up for a paid channel via Roku, they get a recurring cut of the subscription.')
