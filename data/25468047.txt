Are you saying that it&#x27;s a CDN too? If that&#x27;s problematic then fork the web framework code on GitHub and replace GCS with your own thing to make a buck.<p>The root problem is search engine ranking policies. Frameworks can&#x27;t fix that systemically. If Google was actually downranking websites that go too far with bloat and popups then people wouldn&#x27;t do it. It&#x27;s not complicated. What frameworks actually do is help you &quot;check off a box&quot; for misguided views Google holds about things like mobile friendliness, which punish small web sites, and favor big bloated complicated ones that can afford to devote engineers to sitting around checking off boxes.')
