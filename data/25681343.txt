Serious conversations about energy are nearly totally dominated by hydrogen and related subjects. There has been an endless stream of new hydrogen investments, with total investments well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.<p>While there are still substantial numbers of naysayers, they always seem to be coming from a position of ignorance. I suspect if they actually knew about current events in the energy sector right now, and assuming they&#x27;re open minded, then they should also agree that is the case. And if this is the case then yes, this is more matter of fact than speculation.')
