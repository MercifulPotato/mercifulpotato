Phenolic boards from the pre-FR4 era were just too fragile. By the 1980s, the PC board manufacturers had that under control.<p>I have five working Teletype machines I&#x27;ve restored, and they were manufactured between 1926 and 1950. All the wiring in the 1920s models had to be replaced, but by 1935, Teletype had that solved, and later Model 15 machines just did not age. Especially the WWII models that not only got the factory Parkerizing for rust prevention, but the Army coating for the tropics.<p>Annual maintenance involves 600 oiling points, though.')
