A great example is the existence of so called crypto exchange. Why are the exchanges there anyway? Because the two parties of a transaction simply cannot and never should trust each other, so they will need a neutral 3rd party to arbitrate when necessary. Okay, then the scenario simply become a catch 22: in order to decentralize, we&#x27;ll have to need trusted authority(ies) which has(ve) to be centralized. But if we simply cannot get rid of the centralized authority(ies), then why we would ever decentralize in the beginning at all?')
