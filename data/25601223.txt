Item(by='ratww', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609480456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595735, text='Physical synths are great because they have knobs and are great for real time tweaking along with playing. Also, some people enjoy some of the &quot;special sauce&quot; that analog synths have due to their imperfect nature.<p>...with that said: the DX7 is digital, and its UI&#x2F;UX sucks. It has only buttons and menus, so no realtime control, and it&#x27;s a bit unpleasant to use IMO. There used to be an external programmer unit with knobs but I never saw one in the flesh.<p>So, your VST is light-years better in terms of both UI&#x2F;UX and sound due to better anti-aliasing filters and probably new features. Another good option if you enjoy the DX7 sound is the Native Instruments FM7.<p>If you want to experiment with a real analog synth may I suggest something in the subtractive synthesis family? Something Moog-ish is a great start! Behringer makes some very affordable ones!')
