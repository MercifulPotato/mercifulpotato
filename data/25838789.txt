So stupidly clever.<p>But man KFC makes me feel so very ill afterwards.  I&#x27;m not sure what exactly it is: I can eat Chik Filays and Burger King fine (the ~3-4 times a year I get fast food).  But KFC, it&#x27;s been like 7-8 years and I just steer clear now. \n It&#x27;s nostalgically saddening because I remember loving the stuff when I was a kid, especially those mashed potatoes.')
