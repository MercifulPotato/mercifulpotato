I&#x27;ve dipped in to the groups she&#x27;s part of and my very rough guess from the numbers is that it is something like 1 in 1000 covid sufferers get long covid. That figure though could be totally out either way as the number of cases was unlikely to have been correctly reported back when she got ill, and the new long cases coming through now won&#x27;t be &#x27;long&#x27; for months yet.')
