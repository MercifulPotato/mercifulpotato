Often the templates request info I know as an experienced user of the software to be completely irrelevant to the issue, and if provided would only confuse the cause of the problem. Templates often assume a stupidity level of issue submitters. If there is a github template, I&#x27;ll usually heavily modify the template and delete sections, which then gets flagged by a bot if such a bot exists. This only slows down the process of getting something fixed, not speed it up.')
