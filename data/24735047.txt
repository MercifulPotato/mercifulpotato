That&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happened.<p>Not for all goods &amp; services. The consumer price index has been falling for most goods &amp; services with the notable exception of healthcare, housing, education, and (to a lesser degree) food.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;howmuch.net&#x2F;articles&#x2F;price-changes-in-usa-in-past-20-years" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;howmuch.net&#x2F;articles&#x2F;price-changes-in-usa-in-past-20...</a><p>The only way to prove that “market forces do not reduce prices” is if all goods &amp; services are provisioned through purely market forces, and the CPI still increases. But not all goods &amp; services are provisioned through purely market forces.<p>The price of food in particular is largely dictated by the price of low wage labor, and minimum wage laws bring that up, despite productivity improvements elsewhere in the supply chain. In other words, the consumer price index for food <i>could</i> drop if the cost of labor wasn&#x27;t constrained.<p>&gt; Most of the structures of UBI I&#x27;ve seen seem like a massive redistribution scheme to the wealthy.<p>Only true for landlords, but that&#x27;s because the supply of housing is artificially constrained by zoning regulations. If we fix that, then this becomes less true.')
