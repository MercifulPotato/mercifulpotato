Investing in an index fund is a bet that over your holding period your rate of return will be positive for the companies invested in. But recessions happen, and if you don’t want exposure to recessions then you don’t want an index fund.<p>Furthermore it is non-trivial for global citizens, especially those in corrupt and financially moronic countries like Argentina, Turkey, and Lebanon to get access to a US index fund.
