So what makes the M1 successful should also work for RISC-V. The key non-technical difference is that you won&#x27;t have to license it from NVidia which might make it attractive to some companies that don&#x27;t want to pay as many license fees to these companies.<p>Licensing and patents have historically been in the hands of only a few companies; which limits other companies doing custom designs. With RISC-V, that could change. Of course that&#x27;s only the instruction set and you&#x27;d likely still need to license lots of patents to get anything shipping. But it fits the pattern of OSS software driving a lot of innovation and hardware design becoming more like software design.<p>Theoretically, if Intel wanted to make a comeback, RISC-V might actually be interesting for them. Right now they would have to compete with Apple, Nvidia&#x2F;ARM and the likes of Qualcomm for non X-86 based CPUs. Those three are basically using ARM based designs and you need to license patents and designs to do anything there. Intel having to license chip designs + patents from their competitors is likely not compatible with their ambitions of wanting to dominate that market (like they dominated X86 for nearly half a century). They are clearly having issues keeping X86 relevant. So, RISC-V might provide them an alternative. The question is if they have enough will left to think laterally like that or whether they are just doomed to slowly become less relevant as they milk the X86 architecture.')
