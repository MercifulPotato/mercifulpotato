You got some ammo to back up that claim?  The GOP is nothing if not unified to a fault. They&#x27;re strong because they will tow the line to hold power. (Mitch hates trump and Cruz got in line even after the mud slinging about his wife.) It&#x27;s fractured now but they&#x27;ve historically been in lock step, even when it was against their personal, publicly stated, beliefs. Democrats have been weak because they don&#x27;t require the same level of kool-aid consumption.')
