They believe that others are lying to them, and affirmation of that belief is appealing. But they&#x27;re still terribly incorrect.&quot;<p>The context:<p>&gt;&gt; If you want to claim that there&#x27;s isn&#x27;t a firm consensus around Qanon supporters about the exact definitions of this conspiracy theory, I&#x27;m still going to go ahead and say anyone in this vague ballpark is missing a few marbles. Qualifying that Conspiracy Theory != False is not a valid argument to deny that this theory, and many others, are obviously false. Debating the semantics of what a theory is or isn&#x27;t to each subjective viewer is tiring and false and not a real debate.<p>&gt;&gt; I say missing a few marbles, and that&#x27;s rude, because most conspiracy theorists are genuinely suffering from a degree of paranoia and extreme distrust. They believe that others are lying to them, and affirmation of that belief is appealing. But they&#x27;re still terribly incorrect.<p>So my questions to you are:<p>1. How is it that you know(!) the mental state and epistemic quality of the beliefs held by not only one person, but <i>most</i> conspiracy theorists?  (Note: you are the one who made the claim, my inability to disprove it does not constitute a proof of your assertion.)<p>2. Are you averse to touching upon the abstract idea I have mentioned many times: <i>What is actually true</i>?<p>These conversations are always rather ironic:  right-thinking critical thinkers can regularly be observed opining at length about the intellectual inferiority of their out-groups, how they believe things without the need for evidence, how they refuse to listen to logic, how their beliefs do not stand up to scrutiny, and so forth and so on.<p>All of this is very often true, and perfectly reasonable criticism.  But what people seem to not realize is that this behavior is not derived from &lt;out-group membership&gt;, but rather from a more universal place: the human mind.  Challenge any individual&#x27;s axioms (a self-evident truth <i>that requires no proof</i>), and they will exhibit the very same behavior, if perhaps with more sophistication and a better vocabulary.<p>If anyone was actually curious why &lt;group x&gt; believes what they do, or was <i>truly</i> concerned about the alleged &quot;danger&quot; they and their ideas impose upon society, you&#x27;d think they might perhaps have a little genuine curiosity about what is actually going on.  However, as can be seen in this thread, there is not only no interest, but <i>extreme aversion</i> to touching the topic in a serious, non-rhetorical way.<p>Something to maybe keep in mind for the next time you find yourself criticizing those who you do not actually know much about.')
