You could build discounted cash flow models and other spreadsheets to model the returns over time and use this analysis as a guide.<p>Market-based pricing:\nFind competitors or analogues of your offering in a similar&#x2F;the same sector. Price yourself competitively against their rates.<p>Value-based pricing:\nWhat is the value that the client will attach to the solution. How much will it save them? What is the opportunity-cost of not procuring the solution&#x2F;offering to the client. By modelling this and pricing your offering competitively against this number, you could make a sale that the client considers a good deal.<p>IMHO, Value-based pricing can often yield the best profitability, but you need to make sure you are pitching at the right level, and your patter is good.')
