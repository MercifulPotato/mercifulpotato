Radial engines use AvGas which is high octane gasoline.  Turbine engines use Jet A which is a kerosene blend fuel.<p>Most de Havilland Beavers in my area are still radial engines due to the nostalgia that sells to tourists.  Most companies have converted their de Havilland Otters to a turbine engine.  I have seen turbine Beavers from other areas.  You can visually identify the engine by the shape of the plane nose.  A radial engine plane has a big, round, blunt nose and sounds like an idling drag racer with a deep glug glug glug noise.  A turbine engine plane has a pointy nose and sounds like the high pitch whine of a jet engine.')
