I&#x27;m curious what those distributions are since I&#x27;ve worked very little in enterprise scale datacenters, just utilized them with non-Apple hardware.<p>Apple develops and manufacturers a lot of hardware (one of the few positive things I&#x27;ll plug them for). I would definitely consider them a generic &quot;hardware giant&quot; in that context. Much of this hardware are phones, watches, laptops, and peripherals. I know their server&#x2F;datacenter market is traditionally pretty slim but don&#x27;t know what it typically looks like. I know AWS recently announced Mac EC2 instances[1]. The fact EC2 has been so dominant and Apple hardware in EC2 is just now arriving gives much merit that they&#x27;re not in that much demand in datacenters. I work in research and have only encountered a handful of instances where projects interfaced with Apple hardware (especially in a datacenter) but there&#x27;s no reason that couldn&#x27;t shift given Apple&#x27;s capital and talent pool that already exists.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;aws&#x2F;new-use-mac-instances-to-build-test-macos-ios-ipados-tvos-and-watchos-apps&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;aws&#x2F;new-use-mac-instances-to-bu...</a>')
