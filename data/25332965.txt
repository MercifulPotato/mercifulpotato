For at least the last century, different countries have climbed the industrial production ladder; &quot;made in Japan&quot; and &quot;made in Taiwan&quot; were for a time associated with &quot;cheap crap&quot; manufacturing, then higher-quality stuff as their economies and industries finished (re)building and maturing, then finally the bulk of it got offshored and those labels are now pretty rare to see in the US.  Mainland China&#x27;s on the same ladder.  Certainly in our lifetime we&#x27;ll see some other countries start getting tapped for the &quot;cheap crap&quot; manufacturing as China tries to divest itself of that (it&#x27;ll hang on to the electronics for a lot longer, of course), and then eventually on up their own ladders.')
