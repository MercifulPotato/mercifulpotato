I think the main blocker is that you cannot make apps use it without hacks. It looks like Snap requires a custom library that probably doesn&#x27;t even have to implement BSD sockets, since that&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t have to care about at Google.<p>Some years ago I recall looking into this, and it looked kernel had limitations in higher speed ethernet (must had been 50GbE at the time), and it came down to single-threaded nature of the TCP&#x2F;IP stack in the kernel at the time. So that&#x27;s been one of the drivers for experiments in userspace. Looks like that might now be the case now [1], but if someone has more specific info I&#x27;d be quite curious to hear.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Broadcom-bnxt_en-200G-Linux" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Broadcom...</a>')
