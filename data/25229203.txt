In the US in elementary school I studied world capitals, major cities, history, etc. and came away with a pretty decent primer on things overseas, which I really value. Later in life I’ve come to know a fair bit about European football, about daily life in Taiwan, about the systems of government in Australia and New Zealand. The list goes on.<p>I’m not offended to learn about that stuff, I think it’s really interesting.<p>I agree that knowing the names of time zones shouldn’t be required, but I’ve only ever seen them displayed with their UTC offset beside them. When I get calendar invites for “AEST” I just look for that offset.<p>Just seems to me there are far worse things in the world to get worked up about &#x2F;shrug.')
