Is your goal to provide a useful tool as a one-off that anyone can pick up and use?  Then BSD is for you - otherwise, if you have expectations around self-maintenance of the code by consumers then you want to lean more toward GPL.  The thing you get out of GPL that you lack with BSD is the ability to pull back changes and bug fixes from users - usually by explicitly excluding those parties which for legal&#x2F;whatever reasons aren&#x27;t comfortable re-sharing bug fixes.')
