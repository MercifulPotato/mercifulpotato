Most people don&#x27;t know how skewed the political window is in the US anyway.<p>Even moderate right-wing politician from a European perspective want to be associated with him because he represents the right.<p>Because of that, news reporters in Europe tend to be gentle with Trump and the Republican party, glossing over their most egregious acts, to not appear biased, despite the small number of people actually supporting the same policies locally. And they still need to report on the USA because of their importance in the world.<p>Also at play, the incomprehension in translating American problems to other countries&#x27;. In other events, the BLM movements was imported to other countries with little knowledge of the US systemic problems and used&#x2F;criticized in different ways.<p>This is how American politics can drag the political discussion over the world and impact the political spectrum everywhere.')
