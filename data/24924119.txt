Item(by='phkahler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603919021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24923027, text='&gt;&gt; Try accepting constructive criticism instead of accusing people of entitlement just because they dare to disagree with you.<p>That&#x27;s valid, and I did say I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me - meaning my (possibly wrong) interpretation. A list of specific things missing is fine, but the I&#x27;m-not-switching-until sounds different than a simple valid criticism or an inquiry as to weather those are being addressed.<p>I probably should not have responded to a particular comment with my comment though. It wasn&#x27;t too bad as those things go. Some of them <i>really</i> do come across the way I described.')
