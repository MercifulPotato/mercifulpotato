I have a python script that does it for me.<p>It recognizes apps that I have open and I wrote an algorithm to place them on the screen the way I want.<p>It also creates what I call scenes, which allows me to select from couple different dynamic arrangements of windows depending on what I work on.<p>I can also able to instantly decide what windows are on both monitors by having a simple script when I select a desktop and it is being brought to primary monitor and contents of primary monitor is pushed to secondary monitor. By pressing two key shortcuts in short succession I can almost instantly set any arbitrary windows on both monitors without moving my mouse.<p>Now, this would be difficult to organize on another WM, but is a breeze on i3.')
