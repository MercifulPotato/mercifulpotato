Your ideas have to be both correct and novel. You can&#x27;t publish papers saying things other people already know.<p>To be a brilliant scientist - maybe.<p>To be a successful scientist - I think (unfortunately) the opposite.<p>If you rock the boat too hard - by challenging or contradicting other scientists&#x27; work, then you&#x27;ll be gently rebuffed on technical grounds by the peer-review process, which will make it harder and slower to get funding, which means you spend more time stuck in bureaucracy than you do in science.<p>Publishing things that confirm the status quo is a much easier way to be successful as a scientist. <i>Correctness is less important - many published papers are not &#x27;correct&#x27;.</i><p>I doubt that the other examples (investors, startup founders, writers) are different in this respect.<p>It&#x27;s easier to be successful by taking the obvious and safe path competently, rather than taking the very high risk of a completely novel path.')
