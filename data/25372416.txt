But mostly in the sense that your regulation has to be careful to avoid supporting monopolies.  Especially barriers to entry are often overlooked.<p>For example, regardless of content, complexity of regulation itself can be a barrier to entry.  Compliance takes a lot of lawyers and accountants.  (Eg most agricultural subsidies around the world go to really big farms.  And financial regulation&#x27;s complexity essentially forces banks to become big.)<p>If regulators were really interested in combatting monopolies, there are a few straightforward strategies to try first:<p>* Encourage foreign competitors to enter domestic markets<p>* Encourage companies from different industries to branch out (eg Walmart tried to offer banking services a while ago.  Lobbying by banks kept that competition at bay.)<p>* Encourage start-ups.  (This is much harder for governments than the first two points.  One way to encourage start-ups is via simplifying regulations.  But there are lots of other popular ways that don&#x27;t work well. \n See eg all the government funding available for tech startups in Europe that sadly doesn&#x27;t seem to produce much by and large; but it feels good to hand out money.)')
