Unfair constructs in the society are likely to cause overall harm in the long term (if nothing else, the society is unlikely to extract the full potential of those who feel unjustly treated by it). So you&#x27;d have to have some benefits that are greater (or greater harm avoided) than the likely harm to justify causing that harm.<p>So voluntaryness is not irrelevant, with a footnote that there might exist a case where it needs to be weighted against other factors.')
