Item(by='wruza', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608169117, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25448134, text='&gt;because I don’t want to be standing and moving around when playing a game and if you’re not doing that, the motion is kind of unpleasant.<p>This is what stops me from buying VR. I don’t want a new form of gaming(r)(tm), I just need 3D display and my chair, kbd &amp; mouse to play my regular AAA games as-is, but with depth perception and appropriate fov. Instead they suggest you to stand and waive your arms in few pretty average if not crappy games. Also, finding a VR-enabled game that will <i>actually work</i> with your headset is not as easy as one may think.')
