As Max Planck pointed out, <i>”A scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”</i><p>Regardless of that, given the veneer of rationality in discussions of this topic (not just this source, but more generally) are there any strong arguments <i>for</i> extending human lifespans? The four reasons following “Because death is bad” (including footnote 4) seem like a superficial analysis based on a cartoonish model&#x2F;philosophy of life.<p>Personally, it seems far more useful to think about how we might make human life happier and more meaningful; longevity research seems particularly pointless &amp; banal as it is unlikely to improve well-being in any significant way in and of itself. (I’m not referring to preventing  unnatural mortality, but extending median lifespan). (This is somewhat opinionated, and of course, others are welcome to alternative opinions.)')
