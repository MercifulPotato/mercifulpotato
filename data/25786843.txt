Item(by='beerandt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610683069, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25786369, text='1) One key fact often overlooked though, is that the tribal treaties (most, anyway) not only gave the US ultimate sovereignty, but also transferred ownership&#x2F;title of the lands into federally administered trusts, held on behalf of the tribe&#x27;s members.<p>So anytime a tribe wants to do anything with tribal land, it&#x27;s got to get signed off on by someone at the Dept of the Interior, or whoever is holding their trust. But not the Dept of State.<p>Which I&#x27;m assuming is part of what&#x27;s going on in the situation in TFA. Govt action requires Govt study.<p>2) The 2&#x2F;3 vote is to <i>ratify</i> a treaty, but <i>withdrawl</i> is always easier; it&#x27;s often accomplished unilaterally, and for the US, it&#x27;s basically at the Presidents sole discretion, if not at his pleasure.<p>Of course tribal treaties are different things than foreign ones- even if that wasn&#x27;t the original intent. And politically, leaving any such treaty is an idea DOA.')
