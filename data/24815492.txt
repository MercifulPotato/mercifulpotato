Item(by='mrosett', descendants=None, kids=[24817285, 24816220], score=None, time=1602994351, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24814748, text='&gt; You claim that those low-efficiency jobs would still have workers if we were allowed to pay them a low enough price.<p>I think you misunderstood &quot;If you could pay someone $4&#x2F;hour...&quot; It&#x27;s not a statement about minimum wage or anything like that; GP isn&#x27;t claiming that there&#x27;s a potential market of $4&#x2F;hr labor that would exist without regulation. Instead I interpreted the sentence as &quot;Consumers value certain tasks at e.g. $4&#x2F;hr but due to the Baumol effect nobody is willing to work for that amount.&quot;')
