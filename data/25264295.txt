Players&#x27; agents make a large cut (and it&#x27;s historically increasing) out of signed contracts, but the overwhelming majority of the money goes to the actual athletes (who then proceed to squander it, typically, since they often come from unprivileged background with no familiarity with long-term wealth management). There is some distortion (agents are more interested in brokering newer and larger contracts than renewing on same terms year after year, regardless of how settled the player is) but it&#x27;s not really exploitation.<p>This said, South American and African football are plagued by &quot;third-party ownership&quot; arrangements: investment companies literally buy footballers when young and then take massive cuts from any contract they sign, in perpetuity, in exchange for promotion and rights management. The governing body FIFA has officially banned the practice, but it remains widespread in the poorest regions like Africa.')
