To me, it talks about everything <i>but</i> actually deploying a machine learning model in production. In particular, there are a lot of words around where training data is stored. In my experience, the training data is really more part of the the development process than the actual productionisation of the model.<p>That said, there is a piece here on TFX, which is valuable in this context. I also think the advice about going with proprietary tools that speed up the process is good. Tools like Microsoft&#x27;s AI tooling, Dataiku and H20 are good in that context.<p>I would have liked to have seen some discussion around when you should deploy a model as an API vs generating batch predictions and storing them - I&#x27;ve done both on a test bench, but I don&#x27;t really know how well the API scales.')
