Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603738307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899489, text='&gt; Is bathroom choice a problem of the relatively wealthy?<p>Your rephrase lost an important nuance.  I said &quot;problems the relatively wealthy face.&quot;  Bathroom choice is a problem wealth can&#x27;t really solve or mitigate, so it&#x27;s one they still face (either directly or through their children or peers).<p>&gt; but it also affects a fair number of the wealthy, quite possibly in numbers greater than their proportion in the population. (It&#x27;s hard to judge because every celebrity overdose will be widely reported, so availability bias might be affecting my perception.)<p>IMO, celebrity drug abuse is kinda a different thing, because celebrities are a special, tiny class that&#x27;s easy to hold yourself apart from.')
