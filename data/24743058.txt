This is a similar approach that Townsend microphone’s have taken and they’re supposed to be absolutely fantastic.<p>In any case, it’s total BS that waves, et. al, can charge hundreds of dollars per plug-in when at the end of the day it’s just software, and I was wondering to myself the other day why there isn’t more stuff in the open source space. I’m grateful to have seen this now, and I’d probably be interested in poking around this kind of stuff more. I have no idea how one actually goes about writing a VST or UA or AU plugin, but this is a great start, thanks!')
