It has support for LPDDR4X-4267 68.2 GB&#x2F;s, up from DDR4 3200&#x27;s 51.2 GB&#x2F;s.<p>But the Vega 8 in this is definitely not the peak that you can squeeze out of DDR4. If that was the case then we wouldn&#x27;t have had things like the Vega 11 in the 3400G. Also RDNA2&#x27;s &quot;Infinity Cache&quot; helps reduce memory bandwidth requirements, which would also be a relevant upgrade.<p>This was just a time-to-market strategy to reduce risk. Not an optimal engineering decision. This let them avoid trying to make a power-optimized version of RDNA2 at the same time they were trying to release <i>any</i> version of RDNA2.')
