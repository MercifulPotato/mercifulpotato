Item(by='marcinzm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611956384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25962806, text='&gt;In Denmark we have a national login system (NemID), and if you got a Jailbroken iPhone, then you will not be able to use the (required) two-factor code-generation app, and then you will not be able to buy stuff online via credit card. I had a similar problem recently, as there was no alternative authentication option if the app did not work. Basically it just showed a popup telling me I had to use the app. That is NOT okay.<p>That doesn&#x27;t seem an Apple issue but rather the maker of the app decided to add a check against jailbroken phones.')
