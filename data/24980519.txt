You give an example of &quot;coal&quot; and &quot;stuff&quot; and &quot;carbon&quot;, but I don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;re arguing that &quot;carbon&quot; belongs to a higher&#x2F;academic register. Your examples seem to support the inverse of your argument, which is that German (and presumably other languages) has a distinction between a higher and lower register (one could choose between &quot;Carbon&quot; or &quot;Coal-stuff&quot;) and English <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have this distinction (you must use &quot;carbon&quot; when talking about carbon and &quot;coal&quot; when talking about coal).<p>&gt; This may be &quot;an altogether different phenomena&quot; to what the author is describing, though that should not stop you buying it. Equivalently, it should not impede your purchase of the concept that English does have some form of &quot;high&#x2F;low language pairs&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t disbelieve the author&#x27;s premise, but that&#x27;s not your premise. English doesn&#x27;t have a single &quot;high dialect&quot; or a single &quot;low dialect&quot;, but again, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what TFA is talking about with respect to other European languages. Rather, I&#x27;m guessing the author is arguing that because Latin was the written language for continental Europe, and because the scribal class was markedly different than the illiterate masses, there was a considerable divergence between formal&#x2F;written Latin and vulgar Latin which was persisted as vulgar Latin became the Romance languages--indeed, this division has deep historical roots into Latin itself (scribal&#x2F;educated Latin was different than spoken Latin) and perhaps even earlier. On the other hand, in England, that educated Latin tradition never took root--the English vernacular quickly became the language of literacy hundreds of years before written French, Spanish, Italian etc came into existence (continental scribes were clinging to written Latin). Again, I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s what the author is driving at, but it seems that way to me.')
