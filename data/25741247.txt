I need to get up to speed on using WireShark to diagnose dropped connections one of these days, as I actually have a couple of dropped-connection issues that need troubleshooting.<p>Typically I&#x27;ll get a connection timeout every few days, even with keepalives, and even with a hardwired DHCP address for the MAC in question.
