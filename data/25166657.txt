So what&#x27;s enough to be bricked?<p>* Configured badly in a way that could be fixed in just software, but in a very unintuitive and undocumented way?<p>* Firmware overwritten with broken firmware, requiring special software and images to fix&#x2F;update?<p>* Firmware overwritten with broken firmware, requiring you to open the case and attach a serial cable to a hidden connector fix it?<p>* Firmware overwritten with broken firmware, requiring you to attach thin test wires to a flash chip and bit-bang flash programming sequences?<p>* Firmware overwritten, requiring you to lift and replace the flash chip.<p>* Broken hardware components requiring extensive rework?<p>Whether something is irrevocably bricked or not depends upon what tooling, documentation, and skills you have.  Someone releasing a new tool that makes it easier to recover&#x2F;unbrick doesn&#x27;t make it not have been bricked in the first place...')
