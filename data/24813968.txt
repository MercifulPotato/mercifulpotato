Given the intent of the message, this is actually kind of harmful.  There&#x27;s a certain class of chest-thumping&#x2F;-puffing programmer who sees this as vindication for the language.  So, perpetuating that idea is bad news, especially since it&#x27;s only true if applying very, very loose criteria of what it means to give a programmer &quot;complete control&quot;.')
