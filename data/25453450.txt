It was pretty solid and rev&#x27;d to the moon.<p>(Of course I think the motor was geared and I think 6000 rpm on the tach was really 2000 rpm, but hey)<p>After about 60k miles it started getting little puffs of blue smoke when it started up (they went away in a moment).<p>I got a good deal on another car and traded it in, but I still think about it.<p>Newer models came along, and finally the RX-8.
