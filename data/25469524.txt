It&#x27;s not my model.<p>You have to come up with a persuasive answer to &quot;Why should I work as hard as I can on this company, rather than go work for Google?&quot; That question is in fact so hard that it (possibly) almost killed YC in the crib, back in &#x27;08. No one wants to work for a startup when they can get paid far more and live an easier life.<p>What you&#x27;re proposing, if I understand you correctly, is that someone works extremely hard, for no concrete gain other than perhaps intellectual curiosity. Sure, you can argue that the usual benefits apply: you&#x27;re free to do as you please, and to self-manage. But that&#x27;s not a very convincing argument in the face of $RIDICULOUS_SALARY at a bigco.<p>It&#x27;s cliche to say &quot;Don&#x27;t hate the player, hate the game,&quot; but I believe it applies here. Neither of us chose to live in a capitalistic society. We were born into one. Why not make the optimal decisions, all else being equal?')
