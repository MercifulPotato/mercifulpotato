These are just the same kind of people who, pre-COVID, would have claimed to have &quot;chronic Lyme&quot; or whatever.<p>Of course scientists are finding some cases of people with symptoms lasting many weeks, but this does not appear to be common enough that special strict public health measures should be instituted for it, just like we do little to prevent flu or colds that affect a small segment of the population with long-term complications.
