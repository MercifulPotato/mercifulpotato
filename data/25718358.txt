News about it was suppressed by the govt.<p>A woman driving along the road uploaded a video she had taken. It showed shell cases strewn on the roads, burnt out trucks, and the aftermath of that violence.<p>IT went viral on Facebook, going against the Government narrative and letting a slice of reality get observed.<p>Until morning came around to the UK. At which point someone opened facebook, and saw the gore. They were able to call people they knew at FB and say &quot;why am I&#x2F;my kids seeing this?&quot;.<p>And FB responded and took it down, for breaking site rules.<p>(taken from Custodians of the Internet)\n-----<p>FB wasn&#x27;t necessarily wrong, but it was definitely partial. When the blood and gore rule was enforced during the Boston bombings, senior employees overruled it citing newsworthiness.<p>----<p>Your guess that the net will be balkanized is quite likely true.<p>FB spends great efforts to have local presence in each market. They recruit policy people, and negotiators. However, the platform <i>does</i> help broadcast content.<p>And if someone at FB can decide what is newsworthy or not, then why wouldn&#x27;t local leaders crave that same power?')
