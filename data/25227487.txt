The court ruled that the word could only be used by wine makers in the given region. What this resulted in was not I believe good for the Champagne region, despite the intent.<p>The mind share for that word went down. Instead we found ourselves hearing people asking for Prosecco or bubbly. Champagne might now be able to assert that only the&#x27;quality&#x27; product from their region has the name, but I suspect it&#x27;s just caused the companies that produce wine to make sure that they own the trademark, and push their brand, not the term champagne. Regardless of whether it&#x27;s from that region.<p>On the flip side there are several products in Europe (and potentially elsewhere) that use the term Aussie or Australian, and they&#x27;re not actually Australian businesses[1]. Both were originally American businesses.<p>So I get the need for some level of origin protection. Both of the Australian products imply something that isn&#x27;t accurate, either manufacturing or ingredients.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aussie_(shampoo)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aussie_(shampoo)</a>\n[2]: australiangold.com')
