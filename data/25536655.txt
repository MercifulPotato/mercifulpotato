When you increase the supply of that thing, the value goes back down.  In other words, the value of a thing changes based on both supply and demand.<p>Inflation is where the value of dollars goes down.  As long as you don&#x27;t print more dollars than people are demanding, you won&#x27;t get hyperinflation.<p>The U.S. dollar, for one reason or another, is in high demand all over the world.  Other national currencies are not, so when they printed too much of their currency they got hyperinflation.<p>If the U.S. printed too many dollars too quickly, or demand for dollars dropped quickly, the dollar could see hyperinflation too.')
