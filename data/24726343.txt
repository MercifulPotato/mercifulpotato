When a DS needs some data he&#x2F;she needs to talk to all these different people, wait for them or their managers to grant access, and join the inconsistent labels. This takes a long time and some people are extremely protective of their (messy anyways) tables, requiring higher ups to straight up demand them to grant access.<p>Having nicely organized data is perfect, but I&#x27;d rather fetch the data myself from a pile of messy data instead of dealing with all these organizational nightmare.')
