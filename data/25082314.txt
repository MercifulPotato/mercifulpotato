I’ve mostly been testing with it, and not yet seriously using it.<p>&gt; Besides the cases mentioned in the readme, I also want to use this to automate on-demand Nix builders, because Nix only understands SSH for remote builders. Locally I run Mac, and I sometimes need to do a Nix build for Linux. Similarly at work, we have a build server that I want to do ARM builds on, so I can eventually deploy on t4g.* EC2 instances.<p>&gt; Any way, hope this is useful to others.')
