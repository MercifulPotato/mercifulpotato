We love it when our people take the skills we&#x27;ve honed into, for example, Amazon, JP Morgan and amazingly often return to the fold and are welcomed back with open arms.  There isn&#x27;t a prestige trap really, but maybe we just think we&#x27;re the best of the best and going anywhere else is just for rounding out experience.')
