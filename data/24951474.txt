But it&#x27;s true I&#x27;ve been doing it in limited ways, only a few tables that aren&#x27;t the &#x27;main&#x27; database, the secondary database being managed externally.<p>The things that were difficult before (that I didn&#x27;t do), that are now supported&#x2F;smoother, include: migrations (schema-history-as-code) for multiple databases; and the really new exciting feature, different database connections used for read and for write. (i&#x27;m sure there are other platforms that support that, but I know it&#x27;s not universal).<p>To me these seem like fairly advanced features, I am not sure how many&#x2F;which other &quot;competing&quot; frameworks support these features; it&#x27;s a matter of opinion whether these features are required for &#x27;maturity&#x27; or not, I&#x27;m not going to argue about that.<p>But to be clear that basic ability to connect to multiple databases has existed since long before August 2019.<p>For the other feature mentioned as being introduced four years ago in 2016, trying to make the argument that it indicates a lack of maturity because it should have existed for even <i>more</i> than 4 years in order to call it &#x27;mature&#x27;?  I think it&#x27;s clear there is just some axe-grinding going on there.<p>In general, whatever Rails faults are (and of course it has plenty) I don&#x27;t think a lack of &quot;maturity&quot; is one of them. There are few frameworks&#x2F;platforms more mature (and I would actually be interested in what examples you are thinking of). If I wanted to talk about the places where Rails isn&#x27;t as mature as would be liked, it&#x27;s not features that don&#x27;t exist or features that were introduced &quot;only&quot; four years ago -- it&#x27;s in some <i>new</i> features that IMO were introduced with insufficient stability and polish, like webpack integration. That, or ActionCable, are much better examples if you want places where Rails isn&#x27;t mature. The examples in this thread are... silly.')
