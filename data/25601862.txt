Twitter threads like this one remind me of a slideshow, with each tweet trying to make a single point.<p>Honestly I don’t get the hate. If you don’t like a certain format, don’t read it. Or use other tools that condense the format (like the threadroller app).<p>Especially when experts from other domains use this format to explain the nuances of eg a new paper, discovery, policy or political position, this kind of format has a extremely low barrier of entry, is standardized and available on a platform that loads rapidly and without (too) invasive ads.
