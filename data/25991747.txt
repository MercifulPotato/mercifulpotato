Pick one you like, use it and build something with <i>IT</i> instead. I feel the same way. Developers are a fickle bunch. One tool works, but then in order to be &quot;cool&quot; you have to bag on it and then propose some other obscure tool you think is better that nobody has ever heard of.<p>It seriously reminds me of people arguing over music. Its totally uncool to like a mainstream band because <i>everybody</i> else likes that band and its not cool to like them. So then you have all the &quot;cool&quot; people who listen to all the obscure &quot;awesome&quot; bands who Rolling Stone magazine tells you to listen to, so then you go around telling people you listen to the Shithouse Rats. &quot;Oh you&#x27;ve never heard of the Shithouse Rats? Well, they&#x27;re kind of obscure.&quot; and now you&#x27;re one of the of the cool kids.')
