And I say this as someone currently trapped on MacOS. For personal hacking I use an older Dell XPS15 w&#x2F;Ubuntu and it’s like a breath of fresh air every time I dig into a project. Containers just seem to work so much faster, there’s fewer weird things, no hiccups, and things like git and Emacs scream compared to Windows.<p>I totally get why people prefer Mac and Windows outside of software development. But as a working developer it’s really worth the effort, if given the option, to invest in learning Linux and developing on it.<p>Interns doing the whole WSL thing makes me cringe. Not great for your career IMO unless you plan on making a quick exit from the dev side of things.<p>This might be a controversial take, but I feel like A “worse” developer with a solid workflow in Linux will appear more productive than a somewhat more skilled developer getting dragged down by WSLisms.')
