Lots of developers aren’t themselves proficient at writing filesystem code as well, and there aren’t as many copy-pastable exFAT implementations as there are for FAT32.<p>So unless they know what they’re doing and unless it’s critical to their product, the majority won’t easily move onto exFAT.<p>As for the use within the device “firmware”, the user defined program is usually just a giant baremetal a.out in the middle of the ROM at a specified address, so no FS is involved there.')
