To get to real-world performance for specific games&#x2F;settings&#x2F;specs and away to have something specific in addition to the (also interesting) theoretical discussions on what is enough RAM and whether you can game on an integrated GPU and so on.<p>I hope this sheet helps answer some of it and will help more of it going forward.')
