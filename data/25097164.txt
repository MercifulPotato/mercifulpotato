I first got the internet at home when I was 12. Was then able to learn to program. Before that, I really wanted to learn everything I could about computers, but the local library didn&#x27;t have the books I needed, I didn&#x27;t have any adults or friends who could teach me, and I also didn&#x27;t have the software I needed (I didn&#x27;t even know what a compiler was). The internet gives anyone who wants to learn about programming and electronics access to references, tutorials, YouTube videos and even knowledgeable people they can ask questions to.')
