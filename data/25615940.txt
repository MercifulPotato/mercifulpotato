Item(by='bad_extension', descendants=None, kids=[25616137, 25616053, 25616108, 25616230], score=None, time=1609617700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25615690, text='Now I&#x27;m really intrested in which ones there are kernels of truth - FEMA death camps, hollow Earth, false-flag Sandy Hook? \nThe problem I have with &quot;kernel of truth&quot; is that every loosely connected scandal becomes proof of conspiracy theory being &quot;real&quot; when in reality the shady actions are made elsewhere and no one is really intrested, or worse, conspiracy is more intresting than truth. For example, when USA spend milions of dollars during satanic panic trying to prove conspiracy theory true (and ruined innocent people lives), the Catholic church was doing it&#x27;s thing freely (in my country we have hundreds of people fighting with sex-ed because it&#x27;s &quot;child abuse and LGBT indoctrination plan&quot;, when information about Church officials hiding cases of abuse is just another Monday). We have people scared to death by toothpaste and fluor in water or vaccines (another example of innocent people being in risk of harm due to conspiracies), when opium crisis and dubious antidepresants are basically ignored. I really doubt that looking for children hidden by Hilary Clinton is not going to help with finding another pedophile circle.')
