However, on the other hand, I highly doubt that the author have never ever requested any help &#x2F; support from maintainers and&#x2F;or core developers of any open source software (OSS) that the author most certainly uses and&#x2F;or have used, e.g. Linux, Android, ADB, whatever. This is in addition to free improvements and bugfixes that most OSS projects provide thanks to relevant people who (surprise!) spend their time on that, too. So, virtually replying to the author on &quot;my time is valuable&quot; -- Guess what, others&#x27; time is valuable as well. Hence, your <i>stance</i> is questionable.')
