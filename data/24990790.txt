Troubles come in various forms: missing deadlines, maintenance burden, change of employees who may or may not know a single thing about security. In small companies (web&#x2F;digital agencies) productivity and reliability is what everybody wants, not proving the ability of implementing your own similar solution. Given enough time, anybody can implement the same set of features Okta&#x2F;Auth0 provides. But how much time is that? How reliable is your code? Is it really secure?<p>As an engineer, I completely agree with you: reimplementing stuff on your own is an amazing learning opportunity (did it a billion times myself).<p>But as an owner of a digital agency in the past, I will take a 3rd party IDP over custom solution for production-ready products any time. It&#x27;s just not worth the risk for solid businesses, not to mention the maintenance burden, lack of features, etc.')
