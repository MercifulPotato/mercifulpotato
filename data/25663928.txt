Viability is a step or two down the road.<p>I took the reference to basic criteria of viability from the legal body of knowledge. Check your premises. Besides, alleged election fraud taken on its face states a possible violation of the law, the current President (represented by his lawyers) (who in turn represents the people voted him) is (are) someone who would be entitled to a remedy under the law. And the court has the power to remedy it. Essentially, what you say are the same things as the basic criteria of viability.<p>&gt; That there were no actual claims made to courts based on the affidavits<p>That&#x27;s factually false, as there were official court case filings, that carry their unique numbers, and the claims made in those filings are backed by signed affidavits. One of these filings is the Case No Case 4:20-cv-02078-MWB from 11&#x2F;09&#x2F;20: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static.reuters.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;media&#x2F;editorial&#x2F;20201110&#x2F;trumpcampaignvPA--complaint.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static.reuters.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;media&#x2F;editorial&#x2F;2020111...</a> The document mentions sworn statements regarding mail-in ballots and actions that could lead to election fraud, and that the case asks to be investigated.<p>And here&#x27;s one of the vast number of signed affidavits that have their case numbers aligned with the main case: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclu.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;field_document&#x2F;31-8_natalie_price.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclu.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;field_document&#x2F;31-8...</a>')
