Say what you want about Reddit; their ads work very well.  I was able to target relevant subreddits, people made posts about it(opening the door for me to interact with potential users), and I got a few hundred people to sign up through the Play store.<p>I didn&#x27;t continue because I realized that there just wasn&#x27;t a way to make the app profitable.  I had assumed, based on my experiences from 10 years ago, that I could make money on ads, but ads today are pretty worthless unless you reach a critical mass of users.')
