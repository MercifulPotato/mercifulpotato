The issue of putting too much IO in single die is that perimeter of die&#x2F;package needs to fit all the IO traces on substrate&#x2F;motherboard, which means more layers and more costs. Everything is just a performance&#x2F;cost&#x2F;power trade off.  But I would say that off package controllers dealing with multiple CPU chips are probably less viable now than they were before current core count increase.It&#x27;s because synchronization traffic would require insanely large busses to those controllers, if you wanted to have lots of sockets, and then you would need a lot more pins to those. \nOn the other hand if you had those on package you would get a lot more bandwidth at much lower power and latency, which is what AMD has done.')
