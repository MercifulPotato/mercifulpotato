Things like running phishing campaigns to try and steal credentials from someone inside the institution.<p>It&#x27;s substantially less likely, especially if you don&#x27;t buy the geopolitics angle, but potentially these criminals even have some unpatched vulnerability in a common deployed piece of software, which would allow them to skip the phishing part entirely.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;first-death-reported-following-a-ransomware-attack-on-a-german-hospital&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;first-death-reported-following...</a><p>Disclaimer: The company I work for is involved in detecting ransomware as a side business.')
