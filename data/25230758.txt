I&#x27;m not sure that is going to be feasible but not being able to run vanilla x86 docker images means I can&#x27;t build most server side projects I&#x27;ve worked on in recent years because they all fire up things like elasticsearch, redis, posgresql, etc. as part of their builds so tests can run against these thing. All of those are basically either vendor provided docker images or things on Dockerhub in x86 form. Manually creating arm variants for these things and customizing the builds to have ARM variants is not going to be practical for a lot of that stuff. I&#x27;d have an easier time switching to Linux or Windows based laptop than to an ARM mac right now.<p>Realistically, most people that have docker in their life are going to not be bothering with ARM macs for quite some time. In any case, the 16GB limit is also not great if you are using docker, some ide, and other tools. I&#x27;d be looking for something closer to 64GB if I was buying currently. Maybe the second generation will be a bit more attractive and maybe by then the software ecosystem will have matured a bit. Right now basically everything I use on a daily basis is somewhat problematic.')
