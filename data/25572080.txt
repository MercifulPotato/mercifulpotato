The latter I can understand, they sell photography equipment and they do repair things (I don&#x27;t think photo gear?..) but McD? McD pin is also always visible in Google Maps for me now.<p>Neither result set was helpful, though I guess that&#x27;s because what I was looking for probably doesn&#x27;t even exist in the area. Apples results were more useful, I could at least call those places and ask for advice and they&#x27;re local businesses. Google on the other hand was just irrelevant paid advertising basically. They are regressing.<p>I should say too I&#x27;ve been trying to main Apple Maps for 5 years and it has gotten a lot better as a mapping&#x2F;navigation tool, it has been my main navigator for 3 years but I still bounce to Google for search variety.')
