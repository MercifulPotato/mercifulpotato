The sales funnel takes a lot of time. You don&#x27;t necessarily have to <i>like</i> the sales process, but you should at least be able to tolerate it or consulting will be very hard.<p>I would suggest:<p>* getting some sort of American and European business entities stood up where it is easy for companies to pay you. I believe Stripe Atlas makes this straightforward now for the American side (but I have not tested)<p>* writing blog posts, recording YouTube videos, giving talks at conferences - anything to get your name out there. You want something where you draw attention to yourself and people can say &quot;who is edem?&quot; and then look up your website and discover you have a consulting business<p>* figure out how to get a list of 200-300 people with buying power at their organization and reach out offering services. Target your conversations to their needs, like, &quot;hey I see you have job opportunities for Big Data Architects, would you be interested in some consulting work to bootstrap your efforts?&quot;<p>* be prepared that sometimes you won&#x27;t get quite the consulting work you want. Sometimes you might hope for a software engineering consulting role, but you might get asked if you can advise on how to hire people like yourself. Money is money.<p>* ultimately, work hard, try lots of things, be flexible. Most attempts probably won&#x27;t work, so the ones that do should pay you very well. If you are doing 75% sales and marketing at first, 25% coding... that sounds about right.<p>If that doesn&#x27;t interest you, Solutions Architect (or even Sales Engineer) might be a better fit. These are pretty common roles at medium to large companies, but they come with a lot more assistance in the sales and marketing pieces.')
