I understand it to mean that in 1949 minimum wage was $4.22 an hour in 2018 dollars. Does that graph show worker productivity as well?<p>Similarly I do not understand your assertion that the author is &quot;cherrypicking troughs and peaks&quot;. from tfa:<p>&gt; Until 1968, the minimum wage not only kept pace with inflation, it rose in step with productivity growth. The logic is straightforward; we expect that wages in general will rise in step with productivity growth. For workers at the bottom to share in the overall improvement in societyâ€™s living standards, the minimum wage should also rise with productivity.<p>Is their assertion regarding 1968 and minimum wage factually incorrect?')
