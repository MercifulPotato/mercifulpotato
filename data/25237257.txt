If they&#x27;re not using it for tracking on their own, they close this loophole (from their PoV) of visitor data leaking to competitors, to perpetuate their monopoly.<p>Google has simply shut down too many information channels (MMS, RSS, Usenet, forcing https, to name a few) in the name of &quot;security&quot;, when they are the ones to gain from this deprivation and monopolization into the &quot;open web&quot;.<p>Nobody can convince me Google has oppressed political minorities in mind with DNS-over-HTTP.')
