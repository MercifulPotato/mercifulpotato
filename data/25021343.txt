Whether that is APNews or NYT or straight from the government website.<p>Would you really teach your children &quot;trust the New York Times and whatever the government says&quot;? When both said Iraq had WMDs, did you believe them? In a perfect world we could all look at the source material (photos, videos, data, etc.) ourselves to figure out reality and there would be uncensorable platforms for individuals to call out corruption and reach the masses. This was the original promise of the internet and social media! Sadly the authoritarian left is insistent on defining &quot;reality&quot; and relishes censoring dissenting facts or opinions. Facebook and Twitter wields their &quot;fact checking&quot; and  censorship on a might-is-right basis, which disenfranchises 50% of the population and is seriously incendiary to civil discourse.')
