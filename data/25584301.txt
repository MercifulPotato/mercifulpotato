Must say that, unexpectedly, it was very good experience. It felt almost like 50&#x2F;50 work&#x2F;free days. I was more focused at work. I was more productive. Although, honestly, I don&#x27;t think I was able to deliver same output as 5days week. The way I see it, you have only a few hours per day where your output is at the highest level. When you cut off 1 day you also decrease that hours. You can&#x27;t just squeeze them into other days, because it doesn&#x27;t work like that.<p>I actually learnt two lessons:<p>4 days a week is something I&#x27;m looking forward when I have a profitable side project.<p>5 days x 6 hours imo is better than 5 x 8 hours, better to be less tired and maximize next day&#x27;s most productive hours than to be tired and burn out eventually')
