There are a few differences:<p>1. It is not clear that we will ever be free of logic bugs to the same degree that we can minimize memory safety bugs.<p>2. We&#x27;re in a specific context in this sub-thread, and that&#x27;s that you claimed that this is a pervasive issue that everyone must consider all the time. These logic bugs can only be introduced in a context that is very unusual, and so my claim is not that logic bugs in general are irrelevant, but that the context that this kind of bug can appear is smaller than you say it is.<p>&gt; logic bugs (where Rust is weak)<p>Rust gives you way more tools than C to reduce logic bugs as well.')
