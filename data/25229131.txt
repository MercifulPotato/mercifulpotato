I don&#x27;t know the author&#x27;s credentials but it feels like a knee-jerk reaction by someone who doesn&#x27;t know what they are talking about. I&#x27;m not aware of any other cloud vendor that doesn&#x27;t ever have outages, and I&#x27;d be even more worried if my vacuum relied on the manufacturers own data centers. I think a better conclusion is for vendors to use redundant cloud regions and availability zones, and for consumers to maybe not buy internet-enabled devices if %0.001 downtime is unacceptable to you.')
