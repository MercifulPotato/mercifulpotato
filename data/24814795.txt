Note that &quot;education&quot; is not a prerequisite for a rich intellectual life.<p>In the pre-industrial era, yeoman craftsmen (think Paul Revere) would hire a person to read them history and literature while they worked.  In the early industrial era, factory workers imitated this tradition and also published&#x2F;read dozens of leaflets we might call newspapers.  Because this active intellectual life produced crazy ideas like &quot;maybe let&#x27;s do a union&quot;, it was quietly eliminated.<p>As time passes, we are increasingly conditioned to respond only to &quot;expert&quot; opinion (always conclusory, never persuasive), or emotionally potent oversimplifications intended to manipulate opinion in a particular direction.<p>When you condition a population to respond to propaganda, and only propaganda, you get predicable consequences.<p>The remedy is to encourage critical thought by socially rewarding activities like reading and reasoned dissent. Reasoned dissent is particularly unwelcome in communities of highly credentialed &quot;intellectuals&quot;.<p>Could you imagine the Federalist &#x2F; Anti-Federalist debate playing out today?  It&#x27;s unthinkable.')
