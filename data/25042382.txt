It&#x27;s super simple to set up, and the short length forces you to be direct.<p>2. It&#x27;s incredibly easy for sharing - so there&#x27;s potential for things to go viral, fast. Good for customers, bad for companies. Hashtags are quite powerful, as anyone can use them - so if someone decides to block you or whatever, you can still reach through hashtags.<p>Likewise, I guess a lot of big companies are actively monitoring twitter for things related to them. Pretty easy to automate.')
