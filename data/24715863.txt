But those situations are irrelevant because they have no bearing on the fundamental question of whether or not to switch doors when Monty shows you a goat. Effectively, we discard all outcomes when Monty shows you the car, making it an identical “game” as when Monty simply does not ever choose the car.<p>As I said, the outcome per game will be different (since you suddenly have an additional opportunity to lose), but the math around whether or not to switch when shown a goat remains unchanged.')
