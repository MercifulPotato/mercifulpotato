It reflects their CEO&#x27;s attitude in that article.<p>I had an issue where their plugin, which only worked on chrome at the time IDK if that has changed, stopped working. And I had about 1 hour before my final exam.<p>They went through the normal expected steps, then started recommending crazy shit! For example, they recommended that I delete all my bookmarks from my browser and &quot;see if that works&quot;. And if it didn&#x27;t, to re-install the operating system. Their other recommendation was to go buy another laptop -- in an hour!<p>Then, they basically just said ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯<p>I understand that there is only so much a phone tech can do in that situation, but these exams are very, very important. I am not sure I would have been able to get a waiver to take it at another time and could have ruined my GPA and been out thousands of dollars. Luckily I got it working on another computer that I had, so everything worked out in the end.<p>I am not a fan!')
