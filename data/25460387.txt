Similarly, end the subsidies that allow for cheaper shipping from China than a neighboring state.<p>If anything, I would expect “trickle-down economics” to have reduced globalization, since it allows for cheaper American labor. Of course this doesn’t mean we should embrace trickle down policies, but that we should make sure we prevent jobs from flooding overseas as we dismantle them.')
