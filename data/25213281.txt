OpenMeetings has been around for more than ten years. The feature set and ecosystem didn&#x27;t appear out of thin air.<p>What makes you think that the ASF is supposed to only support &quot;already succesful|relevant&quot; projects? The ASF doesn&#x27;t &quot;support&quot; projects. A project either is or isn&#x27;t an ASF project (though it might be incubating or retired). They have over 300 projects. Some of which are very successful or relevant, some of which are less so. But it&#x27;s always up to the ASF to decide which projects to keep going.')
