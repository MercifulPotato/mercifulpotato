To be fair I can&#x27;t yet find a way to allow arbitrary computation (though it seems easy to add one with fairly innocuous features). Although you can get it to solve 3-SAT, though only for some predefined number of variables (which it assures can be at least 32). Combinatorics stuff like printing all possible sudokus also seems like it should be feasible.<p>Don&#x27;t expect your config files to terminate when they use macros, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying.')
