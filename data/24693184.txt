Does this mean that the OP article is wrong when it says to use a separate getter&#x2F;setter function for each TLS variable (even if we manually disable inlining for those accessor functions)?<p>Also, regarding shared libraries, how can compiler cache the TLS address, since the compiler versions that compiled the shared library may be different that the version which is compiling the executable that links to it, and thus may have different caching behaviours?')
