Item(by='542354234235', descendants=None, kids=[25988945], score=None, time=1612185750, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25982894, text='&gt; Lets take a yellow cab driver in Manhattan not wanting to pick up a black passenger. If you ask them, they’ll assume its because the black passenger lives in Brooklyn or some other not-Manhattan place and that the driver wont get a good tip and wont be able to get fares at the destination, making it less economical.<p>This isn’t an example of institutional racism, just regular racism. Institutional racism would be something like legacy preferences for college admittance. Most universities and colleges either explicitly or implicitly banned or discouraged black students from attending for many decades. So, a disproportionate number of legacy students are white because a disproportionate number of past generations allowed to attend were white. Giving preference to legacy students disadvantages black students, not because anyone is being explicitly racist, but because the system is set up in a way that ends up disadvantaging them. No is looking at a black applicant and saying they don’t want them or a white applicant and saying lets pick this person, but the pattern of passing down preferential admittance to the children, grandchildren, etc. of whites who were able to attend because they were white is institutional. Legacy students are just acting in their own self-interest by using the preference system. The school is acting in self-interest by promoting the legacy system as a benefit to attending that will benefit your future children.')
