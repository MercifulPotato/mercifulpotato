And even then, it might not be the SEC etcs opinion that they want this fight.<p>That said, WSB have been really clear that they&#x27;re cornering the market to drive up the price. The fact they&#x27;ve done it by coordinating 1001 little retail accounts makes no difference. Short squeezes are always pretty dodgy. This one is openly a conspiracy to move a market.<p>Shorters got themselves in a dumb position. It seems to me someone is rigging the market to get them out of it. But that doesn&#x27;t change the core action here: let&#x27;s conspire to corner the market and force an artificially high price.')
