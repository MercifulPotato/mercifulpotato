Item(by='sammorrowdrums', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1611834765, title='Ask HN: Could OS vendors / regulators fix Universal Linking?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I have done extensive work on inter-app linking and it is excruciating dealing with the efforts of Facebook &#x2F; Insta and Google now with their gmail webview, to interupt you leaving their apps.<p>I understand that they would try to call it a user experience feature, but it really makes universal links a hack that often require intermediate websites and detection tricks to work.<p>Could &#x2F; should OS vendors (like apple and android) not enforce respecting the links. And if not, should competiton regulators (thinking both EU &#x2F; US) potentially force apps to respect universal links and user default apps etc. It strikes me that the behavior of intercepting links which are a key part of the (particularly) mobile competition space could be seen as stifling competition and anti-consumer.<p>I am interested if anyone has any suggestions about how we could better push for movement on this issue, because the current behavior is really poor and only favours companies like FB looking to try and force users to remain in their apps at the expensive or a functional mobile ecosystem.<p>If you dislike universal linking I&#x27;d also love to know why?')
