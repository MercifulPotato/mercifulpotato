It definitely is more work than simply putting bad intentions or premises into your opponent&#x27;s mouth, grandstanding against the resulting straw-man, and hiving off into disjoint factions that can be divided and conquered more easily.<p>Still, I would never pull that kind of crap on you or any other HN antagonists. We need to work together against common enemies, if we can. Warmongers, crypto-backdoor advocates, surveillance capitalists, banksters, polluters, DRM-everything vendors -- in general, the monied interests and oligarchs who call too many shots today.')
