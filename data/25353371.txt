There are meetings without me where this is decided.<p>Since I&#x27;m close to the founder and he seems oblivious, I tried to calmly tell him using facts what the situation is and how I feel about it. The only thing I&#x27;m getting as replies are &quot;yes right&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll check what happened&quot; and so on.<p>On the bright side - I&#x27;ve been promised my own team and given the ability to hire it and I&#x27;m happy about that.\nI&#x27;ve been told that I can work on more interesting things - like the ones I&#x27;ve started working with, not fixing boring bugs or doing copy-paste code.<p>The issue I&#x27;m having is that the other employees are doing decisions which I&#x27;m being kept out of the loop and which are directly related to my role and that makes the work environment toxic.<p>And I&#x27;ve also been burned out for a long time and having serious health issues due to that.<p>Since the exit was very successful, I can afford to quit and not work for at least 10 years. What&#x27;s stopping me is that I&#x27;m doing work that I love and that is a passion of mine.<p>What do you suggest - quit, take a long break, talk to founder again?<p>edit: I&#x27;m in my 20s')
