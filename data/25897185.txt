I learn so much when I try to do something with it.<p>You know what they say about emacs. &quot;Emacs a great operating system, it&#x27;s just lacking a decent text editor.&quot; Same with Racket. Racket is a great language development framework, the only thing missing is a decent language to write your program in.<p>It does take a lot more effort and expertise to design a language <i>and</i> a program. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s fun for me, I get to dream more and need to learn more.<p>I&#x27;m inspired by the super interesting Racket papers [1] and PG&#x27;s book &quot;On Lisp&quot;. It helps that I got to use Racket to make a couple basic compilers in some uwaterloo classes too.. but I didn&#x27;t even use macros for those projects, so I haven&#x27;t really gotten started with Racket yet ;)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.ccs.neu.edu&#x2F;racket&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;scheme2007-ctf.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.ccs.neu.edu&#x2F;racket&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;scheme2007-ctf.pdf</a>')
