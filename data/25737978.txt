You&#x27;re right that people don&#x27;t care about YouTube having access to their stuff; they care about <i>people</i> having itâ€”people like Regina, or their manager (or Regina, their manager).  The whole &quot;digital serfdom&quot; concept is as abstract of a concern (and in the minds of many, as irrelevant) as the classic surveillance capitalism arguments that you&#x27;re putting down, even if the digital serfdom concept is accurate.  People just don&#x27;t care about anything that isn&#x27;t an <i>immediate</i> concern.')
