I was looking to build a side project, and figured this feature could be useful for a lot of other companies that either don&#x27;t use Basecamp, or don&#x27;t have other good communication tools beside email.<p>It&#x27;s my first side project that I am launching. It&#x27;s quite a simple app that I built in roughly two weeks. Here&#x27;s the result: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.letscheckin.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.letscheckin.co&#x2F;</a><p>How it works:\nYou create a check-in, set the schedule, and the emails will send to you at the set schedule (in the subscribers timezone). At the same time you will get a separate email with the answers from the last period. This way don&#x27;t have to log in to the app to view all the answers (but you obviously can).<p>Tech:\nIt&#x27;s built on Ruby on Rails using ActionMailbox with Postmark for sending and parsing incoming emails. I&#x27;ve followed Chris&#x27;s tutorial on how to use ActionMailbox (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gorails.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;action-mailbox-rails-6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gorails.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;action-mailbox-rails-6</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gorails.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;save-action-mailbox-html-emails-with-action-text" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gorails.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;save-action-mailbox-html-emails...</a>). I run a cron-job every hour that runs a background job that checks if there are any subscribers set to receive a check-in in that hour (in their timezone), and schedule the mail with deliver_later(wait_until: &lt;send_time&gt;)<p>Work to do:\n    - Make a better landing page - work on the design and messaging.\n    - Comments on answers (it will more interesting to answer if you know you get some feedback)<p>Evolve the product:\n    - This could also become a way for companies to send announcements to the entire company.<p>Feedback\n    - Could you see this being useful as a self-standing product, or does it only belong in the context of an app like Basecamp?\n    - How would you price it? I went for a per-seat subscription as I wanted to make it affordable for small companies. These do end up being quite expensive for larger companies, so I am thinking about how to make it fixed price tiers.\n    - Suggestions for the landing page?\n    - Suggestions for the app itself?')
