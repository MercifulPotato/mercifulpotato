Item(by='xamuel', descendants=None, kids=[24851105], score=None, time=1603302628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24850160, text='Yes you can, but said representations will necessarily be misleading. It&#x27;s illuminating to consider Big-O notations: why don&#x27;t we &quot;simplify&quot;, since real numbers are so much easier, why don&#x27;t we declare, e.g., that O(n) is &quot;1&quot;, O(n^2) is &quot;2&quot;, etc.? Well, then what should O(2^n) be? A million, perhaps? But then what about O(n^1000000)? To be consistent, you&#x27;d have to say O(n^1000000) was something below a million, since that complexity level is below O(2^n). And then whatever you chose for that, that would constrain you to pack O(n^billion), O(n^trillion), etc., into smaller and smaller ranges of possible numbers. You&#x27;d inevitably be forced to eventually assign almost identical numbers to, say, O(n^(2^100)) and O(n^(2^999)), which is misleading because those are not at all close to each other in complexity.')
