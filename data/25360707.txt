It typically emerges in situations like Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan where you have a large, technologically advanced invading force that you are resisting. In the United States, there is very low risk of an exogenous actor occupying US soil, so we don&#x27;t really have to worry about that.<p>Rather, we have to worry about our own government, and our best option is to take full advantage of our democratic system to head tyranny off at the pass.<p>Lebanon was a Civil War in the context of a failed state. The state no longer had a monopoly on the use of violence. A more recent analogy you could draw that would be more apropos would perhaps be Mexico where large swathes of the country are outside of state control, and rather in the hands of transnational criminal organizations.<p>I would again, argue that we should worry about preventing our country from becoming a failed state. The effort of preparing for the worst case scenario could perhaps be better spent through political engagement and activism to ensure that our country does not reach the point of being a failed state.<p>As you see right now, the current presidential administration is in the process of attempting a coup. It is not the lone citizen with an AR-15 that has prevented it. It is our <i>institutions.</i> What stands between the current administration staying in office for the next four years in full defiance of the voters as they would very much like to do? It&#x27;s our <i>institutions,</i> including the whistleblowers, the free press, the judiciary, congress, state legislatures, and a military with a good head on its shoulders.<p>In fact, I have hundreds of rounds of 7.62x39 in my garage and a few thousand of 9mm. But, I have it because it&#x27;s cheap in bulk, not because I have any aspirations to shoot another human being in any conceivable scenario. I believe in the strong institutions of my country, rather than my ability to murder my fellow Americans.<p>I bear no ill will, however, towards those who choose to &#x27;trust in Allah, but tie up your camel.&#x27; I only ask that they consider giving their time to mending the patchwork of our society rather than simply preparing for when it rips.')
