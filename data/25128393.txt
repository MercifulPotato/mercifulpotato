The economics of this hasn&#x27;t changed much over the past 10 years and I doubt it&#x27;s going to change any time soon. Ultimately local computers will always have excess capacity because of the normal bursty nature of general purpose computing. It makes more sense to just upscale that local CPU than to rent a secondary CPU which imposes a bunch of network overhead.<p>There are definitely exceptions for things which require particularly large CPU&#x2F; GPU loads or particularly long jobs, but most developers will running local for a long time to come. CPUs like this just make it even more difficult for cloud compute to be make economic sense.')
