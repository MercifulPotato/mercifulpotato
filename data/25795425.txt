The system is set up so girls message first and matches will expire after 24 hr. When a girl messages you first, she is already more invested in getting to you know than when a guy using a cheesy pickup line on tinder.<p>This is an overly optimistic take that I cannot confirm.<p>The first messages received on Bumble are either &quot;hey&#x2F;hi&quot; or a GIF that is typically a waving bear with the word &quot;hello&quot;. That is despite profile text and images with dozens of things that could spark a conversation or question. In fact, most people never read my thoughtfully crafted profile - there certainly is no investment in getting to know me. Instead my reply is expected to be creative&#x2F;funny or the conversation will end, essentially making this conversation no different from Tinder.\nIn my experience the typical Bumble user in major metro areas wants to date, but not with long term in mind. If that isn&#x27;t important to you, fair enough.\nAs an aside, I also find that Bumble has less diversity than other apps - racially, socioeconomically etc<p>Given Tinder and Bumble I vastly preferred Tinder. Tinder has far more users of every kind of background with every imaginable kind of intention. The key is to be intentional in your profile or your first messages about what you are looking for and move on if it is a mismatch. I know how to identify a Tinder profile that is a good mutual match for me, but I definitely will get tendonitis from swiping left in the process of locating such a profile. If you save your free daily super like for that person and assuming you are introspective enough to accurately assess whether this person will be interested in you you have a high chance of being seen and matching.<p>If you would like to date seriously without it feeling forced or desperate I highly recommend Coffee Meets Bagel (if you are in an area where this app is being used). It never takes me long to find someone wonderful there that makes me want to quit all apps.<p>In my experience, no matter what you are looking for, Bumble isn&#x27;t your best choice for any of those things.')
