Item(by='zrm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612107930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25977547, text='&gt; to have compatible servers that could communicate across different protocols, which is a run to the bottom just as in e-mail where adding new security and removing legacy is near impossible.<p>TLS was not in the original email RFC. Such a high percentage of email servers use it now that some have started refusing to communicate with ones that don&#x27;t. And long before 100.0% of email servers support TLS, you can still use it whenever it&#x27;s supported by the servers of the sender and recipient.<p>The DNS RFCs contain a specification for zone transfers, i.e. requesting all the DNS records in the zone instead of any given one. Some people don&#x27;t like the idea of anybody being able to download their entire zone, and it was always a silly way to sync zones between DNS servers as opposed to using e.g. rsync, so most DNS servers on the internet refuse to do it and a lot of DNS server software doesn&#x27;t even implement it. But the people still using it internally for whatever silly reason can carry on doing so indefinitely without hurting anybody else.<p>Nobody cares about the legacy cruft that nobody they care about uses. What having central control gets you is the ability to decree from the tower that something some people <i>are</i> still using shall be removed for everyone everywhere. That can be more of a bug than a feature.<p>The biggest actual problem with protocol ossification is stupid network middleboxes that manipulate or drop traffic and then break on protocol changes they don&#x27;t understand. The way to fix this is for future protocols to be encrypted so the middleboxes can&#x27;t mess with it.')
