The I&#x2F;O\n   subsystem, the concurrency subsystem (which includes the \n   scheduler for “green” threads, Concurrent ML-style events,\n   and custodians), and the regexp matcher were all rewritten\n   in Racket. Those pieces followed the rewrite of the macro \n   expander in Racket.\n</code></pre>\nSo there was a slowdown until those pieces matured.  But now they get the benefit of having all those pieces in higher level of abstraction and more accessible to Racket programmers.')
