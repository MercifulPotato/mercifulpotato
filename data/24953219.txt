This is eye opening. I’ve definitely seen this “dance” going on between new Indian coworkers and could detect there was some shared knowledge I was missing but had no idea what it meant, what was going on, or if it was friendly or not.<p>(Especially the vegetarian question and asking if “that was out of choice or cultural”. I figured this was dog whistling to religious affiliation and felt uncomfortable about it but regrettably just stayed out of it.)<p>I want to apologize to my Indian coworkers and especially directs, that I was so naive to this. You absolutely do not deserve this kind of treatment anywhere but especially the US and immigration status really compounds this and makes this oppressive.<p>I am absolutely going to be more aware and diligent about this and raise flags when I see it going forward. Not okay. I am so sorry.')
