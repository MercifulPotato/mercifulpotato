So they basically scrape the web themselves and serve the results via Spotlight &amp; Siri, it just lacks a web frontend? Is there any additional information on that? I haven&#x27;t heard of a Apple crawler user agent yet, but I could&#x27;ve just missed that. I always thought they&#x27;d be using Bing or DDG for that data. If Apple wanted to go into the search engine business, I&#x27;d have expected them to just aquire DDG, tbh.')
