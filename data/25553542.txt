Item(by='emteycz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609097248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25553266, text='&gt; That is an observation, not a policy thought up by politicians working at the Parliment.<p>Once more, the document says: &quot;The study lays out predictions for digital services in the next one to ten years and provides recommendations for action for the European Parliament in preparation for the Digital Services Act.&quot;<p>&gt; It is a study for politicians to take better decicions not policies to be implemented, for that you want to read the things like the meeting minutes not supporting analysis.<p>Exactly! And they really took all of this advice to their hearts with the Digital Services Act.<p>&gt; I would welcome linking to more, as long as they are not just studies, although interesting reading they do not dictate the policy.<p>Start here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;digital-single-market&#x2F;en&#x2F;digital-services-act-package" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;digital-single-market&#x2F;en&#x2F;digital-servic...</a><p>&gt; Well I am also welcoming more information about this as it sounds like something I want to read up on. The EU may be inefficient, and it could be a lot better, which is why I would welcome a discussion about it instead of making accusations without providing any sources to base your claims on.<p>Are you not watching the news? Even if not you could have easily used Google yourself, the document I linked gives more than enough keywords.<p>We&#x27;re very lucky the EU is inefficient, otherwise there would be a totalitarian police state way worse than China or Russia sooner than tomorrow. Fortunately we got enough time to leave before the EU makes its latest moves.<p>No discussion is going to save this shit show, we&#x27;re way past that. The DSA is going to be implemented soon and it&#x27;s not going to be even a tiny bit better regardless of how much you talk about democratic values.<p>Sadly it can&#x27;t be better. It&#x27;s democratic, and the people in this union are not striving for freedom but the opposite.')
