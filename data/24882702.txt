Why? That&#x27;s only needed for devs in SV, NYC, London and other places with mad rent, besides - all you&#x27;re gonna get in these places are fresh university grads and hipsters, not seasoned people with actual experience that tells them to <i>not</i> use a two months old JS framework for something that is supposed to live long.<p>2) Why limit it to USA? Other countries have decent programmers too, with <i>way</i> lower cost of employment. 60k is going to fetch you quality in Germany, 30k in Eastern Europe.<p>Besides, the best way to finance all of this, other than pressuring government to procure only&#x2F;preferred open source  is some rich startup exiter putting a couple billion dollars into some sort of trust fund and pay the development from the interest.')
