Item(by='dhosek', descendants=None, kids=[25582489, 25582715], score=None, time=1609342302, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25561534, text='Not the best review of Richard Greene&#x27;s biography (I have a Google news alert on “Graham Greene” so I&#x27;ve read them all) in that it tends more to summary than evaluation, but it’s not the worst either, perhaps for the same reason. I have the bio on pre-order (it’s been out in the UK for a few months but the American edition, with a different title, <i>The Unquiet Englishman: A Life of Graham Greene</i>, doesn&#x27;t come out until 12 January). I found Boyd&#x27;s comments on <i>The Heart of the Matter</i> especially interesting as this is the novel by Greene that’s by far the most incomprehensible to non-Catholics.')
