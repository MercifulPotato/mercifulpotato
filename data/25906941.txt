Item(by='geocar', descendants=None, kids=[25917029], score=None, time=1611600203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25905910, text='&gt; This argument is significantly weakened when simply removing the meaningless macros and adding whitespace improves readability.<p>I disagree wholeheartedly. Whitespace tends to move code further away from the code that uses it; scrolling and tab-flipping requires the developer hold that code <i>in their head</i> where it is most likely to degrade. It is much <i>much</i> better to make them remember as little as possible.<p>It also helps reuse: If you don&#x27;t scroll, you can see more code, so you can see if something is a good candidate for abstracting, just because you can <i>see</i> them doing the same thing.<p>Macros like this help with that, and so they aren&#x27;t &quot;meaningless&quot;. Less whitespace helps with that, and so it actually improves readability (to those who have to read it!).<p>The trade-off is that you can&#x27;t hire someone with &quot;C&quot; on their CV and expect them to be productive on their first day, but in a complex codebase, this might not be possible for other reasons.')
