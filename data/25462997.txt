The linked rantpost is verklempt because it&#x27;s been 4 weeks since the release of a major OS revision supporting a new processor architecture and a standalone installer hasn&#x27;t been provided (yet).<p>And here are his given arguments for the Collapse of American Way and Civilization in General if this situation continues:<p>- It&#x27;s hard to reinstall Safari.<p>This basically happens ... never. I&#x27;ve been running OS X since the beta and have never had to reinstall Safari.<p>- It would make it difficult to recreate a specific point release in the future.<p>This is valid, but also a rare use case and this doesn&#x27;t prevent you from doing it, you just have to apply the incrementals from Apple.<p>- It would eliminate &quot;An effective panacea for some system problems.&quot;<p>I think I applied a combo update to fix some hosed up printer drivers after an HP update screwed the pooch one time but I could have just loaded an earlier version.
