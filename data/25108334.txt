This includes the guiding principles&#x2F;objectives for NZ, key outcome targets, various status updates and the ability for the public to make submissions regarding the treaty. This is more than enough to understand the context and purpose of the treaty -- the actual text is generally not publicly available until it has been agreed (there would be little point, there are near continuous changes as the negotiations occur).<p>I&#x27;m not from NZ, but once the treaty text has been concluded the ratification process looks similar to Australia and involves fairly extensive public review (NZ process detailed [2]). You&#x27;re welcome to read the couple hundred pages national interest analysis, economic analysis and cabinet papers on the treaty as well [3].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200122083058&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mfat.govt.nz&#x2F;en&#x2F;trade&#x2F;free-trade-agreements&#x2F;agreements-under-negotiation&#x2F;regional-comprehensive-economic-partnership-rcep&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200122083058&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mfat....</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mfat.govt.nz&#x2F;assets&#x2F;About-us-Corporate&#x2F;Treaties-Model-instruments&#x2F;International-Treaty-Making-Guide-2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mfat.govt.nz&#x2F;assets&#x2F;About-us-Corporate&#x2F;Treaties-...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mfat.govt.nz&#x2F;en&#x2F;trade&#x2F;free-trade-agreements&#x2F;free-trade-agreements-concluded-but-not-in-force&#x2F;regional-comprehensive-economic-partnership-rcep&#x2F;rcep-resources&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mfat.govt.nz&#x2F;en&#x2F;trade&#x2F;free-trade-agreements&#x2F;free...</a>')
