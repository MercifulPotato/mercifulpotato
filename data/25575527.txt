I am talking about real fat burning. Think about it - if you don&#x27;t eat at all, aren&#x27;t you going to lose weight? Our ancestors often went through feast-famine cycles and survived, likely because they accumulated fat during feast periods and then spent it during famine periods. Our issue is that we are always in the feast period and can&#x27;t allow body to enter the famine one. The first three days are usually the worst, then it feels normal (assuming you take your electrolytes).')
