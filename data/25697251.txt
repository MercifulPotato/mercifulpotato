ACA was a thing that various corporate backers did not all agree about.<p>For the phenomenon I am talking about, both sides agree, and you never hear a peep about what they agreed on. For example, was any corporate officer of any large bank prosecuted for millions of counts of fraud, after 2008? For even one count? Did any single one go to prison? Tim Geithner got made SecTreas, instead.<p>The DoD every year utterly fails to account for how most of the money they are handed was spent. Do you imagine that is because it can&#x27;t be done? That they can&#x27;t follow orders? The major corporations account for more than that amount, every year, every dime.')
