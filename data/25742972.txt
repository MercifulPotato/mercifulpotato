It&#x27;s not ideal - what would be <i>ideal</i> is zero knowledge proofs for such a thing. But it&#x27;s basically:<p>hash(static-pepper, username, password) * 250k<p>That + tagging the password with &quot;password++&quot; or something means that you&#x27;re a <i>lot</i> safer against the major issue of leaking a password before it&#x27;s stored, for example the mistake that definitely happens everywhere of &quot;let me just add request logging, whoops there&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s plaintext passwords&quot;. You can always search your logs for the &#x27;password++&#x27; tag and alert if you find it, and if that does happen at least you know an attacker isn&#x27;t going to have an easy time extracting a plaintext password - it buys you time.<p>And if an attacker gets SQLi or whatever and dumps the passwords they&#x27;re that much harder to crack - you&#x27;ve added hundreds of thousands of iterations of key stretching, and it&#x27;s totally distributed to clients so you don&#x27;t even have to worry about it blowing up your db&#x2F; auth service CPU.<p>And it&#x27;s trivial to implement, which is the really important part. ZKP is a lot more work, but what I described is like 5 extra minutes and pretty trivial.')
