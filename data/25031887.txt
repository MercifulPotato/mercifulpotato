No, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the other way around. Quest has a mobile GPU so it can&#x27;t deliver the top VR experiences. That it&#x27;s easier to use, no wires the same way an iPhone is easier than a PS5 might be true but I can&#x27;t play PS5 AAA games on an iPhone and I can&#x27;t play VR AAA games on a Quest')
