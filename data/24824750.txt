I spent months looking for a good cabinet for my TV + consoles + storage, but could&#x27;t find anything. I buckled and went for an ikea setup in the end, using their design tool to come up with something really neat and affordable. I mean yeah it&#x27;s particle board, but it looks good and will be just fine for the next ten years.')
