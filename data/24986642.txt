Verbal agreements or not. Common sense says if you undercut someone&#x27;s price they will cut their price too in response. Just offer the same price, stay out of their neighborhood, etc. Don&#x27;t need to wink and nod about it. Yet we see fierce competition all over the place because that strategy doesn&#x27;t work. New entrants always come along and they can&#x27;t make a profit by playing that game when others already have all the market share. If you only see a single provider it&#x27;s either a govt-protected monopoly as I mentioned above, or a beneficial monopoly that is holding prices too low for competition to see an opportunity.')
