I&#x27;d start with his Border Trilogy which is 3 books sold together. Or just All The Pretty Horses if you want to dip your toes to see if you like his writing.<p>I&#x27;ve also enjoyed Elmore Leonard quite a bit recently. More pulpy I suppose, but well written. Out of Sight is a good one with a somewhat faithful movie version as well.<p>Normal People by Sally Rooney is something I read recently that I liked.<p>Unless by literature you actually mean classic literature, in which case I&#x27;m really not qualified to recommend anything :-)')
