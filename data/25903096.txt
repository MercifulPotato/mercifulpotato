Making an alternative messenger that people will use is one problem, but making one that people will use *instead* of WhatsApp is an entirely different beast. The former can be solved with new (non-privacy related) features, but that&#x27;s not gonna be enough to overcome the network effect.<p>The really important question here is whether people really don&#x27;t value their privacy that much or if they just don&#x27;t know any better. If people really don&#x27;t care, then there is no problem to be solved. If it&#x27;s an uninformed decision, then this is not a technological problem but a societal one that can be solved with awareness campaigns for example.')
