One of the findings is that the average time per day spent across all development processes (from getting requirements to testing) was about 2-4 hours.<p>That number is surprising only to people who don&#x27;t accurately and religiously track their time. Guesses are useless. We found that it took about a year for everyone to really get good at time tracking and to reinforce others (&quot;hey, George. I was looking for you before and I noticed you weren&#x27;t at your desk, but you timer was still running&quot;) to get better. After doing that, we found that our time fell into that range. The Test team was at the higher end with 6-8 hours when executing test cases for days on end and newcomers were around 4-6 which we attributed to them having fewer distractions. Experienced&#x2F;senior engineers were usually around 2-4 hours&#x2F;day.<p>So, all in all, I&#x27;m not at all surprised by your results.')
