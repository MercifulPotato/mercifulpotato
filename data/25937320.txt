You’ll have a hard time finding a) a service provider willing to tolerate that and b) much public sympathy for the service promoting hate.<p>Yet it called into question freedom of speech.<p>Same thing today with WSB, but the focus is clearly not hate speech (even if Discord says so). I find today’s bans way more objectionable than Parler, yet I still cannot reason why people truly believe that any service providers owes it to us a 1st Amendment platform. Discord and Reddit are free to select whatever content they find palatable.<p>It sucks because I found WSB entertaining, but no one here should be mixing up Big Tech with the 1st Amendment.')
