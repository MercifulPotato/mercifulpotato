Being in a lower gear than you expect and spinning out or being in a higher gear and having no traction is terrible. The Nexus is super easy to shift (and can shift when you are stopped) has a bigger gear range, and is predictable.<p>Also, when bikes were launched, these didn&#x27;t exist. Now it&#x27;s likely you can get an all around easier ebike for about the cost of one of these so it&#x27;s a no-brainer.<p>&gt; Your argument seems to be &quot;advanced users don&#x27;t want this&quot;<p>No. My argument is <i>nobody wants this</i> you might think automatic shifting on a bike is a good idea, but every time it&#x27;s been done people hate it. It doesn&#x27;t work like an automatic in a car.<p>The fact that it&#x27;s far more difficult to change a tire means users are even less likely to learn basic maintenance. It&#x27;s nice to say &quot;They&#x27;ll take it to the shop!&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t help when they are on the bike trail 4 miles from their car. With a somewhat normal drive-train another rider can give them an assist. With this, it&#x27;s unlikely anyone has the tools with them to help out.')
