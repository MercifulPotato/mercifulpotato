Design systems, plugins, multiplayer for holding critique&#x2F;retros&#x2F;planning, version control, etc put Figma far ahead of Sketch.<p>I manage a design team and there’s no way in hell we would go back to Sketch.<p>To even think that having a “native” app has any bearing isn’t accurate at all. Sketch is so slow compared to Figma. You aren’t using multiplayer everyday but when you do need it, there’s nothing like it.')
