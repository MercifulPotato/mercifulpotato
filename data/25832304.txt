Anyhow, the interesting measure is the total number of people living in small vs. large countries noted for human right violations or wars, not the total number of countries with that condition.<p>I agree that Singapore is a hellish dystopia, but Switzerland&#x27;s referenda and its strong stance on not going to war (but keeping a strong army for defense) are undeniable attractive points.<p>These are the European countries with population between 4 and 9 million: Austria, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Serbia, Denmark, Finland, Slovakia, Norway, Ireland, Croatia.  That&#x27;s quite a &quot;dream team&quot; in my view!')
