Item(by='meetups323', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603807929, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24906218, text='I&#x27;m about 2 hours into setting up an Mobilizon instance for outdoor socially distant activities, but running into problems [1] and at the end of the day federation isn&#x27;t important to me and I&#x27;d prefer the learning opportunity and flexibility of building my own [2].<p>Curious if any HNers in the PNW region might use such a service to pod up for outdoor socially distant activities (hiking, wilderness cleanup, kayaking, perhaps camping&#x2F;backpacking&#x2F;biking, etc). I moved here just pre-COVID, and quarantine, my introverted nature, lack of FB, and tendency to enjoy things that don&#x27;t involve lots of people being around has left me without as much of a do-things-with group as I might like.<p>[1] I&#x27;m 2+ hours into provisioning&#x2F;setup, and unfortunately the yarn install keeps hanging&#x2F;crashing on the $5 digital ocean droplet I provisioned for this, and at the end of the day I&#x27;d prefer to have full knowledge and control over the stack. Additionally, for me federation isn&#x27;t important, all I want is an open architecture that respects privacy.<p>[2] To keep things simple for myself and users, it wouldn&#x27;t be federated, instead there would be a single domain I manage that hosts the events. The architecture would of course be open source, and my goal would be to make the entire project be available as some sort of { docker image &#x2F; kubernetes cluster &#x2F; DO App &#x2F; heroku thing &#x2F; something } such that anyone can easily launch their own instance without needing to dedicate 2+ hours to the process, and more importantly any user can find activities to join in on without needing to set up an account&#x2F;provide email&#x2F;etc.')
