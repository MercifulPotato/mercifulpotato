Item(by='axguscbklp', descendants=None, kids=[25100531], score=None, time=1605431473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099460, text='&gt;It will be a terrible place to live even if witch-hunts are genuinely wrong.<p>It would probably be a terrible place to live physically, but not necessarily a terrible place to visit online. Places such as the ones SSC refers to are terrible places to visit for people who get deeply emotionally hurt when they see hateful discourse and for people who lack the skill of filtering low-value content in search of high-value content. However, both the skill of being unaffected by hateful discourse and the skill of rapidly finding high-value content in an ocean of low-value content can be learned. I think that learning those skills is worthwhile because in strongly free speech areas, one can often find high-value content that is difficult or impossible to find in thought-policed places.')
