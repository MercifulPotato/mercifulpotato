Only CGI does that since the CGI binary is executed for each request.  FastCGI binaries run as a server listening on a unix&#x2F;tcp socket for connections from the frontend web server.  It works the like a webapp listening for http requests on a local socket with reverse http proxy rules setup on the frontend web server.')
