The variable length instructions of x86 mean you can fit more of them in an L1i of a given size. So, in short, ARM pays for easier decode with a larger L1i, while x86 pays more for decode in exchange for a smaller L1i.<p>As a spectator it&#x27;s hard to know which is the better tradeoff in the long run. As area gets cheaper, is a larger L1i so bad? Yet on the other hand, cache is ever more important as CPU speed outstrips memory.<p>In a form of convergent evolution, the uop cache bridges the gap- x86 spends some of the area saved in the L1i here.')
