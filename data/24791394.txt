Government can afford to pay employees decently despite opposition from the public and business because taxation is not voluntary. It&#x27;s not an ideal situation obviously, but government is in the best position to buck financial incentives for corruption because it already has tax revenue to cover costs. Private companies don&#x27;t have that luxury and are more liable to be corrupted.')
