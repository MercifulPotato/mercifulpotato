I certainly don&#x27;t want to become a victim of an avoidable incident, and I don&#x27;t want anyone else to become a victim either.<p>&gt; American conservatives tend to dislike safety (people should be responsible for their own safety, regulation will slow down business and make everyone worse off)<p>People being responsible for their own well-being certainly doesn&#x27;t imply a dislike of safety. It&#x27;s acknowledging a reality that ultimately we are responsible for our own fates. And it certainly doesn&#x27;t rubber-stamp fraud, as is the case here where companies literally lied about the leveling of their product.
