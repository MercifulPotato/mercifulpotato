How exactly does MDN bring money? Do you suggest MDN should be a revenue source? Or do you expect Mozilla to maintain the MDN for free eternally just because?<p>This is seriously entitled. Mozilla gave us an amazing resource, entirely for free. This attitude isn&#x27;t right, it&#x27;s toxic and harmful.<p>Mozilla is in a spot of difficulty, and instead of taking a resource that is operating entirely at a loss down, they&#x27;re taking the engineering steps to ensure thez resource can outlive them.<p>That their mismanagement caused them the difficulty is entirely irrelevant here. It could have happened in a myriad of other ways. We should be praising Mozilla and the MDN tech team for the steps they&#x27;re taking in making sure the MDN can live on.')
