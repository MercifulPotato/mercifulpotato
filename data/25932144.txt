That uses the same type of 120V plug that you&#x27;d use for a coffee maker, and it&#x27;s enough for about 40 miles of range while you sleep.<p>With a modern long-range EV, nightly L1 charging plus occasional DCFC or L2 charging would meet the driving needs of almost everyone.<p>So the solution is very simple: Just install L1 EVSEs everwhere.  Streetlights have extra capacity now that LED bulbs are in vogue, so putting L1 charging next to every on-street parking space isn&#x27;t even a technical challenge.')
