I&#x27;ve been using Macs since 1986, and I&#x27;m accustomed to the &quot;open a file, do something to the file, and then save the file&quot; paradigm, which has worked for documents, spreadsheets, graphics, audio, etc. using many different types of software. It took me an embarrassingly long time to understand that, with iMovie, you are working instead with &quot;projects,&quot; which are (if my understanding is correct) a kind of container with links to various video, graphic, and audio files, and that, at the end of the editing process, you need to convert each &quot;project&quot; into a new file in order to share or archive it.<p>If I had read or viewed a How-to-Use-iMovie tutorial at the start, of course, I would not have been so confused. But I&#x27;m used to just diving in with new applications and trying things out, seeking help only at a later stage. That didn&#x27;t work with iMovie, which was frustrating for me.<p>I realize now that, because of the size of video files and the time required to process them, the manipulate-the-file-directly workflow probably wouldn&#x27;t be feasible. But if you think that Windows users inexperienced with video editing would have the same file-based mindset that I had, you might want to see if you can make your interface <i>seem</i> as though the user is opening, editing, and saving their video files directly. If that&#x27;s not possible, then at least give users the option to view a getting-started tutorial the first time they launch the application.')
