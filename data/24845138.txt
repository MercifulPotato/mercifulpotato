There is time involved to invoke a new variable just as there is time involved to access an object&#x27;s property.<p>As an added bit of trivia in the 1970s a software developer named Paul Heckel, known for Heckel Diff algorithm, discovered that access to object properties is faster than accessing array indexes half the time.  That was in C language, but it holds true in JavaScript.')
