SPAs usually fail to display anything but a blank screen when there is a slow connection.<p>Losing form data hasn&#x27;t been an issue in forever... The browser saves it when you go back or forward. You don&#x27;t even need to press &quot;back&quot; - you can even just refresh the error page and as long as you click &quot;yes&quot; to the pop-up telling you you&#x27;re resubmitting a POST, the form will submit with the original data entered, no problem.... Of course, SPAs like to break this for no reason, stop doing that.')
