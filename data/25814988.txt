A few years back I built a NAS at home and wanted to run ZFS on it, so FreeBSD was an obvious choice. I soon found out how easy it is to create and manage jails: you just start a new one from a template, get an ip address, ssh into it and `pkg install` whatever you need. I now run over 10 jails, having home automation, media player, grafana, few different databases, unifi controller and so on all in their own jails.<p>I like the simplicity and how straightforward it is to add new servers to our home. I have long history with docker, but kind of prefer the way of being able to ssh into the jail and manage it like a normal server distro. Docker again is much nicer in the daily development flow, where I want nine different databases in a clean state every morning.')
