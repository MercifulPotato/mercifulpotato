Yes it is possible to be productive on the linux desktop.<p>I&#x27;m using Fedora 33 on my personal laptop with nvidia drivers. And never needed to install any drivers for my work laptop.<p>Upgraded both laptops 3 times from Fedora 30 without a hitch.<p>And it&#x27;s a one step process using a graphical interface [1].<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that (in my own experience), linux of today is very different from linux of 10 or 20 years ago. I&#x27;ve had my share of problems before, installing drivers for graphic cards and modems back in the &quot;00&quot;s but I think that most linux distros have come a long way since then.<p>Linux may not be the best choice &quot;getting stuff done&quot; for an average user. But, from my own experience, for a software developer it&#x27;s a good choice. And in the company I work for, most developers have hp elitebooks with fedora installed.
