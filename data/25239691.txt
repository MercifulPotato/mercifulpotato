The idea is that if you send too much, you just compete with your own packets, and thus are not rewarded for sending too much. This discourages hogging the bandwidth. But fair queuing is computationally expensive, and is rarely seen in core routers, where some FPGA is doing routing. It&#x27;s also not seen enough in home routers, where fast LAN hits slower uplink and a FIFO queue gets long, increasing latency. That&#x27;s &quot;bufferbloat&quot;. Quite fixable. Now get AT&amp;T and Comcast to cooperate.<p>From the paper, &quot;Classic congestion control questions on fairness guarantees and convergence need to be re-answered for the new rate-based congestion control paradigm.&quot; Yes. They&#x27;re looking at performance for individual nodes.<p><i>This will be exponentially worse with QUIC</i><p>Or when Google uses it to improve their responsiveness vs. others?')
