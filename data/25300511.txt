The black bars are fine when watching movies if you mostly use the display for productive work, whereas 4:3-&gt;16:9 was a shitty transition for someone like me working mostly with text and written music. It was as if the world had decided that the use case for computer screens was something else than what I was using them for. Although I do costume some video content on my computer today, I would switch to a high-res 4:3 display instantly.<p>A 27&quot; 4000x3000 display would be a dream come true.')
