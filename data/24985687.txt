I might be misunderstanding it and hopefully they just mean those specific days there was a risk and every other day they didn&#x27;t think there was.<p>But why then would they bother having a level for &quot;LOW means an attack is highly unlikely&quot; if they only flagged risky days? If it weren&#x27;t constantly elevated wouldn&#x27;t they flag the vast majority of dates as &quot;LOW&quot;? I think that no, they are flagging every day as having a terrorist attack &quot;likely&quot;!')
