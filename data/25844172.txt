So why is it ok to use that to insinuate stereotypes and hand-wavy assertions of malfeasance.<p>Perhaps for you there is no consequence, but much like calling the coronavirus the &quot;China virus&quot;, you&#x27;re doing cultural damage by spreading negative stereotypes via fabricated or insinuated purely speculative assertions. The stereotype here is that China is associated with as some dystopian backwards society that has done no favors for its citizenry, which may or may not be true, but is definitely not defended by any objective evidence presented by the OP.<p>To flip the scenario, imagine if some random people from China commented about how the US elections seems like there was rampant fraud, without much supporting evidence. By lending credence to something without any concrete evidence you give it some air of legitimacy. When you do so by purely speculating on non-important things you&#x27;ve entered the realm of purely pushing an agenda with no substance.')
