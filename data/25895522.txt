Item(by='ineptech', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611519711, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25885356, text='&gt; How many examples would I need to provide?<p>I&#x27;m a liberal, living in a very liberal city.  I don&#x27;t need you to tell me what the left thinks.  Believe me, I&#x27;ve heard plenty of politically correct stuff from my side that I think is silly (and presumably you would agree).  This just isn&#x27;t one.  You can go to a collectivist bookstore with BLM posters in the window, where the History section is labeled &quot;Herstory,&quot; and still be wished a Merry Christmas by the person running the register.<p>You&#x27;re welcome to disagree of course but this might be a good time to step back and remember where the goalposts started.  You didn&#x27;t set out thinking this was something you would have to prove with evidence.  You said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s controversial that...&quot; and then a bunch of people said it was.<p>In any event, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s super important; this seems like it is clearly an example of a &#x27;weak man&#x27;, because however strongly the left does or doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s rude to say Merry Christmas, it seems incontrovertible to say that Fox News presented us as believing it somewhat more than we do, and for the reasons discussed in the article.')
