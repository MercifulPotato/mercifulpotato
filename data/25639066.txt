And also not interested in solving the most important problems (as evidenced by the knock on what sounds like a reasonable promotion deal), just the ones they might (or might not, even they don&#x27;t know apparently) be interested in. Sounds elitist as hell and doesn&#x27;t reflect someone who&#x27;s genuinely seeking growth in their career.<p>Which is fine, compared to twitch streamers making millions for doing squats this is still a great career, but if anyone&#x27;s looking at all for constructive criticism then they should introspect how priviliged all this stuff sounds like and whether it&#x27;s healthy for their own development to live in such a bubble for too long.')
