Item(by='jasomill', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608575850, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25491926, text='4.3BSD VAX was distributed on open-reel magnetic tape.<p>The second file of the first tape contained a miniroot filesystem which, at the very least, <i>certainly</i> would have included working copies of of the two utilities <i>mknod</i>(8) and <i>restore</i>(8) required to restore from his <i>dump</i>(8) tapes.<p>As with DOS, Windows, Linux, etc., 4.3 BSD could only mount filesystems stored on random-access block devices (so not sequential-access magtape).<p>Therefore, one of the first steps in &quot;booting from distribution media&quot; was to copy this miniroot filesystem to the swap partition of a formatted and labeled disk, at which point it could be mounted as the root filesystem (with swapping to this partition disabled, obviously).<p>In the (likely) case that the existing disk layout contained a swap partition of sufficient size on a device supported by the boot loaders and kernel supplied by the distribution, this would have indeed been a reasonable road to recovery, and, assuming the existing disk labels remained valid, the required swap space was available, and the <i>dump</i>(8) tapes were good, shouldn&#x27;t have required anything beyond:<p>1. Copying the miniroot from tape to a preexisting swap partition using the standalone <i>copy</i> program included with the distribution media (typically on a console tape or diskette as appropriate for the VAX model in question).<p>2. Booting <i>vmunix</i> from the miniroot in the swap partition, taking care to RTFM and include the special syntax required to prevent swapping to the partition containing the miniroot.<p>3. Recreating required special files with <i>mknod</i>(8) (possibly using the &#x2F;dev&#x2F;MAKEDEV script from the miniroot).<p>4. Using <i>restore</i>(8) to restore from <i>dump</i>(8) tapes as usual.')
