Small suggestion, change the two generic people images - seems all sites use those today and the rest of your site design is so nice you don&#x27;t need to be generic.<p>I use to be in the job board&#x2F;resume space and built a resume reviewer and builder. A few things you might want to add in the future:<p>- Analysis of the current resume to recommend passive vs active works, spelling mistakes (happens all the time), and length (shorter is better). This were big hits with users.\n- Templates of resumes - in the U.S. we don&#x27;t put our picture on the resume, so good to see you have templates that support different country needs.\n- ATS readiness is awesome, but most people don&#x27;t know what that is. I would just describe why important and not go into the ATS details.')
