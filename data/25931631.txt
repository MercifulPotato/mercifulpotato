The perspective change you are talking about is called &quot;a dolly zoom&quot;.  A dolly is a little cart that runs on a track, so the camera can be physically moved in a straight line, in this case moving towards or away from the subject. The change in perspective is caused by this change in distance,  made more noticeable because the zoom lens continually changes focal length to keep the subject the same size. It forces us to see the effect distance has, something our eyes normally tunes out.')
