Charities do it all the time, a subsidiary company runs the charity shops, and gives the profit to the parent charity.  This allows the shops to be run more like a commercial operation, with fewer constraints than a charity is required to follow, then when the money is handed up to the charity those constraints apply to how it is spent or distributed to other charities.')
