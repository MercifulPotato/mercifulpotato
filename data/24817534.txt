I&#x27;m tempted to say Centos 8 Streams is Fedora... but I had a couple packages where it was tricky to get that to work, so currently doing the normal Centos 8 release.  Everything else was Centos, so thus picking that when setting up the XPS.<p>As personal workstation OS, I all my JetBrain (GoLand, IntelliJ) development tools, VMWare Workstation, a mess of databases, and... Steam on my home desktop.  Getting video drivers set to work nicely with proton is really what drives the laptop and I sorted that last year with the AMD cards on my threadripper last year.  (now, it is silly easy, but last December...ye gods)  If I can ever get my hands on a 3080, I assume the driver setup for NVidia will be similar for the 2060 in the laptop.')
