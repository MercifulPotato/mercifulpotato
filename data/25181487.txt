I think that co-worker relationships can get complicated (and deep), with co-founder relationships being a lot more intense.<p>To be fair, there are a lot of other working scenarios, where you can have similar types of relationships, like military duty, police, firefighters, etc.<p>In the US, men can be discouraged from talking about these kinds of relationships, but we have them. They are deep and wide. We often mask them behind bravado.<p>I have a number of friends that are&#x2F;were in the police and fire service in New York. I also had an employee whose sister was killed in the towers during 9&#x2F;11.<p>The firefighters were hit the hardest.
