As we&#x27;re professionals, we use our laptops a lot, so the battery needs to be exchangeable without having to buy a new laptop, so you can restore the same battery life as you had to initially.<p>Now any professional laptop (except the &quot;modern&quot; Apple ones) let you change the battery, if you don&#x27;t want to do 3rd party repairs yourself. But I highly recommend you either change your battery in a repair shop, or get a laptop meant for professionals, ThinkPads are pretty good in that area. And if you do a lot of remote dev, it doesn&#x27;t really matter which one, as long as it has a good WiFi card so remote latency&#x2F;jitter gets as low as possible.')
