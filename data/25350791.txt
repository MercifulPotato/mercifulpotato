If the cost of computation for a required sound quality is lower than the difference in driver cost, then computation will win, especially when it adds additional value unavailable to the non-computational approach. Positioning the computation at the device is advantageous since it allows for a simpler data interface. For example, adjustments to the soundstage based on head movement can be performed on-device instead of making a round trip to source for the adjustment.<p><i>In ear headphones aren&#x27;t going to have enough battery to power a cellular modem.</i><p>Sure, and when the first iPod was released it lacked wireless networking and was storage constrained compared to comparably priced products. I can appreciate the pragmatism and be appreciate folks working towards an exciting future.<p>Pardon me for departing, my kid wants to watch the SN8 livestream together; hope you enjoy some high quality Soyuz laserdisks.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;23&#x2F;1816257&#x2F;Apple-releases-iPod" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slashdot.org&#x2F;story&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;23&#x2F;1816257&#x2F;Apple-releases-i...</a>')
