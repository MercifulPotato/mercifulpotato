Where do your reparations end? Are you going to forcefully take money from me because African Americans were enslaved generations ago, but then forcefully have money taken from them for the other Africans and other races they themselves enslaved in Africa before that? Where does it end?<p>Do you honestly think that forcefully stealing money from someone at the threat of imprisonment if they don&#x27;t pay is really going to fly? Do you think putting a gun to my head and taking money from me really makes sense when my ancestors emigrated here only a couple generations ago? How do you foresee this working? How do you foresee this helping anything?<p>Of course my language is extreme, but that&#x27;s what taxes and similar payments are. It&#x27;s backed by the force of the government and if I don&#x27;t pay, eventually someone with a gun will come to put me in prison, and if I refuse, that gun will be pointed at me.')
