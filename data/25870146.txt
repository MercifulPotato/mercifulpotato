They could subsidize them, they could lower their taxes, they could even substantially raise Google and Facebook&#x27;s taxes (ideally without directly naming them in the law). But telling two (foreign!) companies &quot;you have to pay these people, because you&#x27;ve outcompeted them&quot; is just not how this is done. I don&#x27;t see what made them choose this unprecedentedly direct and confrontational option.')
