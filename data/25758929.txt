You don&#x27;t know how &quot;toxic&quot; people really are. Some of them are nice, but just put no time&#x2F;understanding into their internet communication. They write and forgot what they wrote a minute later.<p>2. If they really need to learn something, talking to them politely &quot;Thanks for the suggestion but...&quot;, &quot;Could you please...&quot; etc. will help over time. Not doing something in the fear of rewarding their behaviour is way too complex to understand.')
