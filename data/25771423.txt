For instance two people &quot;on the same side&quot; have a lovers quarrel. One of them deplatforms the other. Another example: some official takes a bribe, and when the press realizes they are censored. Third: Some company has a competitor, and gets them censored for purely monetary reasons.<p>Another aspect where censorship creates issues is that every idea starts as fringe before growing mainstream. If they are censored it creates ideological stagnation.<p>A third is that true but &quot;dangeroues&quot; ideas, can have important implications. And those implications may be ideas beneficial to everyone. But since the dangerous idea is censored, no one will figure the implications out, and the benefits are not realized. For instance, let&#x27;s say there was election fraud, but the censors &quot;bet on the wrong horse&quot; (nothing is certain, at some point you have to say it&#x27;s &gt;95% certain so we will <i>treat</i> it as true) and censor such claims. Then they may miss opportunities to make elections fairer in the future.')
