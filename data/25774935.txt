There is no two-photon vertex, that’s true, since there is no fundamental interaction between two photons. But put four photon&#x2F;charged particle vertices together and you’ll get the 4-photon box diagram [1], whose contribution is nonzero.<p>[1]: Since I’m not good at painting diagrams in ASCII on HN, here’s a link to the Wikipedia article with the box rendered nicely: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Two-photon_physics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Two-photon_physics</a>')
