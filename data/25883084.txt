Furthermore, they generate virtually no waste. Ink comes in a recyclable bottle and it&#x27;s water-based, so the paper I write in can be easily recycled without aggressive solvents. The pen itself can easily last a whole lifetime.<p>If maintenance becomes bothersome, maybe you should look into good converters and simple water-based inks. You can easily use a fountain pen like this during many months before you need to go through one cleaning cycle. For cleaning, you can buy some special cleaning agents which you can use just like ink.<p>Some other pen setups like vintage piston fillers and saturated inks can be high maintenance. It makes a big difference to choose a simple ink and a simple pen. The latter can be as easy to use as a rollerball.')
