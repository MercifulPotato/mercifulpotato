I don’t share the link with anyone and thus don’t infringe on the copyright by redistributing the content publicly.<p>Now someone else buys the same DVD, rips it the same way and ends up with the exact same file (so their link actually points to <i>my</i> file because of deduplication), however they then decide to infringe on the copyright by distributing the link publicly.<p><i>Their</i> link should indeed be disabled, but the original file should stay (with its other links) as there is no way to tell whether those other links are used legitimately.')
