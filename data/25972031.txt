In the jQuery example you have to get really specific, because just talking about the <i>best</i> can be pretty vague. There are many examples of <i>best</i> where merely pointing to the popularity of jQuery is a logical fallacy, and perhaps some where it isn’t (e.g. the breadth of documentation making development easier). This is really a different class of problem to something more abstract such as the belief in alien civilisations, where the fallacy is more clear cut.<p>The currency example is a slightly different case though, because it’s the belief in the currency itself that <i>creates</i> the currency. So the statement <i>everyone should replace their USD with Bitcoin</i> is undermined by the overwhelming depth and breadth of belief in USD (misplaced or not). So I don’t think it counts as a logical fallacy, because it goes beyond merely trying to leverage the majority opinion on the subject; the beliefs themselves are absolutely instrumental in driving the relative utility of USD and Bitcoin.')
