Hyperinsulinemia is not really well researched in &quot;normal&quot; population, because measurement of insulin in blood is not trivial; there are no simple devices similar to glucometers that could easily and affordably measure your current insulin level.<p>Eating a modern diet laced with hidden sugar is a surefire way to increase your total insulin level.<p>It is not as if a healthy pancreas has a choice. It automatically releases insulin as a response to certain stimuli, including sugar, but also interestingly protein. Only pure fat is &quot;invisible&quot; to pancreas AFAIK.')
