If you &quot;make it&quot; (or, alternatively, until you &quot;fail&quot; and drop out) you&#x27;ll spend most of your time working on problems that you are truly passionate about. The kind of problems that you can&#x27;t stop grinding over in the back of your head anyway. You get peace and quiet and a paycheck to sit and work on those all day. To me, doing this for life is an absolute dream!! Maybe a student two help you out. And then you get to travel the world and speak to other people who are equally passionate about this or similar problems.<p>Yes there&#x27;s teaching too. But unless you hate that, it&#x27;s not a big downside. I for one enjoyed it. I&#x27;ve heard horror stories of the american teaching burden though, so maybe it&#x27;s different if there&#x27;s too much of it. And yes there&#x27;s grant application pressure. Maybe I speak from too European a perspective, but I absolutely loved almost every week (every day would be an overstatement) of my 4 years as a postdoc. Every day I miss it.<p>But the instability was killing me. I had the kindest most wonderful boss who shielded me from most of it, and in the end gave me 4 years of peace and quiet, and would have helped me go anywhere next. But I couldn&#x27;t take the repeated uprooting. I wasn&#x27;t good enough for a permanent position yet, or rather - not good enough for one in a place I could possibly imagine living - and forced uprootings crush my mental state.<p>So I gave up.<p>I don&#x27;t wanna sound bitter.  Hats off to those who make it. Truly! But the system has become so selective for a few &quot;types&quot; that I worry about its health:<p>- Incredibly bright people. This is obviously good.<p>- Incredibly hard working people. This is good, to a point. Not if the norm becomes giving up your life.<p>- People who&#x27;ll accept any terms. Not good, this is a slow march towards serfdom.<p>- People who are fine with complete instability. I think academia is missing out on a lot by selecting for these.<p>Rant over  :-(')
