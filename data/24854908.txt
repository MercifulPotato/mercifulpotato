The spooks like to extort by threatening to reveal crimes, or prosecute them. Ever heard of plea bargaining? Most often the promise of &quot;reduced&quot; charges is exchanged for participating in surveillance, yielding more victims and more pigeons. Spies like to get other kinds of cooperation, for other kinds of threats--including revealing that you already caved once. Some people have enemies who would act on revelations. Most people have relatives who wouldn&#x27;t want them harmed. Judges have relatives. Ever wondered at Judges blatantly violating settled law? It is not always just because they felt like it. Since surveillance always involves official secrecy, it is easily and widely abused, and abuse is never, ever prosecuted.<p>Do you wonder why politicians stay exactly in line, these days? Think they just don&#x27;t have any ambition, no independence, no cojones?<p>We already have a surveillance system in place that the STASI could only have ever dreamed of.')
