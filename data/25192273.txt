For why China was so poor, and had to dig themselves out of a hole in the ground?<p>After all, the criminal British Empire made their fortunes, by shoving opium down the throats of the Chinese for 100 freaking years!<p>And then Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who never had a job his entire life, and just one day became the American president, well, where did his family get their money from?  Yes, that’s right. Opium. The Delano’s were also the biggest American drug smugglers during the opium era. And yes, when the Americans were talking about trading success with the Asians, they were specifically referring to opium, but they were too ashamed to admit it.<p>The Chinese opium era was the greatest theft, and the greatest transfer of wealth in human history!<p>Google it man. Educate yourself about the sins of the British and American empires.<p>At least after the CPC and Mao came into power in China, they finally eliminated the opium scourge, and kicked out the British dickheads from their country (except for Hong Kong).')
