Raymond, the people who <i>invented Free Software and Open Source</i>, all specifically said, at the very creation of the god damn licenses, that this would happen, and was perfectly fine. They specifically wrote their licenses to allow this. It&#x27;s not an accident or exploitation, it&#x27;s a fundamental part of what they exist to serve, which is the <i>user&#x27;s</i> rights.<p>The Open Source Initiative, Debian, and Fedora, have all <i>banned</i> licenses like SSPI which exist solely to punish cloud service providers. If that&#x27;s not the open source spirit telling you where you can stick it, I don&#x27;t know what is.<p><i>You</i> are trying to twist things here. If the people who invented the thing said this is to be expected, then it&#x27;s part of the spirit.')
