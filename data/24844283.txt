But the majority of problems I have encountered have not been technically difficult. Once you create an application with a sound system design, all the other technical stuff isn&#x27;t really a challenge.<p>Majority of the issues are caused by requirements not being communicated, captured, or implemented properly. That&#x27;s something that&#x27;s not really focused on tech interviews. I just want a diligent developer who can identify potential issues, do their research, and propose solutions rather than be able to design a system in 90 minutes, because that&#x27;s never happening in real life. In fact, I&#x27;d not hire someone who can claim to do so.')
