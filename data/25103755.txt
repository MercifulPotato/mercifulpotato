It&#x27;s just there is no infrastructure (cold storage, sterile needles, medical documentation&#x2F;identity) in place to administer it.<p>The new vaccines you mention are even more delicate than the existing one, so would not be helpful.<p>The current vaccine (the bad one) needs nothing more than a backpack and a marker (to mark those who were vaccinated). There is research to develop a new, temperature stable, vaccine that can not mutate. But so far no success.')
