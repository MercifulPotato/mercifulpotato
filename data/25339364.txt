Near the end, I was wanting to pivot from utility to &#x27;replace your current phone service&#x27; and providing data makes it incredibly expensive when compared to other providers due to not having the volume to get reduced pricing.<p>If I had to do it right, I would get VC and become an MVNO and position it as a 21st-century phone company (&quot;Why can&#x27;t I text on my computer?&quot;, &quot;why can&#x27;t I have multiple numbers&quot;, etc).')
