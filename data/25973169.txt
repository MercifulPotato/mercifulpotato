It was only when saving that the text box would have the wrong characters. Late last Saturday night, I had edited the `editorcmd` to be<p><pre><code>    gvim -c &quot;set filetype=markdown fileencoding=latin1&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAt that stage, I hadn’t discovered the use of `x ++enc=utf-8` to resolve the issue and gave up at that stage (I thought I had reset the `editorcmd` but must have forgot). Anyhow, with the new native messenger, I don’t need  to mess with specifying character sets and I’ve now set the Tridactyl `editorcmd` to the simpler:<p><pre><code>    gvim -c &quot;set filetype=markdown&quot;\n</code></pre>\nNow GVIm opens with UTF-8 as both the “encoding” and “fileencoding” so I can exit it as usual with a simple `:x` and the text-box updates correctly.<p>Thanks again (your help with this prompted me to become a sponsor).')
