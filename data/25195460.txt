Its IDE features are driven by language servers, and most are written by third-parties, and some of them are great and some of them are terrible. TypeScript and Rust (if you&#x27;re using rust-analyzer) are stellar. Python is okay. Flow (an alternate JavaScript type system) was terrible last time I checked, spinning the CPU and freezing up like you describe. Language servers run as a separate process (Code Helper, I believe) and can be as inefficient&#x2F;leaky&#x2F;resource-hungry as they want to be.')
