Item(by='donmcronald', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610927733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25806169, text='&gt; Are you implying that the list no longer has a good intention?<p>Most of the time I run into blocked sites they seem to be blocked because of copyright infringement, not phishing.  The only phishing sites I&#x27;ve seen in the last year or so are custom tailored.  For example, I had to deal with a compromised MS365 account last year where the bad actor spun up a custom phishing site using the logo, signature, etc. of the victim.<p>So IMHO the intentions are no longer pure plus the effect is diminished and being worked around.')
