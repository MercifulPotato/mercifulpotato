(Can even legally have a case against a dead person?) This <i>requires</i> thinks to have been illegal when done.<p>- Requiring that (likely dead) person to pay a fine based on <i>existing</i> law.<p>- Arguing that whoever accepted an inheritance did inherit the fine, too.<p>But as far as I know every point of this list has many legally questionable aspects.<p>But what you MUST NOT do under any circumstances in a state of law is to not base judgement on law but arbitrary &quot;I feel like this should be done&quot; arguments. This is also why it&#x27;s of upmost importance to fast adapt laws make them general instead of specific and not put any loop holes in them. Because then you can judge people to some degree even if they do something bad even if that specific think wasn&#x27;t explicitly forbidden. (E.g. based on a generic law which makes any form of causing environmental damage in a context where it&#x27;s reasonable to assume it the person should have been aware illegal. Sure you need some threshold, too. Else driving your care is illegal.)')
