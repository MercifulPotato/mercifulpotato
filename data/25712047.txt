It is rape every time.<p>Male cats develop barbs on their penii after about 5-6 months. Female cats don’t ovulate before copulation. It is painful every time and the female cat can’t escape the male cat who detects her estrus. When a female cat is in heat, she can ovulate as many times as a male copulates with her which is why a single litter can be fathered by more than one tomcat.<p>Why cats evolved this way in nature, we don’t know..but rape is not uncommon at all in the animal kingdom. Nature is brutal.')
