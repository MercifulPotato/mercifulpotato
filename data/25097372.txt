So basically I would guess NUMA and programming models that take it into account is the future.<p>And maybe software management of CPU cache.<p>I think wanting fast, flat, and big is sort of like wanting the CAP theorem to go away... &quot;it sure would be great&quot; if we could have an infinitely scalable SQL database without any programming model changes.<p>In other words, no matter how &quot;fast&quot; a memory becomes, someone&#x27;s going to want it &quot;bigger&quot;, which makes things slower.')
