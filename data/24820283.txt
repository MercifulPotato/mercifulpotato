Most of the time, facts are uninteresting and therefore not prone to gain a lot of viewers — at least not when there is competing “news” that is more about being interesting than factual.<p>In other words, I no longer trust viewership and&#x2F;or ad-driven “news”. Which pretty much means almost all news of all forms, including TV, web-based, and social media.')
