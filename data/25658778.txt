Literally, Death!, closest we have in English: Shut up!<p>2) Khabare margesh! Literally, the news of his&#x2F;her death! This is used with someone you don&#x27;t like, as in, you&#x27;re only interested in the news of that persons death (perhaps a politician is a typical example).<p>3) Boro bemir! Literally, Go die! Again, in English, the equivalent is along the lines of Shut Up!<p>4) Che margeshe? Literally, what&#x27;s his death? Used mostly for objects, such as when your car won&#x27;t start.<p>5) Marge man, literally, my death. Used when you are swearing you are telling the truth.<p>Iranians have so many idioms&#x2F;expressions&#x2F;figures-of-speech related to Death, this is just a small sample.')
