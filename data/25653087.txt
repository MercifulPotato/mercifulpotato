It is not even the same case as with songs and movies where the actual creator may arguibly lose “something”, but the author here doesn’t even get compensation from his&#x2F;her work based on journal sells. The only thing scihub does is not give additional profit to journals, while greatly enhancing the life of many many people partly those that produce the actual value as well (even those who would otherwise have access because university vpns suck), and morally the latter is the good thing to do.')
