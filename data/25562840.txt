For example, I enjoy painting and weightlifting as well as programming, and can list several places I enjoy going to discuss and share stuff related to those topics.<p>In my eyes, the issue with modern internet communities is that there are too many people there &quot;just for the sake of it&quot;. I find that communities focused on a specific thing don&#x27;t suffer from the repetitive and bland drivel that fills the front pages of most discussion websites.<p>Due to the nature of this advice, I won&#x27;t just list a bunch of forums and discussion boards I look at and post on. I&#x27;d recommend you search for places based on your interests.')
