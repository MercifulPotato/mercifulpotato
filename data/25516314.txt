There are a LOT of scams on Amazon and to succeed in the marketplace many brands have to be willing to do some shady things (buying reviews, swapping listings, etc).<p>At a small scale these scams are probably not worth it for law enforcement to worry about. But if a hundred brands are rolled up into a conglomerate, there&#x27;s going to be a lot of scams under one roof.')
