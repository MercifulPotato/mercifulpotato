I haven&#x27;t spent much time in Poland, but I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of time in the baltic states and systemic racism absolutely is a problem there. It&#x27;s just (mostly) against Jews and Roma rather than black people. I fully expect this is the case in Poland too.<p>EDIT: yes,as I thought.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Racism_in_Poland" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Racism_in_Poland</a><p>In a way, it&#x27;s even worse: because America sets the tone of discourse and frames racism as white vs black, Polish and other Eastern European cultures feel justified in claiming they don&#x27;t have any systemic racism, when in fact it&#x27;s there, just not against black people.<p>I recognize this in my own country (Ireland) where people will so proudly declare we are not racist because we treat black and Indian immigrants well by comparison to the US. However, Irish culture has deep systemic racism rowards the Traveller minority. Getting most Irish people to admit this is basically impossible though, and I expect it&#x27;s the same for racism towards Jews and Roma in Poland.')
