Even if I&#x27;m to agree with the purpose of the requested change, does it justify the means by which it&#x27;s being procured?<p>Trump may have screwed it up even more, but sanctions of the second kind have been introduced on countries like Iran or Syria since the mid-80s afaik. No major change happened, but the idea of knowingly use the population of another country to pressure their government which is known to not be chosen democratically is basically a form of hostage situation, and is immoral imho.')
