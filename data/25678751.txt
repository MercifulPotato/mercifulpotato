Hence replacing fossil sources by nuclear would entail large-scale construction of new nuclear reactors. By the time we&#x27;re done building these, we will already have exceeded our CO₂ budget for keeping below 1.5 °C at a reasonable certainty.<p>Also, at the current rate, the Uranium reserves last for approximately 140 years; if all fossil sources were switched for nuclear, it would last for 10 years. This problem can in principle be alleviated by innovative reactor types, but realistically they won&#x27;t be available for large-scale production in the next couple years.<p>Luckily, we do have all the technology for phasing out fossil energy while staying within our CO₂ budget: water, wind, solar, storage of synthetic gas, gas-fueled power plants (fueled by synthetic gas obtained using renewable energy). Energy production with these alternatives is cheaper than with nuclear; this fact is an additional issue for expanding nuclear power -- it&#x27;s not economically viable.')
