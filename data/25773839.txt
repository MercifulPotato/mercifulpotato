A good chunk of the population would probably be OK with them only selling weed, but then you have stolen credit cards, weapons, and what not. And the more unscrupulous the seller is&#x2F;becomes, the worse it gets.<p>It&#x27;s like with small-town drug dealers. Kids seek them to purchase weed, but then after a while the dealer is trying to push other stuff on them.<p>If anything, the world needs to legalize a lot of drugs, properly regulate them. Keeping things illegal will only result in all things illegal being centralized, and more available to those seeking those markets.')
