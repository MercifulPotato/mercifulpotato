I think the input&#x2F;output curve of my red perception is non-linear compared to normal colour vision, and while on a lot of that scale it is a deficiency, in some situations, I have improved sensitivity.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;d trade in a heartbeat, so I could see bloody charging LEDs properly.')
