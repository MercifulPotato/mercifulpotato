What is the big banks target price and what is retails target price?<p>Over on WSB they&#x27;re going nuts claiming that 5k isn&#x27;t a meme.<p>The banks aren&#x27;t holding until then. If they decide to offload at, say, 600, then retail will be left with the bag since the bank selloff will drop the price down dramatically.<p>That&#x27;s the claim as I&#x27;ve seen it made on the &#x2F;r&#x2F;stocks subreddit.<p>I have a lot of shares. In at $17. I&#x27;m not sure what to think. I&#x27;ve already taken out 5x my initial investment. I&#x27;ve been doing as much research as I can to determine how high this could go, partially for my own benefit, but I also want to &quot;hold the line.&quot;<p>Who knows what would have happened had RobinHood and others not shut down buying. I&#x27;m pretty sure I would have retired.')
