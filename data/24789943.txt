You got ORNL (with Summit and soon Frontier)[0], ANL[1] (soon to have Aurora), and LLNL[2]. I think what needs to happen is that things could be better organized, for example ORNL has [3] which still open sourced but not grouped under the ORNL GH. Also if we got to code.gov and search &quot;ORNL&quot; and &quot;C++&quot; we only see DCA++ which isn&#x27;t on the GH but here[4].<p>I think as long as code isn&#x27;t sensitive to national security (LLNL...) it should be open source. But I think the big problem is that organization and discovery is very difficult. code.gov is an attempt to solve this, but it doesn&#x27;t do it well.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ORNL" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ORNL</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;argonne-national-laboratory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;argonne-national-laboratory</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LLNL" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LLNL</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ornladios&#x2F;ADIOS2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ornladios&#x2F;ADIOS2</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CompFUSE&#x2F;DCA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CompFUSE&#x2F;DCA</a>')
