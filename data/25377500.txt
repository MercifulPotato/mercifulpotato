I wouldn&#x27;t try a career switch like that without having a community of people that will help me, like in a new job or as part of a bigger project, or at least four years of runway.<p>If you become even a mediocre game developer-promoter in 10 months I&#x27;d say you are really gifted or got really lucky and got all the opportunities to learn fast.
