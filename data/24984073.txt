Sun wanted to be internet servers (along with workstations); SGI wanted to be render farms along with workstations.  But internet servers were a lot bigger market than render farms.  Which left SGI with the workstation business.<p>I remember that some guy at SGI wrote an article titled &quot;Pecked to death by ducks&quot;, that argued that SGI would never be done in by commodity hardware - that commodity hardware wasn&#x27;t powerful enough, so it would be as absurd as being pecked to death by ducks.  Then dual CPU machines came out, and so he wrote a sequel:  &quot;Pecked to death by ducks with two bills&quot;.<p>In the end, though, SGI got pecked to death by 700-pound, 15-foot-tall ducks - the commodity hardware got better faster than SGI&#x27;s did.<p>But in the mid-to-late 90s, I <i>loved</i> SGI machines.  Not by 2005, maybe, but in their day, they were great.')
