Item(by='alok-g', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605881792, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25145904, text='&gt;&gt; If an error is detected - a mismatch (e.g. a G paired with a T) - a trio of proteins (MutL, MutS, MutH) spring into action.<p>One additional thing should be covered in biology teaching -- Not just the process that magically &quot;happens&quot;, but how it ends up happening.  The said proteins have no free will to just spring into action.  I recall being taught during high school about mitosis and meiosis, how this spindle apparatus forms, DNA strands split, etc.  How do I connect what happens to the laws of Physics?  I understand that I still cannot explain gravity, or why a ball falls to the floor, but biology teaching seems to leave a lot more out, and without saying so.')
