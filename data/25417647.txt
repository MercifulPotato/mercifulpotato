In life there are many self-imposed halo effects on the people you love. I believe this is one of them. Honestly I&#x27;ve had too many deep stare-downs in the world of addiction, sickness, and loneliness - I choose to forget many of them. There has been a Molly (though we never married) in my past, too. But 20+ years forward the effect she had on me has eroded and left behind a truth of who she really was that&#x27;s raw and unforgiving. But I want to remember the &quot;Molly&quot; of my life that was fun and carefree. And maybe I&#x27;m casting my own experiences here on the author, most likely I am. Things like this are hard to put into words.')
