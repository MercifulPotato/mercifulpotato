Ubuntu works.  What I&#x27;ve not found yet is a source for Centos.  I&#x27;ve found a couple open source projects, and a few beer money entries on the Microsoft store - but nothing I&#x27;d consider a good source yet.  Still trying to figure out if I need to package up Centos or make some random msi work.<p>The irony is I&#x27;ve spent more time mucking with this than doing a native Centos 8 install on the same hardware.')
