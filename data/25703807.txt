I saw in the change log that you support IPv6, make it more prominent in the front page as well. (maybe add IPv6 support to pingr.io as well)<p>2. Your pricing is what I was looking for, per request and per location. but the fixed charge thing is what holding me back. maybe a prepaid option would be better. eg: a person adds $10 credit to the account and uses it at pay as you go pricing.')
