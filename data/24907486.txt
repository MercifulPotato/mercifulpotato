I was wearing two masks duct taped to my face and the paramedic was wearing one of those white bunny costumes where I could only see his eyes.<p>He strapped me in, and took my pulse and then placed his hand on my shoulder, which I thought was really unnecessary,  because I was strapped pretty good to the bed, then I realized he touched my shoulder to calm me down, not to secure me from falls :)')
