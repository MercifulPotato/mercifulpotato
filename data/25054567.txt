Too little iodide and the thyroid can&#x27;t synthesize enough hormones critical for early development. Too <i>much</i> iodide and the thyroid <i>won&#x27;t</i> synthesize enough hormones critical for early development.<p>It took me forever to find an iodide supplement for my pregnant wife and children that was at least nominally safe. The typical pills at the health store and Amazon supplied too much by several orders of magnitude! Iodide intake should normally be on the order of 100s of micrograms per day, but the typical supplement pill is 10s of milligrams.<p>Only <i>after</i> my children were born did the major prenatal vitamin companies (e.g. Nature Made) begin adding iodide. It wasn&#x27;t a recommended supplement because until some recent studies everybody assumed table salt fortification was sufficient. But most salt intake these days is from processed foods, which isn&#x27;t fortified with iodide. People who &quot;eat healthy&quot; also tend to avoid salt, and cruciferous vegetables inhibit iodide uptake. So iodide intake has dropped in some developed countries, such as the U.S.<p>Ironically, iodide is up there with things like folic acid and iron in terms of clearly proven benefit, although the benefit is less apparent. There&#x27;s some debate around the best levels[1], but that&#x27;s typical of these things. It really sucked that I had to resort to some dubious supplement provider[2], but I figured it was worth it. I ended up finding a tablet at Whole Foods that claimed to provide 250mcg from processed seaweed.<p>[1] IIRC, average intake among some Japanese populations nears or <i>exceeds</i> the USDA safe maximum dose, without any known detrimental side effects--e.g. no IQ deficits.<p>[2] I prefer something certified by, e.g., USP, which provides some minimal assurance regarding dosage consistency and contamination. Better than nothing, especially given the regular consistency and contamination problems in the supplement industry, as well as the food industry in general.')
