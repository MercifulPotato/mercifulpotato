Something bad happens every day, the sums are crazy (75 for a cellphone bill?), basically it&#x27;s too much.<p>I&#x27;ve been poor. You have good as well as bad days. I remember the day I won £75 with £1 on a fruit machine. I also remember the days I&#x27;d put £10 in and get nothing. I remember the unexpected bill but they weren&#x27;t every day, they would be every 6 months so you hadn&#x27;t accounted for them.<p>It would be more realistic if it allowed those little moments of triumph, only to snatch it away later.')
