People are susceptible to advertising but we aren&#x27;t <i>that</i> susceptible.<p>I bet the author is very concerned about &quot;internet radicalization&quot;.  I bet he&#x27;s so concerned that he began to feel the stirrings of his own radicalization while pretending to support Trump on the internet.  The article is a fantasy brought on by what the author expected to feel.<p>All respect, but if you didn&#x27;t find the part of the article you quoted funny, your bullshit barometer needs to be recalibrated.')
