There is no visible progress towards a viable MMO or indeed of server instances supporting more than ~30 concurrent players without breaking in bizarre ways.<p>&gt;If CIG folds after a decade, that&#x27;s not a scam... that&#x27;s just a mismanaged studio<p>It became obvious years ago to anyone but the wilfully ignorant that CIG are incapable of delivering, and to continue to take people&#x27;s money in this circumstance is indefensible. If they cannot deliver they should gracefully admit it and refund backers and investors as much as possible. Instead they continue to pump out new ship models while making no progress towards core tech required to actually deliver something resembling the game they promised.<p>&gt;CIG has delivered a product. You can judge whether it is a good product, but they have delivered and continue to deliver.<p>That is the problem - they continue to deliver eye candy to attract new victims, but nothing of substance. Star Citizen is vapourware with just enough bait to keep luring gullible whales into dropping cash on ship models.')
