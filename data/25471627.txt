Right off the bat, if you figure there&#x27;s a 1% chance you die if you get it and a 20% change you get it, that values a life at $12.5M. That&#x27;s a little on the low side for someone rich, but not not by that much.<p>You also have to factor in that it&#x27;s free in 6 months, and for at least 3 months, it&#x27;s not like you can do anything. The drug is also experimental, so there&#x27;s an off chance something really bad happens. The vaccine also means you won&#x27;t be a long hauler, so that adds some value.<p>$25k feels about right.')
