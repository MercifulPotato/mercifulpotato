It’s viewed a little differently from most other ex-pats because these are the people who have the money and power to dramatically influence  the government, so if they’re running from something here in the US, it’s either “their” (by that I mean billionaires in general) fault for pushing the government in the wrong direction, or within “their” power to fix.<p>For example, if mass civil unrest breaks out in the US as a result of the recent election, Eric Schmidt can flee to his estate in Cyprus and ignore the fact that he owned a social network (Youtube) that knowingly hosted radical content and disinformation which would have (in part) caused the civil unrest he’s fleeing from.<p>Whether or not that’s his intention, it doesn’t matter. True or not, what people are seeing is billionaires knowingly destabilizing the country in order to make a lot of money, then using that money to protect themselves against the country they just damaged.<p>That very thing happened earlier this year at the start of the pandemic, SV billionaires fled the country to go to a private island in New Zealand, while their employees suffered and died back here in the US: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;coronavirus-underground-bunker-new-zealand-us-death-toll-latest-a9476931.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;coronaviru...</a>')
