As an 11-year-old boy, who&#x27;d never seen a computer before, I was more interested in the TV... I&#x27;ve often thought what my life would be like if my parents <i>hadn&#x27;t</i> bought me a computer back then. It&#x27;s had that much impact on my life...<p>[aside: story of how my parents got tired of me just using the TV]<p>About 3 months after xmas, I still hadn&#x27;t soldered everything together. My parents laid down the law, so I eventually went into the garage and started soldering away. I took my telly with me :) Once it was all together (which wasn&#x27;t really that hard) I had it plugged in and working, and I was going through the instructions to make sure it was done correctly... Then I proudly walked into the house and everyone gathered around the living room TV (the only other one in the house...) I plugged it all together and up came the boot screen.<p>Following the instructions, I typed in<p>PRINT 1 + 1 = 2   [return]<p>... and the computer printed &#x27;1&#x27;<p>At which point my father turned to me, and said &quot;I knew something was up. You&#x27;ve buggered it&quot;, and walked out the room. It took a <i>long</i> time to get across the concept of logical true as 1 and logical false as 0...<p>[&#x2F;aside]<p>Once that episode was done, though, computers took over my life, I graduated to the Atari XL (which Dixons sold for Â£129 with a disk drive) a few years later - it was supposed to be a shared computer between myself and my brother for another xmas present, but basically he never got a look in. I became the &#x27;computer room prefect&#x27; at school when I got to the sixth form, I was obsessed.<p>When I went to college, I used my student grant to finance an Atari ST, and I&#x27;m convinced that my lab grades were better because of the beautiful DTP reports I came up with, when everyone else was on 80-character daisywheel printed text.<p>I used to regularly write code in GFA Basic, and then graduated to C, learnt unix and used my ST as a terminal, then wrote the MDK (a unix-like distribution like Slackware for the ST)[1]. I fell in love with unix at college and have never used anything else since. When linux came on a boot disk and a root disk (yes, floppies), that was when I started using it :)<p>Time passes, and until very recently I was in R&amp;D at Apple. Everything from verilog for FPGA&#x27;s, kernel drivers, PCIe bus drivers, system frameworks, app frameworks, and even full-blown applications. One project I worked on, I had to produce an operating system for something that didn&#x27;t have a central CPU. That took me two years, but it was a lot of fun, and I believe will have enormous impact when it finally sees the light of day :)<p>I&#x27;ve been immensely fortunate in that computers (my hobby for the last 40 years or so, my degree was in Physics, but generally physicists consider themselves jacks of all trades. Pretty much everything deals with energy at some point...) are also my day job. Sometimes it&#x27;s had its down-sides, but mainly it&#x27;s been a blast :)<p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;umich.edu&#x2F;~archive&#x2F;atari&#x2F;Mint&#x2F;Distrib_kit&#x2F;Doc&#x2F;readme.1st" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;umich.edu&#x2F;~archive&#x2F;atari&#x2F;Mint&#x2F;Distrib_kit&#x2F;Doc&#x2F;readme....</a>')
