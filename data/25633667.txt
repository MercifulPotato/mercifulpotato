You can test seat belts with crash dummies. It&#x27;s a clear experiment, and yes, people should have been skeptical of seat belts until they were proven to be effective. Auto companies were pushing against seat-belts and safety. Today big industry is pushing for lockdowns (and we should question those motives).<p>It&#x27;s a bad argument. There are literally thousands of people in the Great Barrington Declaration, who have sound arguments for ending lockdowns. We can literally look at the numbers across the globe from different policies in different countries and see there is no direct correlational between any government action and fatalities. Correlation isn&#x27;t causation, but we DO NOT even have correlation!<p>Scientists and doctors are saying we need to end this mass hysteria. We should listen to all the experts, not only the ones we agree with.')
