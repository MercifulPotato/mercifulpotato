Romaji is meant squarely at people who can&#x27;t and don&#x27;t intend to read Japanese, and for them &quot;chi&quot; is much closer to &#x2F;ʧi&#x2F; than Kunrei&#x27;s &quot;ti&quot;, even though it violates the symmetry of the た行 and thus obscures some verb conjugations the casual reader won&#x27;t care about.<p>As for pitch accents, Japanese is only very weakly tonal and what tone there exists is regional to boot, so nobody is going to get confused if you order <i>nihon</i> of beer with the wrong tone.  (This is manifestly not the case for, say, Chinese.)')
