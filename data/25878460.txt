Launches were expensive, so you designed your spacecraft very thoroughly for many years before sending it up.  If launches have become cheap, in part due to iterative design processes and letting oneself fail, then the same techniques can be applied to orbiting bodies.  Launch a bunch of cheap inflatable labs, test them in real (out of) world conditions, and iterate towards a final design faster')
