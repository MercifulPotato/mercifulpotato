And you don&#x27;t need Optane SSDs; people do better than that with cheap NVMe JBODs like you get on EC2. Also, something is only &quot;I&#x2F;O bound&quot; if it is literally running at the theoretical limits of the storage hardware. And even that doesn&#x27;t imply another database couldn&#x27;t drive much more workload with the same theoretical bandwidth; many popular databases employ architectures that unnecessarily burn storage bandwidth.<p>It is pretty rare for these days for a modern database engine to be I&#x2F;O bound in a storage sense, even with cheap solid-state storage. Certainly not for fast-twitch query workloads. For most data models and workloads, the bottleneck is either memory or network bandwidth if you are doing everything else right.<p>MySQL isn&#x27;t typically held up as a paragon of query performance. It is solidly middle of the road. It is part of a generation of architectures that can&#x27;t get anywhere close to current high-performance architectures. Every database architecture suffers this fate as they get older.')
