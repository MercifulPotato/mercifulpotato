Some of these choices, while seemingly innocent and benign, can affect other people and make their lives not worth living (as mine has become). Lack of of an malevolent intent may not always be an indicator for punishment of criminal acts. Negative societal effects, victims&#x27; personal tragedies, and other stuff must be considered for determination of punishment.<p>That said, there are some that have been swept up by the legal system that may not have received an appropriate punishment in moral terms. But I have no solution to this mess that lies at the intersection of legal, societal, moral, and ethical domains.')
