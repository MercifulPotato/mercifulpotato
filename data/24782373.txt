It&#x27;s primarily meant as a video player but it works well for music too and even as an image viewer (alternative to &#x27;feh&#x27;)  There is a pretty active community of people writing scripts for mpv (Lua or JS) and it&#x27;s generally really nice for users with a hacker ethos.  I consider it the Emacs of multimedia.<p>(I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for casual users, I tell family members to use VLC.)')
