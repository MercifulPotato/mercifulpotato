Item(by='lukeschlather', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607176134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25313679, text='The problem with student loans is that they are rooted in &quot;need-based&quot; formulas which define how much a student should pay in terms of their parents&#x27; wealth. And for upper-class students the gap between what their parents are willing to pay and what the formula says they can pay often is substantial and is made up with loans. This ends up being something resembling a real hardship for upper-middle-class families, since tuition for two kids can easily be 50% of your household income. If someone is paying off a mortgage on a house, it&#x27;s easy to imagine their only option to pay the tuition without loans is to downsize the house, which is a huge investment of time and money on top of getting a child ready for college.')
