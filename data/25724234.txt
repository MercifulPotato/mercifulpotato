It&#x27;s an absolutely toxic developer community who rejects any reflection upon the quality of their product that could somehow indicate that there exists problems with their design vision.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter that they&#x27;ve made the UI harder to use for those with ability concerns, or that their market share is dwindling, or that they&#x27;ve steadily lost developers for most of a decade.<p>Everyone should give up and move on; I use MATE and am happy, others like Plasma and Xfce. There&#x27;s plenty of vastly superior DEs with healthier developer attitudes.')
