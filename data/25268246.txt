Item(by='kls', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606847856, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25262560, text='To me it does not seem all too hard of a problem to solve. I don&#x27;t know about other state but in FL you can get your driver licence, tags, and most other FL DOT related functions at the local tax collector&#x27;s office.<p>There is no doubt that their are inefficiencies in the process but, it is after all government services, their is no incentive for them to perform better or to provide a decent customer experience because they hold regulation and a monopoly on the process. I get it, I mean in FL they won&#x27;t take your old licence (if it is expired) as proof that you are you, even though they issued it and can verify that while it is expired, it is an official id that they issued. I know because I had to deal with it, as well as deal with the fact that at some point they stopped recognizing hospital issued birth certificates, that did not have the state encoding strips on them. That being said, inefficiency of government does not invalidate the need to restore faith in the election process on several levels. Rather it means we look at ways to make it more efficient and change the incentive process to do so.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that these items could be distributed to other trusted entities. I mean I would be all for the poll watchers being able to take the documentation and issue the ID right there on the spot at no charge.<p>And I don&#x27;t disagree that there are a lot of agendas at play, but I honestly don&#x27;t know how people come to the conclusion that the average minority &#x2F;poor will be disenfranchised by this. I cannot speak to whether it would disenfranchise the homeless as I would hazard to guess that not many among it&#x27;s community actually vote. I know where I live (The Florida Keys) we have a very high homeless, working poor and transient population. Most of those that actually work, posses some form of state ID, but I could not say for the homeless that panhandle.<p>I am all for making it as frictionless as possible and I agree on fees for the poor, but I just don&#x27;t see the racist implication which is generally what I have heard bandied about in the dogma. I personally see it as a valuable step towards election integrity and that is my primary concern. No one is letting off the gas, and given how insulated we have been in the US to political strife, I don&#x27;t think the majority of both sides sees how close we are too the edge of the cliff, but everyone just wants to keep the pedal down. We will not go on long with lack of faith in our representatives being duly elected and the less faith people have the more prone they are to wild conspiracies of Russian hookers peeing on candidates, and pizza parlor pedo houses. We truly are at that level of crazy, and that level of crazy makes people easy targets for manipulation.')
