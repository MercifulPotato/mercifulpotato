It&#x27;s not helpful to lump all substances into a single &quot;drugs&quot; category and then draw conclusions by cherry-picking specific substances like caffeine. We have plenty of evidence that caffeine is safe to consume regularly over the long term. Trying to consume MDMA at a similar frequency would provided disastrous long-term effects. It&#x27;s disingenuous to try to equate the two substances.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s a continuous gradient between &quot;medicine&quot;, &quot;habit&quot;, &quot;functional addiction&quot;, and &quot;rock bottom addiction&quot;. It&#x27;s hard to draw defining lines on other peoples&#x27; spectra.<p>It&#x27;s not really as arbitrary as you make it sound.<p>The bigger problem is that addicts almost always fail to categorize <i>their own</i> usage, especially in the early phases. It&#x27;s frighteningly common to hear addicts rationalize their escalating addictions as self-medication, or for alcoholics to convince themselves that they are functional alcoholics as their lives slowly fall apart.')
