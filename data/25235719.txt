He&#x27;s the former chairman of Purdue Pharmaceuticals, and investigative journalists have uncovered a boat load of paperwork showing that he personally pushed for marketing tactics that would result in addiction and death. The sudden exit of the entire Sackler family from the board and executive positions in 2018 reeks of wrongdoing too, especially since reports indicate that Richard continued to call the shots after resigning. Given that Purdue Pharma recently pleaded guilty to criminal charges, I suspect that various proprietorial offices should have enough evidence to get a subpoena of his personal records.<p>But again, tons of people have researched this stuff. The problem is that <i>I cannot personally bring a criminal charge against Richard Sackler</i>. Which is why your &quot;people just want to be mad on the internet&quot; attitude is extremely obnoxious. The problem isn&#x27;t that what needs to be done in these cases isn&#x27;t known, the problem is that the people who have the power continue to do what we don&#x27;t want them to do.')
