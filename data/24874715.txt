And the character Johnson ends up being a fascinating raconteur, even if his literary works have not withstood the test of time.<p>And it&#x27;s not really that much of a biography, as we would think of a biography today. There&#x27;s very little on Johnson&#x27;s literary work which had propelled him to fame in his lifetime. A royal pension (happily for him) relieved Johnsonof having to produce any more works, I think sometime around the time Boswell met him. Johnson spent the last decades of his life as a popular man about town, with the sycophantic Boswell recording his conversations verbatim, which Johnson and others frequently teased Boswell about.')
