My wife asked after the movie was over, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you fill out the card and turn those people in?&quot; I replied, &quot;You think they&#x27;re going to believe me that every person around me was talking?  When it&#x27;s one person, they&#x27;re the asshole.  When it&#x27;s everybody but me, I&#x27;m the asshole.&quot;<p>If a theater chain that prides themselves on throwing people out who talk[1] can&#x27;t keep people from shutting up then I have no hope it&#x27;ll ever change.  What was once considered extremely rude is now considered commonplace, apparently.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1L3eeC2lJZs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1L3eeC2lJZs</a>')
