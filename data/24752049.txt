He was in culinary school and had split a bag of Bob&#x27;s Red Mill (expensive for some young people) soup thickener with a friend that he wanted to experiment with. He had no prior record whatsoever.<p>Luckily, he was able to get out on OR only because about a dozen of us called the jail as soon as we heard, and spoke to the recognizance volunteer that happened to be on duty and he only spent the night on jail.<p>It took over three months for the DA&#x27;s office to actually test the substance and drop the charges. If he hadn&#x27;t been lucky enough to have quite a few highly motivated friends that knew the system in that city, he&#x27;d have stayed there the whole time.<p>For soup thickener.')
