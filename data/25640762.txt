I  look forward to watching the company falter over the coming decade.<p>Switching costs for a search engine are pretty damn low. And yet their search product is littered with crap and exploits users like only a monopolist would.<p>Ideally they’ll continue burning goodwill by doing things like adding some fact-checking or censorship “features” into Gmail, delisting political sites, and feature hyper-partisan political infighting as a core  tenant of their employee training and advancement practices.<p>GoodCheapFast alleges they have a 7% conversion rate from visitors to purchases. That’s insanely high, and indicates Google should be sending them as much traffic as possible if their goal is serving the end-user.<p>But since the site doesn’t advertise with Google, and in fact fosters a beautiful ad-free experience, its essentially an indictment of everything Google stands for and therefore must be eliminated.')
