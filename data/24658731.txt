From what I heard in Taiwan, TSMC only accepts Master&#x2F;PhD for these position and internship.<p>Then you have the interface side which writes firmware codes for these chips ( SSD controler ). These are more like your typical software engineering, you will need at least BC degreee and well verse in C&#x2F;C++. But usually it&#x27;s hard to get in with a BC degree unless you are recommended by one of the employee.<p>If you don&#x27;t have any of the mentioned degree, the fastest way is to get one. It is really hard to learn yourself since this is a highly automated industry with most of the work available in maintainence and cutting edge R&amp;D.<p>Otherwise, your job scope in chip industry is limited to a few ( Firmware is a good start )')
