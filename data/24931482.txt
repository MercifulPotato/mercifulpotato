A traditional phone is completely unnecessary for my work with Zoom, Google Voice [1], Signal, etc.<p>The only downside is so many contact forms even for tech companies insist on a phone number as a required field. I certainly won&#x27;t supply a personal mobile number, because constant hounding by salespeople is still a thing.<p>Is anyone else&#x27;s perspective on a commercial entities that require voice phone numbers being diminished?<p>[1] I do have a GV number I use for legitimate business contacts, but since it rings to my mobile, its kept close to avoid sales spam, which seems to be getting worse in 2020.')
