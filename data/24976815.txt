It wouldn&#x27;t be 30x more likely to rain than not on a particular day. However, this is a detail and not that important.<p>Second, though, is that people make highly uncertain bets all the time, and the price for those bets DOES fluctuate wildly over time.<p>For example, you can currently place bets at a number of sports books for the winner of next year&#x27;s NBA finals. There is a TON of uncertainty (we don&#x27;t even know who is going to be on teams, free agency and the draft haven&#x27;t happened yet... not to mention injuries, player improvement, etc)<p>That uncertainty is priced into the bet, and people will take both sides of that bet.<p>As the year progresses and things happen, that price will fluctuate as we get more information and we get closer to the finals. The favorite might change, and a 200 to 1 might end up being a 10 to 1 by the time the finals gets here.<p>It isn&#x27;t that the odds were WRONG at the earlier time, they just had less information. It doesn&#x27;t mean the odds makers didn&#x27;t understand what the state of the world was, or that they didn&#x27;t take into account the uncertainty of what could happen.')
