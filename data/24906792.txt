I&#x27;ll often use bluetooth for convenience but from time to time I&#x27;ll connect over USB. Whenever I make the direct USB connection the sound quality is always noticeably better: rounder deeper sounds, much better quiet and loud sounds ...<p>This leads me to conclude that one or other of the following must be the case:<p>- The iphone DAC is x10^9s better than the Kenwood DAC<p>- Kenwood and iPhone have negotiated a poor codec<p>&gt; most likely the problem is careless software&#x2F;firmware<p>So, don&#x27;t take this wrong, but I&#x27;m going to wince and say this has a shade of a no true scotsman argument to it ... and I say this because I think that this is crux of what&#x27;s wrong with Bluetooth. It is a very closed technology, and it&#x27;s very hard to get a leg-up on the standardisation or how to use it for your own devices if you want to do anything any way commercial.<p>I&#x27;m saying this as a Telecomms guy, who is used to having high quality standards documentation, and reference implementations for just about everything I do. Interoperability is key. Though Bluetooth is a communications standard, it seems to have been influenced more by consumer electronics than comms.<p>After 10-15 years or so of using Bluetooth, it increasingly feels like a technology not really developed in good faith. You get these clunky imprecise results that I and other people report <i>all the time</i>. Working with a bluetooth device you&#x27;re always going to be throwing the dice vs the certainty of plain old wired connections. It&#x27;s plain to see that right across the industry people are hedging against it, and anybody that does require reliable M2M short-wave radio is using a proprietary protocol.<p>Bluetooth is a millstone around our necks. Yes it gives you freedom from wires and a certain limited amount of interoperability, but you don&#x27;t get a huge amount that you wouldn&#x27;t have got vs proprietary radio technologies.')
