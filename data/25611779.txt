Item(by='blackbrokkoli', descendants=None, kids=[25613838, 25613090, 25612661, 25612056], score=None, time=1609583215, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25610275, text='&quot;MOSTLY RIGHT&quot; seems to mean &quot;a pilot project around silicon valley (or in a big Chinese city) exists&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve visited a dozen countries and I&#x27;ve never encountered an AI system to prevent interpersonal violence. AI gunfire detection system seem to exist solely in a certain country with a tendency to tack startup solutions onto deep-rooted societal issues.<p>This is a recurring theme throughout the article. The average hospital runs on Windows XP, not a sci-fi network of smart-watches.<p>Virtual artists are somewhat respected for sure, but AI-generated art is a niche for nerds. I say &quot;art&quot; you think Picasso, not Google Labs.<p>No, no one passed the actual Turing test yet. The public discussion was doomed from the start, since Turing himself published several variants. This led to an explosion of (mostly dumb IMO) variations that are much easier to solve - which are getting solved.<p>Honestly, the original predictions are written badly. They are full of bullshit words (many, some, there is) making them not really quantifiable. Also, they contain an implied focus on US tech centers, which allows the existence of a single PR-stunt pilot project as a reason to answer &quot;Totally Right&quot; to anything proposed. Maybe I just don&#x27;t the point, but this smells like pseudo-intellectual reasoning for &quot;amortality will definitely be achieved before I die, see?&quot;...')
