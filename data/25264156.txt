It&#x27;s an opportunity cost.<p>Look, even if ITER is a success, it still won&#x27;t even produce electricity, that&#x27;s require DEMO, a follow on project. We&#x27;re talking post 2035 just for the first Deuterium-Tritium operation. Now, do you think by 2035+, which is 15 years from now, commercial fusion reactors are going to be run off Niobium-Tin cooled with Liquid Helium?<p>Or do you think commercially available REBCO, which needs only liquid nitrogen, and whose superconductivity doesn&#x27;t falloff as field strengthen increases, will be used? By 2035, whatever DEMO uses of the ITER design will be 30 years old.<p>Meanwhile, hundreds of smaller scale fusion devices could have been built, with equivalent field strengths, but at far far less cost.<p>Would you rather run one massive international experiment with dozens of bureaucracies, or run hundreds of smaller experiences, and collect a lot of data from many more designs in the mean time?<p>We don&#x27;t need the kill ITER to fund more startup fusion research in this country. ARPA-E funded Solyndra and Tesla. Solyndra failed, Tesla succeeded, paid their money back, and created a new industry leading car company with a market capitalization larger than all US car companies combined. I&#x27;d call ARPA-E and DOE&#x27;s investment portfolio HUGELY successful. If they were a Silicon Valley VC, all the other VC&#x27;s would be envious.')
