Item(by='scottlamb', descendants=None, kids=[24914172], score=None, time=1603832411, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24911628, text='I&#x27;ve certainly deliberately downed an enormous number of tasks, though, as part of a cluster turn-down. I love the technique of requiring the operator to echo a key fact, but in the case you&#x27;re describing I think the key fact is not how many tasks but that that they&#x27;re serving live traffic. So:<p>* You could ask the operator to echo the qps figure...but really any number other than zero is likely to be an error, so it can just error out in that case without needing the confirmation.<p>* Even if it is serving zero qps now, if it&#x27;s not explicitly drained at the load balancer, downing it is likely to be a mistake. So even better to check that.<p>Only once in my career have I taken down jobs serving live traffic. (They were serving 100% errors.) It was deliberate, but even so I wouldn&#x27;t have minded having to supply a --yes-i-know-im-downing-live-jobs.<p>edit: and if for some reason my assumption is wrong and downing undrained things becomes routine...well, you&#x27;d want to fix that, but as a short term measure going back to the confirming a number rather than the force option would be appropriate. Is certainly not good to have an override that&#x27;s routinely used.')
