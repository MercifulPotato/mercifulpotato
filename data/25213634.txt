If you directly bring a 25-year old Pele or Michael Jordan or Wayne Gretzky to 2020 using a time machine, they won&#x27;t measure up to their peers. If you send an average math professor from a mid-tier college back to 1680s England, they&#x27;d dazzle Newton. Because standards and the base level of skill have gone up across the board since then.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean average math professors today are smarter than Newton. And it doesn&#x27;t mean the average professional footballer today is actually better than Pele or any of the other greats of the past. Bring baby Pele (or Jordan or Gretzky) to 2020 and (barring injuries) he&#x27;d be a world-beater in 20 years.')
