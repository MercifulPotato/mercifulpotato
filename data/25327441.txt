Item(by='jraph', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607295175, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326552, text='I&#x27;ve seen this presentation, and if I remember correctly, this example was more an attempt to convey what good taste can relate to, more than a definitive answer on whether the second is actually better than the first.<p>Many comments here are arguing that the first answer is actually better because it is clearer. I think it feels clearer to many of us not because it is actually simpler, but because it is the one we learnt at school &#x2F; are used to see and therefore know by heart.<p>Linus is probably aware of this and may have meant to surprise the public with the second solution.<p>Why the second solution is better? Not because it does less branching and is more efficient. This misses the point. Not because there are fewer lines of codes and is terser. This also misses the point.<p>Fewer special cases means less ways to screw up, and also easier to follow. In the general case. Not only in this specific linked list example. And also clearer code.<p>It&#x27;s just that in this specific case, we are used to the first solution that we are able to recognize at a glance (we &quot;pattern-match&quot; it).<p>Do you remember when you had to grasp this first solution the first time you encountered it or tried to write it? Many of us probably screwed it up and wasted time making it work. We might have forgotten the exact edge case Linus Torvalds was pointing out in this presentation. At least for me, I remember it was hard. I probably would have had easier time understanding the second solution by the way. The difficulty is a pointer indirection, but you better really understand pointers correctly when you are manipulating linked lists in C anyway.<p>Comments here also speak about leaving maintainable code for future developers on the project and avoid clever solutions to make their life easier, but it is the whole point of the second solution: let them not have to think about edge cases as much as possible.<p>Don&#x27;t stop on this linked list example. We are all used to the first solution and Linus Torvalds probably picked this example because many people know linked lists. The message is: fewer edge cases is better. The goal is not to be &quot;clever&quot;, in the negative sense.<p>Also see the original code with comments, which is way more readable: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25327066" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25327066</a>')
