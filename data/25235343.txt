But yeah, that vendor chose to make some changes to it to improve it, such that archives created by later versions could not be opened by previous versions, unlike Microsoft&#x27;s practice I guess.<p>But as long as we&#x27;re comparing... the target OS for this converter is Mac OS System 6, released in 1988, superseded by System 7 in 1991. In 1988, Windows 2.0 was released, windows 3.0 was released in 1990. Can zip files created by Windows Explorer be opened without problems in Windows 2.0?  I mean, sure, if the format hasn&#x27;t changed I guess so?<p>Googling though.. it looks like if you are creating a zip archive using WinZip, they recommend you choose a &quot;legacy compression setting&quot; if you want to be sure it&#x27;ll be compatible with older versions. Otherwise it may not be. I&#x27;m guessing Windows 2.0 is about as older version as it gets. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.winzip.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;115011349147-Is-WinZip-compatible-with-older-versions-of-WinZip-and-other-Zip-file-utilities-" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.winzip.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;115011349147-Is...</a><p>I wonder who&#x27;s still running Windows 2.0 to find out! I also wonder who&#x27;s still running Mac OS System 6!')
