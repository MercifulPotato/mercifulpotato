I don&#x27;t think so. It&#x27;s baked in to the system: if your equivalent (nth party voter) on the other side of the political spectrum switches their vote to the mainstream party and you don&#x27;t, then the mainstream party you&#x27;re more aligned with is disadvantaged. There&#x27;s nothing subjective here; it&#x27;s just how the system works.<p>We desperately need a voting system that allows you to express your preferences honestly, and ideally across all candidates, without hurting the outcome. By far, score voting systems are the best at that. Of those, I recommend STAR voting (Score Then Automatic Runoff), because it has some actual momentum[1] (it also has some theoretical advantages, but both it and vanilla score voting, and even Ranked Choice with a Borda count, are such a massive improvement over the status quo that it doesn&#x27;t matter which we pick).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.starvoting.us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.starvoting.us&#x2F;</a> -- no affiliation, just convinced by the research (edit: which you can mostly find linked from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.equal.vote&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.equal.vote&#x2F;</a>)')
