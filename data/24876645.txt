If we peg the beginnings of intentional electromagnetic emission from our planet at 1900, then by 2226 all of these stars will be able to &quot;receive&quot; or potentially detect, non-random emissions from the planet which will scale exponentially both in power and in frequency.<p>Those stars that are currently between 50 and 70 light years away will be experiencing our &quot;golden age of television&quot; about now.<p>Perhaps it would be useful to have a SETI project that focused on EM emissions to see if any of them have started transmitting. It would be hilarious if the first reception from an alien civilization was &quot;Who shot JR?&quot;')
