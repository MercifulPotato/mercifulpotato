Instead of my 20, imagine 200 100-ton landings of cargo on the moon, say over the period of ten years.<p>Instead of everybody sitting on Earth, trying to design-session-out the perfect lunar base, why not just keep regularly-delivering supplies, then learn how to build a lunar base while on the moon, figuring it out as you go? After all, just like SpaceX, we&#x27;re not trying to build <i>a</i> lunar base. We&#x27;re trying to build a factory for constructing lunar bases, eventually hundreds of them. Solving the modular&#x2F;generic problem is what we want to do, not build another Space Shuttle.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m wrong, but it seems like most of the people here, indeed most of the aerospace industry, naturally prefer these big, lumbering, paperwork-heavy, long-lasting bureaucratic programs. But without enough regularly-arriving supplies, why try to solve something up-front, all-at-once, and perhaps years or decades ahead of time when you can just figure out the bare minimum of things you need just as you need them?<p>But like I said, I&#x27;m probably missing something. I&#x27;ve been saying for 20+ years that our real problem is cost-to-LEO. Now that we&#x27;re just barely beginning to address that, the next problem very well may likely be changing the way we think of large space-based programs. That could very well end up being a bigger problem than cost over the long run.<p>ADD: Seems to me that the Starship is a solution to delivering <i>humans</i> to space. We need reusable heat shields, booster packs, and payload capsules, along with an Earth-based mass-driver, to truly drive down cargo rates another 100x. At that point we&#x27;ll begin seriously talking about becoming a space-faring species.')
