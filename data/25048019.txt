Both are math, but to say that the Poincaré conjecture isn&#x27;t important to math because you use math primarily for different things is misleading.<p>All of the proposals for homomorphic encryption I&#x27;ve seen to date (which, for transparency, were mostly in the realm of encrypted databases) don&#x27;t provide any protection against chosen-ciphertext attacks. If [F]HE isn&#x27;t IND-CCA2 secure, which is the minimum bar for encryption that should be used outside of academic settings, then calling it the crown jewel only serves to hype up a technology that will fail to protect users.')
