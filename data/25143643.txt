I think where we disagree is in characterizing making inclusive language changes as &quot;political&quot; and keeping the status quo as &quot;non-political&quot;, when the status quo is demonstrably not working for a lot of people. Changing &quot;master&quot; to &quot;main&quot; is admittedly likely near the end of the list of what the tech industry needs to do to in that regard, but if we can&#x27;t even get low-effort token gestures like that to happen without a lot of outcry I&#x27;m not optimistic about any kind of substantive change.<p>The idea of places like HN being meritocratic tech utopias where race and gender are irrelevant and everyone&#x27;s just a username with some neat ideas is really compelling. I can only offer that in my experience it&#x27;s common knowledge among woman developers that if you want to have a good day, it&#x27;s best not to read the comments here.
