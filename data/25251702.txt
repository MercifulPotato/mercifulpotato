Item(by='forest_dweller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606723879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25249954, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re convinced of anything by me. You&#x27;re obviously convinced of whatever ignorant beliefs you have about the US, already. That alone disqualifies you to talk about the origins of my country. Now, run along and spread your mistaken beliefs to someone who cares. I don&#x27;t care what you think about the US, because I live here, an, you, apparently don&#x27;t. You have authority to speak about the history of my country, or what its become, until you&#x27;ve lived it.<p>I never claimed to know anything about your history or your country. What I&#x27;ve noticed was the usual perversion of history through the modern lens which does happen in my country in exactly the same manner. I can quite clearly recognise it.<p>As for &quot;authority&quot;. I don&#x27;t have to ask for your permission and I am glad that obviously annoys you considering your high handedness with me. It is quite funny that an American is soo against people speaking their mind.<p>&gt; Oh, I&#x27;d consider brushing up on your reading skills, too. You clearly comprehend nothing that&#x27;s going on in this thread, so stop pushing your distorted, delusional narrative. It doesn&#x27;t play well here among actual Americans. Maybe there&#x27;s a reason for that.<p>I know exactly what going on here thankyou. People having differing view points is the spice of life and why people like to converse. Marking those that don&#x27;t agree with you as &quot;distorted, delusional&quot; won&#x27;t play well in the long run.')
