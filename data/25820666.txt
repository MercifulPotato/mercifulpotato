It&#x27;s kinda in the back of my mind, colorless, faded, greyish etc. but I&#x27;m aware of the shape &quot;outline&quot;, well not really the outline but just aware of the shape, without actually seeing it. As if you were in a dark room and were feeling out the objects by touch in part (but I am aware of the whole 2d projection at once, unlike touch). I can only really visualize things while drifting to sleep. If people can do that level while awake, that must be awesome.<p>But I do wonder how much of it is about different uses of words by different people. I do have an internal monologue when I want to build sentences, eg crafting a sentence for writing or just imagining talking to someone and trying to convince them as if practicing arguments for a debate (though decidedly not hallucinating someone to talk to). Or when trying to serialize so explicit steps I need to do, I may list them verbally in my mind.<p>I may call this a conversation with an entity, but actually I feel I&#x27;m just talking to myself. I identify with the speaker. I guess, and I&#x27;m trying now, I can sort of feel as if the stream of sentences is coming from a different entity.<p>It might be that we have very similar (though not equal) experiences we just use different terms and stories to make sense of them.<p>There&#x27;s a book that argues that Ancient Greeks in the time of Homer also believed their gods talked to them and it might have been something like this. And that the idea of an individual free-will autonomous singular human is a relatively modern cultural concept.')
