You have to drastically lower your expectations and pay more for the experience. For instance, Librem 5 USA costs a cool $2,000. That&#x27;s $2,000 for a phone with specs comparable to phones in the mid 2010s. To make it worse, you would have to expect near-zero support, and healthy dose of RTFM and DIY mindset along with it.<p>Thus, for the vast (and I mean VAST) majority of consumers, Librem and the rest of the open source phones were dead on the spot even if it cost 1&#x2F;3 of their current price.<p>It&#x27;s a pipe dream up there with the &quot;year of the Linux desktop&quot;.')
