Why the hell do they chose components with RGB LEDs integrated and software to control them [0] instead of just buying some stand alone LED lights in the color they want?<p>&gt; Have you ever painted or reorganized a room and spent time picking out the colours &amp; details?<p>Not really. I spent all of 5 minutes picking out paint colors for my house when I moved in, painted once, and haven&#x27;t thought about it since.<p>&gt; Is your wardrobe 20 copies of the same shirt?<p>Sadly no, but clothing to me is pretty much purely a functional consideration anyway. I pretty much never buy clothing unless I require it for some utilitarian purpose and wear clothes until they become too worn or damaged to wear anymore. If I had to throw out everything I owned and pick a whole new wardrobe, it would have <i>7</i> of the same shirt.<p>&gt; Did you ever toss up the choice between different vehicles&#x2F;bikes based on the looks?<p>It&#x27;s never come up because every vehicle I&#x27;ve ever bought, bikes included, was bought used. If it fits the price range and has what I&#x27;m looking for I don&#x27;t really care what color it is.<p>I get that other people aren&#x27;t like that and put what to me is far too much significance on such things, but what I don&#x27;t get is the added frustration and complexity for such paltry benefit that computer controlled RGB components gets you. It&#x27;s like people who buy IoT devices and go through all the setup and troubleshooting and just kind of accept that sometimes they don&#x27;t work because of an issue with the cloud.<p>[0] Which works so well that these same people are really happy someone made an open source alternative.')
