Yes.<p>Could they do it without alienating their hardware partners? No.<p>Does Android require the Google Play store or any other Google services or non-AOSP code? No. Many Android devices ship entirely without Google stuff, including no Google Play store.<p>Could they do it even if they didn&#x27;t care about alienating their hardware partners? Yes, if they also intend on being fined into the ground by the US and EU.<p>Their hardware partners, the OEMs, is what makes Android suck for Android users. It doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to suck: OnePlus doesn&#x27;t, and Google&#x27;s own Pixel series isn&#x27;t bad either.
