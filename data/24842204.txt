I am not aware of people being extra careful lest they accidentally offend someone left-handed. Maybe that&#x27;s just my bubble.<p>Among the woke people, discussions of poverty are always framed in context of some discriminated group. Like, you can talk about the poverty of women, or poverty of black people. But you don&#x27;t talk about poverty of poor people in general. Poverty is considered a bad thing that happens to oppressed people, but it is not a thing that makes one oppressed. No one cares about a homeless cishet white male... unless you say he probably has some mental problem, in which case it becomes an example of ableist oppression.<p>This is the reason why hardcore Marxists (such as Zizek) complain when people say that social justice warriors are Marxists. Marxism is about class conflict. Intersectionalism is about all kinds of conflicts... except for the class conflict! Intersectionalism is about having more female CEOs, more gay CEOs, more transsexual CEOs. Marxism is about eliminating the CEOs. To put it bluntly, intersectionalism is about things that can also happen to rich kids.<p>The problem with autism is that people on autistic spectrum are often quite bad at social skills... such as political correctness (think: James Damore). Which makes them unpopular among the woke people.')
