In the case of C++, the pain was mostly asociated with an ancient build system we used; the code itself was relatively manageable. There was almost zero template code, and maybe that helped (although in other occasions I&#x27;ve worked with smaller C++03 codebases that relied heavily on templates and I didn&#x27;t find them that bad).<p>Not all codebases are equal and maybe I was lucky, but in my experience, using dynamic languages (or, to be exact, any language where the compiler doesn&#x27;t nag you when there is a potential problem) doesn&#x27;t scale well.')
