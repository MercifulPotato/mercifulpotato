The problem is the lack of tooling. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s letting me down as a user, designer, creative person. Not the web, the lack of tools.<p>But HTML5 can not fix that problem. Only the games industry can fix that problem. HTML5 is never going to be a game creation IDE, it&#x27;s just an API and a set of technologies. Companies like Epic, Adobe, Unity, etc... have to step in and develop game IDEs that are comparable to Flash.<p>And they just haven&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know why they haven&#x27;t, people should ask them that question.<p>There&#x27;s this idea that web advocates don&#x27;t understand that web tooling for games is bad, and that&#x27;s just not the case. As web advocates we do understand the problem, but Mozilla is not in a realistic position to build everyone a game engine. It&#x27;s not something that browser-manufactures can do. It&#x27;s something the games industry has to decide to tackle. Calling out the web is counterproductive, we are doing everything that we can do to help with replacing Flash.<p>&gt; Again, if Flash no longer provide any value to Adobe, may be they could open source it?<p>That would be great, but I wouldn&#x27;t bet on it. The hope was originally that Adobe would migrate Flash to HTML5 canvas output. They never did until Flash was mostly dead, and from everything I&#x27;ve heard their new engines are kind of terrible to work with anyway.<p>The secondary hope was that they&#x27;d Open Source Flash, or at least help with emulating SWFs so people could continue to use old versions of Flash to publish to the web. That never happened either because... I don&#x27;t know why. Maybe licensing issues, maybe Adobe just doesn&#x27;t care about anyone in their user communities at all.<p>To see people giving tearful salutes to a company that literally just sat there and watched its product rot rather than do anything at all to help the community... it&#x27;s just very frustrating. I was a Flash developer too. But I&#x27;m not mad at Open web advocates, there are plenty of other people&#x2F;businesses for me to be mad at.')
