Way back when, while I was squishing some Y2K bugs for a Saudi bank that catered to high net-worth individuals I was asked to look into why the AS400==&gt;&gt;db==&gt;&gt;Excel spreadsheet was &quot;showing something screwy every now and then&quot;.<p>Spoiler Alert: It was a SMALLINT error that was &#x27;patched&#x27; by someone previously (legacy code) that worked around the bug by rounding account balances to the Million (since it was a reporting function rather than an accounting function it was a &#x27;sort of ok&#x27; hack). The bug re-appeared as undefined behaviour when transaction and or account balances went in to the billions.')
