On 6 rounds, a similar attack can run in time &amp; data 2^116 &amp; 2^116, or 2^127.5 &amp; 2^37.5. On 5 rounds, the attack becomes practical due to the lower diffusion, and runs in 2^16 time and data.</i><p>You see what’s happening there? 5 rounds is easily broken, 6 rounds is borderline secure, 7 rounds is secure. Same thing with AES; these algorithms were never meant to be used the way you’re using them.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;1492.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;1492.pdf</a>')
