I would have thought bad until I’ve awoken to the idea that deception is a regular practice of those who do harm, and a regular weakness of those who have harm done to them, but it doesn’t work the other way. That is, the ability to deceive doesn’t make one deceptive. That comes from the desire to do harm, which often comes from a lack of ability or imagination to do well without harming others. Harm is always felt as a necessity. So intelligent people do not practice or learn about deception, and therefore are most vulnerable to it. Maybe they need to learn by practice, the way their attackers do. A society needs trust to function, to build slowly, but all it takes is a little bit of deception from a small group of people, to destroy everything very quickly.')
