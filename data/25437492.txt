Assuming all that is true: how is this news?  This essentially describes every ambitious, genre defining game for the last 35 years.  As someone who tearfully tried to play Doom on a 286, I have some sympathy but the level of outrage is hard for me to understand.<p>In my experience playing the game on a PS4 Pro (does that qualify as a last-gen console? Not sure), I have experienced no game breaking bugs or performance issues that warrant the level of criticism here.  Instead I have been blown away by the level of detail and beauty of the world they created and I personally am over the moon with the fact the game that I had been eagerly awaiting exceeds my expectations for it.<p>Congrats CD Projekt, take a vacation, give some bonuses, let people upgrade their 5 year old hardware and chill out.')
