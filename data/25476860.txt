It tends to be the case that when you drastically alter the fundamental properties of a system, you won’t get the same results - because it isn’t the same system.<p>Yes, but you claim to know changing which set of variables, by which amount, produced what result, while you don&#x27;t actually know that. Your epistemology is emotional rather than rational.<p>&gt; and you fail to observe that all current implementations of that idea have never demonstrated a single instance of producing Google-like companies since the industrial revolution, your ideas are not going to be very robust.<p>Not that I think Google is a great company (it&#x27;s a pretty lousy one, all things considered) but it is unique, and still you don&#x27;t know precisely what combination of variables unique to the US produced this particular result.<p>&gt; which is why they fired her.<p>That&#x27;s fine, but you blamed them for being sort of victims in the first place.<p>&gt; And the conditions that make Google better for them were not created exclusively by employees and especially not by employees who didn’t share the mission.<p>I never said that.<p>&gt; It is only through the right balance of incentives that such a system can function at all.<p>Sure, but there can be more than one right balance, and you don&#x27;t know all of them.
