It lets me give them easy access to an iTunes library in their rooms without worrying about other apps or messing with anything else. Even the youngest (3 years old) could figure out how to skip to the next track or start&#x2F;stop the music to the Bluetooth-paired speaker in their room. I even bought an extra Nano for when this one dies in the hope that that gives me enough time until they’re old enough to handle a “full” iPod touch.')
