I find that most people claim to have a moral rule against lying but have idiosyncratic definitions of what that is.<p>I saw a lecture video the other day where the speaker told an anecdote about how he got to work at a fancy place with a person he looked up to. To get a chance at talking to him, he said he&#x27;ll be in town next week for a conference and they could grab lunch together one day. The conference was a lie, he just didn&#x27;t want to look so desperate that he&#x27;d fly in just for this chance at a lunch discussion. Had he laid his cards bare, maybe the important person would have felt more pressure that if he accepts the lunch invitation then he already owes him something because the guy went through all the trouble to fly in. So by lying, our guy took pressure off the situation and got a relaxed discussion and eventually the gig.<p>This is just one example. How about negotiation strategies? How about lying implicitly by misrepresenting yourself through clothing or otherwise? How about downplaying your romantic interest a bit, to avoid scaring away or overwhelming your desired partner? How about lying by omission?<p>It just isn&#x27;t socially feasible to be always reporting true statements of fact without some hint of &quot;manipulation&quot;. I mean even just putting up a poker face while you&#x27;re very nervous is a form of misrepresenting your inner state of mind. Selling anything, including yourself in a job interview or at a date requires downplaying weaknesses and emphasizing strengths in a very partisan and totally not neutral and balanced factual way.<p>Outright lying is for losers. You can achieve the same goals and more by just being good at technically not lying or lying in socially acceptable ways. (similar to how crime is for losers and the big players get laws written according to their interests).<p>People protect their self image with so many patterns like: &quot;I would never X (lie, cheat on a partner,...)&quot; &quot;How about that time when&quot; &quot;well, that doesn&#x27;t count, it&#x27;s complicated, I had reasons&quot; etc.<p>There aren&#x27;t any hard and fast rules.')
