I feel like our educational system concentrates so much on specific freedoms we have that it ignores other limitations we place on our government&#x27;s powers. The implicit, and well litigated, restriction against limiting freedom of association is an extremely important example of the &quot;forgotten rights&quot;. So when lay people run up against it, they assume there must be some kind of corruption going on, when in fact, it&#x27;s an obvious consequence of constitutional law that everyone probably should have been familiarized with in high school.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to people misunderstanding the law. As the article that birthed this thread illustrates. Which only reiterates the need for our nation&#x27;s civics classes to do a better job.')
