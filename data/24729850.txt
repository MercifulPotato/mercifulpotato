The people who mortgaged themselves up to their eyeballs to get in on those good inner suburb commutes and schools are the losers because suddenly outer suburb housing is a more viable alternative to what they own.  The people living in illegal 300sf studio departments in people&#x27;s basements are neither since they weren&#x27;t all in on any particular side.  They can rent somewhere further out and cheaper with space for an office without too much friction.<p>Back in the early 90s a lot of cities were dumps compared to today.  The people who bought there and held on for 20-30yr won because a lot of cities gentrified.')
