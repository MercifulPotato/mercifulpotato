Other options you might look at for GUI solid modeling are FreeCAD (the one I tried before giving up and learning Fusion) and Solvespace (you&#x27;ll want to build 3.0 from source, the most recent release build is 2.3 from 2016).<p>Or for code based modeling, OpenSCAD is the big thing, and cadQuery is a newer python-based system that seems very promising. Version 2 of cadQuery is built on Open CASCADE, the same backend as FreeCAD, and I gather it makes some modeling operations like fillets and chamfers much more possible than what you can do in SCAD.<p>I&#x27;ve been meaning to dig into that but haven&#x27;t made the time yet.')
