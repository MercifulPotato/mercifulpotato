Sort of like if you oppose beef by-products because you think a cow died for it.<p>They&#x27;re wrong - the cow died regardless, because of high-profit steak, and the submarines are funded regardless of whether we <i>also</i> get carbon-free power from it - but it&#x27;s a valid argument.<p>But yes, in northern latitudes - in winter we run fossil fuels, which create <i>literally millions of tonnes of gaseous waste</i> for ever tonne of <i>solid</i> nuclear waste, or we freeze and die.<p>If you respond <i>but what about [green magic]</i>, congratulations, you&#x27;ve not done the sums for winter in cold countries, and I&#x27;m not wasting time arguing with you. Go do them.')
