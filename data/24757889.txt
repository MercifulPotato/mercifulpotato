Lucky for nazi, their ideology was based on race. The few censored nazi journals issues crossed the line to religious hate. Overwhelming majority of them was hateful against race and thus allowed.<p>So no, their censorship did not even attempted any meaningful limitation of nazi. Also,  in 1933 Hitler gained complete power, was also supported by veterans who worked in civil service and talking about &quot;co-opting&quot; censorship is almost absurd. At that point, first concentration camp was created and political opponents were put in. The censorship machine was not that much important at that point, violence was.<p>Also,  German censorship was quicker against communists then right wing groups, because right wing groups were seen as patriotic.')
