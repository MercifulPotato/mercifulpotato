Well off, couldn&#x27;t really reasonably ask for much more, yet still chasing happiness like a carrot on a stick.  Tired, unmotivated, and forever looking for the next thing to feel better.<p>Diet, sleep, and exercise are all &quot;in check&quot;.  (Not micro managed by any means, but certainly not eating fast food, alcohol, and sleeping poor for example).')
