A gay man talking about his wedding around the water cooler is political. A straight man talking about his wedding around the water cooler is not political.<p>Talking about one&#x27;s wedding around the water cooler is not political, irrespective of the speaker&#x27;s orientation OR the audience&#x27;s opinions about gay marriage. Similarly, an argument in favoring or opposing gay marriage would be political irrespective of the speaker&#x27;s sexuality or the audience&#x27;s opinions. This seems perfectly straightforward to me. It seems like you&#x27;re trying to make a problem where none exists.')
