In both cases (at least with most state of the art NLP techniques), you have to learn certain patterns and ways to phrase a query so that the system will reliably understand it. With formal query languages, these patterns are well-defined, can be looked up and will most likely not change significantly (so there is value in memorizing them). With NLP systems, the patterns are completely opaque, you have to learn them through trial and error, they may change anytime (e.g. because the model is retrained) and they are usually significantly less powerful.<p>I sometimes feel that the trend to prefer NLP over formal query languages is comparable to the trend to prefer GUIs over consoles in the 80ies and 90ies.')
