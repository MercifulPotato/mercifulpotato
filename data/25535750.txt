I recently got into gaming at the tender age of 36 and bought my first joystick for MSFS, Gamepad with two little joysticks for playing platform games and a steering wheel with gear shift for car games.<p>So during this whole process I realized that most gear has two versions, a PC&#x2F;PS4 version and a PC&#x2F;Xbox version.<p>The PC&#x2F;PS4 version doesn&#x27;t actually work in Windows. I had to get the PC&#x2F;Xbox version to work in games like Forza Horizon. Even though their website lists the same brand and model, but they don&#x27;t say which version.<p>I figured that obviously Microsoft will have the best support for the Xbox version of the gear.<p>I also use a cheap Logitech F310 gamepad in Linux for games like Dead Cells, Hollow Knight, Streets of Rogue and Unto the end. Worked with no setup, out of box.')
