Therefore it must send your directions request to Apple. Which I guess is fine, they&#x27;ll just see &quot;some DDG user&quot; requesting certain directions and it&#x27;s definitely not the worst company they could be working with, I&#x27;m just a bit surprised that DDG went with Apple Maps instead of self hosting.')
