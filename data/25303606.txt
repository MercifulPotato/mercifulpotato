We (a very large tire manufacturer you have heard of) spent several million a year coming up with plausible deniability for what we were doing to avoid this, mainly using more natural rubber. We spent more on advertising the &quot;green&quot; natural rubber tires then we did on actually manufacturing them.<p>Sorry to be cynical but I am so sick of this BS where big industry pollutes for decades while academics are eating right out of their hands then they pretend like it&#x27;s a surprise when they &quot;discover&quot; the source of the pollution.<p>We have know FOR DECADES that tire pollution is arguably WORSE for the environment than tail pipe emissions. Don&#x27;t buy this BS as if this is new research, it&#x27;s just been successful ignored until it couldn&#x27;t. Same as recycling plastics but ya&#x27;all ain&#x27;t ready to talk about that scam yet apparently as I keep seeing people diligently filling their blue buckets with unrecyclables as if they are &quot;doing their part&quot;.')
