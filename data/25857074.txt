PM does similar to the above (including auto-updates), and it also connects to start.me as it is the default home page, which loads Google Ads and Analytics. According to its privacy policy:<p>&quot;Among the types of Personal Data that start.me collects, by itself or through third parties, there are: Cookies; Usage Data; first name; last name; email address.&quot;<p>What definition is it using for spyware and why does it only apply to browsers it doesn&#x27;t like is beyond me, but the author clearly has a bone to pick.')
