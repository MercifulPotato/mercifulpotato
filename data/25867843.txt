Just things like the feel of the keyboard or the trackpad can make a system a nightmare to use if they&#x27;re bad. I also need to be confident that I&#x27;m not going to get given the runaround if a piece of hardware (e.g. docking station or monitor) doesn&#x27;t work with the machine.<p>&gt; things should work more smoothly than with Windows (drivers are built into the kernel and update with the OS).<p>That&#x27;s actually one of the things that worries me the most about Linux - I can&#x27;t pin a driver to a version that&#x27;s working, and if the kernel drops support for my hardware then I have to choose between losing support for my hardware or never upgrading my OS. I was excited for GNU&#x2F;kFreeBSD up until the point where systemd arrived and destroyed all the advantages of free OSes.')
