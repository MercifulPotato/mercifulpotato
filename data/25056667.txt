Item(by='BatteryMountain', descendants=None, kids=[25057571], score=None, time=1605084454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25049821, text='Thing is, you can do it but with ceremony.<p>You have to override Equals() and GetHashCode() for starters. Then you also need to make sure you only have getters and no setters (or private setters). In some cases you need to make your empty constructor private and force a specific constructor to be used. If you have multiple constructors it means you will have different invariants which puts you in class land, you are better off with classes then anyway. Also if your immutable objects have many methods..that also puts you in class land.<p>Just that alone makes it cumbersome.<p>So a new record type that behaves somewhat like a struct would be perfect. Or the F# way, which is basically perfection.')
