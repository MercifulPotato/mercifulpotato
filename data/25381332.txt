The ones that he&#x27;s not as self-congratulatory about his innate sense of who are &quot;winners.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s the sad truth: for every one hard-working, hard-cranking, in the right-place-at-the-right-time, never giving up &quot;cockroach&quot; companies like AirBnB that happen to make it, there are a hundred also hard-working, never-giving-up, never at the right-place-at-the-right time people with charisma who people look at and just say &quot;why won&#x27;t they just give up??&quot;<p>Because you can&#x27;t spot an AirBnb out of a crowd of look-alike startups or pick the winner just by sensing the energy of the founder. Good products, great tech, great founders only get you so far on the crazy path of entrepreneurship. There&#x27;s a million variables and factors that prevent you from successfully completing that path. There are the spectacular flameouts. The great founders with great tech who can&#x27;t find market&#x2F;fit. The iterators who can&#x27;t make spaghetti stick to the wall.<p>And no, not even a PG can spot that one survivor out of the batch of many, despite how much self-congratulatory survivor bias would say otherwise, even if he did indeed spot the winner from the get-go as he claims in this essay.')
