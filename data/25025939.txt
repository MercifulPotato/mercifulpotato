On Sundays I distribute the tasks to different days of my next week day.<p>If I don&#x27;t get the task done for a weekday, it&#x27;s completely fine. I just move it back into the long list, so it gets distributed next sunday.<p>If I notice a task has been cycled like that a few times, then I delete it, it wasn&#x27;t important enough for me to overcome the guilt associated with the task.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if the system I came up with was what actually fixed my todo anxiety, but in case it was I figured I would share it.')
