Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=[24953092], score=None, time=1604159187, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24950873, text='&gt; I&#x27;d rather being president were more like being prime minister, just a bureaucratic position without much prestige, necessary but no one is calling you &quot;leader of the free world.&quot;<p>I agree, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a possibility. An administration that would essentially just be boring and bureaucratic wouldn&#x27;t &quot;change&quot; the country, but essentially run it on the status quo. Lots of people aren&#x27;t happy with the status quo for various reasons, they want to change it. That in turn makes other people want to stop them from changing it.<p>If you didn&#x27;t have two groups that split across some major fault lines, you didn&#x27;t have &quot;exciting&quot; politics. When you have these divided groups, how could you have boring politics?')
