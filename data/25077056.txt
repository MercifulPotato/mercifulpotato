It&#x27;s like 3 lines of code with most popular web frameworks. Typically you&#x27;d be storing a card&#x27;s last4, card type, exp date and an association to a user in your system so this info is handy.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take much more effort to send emails out as warnings for that. I&#x27;ve done it in a few systems before Stripe had this email feature.<p>The smart retries is interesting but this feels like another thing where Stripe is happy to collect our data but then re-sell it to us at a premium once they&#x27;ve gathered enough data. Similar to having to pay a lot more money per transaction to get fraud protection rules (Radar). Basically we pay Stripe to train their system and then they double dip and charge us extra to use these features.')
