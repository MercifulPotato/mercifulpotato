Gdb was first, because when I learned C it was the only freely available option. Strace likely was next when I started encountering problems that happened too long into a program’s execution to successfully use breakpoints to debug. Valgrind was likely next, when I ran into bugs where the memory corruption happened a long time before the actual crash (think use-after-free or uninitialized values).')
