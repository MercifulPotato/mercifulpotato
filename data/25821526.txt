But Google isn&#x27;t even a media platform, it&#x27;s a search engine. It&#x27;s just that search adverts happen to work better than newspaper adverts because their more targeted to people they&#x27;re relevant too.<p>If a Danish news paper profiled their advertising specifically for me because they happened to know how much money I spend on Warhammer figures, they would be breaking our laws.<p>Even with the GDPR, Google can do the same thing legally.<p>And google goes beyond just advertising doesn&#x27;t it? If I google air humidity in my town, because I want to spray prime Warhammer figures, google selects which site it shows me the information from in the google widget thing. Maybe it&#x27;s not as bad as Facebook, but what happens if you search for the covid-19 vaccine and you&#x27;re an anti-vaxxer? What data ends up in googles info-boxes then?')
