I got the impression there is a lot of myth around Macbooks, which kindof wasn&#x27;t updated since 2015.<p><i>A lot</i> of folks around me simply skipped the new Macbooks, since touchbar, keyboard, ... , were just unusable for them.<p>Then you had the major issues with dust getting into the keyboard messing it up, the screens dying after weeks of usage, USB things...<p>Now the Big Sur update bricks your machine, if you reset it, because there is a firmware bug. The M1 Macbooks are distroyed by USB-C PD hubs (not just the &quot;cheap ones&quot;; as if that would have been excusable..). Plenty users reporting the machines to panic once or twice a day.<p>People seem to be happy with the old non-retina Air&#x27;s, the pre 2016 Macbooks, but I don&#x27;t see this at all for the recent stuff. Apart from the M1 <i>performance</i> hype, which of course is legit, but doesn&#x27;t cancel out the &quot;just works&quot; issues.<p>Seems rather like a long, long experimental transition, then reliable experience.')
