Item(by='jrochkind1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611861897, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941243, text='&gt; If you close those, you are basically closed-source with an option to peak at the code.<p>Oh no. Closed-source with an option to peak the code does exist.<p>This is not it. Because it is licensed GPL. Which means you have the option to <i>copy</i> the code into your own project. In whole, or just looking at particular parts that are useful. You have the option to <i>fork</i> it and do whatever you want to it.<p>If you got some people together that thought &quot;gee, we like this, but we wish it took PR requests&quot;, you are legally allowed to copy the code into a different project (ie fork it) that takes PR requests, and become the maintainers of that project.<p>This is *HUGE*. You can&#x27;t do that with closed source even if they let you see the code. There is a very big difference between &quot;closed source that lets you see the code&quot; (which does exist, but this isn&#x27;t it) and &quot;open source&quot;. And it&#x27;s not whether they take PR&#x27;s -- closed source can take PR&#x27;s too.  The a proprietary company will let you volunteer your time to submit improvements to <i>their</i> code does not make it open source. It&#x27;s about who (if anyone) controls the code and can decide who is allowed to <i>use</i> it or not, not just see it.It&#x27;s about the license.<p>It is important that we as developers and decision-makers about what code to use understand this difference.')
