The problem is that postdocs also don&#x27;t get paid much (last I checked the mandated maximum salary for postdocs in biosciences was ~45k&#x2F;year), and they&#x27;re being strung along with the hope of professorship.  Even worse, a lot of professors will take as few grad students as they can get away with, and mostly use postdocs, since they&#x27;re only about 50% more expensive, but they&#x27;re much more productive from a research standpoint.  Also, a lot of professors will string grad students along for a while towards the end, since that&#x27;s when they&#x27;re the most productive, but they&#x27;re still cheap.<p>We need to have fewer postdocs, and pay them more.  We also need to make grad school follow a more regimented timeline, with raises over time, to protect the students&#x27; interests.<p>There&#x27;s a reason miserable grad students are such a meme, it&#x27;s a terrible system.')
