I&#x27;m sick and tired of this viewpoint.<p>Your false dichotomy is eyerolling - either we have total faith in all stories we read, with zero attention to detail and context, or we condemn all journalists as hacks, bad faith actors, and relics of the past: That knowledge is either meaningless, or easily compiled and comprehended in its raw format to the layman.<p>We need journalism. And in the new century where we will have stronger disinformation campaigns, better deepfakes, and the potential collapse of local news as we know it, &quot;trust&quot; in institutions and particular sources, based on their track record and credibility, will be <i>all we have</i>. Not everything is verifiable, and we as humans need to act on information we can&#x27;t verify <i>all the time</i>.<p>So instead of going on about how all journalists suck, let&#x27;s call out errors and bad work when we see it, and continue to push for better journalism and new ways of researching, citing, and reporting facts.')
