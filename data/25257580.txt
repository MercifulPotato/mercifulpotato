I ran it in my spare time, using Google Sheets, until the spreadsheet setup grew too unwieldy, time-consuming, and frustrating. Back then, I bit the bullet, and rebuilt it using Django. It took months of my evenings and weekends — just to recreate a database version of what I <i>almost</i> had with a spreadsheet.<p>That got me thinking what made spreadsheets my tool of choice to start with, and what made me switch to a database, and if we can have the best of both worlds. So we built Grist to be a “relational spreadsheet” — most of what a spreadsheet has, but with more structure, linking between records, and a flexible UI on top.<p>I’ve been using Grist daily, it’s now my tool of choice. I’d love to know what uses you put it to as well!')
