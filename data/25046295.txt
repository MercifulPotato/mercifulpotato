Filter traffic going the other way (opening those connection) to taste - perhaps allow access only to the IPP port and certainly don&#x27;t allow any inbound traffic to hit it from the wider world.<p>It&#x27;s far from perfect - most importantly it doesn&#x27;t stop manufacturers from making printers which only work if they have an always-on internet connection, and also doesn&#x27;t stop a scheme where the proprietary Windows&#x2F;etc drivers send the firmware as part of a print payload, but it probably works &quot;enough&quot; for now.<p>One other problem with this approach is that it isn&#x27;t easily open to anyone non-technical.')
