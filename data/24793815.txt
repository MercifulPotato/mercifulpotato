Just for the record, I don&#x27;t <i>like</i> the current centralized internet; I&#x27;ve all but deactivated my facebook account; when a site requires a Google or Facebook verified login ID without their own &quot;create account&quot; option I avoid them at all costs; I avoid Paypal now because there are better alternatives (but in the early &#x27;00s, I would not have trusted most sites enough to pay with a card). And so on. I&#x27;m not trying to advocate for their position, but just understand the problems that they solve and why we got here.<p>And while I hate using recaptcha, I also had the even more unpleasant experience of watching a forum that I moderated die under a crushing assault of spam bots that were smart enough to make it past the built-in CAPTCHA. Recaptcha isn&#x27;t there to solve problems for the people who interact with it, it&#x27;s solving problems for the people who chose to put it on their site.<p>I wrote in a sibling comment what value Facebook&#x27;s login brings to the sites that opt into it. (Offload all the work of password handling, claims about stolen accounts, preventing sockpuppetry and catfishing, etc).')
