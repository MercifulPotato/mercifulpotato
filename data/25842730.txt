Item(by='heleninboodler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611118806, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25841304, text='It&#x27;s possible to support CHOP&#x27;s intentions as non-terroristic and also think that the deaths are not OK.  I personally don&#x27;t support CHOP but I think the deaths were caused more by negligence than malice:  they didn&#x27;t intend for violence and death, but they eventually lost control of their cop-free paradise.  Some would argue that was inevitable and that&#x27;s what made the whole thing a stupid idea in the first place.<p>CHOP started as a bunch of protestors who saw the police make the terrible strategic decision to withdraw from their own precinct building and said &quot;hey, let&#x27;s declare that this area is self-governing to make a political statement about how police presence isn&#x27;t improving things.&quot;  And it initially really was peaceful enough to walk your kids through to look at all the hippie positivity.  The chaos and violence came about after the &quot;autonomy&quot; went on way too long and opportunists (anarchists and wannabe vigilantes) moved in.<p>Everything would have worked out a lot better if the CHOP folks yelled &quot;you&#x27;re retreating?  This is our neighborhood now!  Rah, rah, rah!&quot; and then a day or two later the cops said &quot;very funny, you made your point, but we are coming back and you better get the fuck out of the way or get your heads beaten in&quot; and that was the end of it.')
