Just like the author of this article I&#x27;ve been annoyed at GDB&#x27;s teletype oriented interface and wanted something better, only to find a lot of applications that are even more clumsy to use and crash more than the application I&#x27;m trying to fix.<p>This goes back a long way too.  xxgdb used to be reasonably stable but these days it seems to crash quite frequently.  ddd seemed so awesome when I first discovered it, but it too failed spectacularly on the various occasions when I tried actually using it.  I occasionally go back to see if they&#x27;ve fixed the bugs but thus far have not had any luck.')
