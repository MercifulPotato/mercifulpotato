Apple is matching the 75w 1050ti with less than 5w of power.<p>The 3060ti is a 200w gpu, which is 40x the power draw of the gpu in the m1, but it is only 5x the performance. Gpu’s might not scale linearly, but it may very well be the case that apple will blow us away when they ship their high end gpu’s.')
