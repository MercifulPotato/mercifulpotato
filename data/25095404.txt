The pizza button, defrost setting, etc., I&#x27;ve not seen anyone mention across a few dozen comments (though I didn&#x27;t do a thorough study).<p>I&#x27;d venture to add that a clock config button might also be appreciated by many even if you use it only after power outages and so people don&#x27;t realize they want it.<p>My previous microwave had a +30s&#x2F;start button, power selection, and of course clock setting. And other stuff that I never used. I&#x27;d only ever hit start, optionally after power selection. It would instantly start (my current microwave first waits two seconds for more input) and allow me to press it more for more time (my current one rejects adding time). The button was also nice, I don&#x27;t know how to properly describe it but it was a nice clicky button that extruded, where my current one has a small pressure pad for the quick start button.<p>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m asking for much. A start button that actually starts, lets me add time, and that&#x27;s not tiny and needs a bunch of pressure to register. One proper button. The rest can be crappy, I don&#x27;t use that most of the time.')
