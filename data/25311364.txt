I have a rough estimation of the amount of hours required and I obviously know how much I earn at my current job. I do believe in the product, but I am realistic about the chances of success.<p>The offer is based solely on milestone deliverables, and will vest when those are complete. I&#x27;m trying to assess what percentage of equity is a reasonable offer. There is no dilution protection and I&#x27;m not guaranteed any more work or stock after the deliverables are finished.<p>Essentially my inputs are: hours of work required, my current salary at day job, finger in the air valuation decided by lawyers&#x2F;founders at time of formation.<p>My inclination would be to do something like this: \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.co&#x2F;g&#x2F;how-to-split-startup-equity&#x2F;3522<p>i.e. (current hourly rate * risk modifier) as a percentage of valuation.<p>I&#x27;m struggling to come to what that risk modifier should be though, that article suggests 2x. Any thoughts?')
