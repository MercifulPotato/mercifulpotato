Any resident can see that Pelosi and Newsom have acted exactly like royalty during the corona lockdown. &quot;Lockdowns for you, salons and parties for me.&quot;<p>While they&#x27;ve been in power, infrastructure has declined to the point of ruin (the proposed water projects have stalled for decades, which is a big deal in the dry west), and all we got in return is far-left politics. In the last 10 years, 4,500 tax bills have been introduced to re-distribute wealth in the state.<p>As a result, businesses are leaving the state pell-mell. You can&#x27;t afford socialism&#x2F;marxism without other people&#x27;s money, and businesses know the target is on their back.<p>Advice for New York: Vote AOC out of office as fast as you can, or you will be subject to another 50 years of failed socialist leadership, just like California has endured.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nancy_Pelosi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nancy_Pelosi</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dianne_Feinstein" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dianne_Feinstein</a><p>Some background on one Calif. water project that hasn&#x27;t started:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courthousenews.com&#x2F;newsom-scraps-californias-17-billion-waterfix-project&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courthousenews.com&#x2F;newsom-scraps-californias-17-...</a>')
