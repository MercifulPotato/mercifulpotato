In fact, the author expounds a little bit on your question later, saying:<p>&quot;An October 2019 study on the mental well-being of crew, commissioned by a group affiliated with the International Transport Workersâ€™ Federation, the big maritime trade union, found that even before the pandemic about a fifth of mariners surveyed said they had suicidal thoughts.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d be curious how the suicide rates compare to a non-pandemic year..<p>Regardless though, I feel like the juicy part of this article isn&#x27;t the ~6 suspected suicides, it&#x27;s how messed up the cruise ship companies are and how badly they botched communication in an attempt to cover their asses. They seem to be purposefully misinforming families about what happened with their loved ones. Some of these suspected suicides were found in their rooms and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be closure as to what exactly happened. I can&#x27;t imagine being in that situation.')
