This should make replacing sounds and art rather trivial.<p>&gt; Some assets are code (procedural content, for example) though, how do you feel about those?<p>Code is code, if it produces output, it is owned by the user :) (assuming the &quot;code&quot; doesn&#x27;t produce copyrighted content).<p>EDIT: Why do I treat code differently from assets? I have no clue tbh, but probably has to do with I can do code and thus can give it away, and can&#x27;t do assets and thus can&#x27;t.')
