A lot of the decisions made at Apple that we see in their products aren&#x27;t decisions that could be made within other organizations. Either because the people don&#x27;t have the capacity to do make them, or because the organization isn&#x27;t set up to let them do it and succeed.<p>Some of these ideas, like converting an entire product category to a different ISA would be celebrated and investigated at Apple but laughed out of the room at Dell or HP.<p>A bigger part of this aside from culture is that Apple is one of the most vertically integrated manufacturers of consumer goods in the world, and isn&#x27;t beholden to the whims of suppliers or customers as much as anyone else.')
