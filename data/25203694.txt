When I get to the end of a Stranger Things episode (which I buy on BluRay), I want the scene to fade out, and I want the credits to roll, and then I want the universe to leave me in peace for a moment so I can contemplate what just happened.<p>Netflix absolutely will not allow this experience. You can turn off auto-playing the next episode, but Netflix will take over your screen with a giant promo instead. There&#x27;s no way to let a video just <i>end</i>.')
