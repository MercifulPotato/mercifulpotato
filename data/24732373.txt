If you can confirm you cannot reproduce past results, you may consider discussing with other people about your findings, and publishing if no one can find a reasonable explanation. In any case, you are happy because that&#x27;s how science progresses.<p>&gt; My position is that I am happy to continue as before, but I won&#x27;t overstate my case. I won&#x27;t say &#x27;I know&#x27; when I don&#x27;t. I can accept that what is presented as true, may in fact be true, but I don&#x27;t know it. I would be lying if I did.<p>Sure, and that&#x27;s the point of science: there is no truth, only better and better models. But we won&#x27;t stop using the verb &quot;to know&quot; altogether.\nKnowledge is not a binary thing (you know or you don&#x27;t).')
