Not to mention military stuff.<p>(And Debian is much more popular in those places that people believe)<p>&gt; Devs want to distribute their software to users, and they aren&#x27;t going to chase down rabbit holes to get it packaged to comply with every different distributions set of available dependency versions.<p>That&#x27;s what stable ABIs are for.<p>&gt; Really this idea that a distro (even a large well maintained one like Debian) has the resources to package a set of known versions of go&#x2F;node packages for common open source software seems wrong?<p>Yes, incredibly so. Picking after lazy developers to unbundle a library can require hours.<p>Backporting security fixes for hundreds of thousands libraries including multiple versions is practically impossible.<p>&gt; And no dev is going to downgrade some random dependency of their app just to comply with with Debian&#x27;s set of available versions.<p>Important systems will keep running in the next decades. Without the work from such developers.')
