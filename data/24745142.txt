How many people does something have to be able to kill before being banned?  The truck attack in France was deadlier than any mass shooting in America.<p>There are costs to freedom, including the potential for abuse.  Just like predictive policing is wrong because it goes after those who haven&#x27;t committed crimes, banning guns is wrong.  The death of a ten, a hundred, a thousand, or more people doesn&#x27;t justify restricting liberty.  All guns ought to be legal.')
