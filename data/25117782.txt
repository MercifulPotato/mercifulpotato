I suspect that very few people have been within 100&#x27; of any carpentry for their entire lives.<p>Working for the summer in jobs like this is mostly the preserve of college students, and only a small fraction of them at that - most will do very different kinds of summer jobs, if they do them at all (there&#x27;s lots of evidence that those kinds of summer jobs are now taken by adults already in the workforce).<p>Maybe you live in a more rural area that has lots of this sort of work available and lots of people doing it. As far as I know, that is unusual, and not &quot;normative&quot; for most of the population.<p>There&#x27;s normally a lot to write about no matter how &quot;normative&quot; or even mundane one&#x27;s life is. It&#x27;s not about the activities per se, but about how you reflect on them and connect them with other aspects of living. A classic example would be a book like &quot;House&quot; by Tracey Kidder, which documents in huge detail and considerable philosophical diversions a process that I suspect you would claim happens so frequently and repetitively that it&#x27;s not worth writing about. Millions of people disagreed with you.')
