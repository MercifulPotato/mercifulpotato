These are both simple stories of a vendor failing to meet a [presumably] written requirement: The customer, or regulator, required X, and vendor decided instead to provide Y, and then were dumbfounded when that was deemed unacceptable. OP&#x27;s vendor went farther, offering Z instead, and the customer again reminded them that X was required. It doesn&#x27;t really matter if there are better alternatives than X. Those alternatives are not part of the requirement.<p>Whether Y=X-1 or Z=X+1 is irrelevant. Customer requires X, you provide X or they&#x27;ll find another software vendor.')
