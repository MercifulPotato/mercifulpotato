That would be an advantage over (non-NIF) erlang for some use-cases. Do you plan something like that? Can you easily map a data structure in Rust? (I think is doable between WASM process but not sure about between WASM and native host).<p>Another question: What about sending code between process? Like sending a fun between Erlang process.<p>IMHO this architecture has the potential to go beyond BEAM, good work!')
