The work they describe is actually pretty reasonable, worthy of a real journal article or two, but only if you went into far more detail than the actual articles did. The company involved would never have agreed to that though, it would have given too much IP away, which is why they went for SPIE articles instead. I&#x27;ve seen some SPIE articles that are even worse, almost approaching advertising copy of a new product (our ones had a hint of that but they did at least give an overview of the research).<p>I don&#x27;t mean to suggest that they&#x27;re necessarily the very worst end of things. There does need to be a hint of research involved, and I imagine they would actually reject GPT3 text. Maybe they even have some serious academic research, especially in their historical subject of optics (as this graphene article is). But given they accept articles like the ones I&#x27;ve seen&#x2F;been involved in, the mere fact that an article is on SPIE doesn&#x27;t tell you anything more than it being a PDF on a random website.')
