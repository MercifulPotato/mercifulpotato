This is a choice you can make as your circumstance dictates.  Dark mode is a nice option for a few cases, but it should not be forced upon anyone.<p>There are two cases where dark mode is a really bad thing:<p>1. You&#x27;re presenting your content via a projector in a room full of people (and a room full of people will have some ambient light, because safety rules generally prohibit trapping a lot of people in pitch darkness).  No matter how many lumens the projector can put out, they will not make your low contrast content as visible as light mode would have been.  Most often, the ambient light of the room will completely wash out the low contrast projected image.<p>2. You&#x27;re making a screen recording of your content to demo or educate others (Youtube, etc.).  The low contrast, colorful text will not compress as accurately as light mode, so the resulting text will be blurrier than if it were in light mode.  So it will be harder to read compared to light mode content.  Plus, if your viewer happens to be in a bright room or outside, your content will be unreadable.  You&#x27;ve just wasted your good effort by limiting your audience.<p>Edited typos :(')
