Vendors to pay to make the goods they&#x27;re selling. When you attach a bank account, it usually takes ~3 business days from card processed to accessible cash. This isn&#x27;t Stripe&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s bank transfer ACH&#x27;s fault.<p>By offering sellers a built-in checking account, Stripe (and in turn Shopify) can decrease the time it takes to access money you&#x27;ve been paid. Same-day or next-day access, huge deal.<p>edit: I&#x27;ll add, Stripe already offers immediate access to cash (Instant Transfers), but they charge 1.5% because technically they&#x27;re extending credit. Stripe is eating their own lunch here. People won&#x27;t need Instant Transfers as often and their profit margin on the interest sitting in the checking accounts will be much lower than the 1.5% fee they currently charge for Instant Transfer. But much bigger market.')
