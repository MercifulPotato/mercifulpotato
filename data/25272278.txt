The stuff that&#x27;s hot in a fusion reactor will be far more complex than the stuff in a fission reactor, which is technically very simple.<p>The reliability is costly, regardless of the reason for it.<p>Of course power density matters.  The cost of manufactured items is related to their size, and fusion reactor cores will be far larger than fission reactor cores (as well as being far more intricate).   Are you saying this 10-100x larger size will NOT be reflected in the cost?<p>Renewables have lower power density, but also allow omission of entire parts of a thermal power plant.   No steam turbines, no heat exchangers, no cooling systems.   They also tolerate far less reliable components, because failure affect just a small part of the overall output of a field of turbines or PV modules.')
