When a person finds a way to deploy resources more efficiently, to meet other people’s needs better and with improved efficiency, society has feedback looks that divert more resources to that persons control so they can do so at increased scale.<p>Isn’t that what we want?<p>Just a week ago or so on Reddit someone posted imagining how much good Elon could do with his Billions. I replied that yes, maybe he could devote those resources to push forward electrification of transport to mitigate global warming, invest heavily is solar power technology and devote resources to trying to create a future for humanity in space.<p>Well, of course, that’s exactly what he’s doing.
