Google is really annoying there because of AMP but if you search something like “3d printing layer shift Reddit” you will get a full page of results from Reddit and they are relevant. DDG will return about 3 even though there are clearly more, and the rest aren’t Reddit results. So for this kind of search Google produces better results but shittier experience. Still, I will take DDG for this and switch to Google if I really can’t find what I need in the first three results.')
