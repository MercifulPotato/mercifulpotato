Run-flats aren&#x27;t just a problem in the countryside.  My wife&#x27;s BMW doesn&#x27;t have a spare.  Run-flats are only good to ~50mph and 50 miles when flat.<p>So what happens when you blow out the sidewall on a Friday evening on an interstate in suburban NY?  You call AAA, wait 3 hours in the pouring rain, and get towed the nearest tire dealer (that&#x27;s already closed for the day), check into the hotel across the street, and then miss out on the Saturday activities you had planned while you wait for the tire shop to open and get your tire replaced.<p>I&#x27;ll never buy a car without a spare again.  Run-flats are nearly useless unless you just happen to be near a tire shop during open hours.')
