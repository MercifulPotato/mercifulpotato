The B section, on the bottom-right quarter of the page, starts for the first time at 0:40 in the YT recording and goes to 1:08 or so.  The C section, which is mostly crammed into the left half of the bottom two double-staves but also some stuff in the middle-left of the page, runs about 1:48 to 2:43.')
