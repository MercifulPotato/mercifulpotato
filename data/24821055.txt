I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore about charging battery packs. I always have the lights on, no matter what. I just don&#x27;t think about it now, I know it&#x27;s on.\nDecent quality wet trousers, overshoes and jacket are also a great addition. I don&#x27;t mind leaving home or work when it&#x27;s raining and I know I will be dry enough at the end ; apart for face and hands. Which makes me think that a proper pair of gloves should be next.<p>Wet stones to sharpen my knives. Although I probably don&#x27;t sharpen them often enough, I do enjoy the process and having razor sharp blades afterwards is very pleasing.')
