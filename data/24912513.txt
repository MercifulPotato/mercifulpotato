Could I ask you for any more recommendations?!<p>I have background in standard undergrad math (linear algebra, calculus, real analysis, etc) and some basic undergrad CS, and I work as a software engineer (backend web stuff). However I&#x27;ve never really studied formal logic, or theoretical CS, or formal methods &#x2F; verification, or type theory, and I was thinking of doing so. I enjoy studying math&#x2F;theoretical things for its own sake, but I am of course also interested in techniques which might touch upon software engineering in practice.<p>Do you have any opinions on whether I am proposing something at all sensible for myself, and if so what sort of order to take things in?<p>Any recommended sources of exercises to work on (with solutions? seeing as I might well be self-studying)<p>Or lecture courses, or anything available online (even if it costs money)<p>Online communities you&#x27;d recommend for asking for help, e.g. with problems encountered in self-study?<p>And any more recommended books&#x2F;lecture notes of course.')
