That that was just a +3 &#x2F; +1 affair.  But...<p>Look at all the House races. Repubs won <i>all</i> the red-leaning districts, nearly all the purple ones, and even some light-blue ones.  They did better than expected in all states including the ones where 45 lost in the Presidential race.<p>If you&#x27;re going to steal the election of the President via a comprehensive, super-sneaky, multi-state conspiracy, <i>why the fuck</i> would you also not also steal House and Senate seats?  That makes no goddamn sense.  You&#x27;re going to alter ballots, inject fake ballots, etc., etc., etc., and not bother with the Congress and local elections too?<p>Moronic.  Totally moronic.  How fucking stupid do you have to be to believe that <i>only</i> the Presidential race was stolen, but everything else was fine.<p>Who out there is a supporter of 45, that believes the Dems <i>don&#x27;t</i> hate Moscow Mitch nearly as much as 45 himself?  Or Louie Gomert, Devin Nunes, Matt Gates, or the other lackeys?  &quot;Yeah, let&#x27;s steal the election for Biden, but then leave in place all the other assholes. Great idea!  That will work out perfectly!&quot;<p>Morons.')
