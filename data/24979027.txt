Happy with them.<p>As for AOSP forks there&#x27;s a lot of them, not all equally ready. There&#x27;s CopperheadOS, there&#x27;s &#x2F;e&#x2F;.<p>There&#x27;s also PostmarketOS which is like a mobile Linux foundation for other OSes much like Mer was. There&#x27;s SFOS (SailfishOS) which has Android emulation (if licensed), and all kind of mobile versions of Linux distributions such as Manjaro, Arch, Debian, Ubuntu, PureOS, etc. If you&#x27;re into that, Pinephone might be interesting. They got 13 OSes ready to be loaded.')
