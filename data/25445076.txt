Have you seen M1[1] this year?<p>There is definitely more supply, but is it too much? Can&#x27;t this be the result of decisions that maintain the value?<p>If that money is just somewhere on the books, but people don&#x27;t have more money to spend, then the value of things remains stable.<p>The value of money depends not only on the amount of available money but also on the velocity with which it is spent. As far as I know, credit cards have increased the velocity by which people are spending money which increased the supply of money and stimulated the economy.<p>Now, during this crisis, do people spend money with the usual velocity? If not, then that reduced speed has to be compensated by supplying more money.')
