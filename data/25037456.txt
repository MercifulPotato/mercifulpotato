I forget which ones, but they say the anatomy of the maxilla (the upper jawbone which forms the nose) is key to breathing.  And dentists talk about a &quot;constricted arch&quot; which I think is a related issue.  I don&#x27;t think I have these issues so I didn&#x27;t pay particular attention there.<p>The way I think about it is that breathing is a big geometry problem, and everyone is a little different, and every medical provider has their own viewpoint, and set of solutions they can apply.  For example I don&#x27;t think Nestor has the same problems that I have.  He talks about his problems in the YouTube video and in the book.<p>So you will probably have to look around a lot.  It&#x27;s a big topic.  But the common point is that almost all humans have problems breathing, but it manifests in different ways depending on the unique geometry of their head.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like if you crushed 100 pumpkins, not all of them are going to be crushed in the same way, but they&#x27;ll all have some problem ...<p>And it depends on medical history -- a lot of people seem to have bad breathing because of childhood orthodontic work.<p>e.g. I found this person through Google:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.righttogrow.org&#x2F;mf_s_story" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.righttogrow.org&#x2F;mf_s_story</a><p><i>When I was a young girl I had orthodontic extractions and wore a cervical headgear that pulled my upper jaw back and made my oral cavity much smaller than nature intended it to be.  Before this treatment, I was a fit and healthy child who had no problems sleeping and waking up.  After extractions and headgear, part of my vitality went away and I lived a life of constant fatigue, plagued with fainting spells and low energy for more than twenty years</i><p>Feel free to reach out by e-mail if you learn anything interesting about your case!')
