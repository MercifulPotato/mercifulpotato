See the sentence in my other comment where I addressed your reply: <i>If we actually did contact tracing, illegal crossings of infected people would be easy enough to deal with.</i><p>Sure, we&#x27;d have to actually do something, but it would take less resources than we are expending on medical care, for instance.<p>The countries with low infection levels don&#x27;t need to maintain it for all that much longer, we have effective vaccines. Probably 6 months (At which point they will likely have vaccinated much of their populations).')
