For some people, they perceive their problem to be that they don&#x27;t smell the way they want to smell, or the way they think other people want them to smell. An ad that says &quot;this smell water smells the way you want to smell&quot; will help solve their problem.<p>In this sense, to &quot;solve&quot; advertising, you can&#x27;t just avoid advertising things that don&#x27;t solve problems, you need to address the underlying causes for the perception of countless problems that may or may not actually be relevant&#x2F;rational etc.')
