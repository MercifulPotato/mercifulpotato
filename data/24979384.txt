But by wasting mass amounts of paper over and over again, we can remove a lot of carbon from the air. As we chop down more and more trees to make paper and bury the paper in a landfill, new trees grow up which get turned to paper which gets buried and taken out of the system.<p>So waste paper if you want to save the planet, because paper may kill a tree, but that tree will grow back, and the paper will sit in a landfill petrified.')
