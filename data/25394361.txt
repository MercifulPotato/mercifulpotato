In the book he realizes the mutants are the new humans, he is the outsider. To them, <i>he</i> is the monster, the one who steals their children while they sleep and experiments on them.<p>The title refers to he himself being a legend, something from a previous age.<p>I love the movie and love it, especially the DC with the additional endings but in this case the book really is the better medium IMHO')
