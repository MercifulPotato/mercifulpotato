I merely observed that he was probably half my age; he talked and behaved rather immaturely.<p>I work with younger folks all the time and 90% of them are perfectly fine; actually I enjoy their energy and drive (and there are plenty of older jerks out there).  This guy, I didn&#x27;t enjoy. When I hung up the phone, I was not angry, as I recall.  Just disappointed that a great company would have such petty people vetting applicants.  You don&#x27;t have to agree with me. I&#x27;m not even sure what we&#x27;re arguing about at this point; if you&#x27;re just trying to prove I&#x27;m a jerk... fine, I was a jerk that day.  Happy now?\nHave a nice day. I don&#x27;t work at Amazon and I&#x27;m having a wonderful day :)')
