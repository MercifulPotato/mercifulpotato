I acknowledge that Europeans shouldn&#x27;t have taken the land for themselves centuries ago, but why are there still people today who believe they have an ancestral right to a piece of land? Why can&#x27;t these populations just integrate into the US instead of trying to preserve their cultures from migration? Why is this kind of ethnocentric thinking still acceptable in the 21st century America?<p>The reason I ask is because I see a lot of European nationalists here in Europe asking for similar treatment to native peoples and it&#x27;s hard to say their arguments are not genuine when you guys in America are tolerating nationalism from other non-European groups. What exactly do you say to a British nationalist who wants claim a piece of land in Britain to protect his &quot;people&quot; and culture from non-British arrivals like native Americans? Is this a backwards, racist concern, or a genuine one?<p>I should note I am highly autistic. I&#x27;m not trying to be cruel here. I&#x27;ve just always found the concern for indigenous cultures and land highly contradictory and want to understand the US perspective better.')
