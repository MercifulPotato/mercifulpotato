I can work from home, and currently do, but much prefer working in an office. I&#x27;m more productive when I&#x27;m in the office. It&#x27;s easier to get into and stay in a more focused headspace. There&#x27;s also a lot of relevant context and info that I pick up just by being around the office that I don&#x27;t have when working remotely.')
