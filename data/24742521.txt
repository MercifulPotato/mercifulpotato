I think what the author is doing is defining <i>a world view</i> - especially, any fairly established world view is going to determine which questions are important, which order they should be asked in and so-forth.<p>Edit: Especially, &quot;Is there a God?&quot; is one of the first questions asked and answered in certain world views including the authors&#x27; but by no means all. &quot;Should you even start by considering a potential God&quot; is another question one can ask.')
