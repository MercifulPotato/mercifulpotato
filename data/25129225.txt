The major problem SF has had for a long time is housing is too expensive.  People leaving the city will help counter this, which is going to probably benefit the city in the long term.<p>In the short term though SF is still an expensive place to live and you aren&#x27;t getting nearly the benefit because SF, like all cities, is just a shell of itself right now.<p>To imagine that once the Pandemic is over SF will not burst back into life is crazy.  SF is a wonderful city due to its weather, geography, culture, density, parks, public transit, and many other great things about it.  One bad year is not going to destroy the city.<p>And many people not in the tech community have been a little upset at the monoculture that seemingly has developed in the past 10 years related to the tech boom.  Guess what... If a bunch of those tech companies leave, the city is going to be less of a monoculture.  That&#x27;s good!  Change isn&#x27;t always bad.')
