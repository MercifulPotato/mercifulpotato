On a 7x24 production server, it&#x27;s very unlikely, time is always slewed. But a standard leap second implementation <i>requires</i> the addition or deletion of time via adjtimex()&#x27;s TIME_INS and TIME_DEL, it&#x27;s not adjusted gradually.<p>&gt; <i>I better start fuzzing and catch up</i><p>Yes, you probably can force ntpd to ignore the leap second insertion and also force NTP to slew time only. This approach is similar to leap second smearing (which is considered a violation of standard but nevertheless an useful hack to ignore the problem altogether). But it requires manual configuration, by default the first standard approach is used.<p>So the bottom-line is: Time will be forcefully stepped head by 1 second. I&#x27;m not sure what the consequences would be for various services, perhaps not much, but my worry is the interactions in a complex application can produce unexpected outcomes. Also, how many systems have implemented the negative leap second in the code path? And are they all tested?')
