With a few ads like &quot;[3rd party candidate] is TOO CONSERVATIVE for Congress!&quot; delivered to the right audiences, you could swing margins meaningfully [his campaign has paid for such targeted Facebook ads]. It&#x27;s disgusting bad faith, but it&#x27;s in the bounds of the game for now, so not doing it is foolish.')
