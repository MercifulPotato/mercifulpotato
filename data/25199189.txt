But balancing that risk against other factors has to be a political and&#x2F;or personal tradeoff. There&#x27;s no way it could be otherwise. Science, even if it could provide perfect information, doesn&#x27;t have the tools to make policy <i>decisions</i>. Whether schools should be wide-open, hybrid, or remote only is not a scientific decision although, of course, whatever scientific data is known or thought to be known should of course factor into any decision.')
