The left is the high within society aligned with the low in society to destroy the middle in society. [1]<p>When the power of the upper class is not secure, or somehow threatened by a middle class, the upper class forms an alliance with the lower classes. Today, you see the highly capitalized media powers (like Big Tech and primary media corporations) and other &quot;woke&quot; corporations forming an &quot;alliance of the fringes&quot; with historically marginalized groups, against the more traditionalist middle class. In the past, Kings would form an alliance with peasants to fend off nobles.<p>Bertrand de Jouvenel described this dynamic early in the 20th century, but it&#x27;s a common refrain throughout history.<p>Neoabsolutism is a modern framework for understanding this dynamic.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neoabsolutism.wordpress.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;03&#x2F;high-low-versus-the-middle&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neoabsolutism.wordpress.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;03&#x2F;high-low-vers...</a>')
