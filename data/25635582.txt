The inflation is pretty evident in the stock market and real-estate, which are the assets being bought up. Consumerism and efficiency in delivering consumer goods has kept pace with inflation. It&#x27;s there (from QE), just not where you&#x27;re measuring. It will seep into others over time (like agri) as food supply needs to increase. Luckily, with global warming, land that was good for farming and living has been affected negatively (floods, droughts, etc) allowing people, farmers and meat to move farther north. eg The cattle that now sit on the California central valley land instead of southern CA like the city of Corona. The land is relatively cheap north, much to the chagrin of Idaho natives and such, who face a deluge of immigrants with relatively vast wealth.<p>Food subsidies and the aforementioned weather have kept food prices relatively low...although you might notice that non-McDonalds food will cost you about 10$ a meal, as food prices have doubled in 11 years. Give it a bit more time.<p>Now that the QE has ramped up to ridiculous levels, you can sit back and watch the inflation continue at 4x instead of 2x for the most affected verticals.')
