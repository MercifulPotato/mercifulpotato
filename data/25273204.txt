Procreate is the only app I&#x27;ve used that comes close to capturing what it&#x27;s like to write on paper, but it&#x27;s really not designed for that use case. The rest of my writing goes into google docs, commit messages, and markdown files. I am using paper less over time, but I think that may just be a side effect of my work atm.')
