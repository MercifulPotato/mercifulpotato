Not as a matter of personal bragging but to point out that kids in absense of formal teaching methods may absorb many things.<p>Immersion learning is used and studied mostly for foreign languages but I wonder about how effective it proves in general for small children given vs trying to teach them actively and leaving them to observe it.
