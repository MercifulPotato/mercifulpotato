Your liver must cleave the lysine before the d-amp is released giving a smooth release, taking ~3.5 hours till you hit max blood concentration.<p>Fun fact: Methamphetamine naturally takes 3-3.5 hours to hit peak so Vyvanse has a more “meth-like” concentration curve as opposed to raw d-amp (or adderal which is 75% d-amp 25% l-amp) which hits way sooner. As an aside, Meth is very misunderstood and is in many ways a more ideal ADHD drug than normal amphetamine; and indeed it can be prescribed under the brand name Desoxyn. Methamphetamine when taken in low-moderate oral doses is completey safe and <i>less</i> jittery than amphetamine, but if abused (say, smoking 100mg d-meth) it becomes far more neurotoxic.<p>Understanding enantiomers (left-handed vs right-handed molecules in this case) is really important. For amp &#x2F; methamp, the d enantiomer is 3-4x more powerful by weight yet is more cerebral as opposed to causing peripheral (body) stimulation. So d is almost always superior, although with adderall it has been found that the 75&#x2F;25 d&#x2F;l formula synergizes and has a bit longer half life')
