The only two &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; being analyzed are the disbelief in climate change and the distrust of officialdom (which includes media and politicians). Scientists disagree with each other on many topics, so distrusting them doesn&#x27;t cross the line of conspiracy theory. Media, on both sides of the political spectrum, is quite biased and low quality these days; so distrusting the media is also quite reasonable.<p>Not to mention, both topics, and especially the climate change, has a huge political connotation. So the answers of people would often be merely a reflection of their political beliefs.<p>Why not pick the real, obvious, non-political conspiracy theories? Like 9&#x2F;11 didn&#x27;t happen; people didn&#x27;t land on the Moon; earth is flat; etc?')
