It&#x27;s not doing anything at all for M1&#x27;s general performance.<p>The main reason for M1&#x27;s performance is just that Apple managed to get an 8-wide CPU to work &amp; be fed. That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s the entirety of the story of the M1. Apple got 8-wide to work, while Intel &amp; AMD are still 4-wide. ARM&#x27;s fixed length instructions are helping a ton there, but Apple also put in work to feed it.<p>All the other shit about specialized units &amp; unified memory &amp; vertical integration is all irrelevant and mostly wrong. The existing Intel Macbook Airs are all unified memory with specialized hardware units for specialized tasks, too (Intel QuickSync is 9 years old now - dedicated silicon for the specialized task of video encoding). Apple did absolutely nothing new or interesting on that front. Other than marketing. They are magic at marketing. And also magic at making a super wide CPU front-end, with really good cache latency numbers.')
