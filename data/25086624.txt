Travel bans and negative press alone are enough to pressure countries reliant on tourism to respond differently than they normally would have.<p>Also the examples you listed are mostly island nations, USA and EU have basically open uncontrolled borders between members of the union so it&#x27;s very hard to control migratory spreading.')
