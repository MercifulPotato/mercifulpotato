All facts and rational judgment point to a free and fair election, which means that people open to rational debate already know that it was free and fair. The people who still doubt the legitimacy of the election are not arguing rationally, but rather based on feelings and belief, and above all a desire for a different outcome. I certainly understand being disappointed with an election result, but it&#x27;s disingenuous to sublimate that disappointment into a baseless argument that the election was unfair.<p>The capitol riot was not the logical consequence of a group of rational people protesting an illegitimate election foisted by a tyrannical regime. It was, instead, an outpouring of irrational emotion, draped in the language of revolution against tyranny.')
