More to the point, even the feds aren&#x27;t saying that.  All they&#x27;re saying he did was point his gun.  And that he was shot coming out of his apartment.  And it doesn&#x27;t sound like the cops announced themselves loudly enough for witnesses to hear.<p>Why why weren&#x27;t there body cams and dash cams?  Those readily-available evidence-gathering tools that are so necessary to deliver the accused to justice?  Can we corroborate the police&#x27;s accounts with hard evidence?  No, for some reason, none of them thought that would be important.  Ain&#x27;t destruction of evidence if you don&#x27;t collect it... no, you&#x27;re not going to convince me that Reinoehl&#x27;s death wasn&#x27;t an execution.<p>Rittenhouse attempted to turn himself in, but was actually turned away.  Reinoehl claimed self defense, but his victim was armed with a knife, not a plastic bag.  It&#x27;s true that Rittenhouse got hit by a skateboard later, but that was folks rightly defending themselves from an active shooter.<p>The problem with the cops isn&#x27;t just racism, it&#x27;s the whole authoritarianism thing too.  Fascists love the cops and cops love them.<p>And the president celebrates the &quot;hero&quot; for murdering a person who threw a plastic bag.')
