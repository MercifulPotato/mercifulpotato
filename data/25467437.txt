Urbanization and capitalism eventually overturned this system with most of the vestiges wiped out after WW1 when many monarchies became republics. It existed mostly in the middle ages up to the 1700s&#x2F;1800s and was eroded unevenly around the world (notably the USSR confronted the system directly in 1917).')
