Not sure which industry you are in, maybe banking? As a software engineer, when I do interviews and a guy walks in in a suit, that&#x27;s nowadays a counterindicator. It has turned out to negatively correlate with interview performance. In my experience, dressed-up people in interviews tend to be just very inexperienced at best (somebody at their universities interview training course put &quot;dress i a suit on some slide&quot; an they didn&#x27;t question that) or downright incompetent at worst (they are unable to understand nuanced context, draw conclusions and use them to make an improvement going forward).')
