Whether or not that needs fixing is another question but it&#x27;s totally bizarre to say &quot;if you ignore all the reasons why women are often in positions where they receive less pay that men don&#x27;t have to deal with, there isn&#x27;t a gap&quot;.<p>(To be clear: whether or not this pay gap needs addressing is its own question entirely. It makes total sense to me that a woman needs time off to recover from giving birth or from health complications during pregnancy.)')
