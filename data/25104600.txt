But they do have access to fundamentally off-limits cultural forms through the Internet that serve the same mythical function. They have access to historical information about systems that were ostensibly opposed to the current paradigm. In societal systems that are neither compassionate nor just, those suffering will look towards other systems to fulfill these ideals. While this is a major simplification, leftists have Communism and the rightists have Fascism. However, the United States state security apparatus was really, really effective at destroying the actual living cultural forms[^12] of these during the mid-60s and through the near present, and made their public social promulgation impossible (barring extremely insular communities like universities and prisons). The Internet has fundamentally changed this. Books that were previously impossible to find are publicly and immediately available digitally. Pamphlets, speeches, ideas, and memes that were publicly impossible to hold now have social venues. They have communities. They have reading groups. They have <i>voluntary propaganda departments</i> that are targeting people already ripe for indoctrination.<p>From Jacques Ellul&#x27;s <i>&quot;Propaganda: The Formation of Men&#x27;s Attitudes&quot;</i>:<p>&gt; Propaganda tries to surround man by all possible routes in the realm of feelings as well as ideas, by playing on his will or on his needs, through his conscious and his unconscious, assailing him in both his private and his public life. It furnishes him with a complete system for explaining the world, and provides immediate incentives to action. We are here in the presence of an organized myth that tries to take hold of the entire person. Through the myth it creates, propaganda imposes a complete range of intuitive knowledge, susceptible of only one interpretation, unique and one-sided, and precluding any divergence. This myth becomes so powerful that it invades every arena of consciousness, leaving no faculty or motivation intact. It stimulates in the individual a feeling of exclusiveness, and produces a biased attitude.<p>The main bulwark against the integration of these digital radicalized personae into people&#x27;s normal daily existence has been that the &quot;adult&quot; political discourse simply didn&#x27;t allow for it. In the last two decades the 24-hour news cycle, the rise of popular think pieces over neutral reporting, and Super-PAC-indoctrination have stripped every notion of good faith between political actors, their constituents, and their rivals. This was a powder-keg that the election of Barack Obama sparked for the right-wing and Donald Trump sparked off for the left. Now yellow journalism, astroturfing, and echo chambers are in total control of where the discourse travels in either direction. Neither side has any incentive to reduce the invective lest the other side win. Both sides have villanized their opponents so much by this point that the social penalty for not displaying tokens of loyalty is the same as actually being a member of the opposite group, effectively creating an extremely narrow opinion corridor[^13] on anything if you don&#x27;t want to be considered a gulag-sending Stalinist or a jew-baiting Nazi merely by association.<p>The truth is that all signs point to some form of despotism coming to America[^14].<p>A final quote:<p><i></i>From &quot;They Thought They Were Free&quot; by Milton Mayer<i></i><p>&gt; National Socialism was a revulsion by my friends against parliamentary politics, parliamentary debate, parliamentary government--against all the higgling and the haggling of the parties and the splinter parties, their coalitions, their confusions, and their conniving. It was the final fruit of the common man&#x27;s repudiation of &quot;the rascals.&quot; It&#x27;s motif was, &quot;Throw them all out.&quot; My friends, in the 1920&#x27;s, were like spectators at wrestling match who suspect that beneath all the grunts and groans, the struggle and sweat, the match is &quot;fixed,&quot; that the performers are only pretending to put on a fight. The scandals that rocked the country, as one party or cabal &quot;exposed&quot; another, dismayed and then disgusted my friends. (One sensed some of this reaction against the celebrated Army-McCarthy hearing in the United States in 1954--not against one side or another but against &quot;the whole thing&quot; as &quot;disgusting&quot; or &quot;disgraceful.&quot;)<p>&gt; While the ship of the German State was being shivered, the officers, who alone had life-preservers, disputed their prerogatives on the bridge. My friends observed that none of the non-Communist, non-Nazi leaders objected to the 35,000 Reichsmark salaries of the cabinet ministers; only the Communists and Nazi objected.<p>---<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Information_cascade" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Information_cascade</a><p>2 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Social_proof" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Social_proof</a><p>3 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chilling_effect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chilling_effect</a><p>4 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mannerofspeaking.org&#x2F;2010&#x2F;05&#x2F;12&#x2F;some-chilling-public-speaking-history" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mannerofspeaking.org&#x2F;2010&#x2F;05&#x2F;12&#x2F;some-chilling-public...</a><p>5 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hyperreality" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hyperreality</a><p>6 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=P2OtFprM3No" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=P2OtFprM3No</a><p>7 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gaslighting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gaslighting</a><p>8 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Learned_helplessness" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Learned_helplessness</a><p>9 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Impostor_syndrome" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Impostor_syndrome</a><p>10 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fear_of_missing_out" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fear_of_missing_out</a><p>11 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Survivor_guilt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Survivor_guilt</a><p>12 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;COINTELPRO" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;COINTELPRO</a><p>13 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Opinion_corridor#Overview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Opinion_corridor#Overview</a><p>14 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1Ayxot9vQ_k" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1Ayxot9vQ_k</a>')
