Item(by='aeturnum', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612203489, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25986452, text='For any given area, you will always be able to find an answer to &quot;who&#x27;s in charge here?,&quot; but I think there needs to be some degree of comprehensiveness and inclusion to call that authority &quot;society.&quot;<p>For instance - in colonial states the &quot;authority&quot; is the colonial administrator - who are almost totally separate from the &quot;society&quot; of the country. I should have been more clear with terms in my first post. Trying again:<p>Strong human rights protections help guarantee that the administrative power of a state spends some time including all the people within its borders. Once those rights fall away, the chance of the state becoming more exclusionary and focused on the rights of a limited subset of the people within its borders seems high.<p>A military junta, for instance, is primarily concerned with keeping the military in power and doesn&#x27;t devote attention or resources to much else.')
