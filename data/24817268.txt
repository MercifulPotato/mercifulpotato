And it&#x27;s nowhere near as contagious as this Coronavirus?<p>&gt;Conversely, herd immunity isn&#x27;t a magic barrier: infections can go beyond herd immunity thresholds in situations where the rate at which infections are happening is high.<p>But this is kind of my point, without human intervention the virus is arguably still around even though not in at the pandemic level.<p>Basically we had &quot;luck&quot; that these virus haven&#x27;t followed a mutation path that spins them into a pandemic, but they are still around and they infect people.
