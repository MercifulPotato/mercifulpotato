I&#x27;m aware of the safety disparity but nevertheless I still think this is a nice place. There are also places in Toronto that I wouldn&#x27;t go to. Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve been beaten up randomly in Toronto but not in San Francisco. Anecdotally again, I&#x27;ve seen people shoot up in Toronto but not in San Francisco.<p>&gt; Are you trolling? Those are the nice neighborhoods!<p>Your assertion was that SF is not a nice place. Those neighborhoods are what SF is to many people, including myself. To me, SF is a nice place with bad parts. To you, it seems to be a bad place with nice parts.<p>&gt; And BTW wtf are you doing going for walks and doing &quot;many things&quot; in the middle of a pandemic!? Goddamnit dude.<p>I don&#x27;t know if anyone has told you, but we&#x27;ve been allowed to go on walks. Even in the current lockdown, you are permitted to walk to a park.')
