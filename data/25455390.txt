It consists of two parts: the main function and the printf function. The main function is the first function called when your program starts running. It is responsible for starting all other functions and initializing everything that needs to be initialized before your program starts doing anything useful. The printf function is responsible for printing text to the screen. In this case, it prints &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the screen.\n    \n    The main Function\n    \n    The main function must have one argument which is an integer that represents how many arguments were passed into it from the command line (if any). The following code shows a simple main function:\n\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n        printf(&quot;Hello World!n&quot;);\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    This code will print &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the screen when executed.\n\n    Let&#x27;s go over each line of this code:\n\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n    This line tells the compiler to include stdio.h in our program so we can use its functions (like printf ).\n\n    int main(int argc, char *argv[])\n    This declares a new variable called main . It has two arguments: argc and argv . These are special variables that are used by C programs to pass information into their functions from their command line arguments (if any). We&#x27;ll talk more about them later on in this tutorial when we cover how to use command line arguments with your programs. For now, just know that they&#x27;re there so we can use them later on if we need them! ;-)\n\n    printf(&quot;Hello World!n&quot;);\n    This line calls our friend printf . It tells it to print &quot;Hello World!&quot; followed by a newline character (the n at the end).\n\n    return 0;\n    This line returns 0 back into our calling environment (in this case, it&#x27;s our shell). If you don&#x27;t know what returning values means or why you would want to do it, don&#x27;t worry about it for now; just know that every C program must return a value back into its calling environment when it finishes running (we&#x27;ll talk more about this later on in this tutorial).\n</code></pre>\nPretty good, eh? (I just formatted the text for clarity.)')
