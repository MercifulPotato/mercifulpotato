The page displays that the new ::markers would be displayed before the ::before tag. It&#x27;s definitely a usable hack to have the pointer in the ::before section, but it should not be the way from the start. In between the &lt;ul&gt;&#x27;s should be just the displayed content, not the pointer.')
