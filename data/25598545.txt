Don&#x27;t just assert.  Explain.<p>From the article:<p>&gt; The whole idea of proof-of-work mining is broken the instant hardware comes out which is specialized for mining and useless for general computation because at that point the need to have compute power for other purposes is absolutely irrelevant in having any effect on mining, and there ceases to be any force that causes mining to be distributed around the world. It becomes a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; to find where people can get the cheapest electricity, and then mining anywhere else - anywhere the government tries to make sure ordinary people actually get the benefit from electricity bought for tax money, for example - becomes first pointless, then a net loss.<p>It&#x27;s the same story as some countries not having good quality coffee, avocados, quinoa, etc. because the export-quality goods are priced out of widespread domestic consumption.<p>With electricity production and distribution being a natural monopoly (and therefore typically regulated by the government), blockchain can&#x27;t escape the realities of foreign exchange rates and government control.')
