Item(by='CM30', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608504073, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25489164, text='&gt; But I think this article goes a bit too far in assuming that a significant number creators deserve an audience and an income that aren&#x27;t getting it now, enough to create a creator middle class. I wish that was the case, but in the time I spent working in arts and entertainment I canâ€™t support that view of the world.<p>Hmm, as someone working in the media in some fashion, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a huge number of creators that deserve an audience and income who aren&#x27;t getting it now. Those 6 or so lists of underrated gaming YouTubers I posted in the last few years should be evidence of that to some degree (though many of the people included did take off afterwards).<p>Every week or so I come across at least one creator who I believe should be much more successful than they currently are.')
