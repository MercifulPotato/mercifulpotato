The side effects could do more harm than the intended effects do good. So you need to do a large very controlled study with healthy people so you can more easily find side effects. Second, many side effects can be tolerated well by a healthy person but could be very dangerous in an at risk person. A drug that causes hypertension might not be a problem for a healthy person, but could kill someone with a heart condition. If you skipped this step, you could put people at risk of heart attacks and make it harder to detect the drugs effect on the heart vs already increased morbidity in those heart condition patients.<p>You are also evaluating the intended effects (as opposed to side effects), so you can see if it is actually doing what we want it to do, and how well. We could find out that the vaccine is very effective at preventing covid infections. But we could find out that it does not reduce the rate of covid infections, but does reduce the severity, or we could find out it does not reduce anything for reasons we donâ€™t yet understand.<p>Once that is done, we will have a good understand of A. the level of benefit and B. the level of harm. From there we can make an educated decision to proceed or not. If we do, then it is approved and given to the general population, including those at risk. It is at this stage that the effects on at risk groups can be studied, during the ongoing monitoring of the approved drug.<p>Hopefully this answers your question and shows why this is the best way to do it.')
