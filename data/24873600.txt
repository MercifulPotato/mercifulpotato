Item(by='holler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603484393, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24873031, text='&gt; I think they’re effectively ending the Hangouts brand in favor of Chat. And that includes tying Chat into Gmail. But also a separate Chat app. As for “Hangouts Chat”, which was a thing, I have no idea. I think that’s gone in favor of Hangouts which is now gone in favor of Chat. Again, I think.\nRooms is different. It’s group chat. I think. But it’s a part of Chat, I think. It’s also a part of Gmail which includes Chat, I think. Meet is like Chat for Enterprise with a focus on Rooms, I think. But I actually may be wrong there.<p>lol! good old Google. As it happens I&#x27;m working on my own chat-based discussion site, feel free to check it out. We won&#x27;t be renaming&#x2F;repackaging it every 6 months. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqwok.im" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqwok.im</a>')
