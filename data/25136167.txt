According to the results I&#x27;m seeing, in Missouri Trump got 56.9% and Biden got 41.3%. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone was predicting 8% less for Trump and more for Biden. That would have Biden <i>winning</i> Missouri, which would have been ridiculous. An 8% different prediction in the other direction also seems implausible. Perhaps you could link to the 538 prediction?')
