I don&#x27;t think this is realistic and you will be overcomplicating things for yourself if you try to do this. For things that don&#x27;t change often, having a static site has obvious benefits and Jamstack is well suited to build those parts of your site. For user generated content, you are better off just storing it somewhere else and loading it dynamically.')
