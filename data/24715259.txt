Stronger than, &quot;there is no evidence that is helpful in severe cases&quot; for example.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t happen to have a reference to back it up by any chance?<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m wondering why vitamin D is held to a higher standard than the polyclonal antibodies or Remdesivir.  Where is the evidence that they&#x27;re helpful in severe cases?<p>By the way, I&#x27;m not advocating for long-term, high-dose consumption (say over 2000 IU) consumption of vitamin D.<p>Deva Boone (devaboone) &#x27;s blog points out that this can lead to dangerously high calcium levels and has been covered on here several times recently [0][1]:<p>&gt;Eventually we worked out what happened with Shannon: In 2013 she was diagnosed with mild osteopenia, a thinning of the bones that can be a precursor to osteoporosis. Her Vitamin D was low at the time, so her physician started her on over-the-counter Vitamin D supplementation at 5000 international units (IUs) daily. Five years later, she was still on this dose, and her blood Vitamin D level had risen to 79 ng&#x2F;ml. This level is within what many labs call the normal range, between 30 and 100 ng&#x2F;ml, but levels above 70 are almost always a result of high dose supplementation, and I have seen toxicity with levels between 70 and 100 ng&#x2F;ml. (A better “normal range” based on what I have seen would probably be between 30 and 60.) Vitamin D builds up over time, so the longer someone is on a high dose, the more likely she is to develop toxicity. Shannon’s calcium levels began rising in the fall of 2018, when her severe symptoms developed.<p>What we should be doing <i>now</i> is mass-testing the at-risk population to identify those people with blood levels below 30 ng&#x2F;ml and then do what is necessary to bring them up into the 30 to 40 ng&#x2F;ml range.  Ideally that could be done with sunlight, or food high in vitamin D - for example oily fish, liver, dried-shitake, ...  But for the at risk demographic, in practice one would probably need moderately high-dose supplements, combined with monthly testing until they&#x27;re above 30 ng&#x2F;ml, followed by a switch to a lower-dose maintenance dose.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.devaboone.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;vitamin-d-part-2-shannon-s-story?postId=5f39453f8d01fe00170023fe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.devaboone.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;vitamin-d-part-2-shannon-s-st...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24261948" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24261948</a>')
