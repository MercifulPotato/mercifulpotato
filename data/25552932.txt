I&#x27;m tall and have huge hands, but I&#x27;ve seen the same approach work for quite small people. The actual technique you end up with can look quite different, but I think the goal is pedagogy that directs attention to the right things and let the rest fall in place around it.<p>&gt; you want the finger to land normal to the board for any given string.<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me why that would be.<p>I don&#x27;t have access to a music library anymore, so the Babitz stuff looks like it might be hard to find, but the Martinic-Jercic book looks really interesting. Thanks!<p>&gt; For me, what helped the most was removing the shoulder rest during practice.<p>When I decided I didn&#x27;t have time to maintain both a Baroque and a modern technique, I ended up merging them.
