It&#x27;s been riding the noise floor, probably all false positives, since then, usually between 1-3 per day. Something that&#x27;s not killing anyone is hard to describe as &quot;relatively dangerous&quot; unless you&#x27;re comparing it to some kind of unnatural lifestyle in which as much risk as possible has been removed.<p>The new &#x27;second waves&#x27; of COVID are not correlated with similar second waves of deaths. This is not predicted by any epidemiological model and frankly nobody seems able to satisfactorily explain it, but an increasing number of people testing positive may mean very little when the huge ramp up in testing and unknown&#x2F;untracked (!) false positive rate is considered. At any rate, it hardly justifies lockdowns.')
