Without TypeScript&#x27;s control flow analysis, it would be much less ergonomic to use and would probably lead to a lot of non-null `!` assertions everywhere. When writing correct code, you never notice that control flow analysis is there at all. A desirable feature, though as a result of operating in the background, few know how much TypeScript innovates in this area over other mainstream languages.')
