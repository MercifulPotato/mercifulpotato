Item(by='black_puppydog', descendants=None, kids=[25242494], score=None, time=1606597179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25238523, text='&gt; I&#x27;m working against the system instead of with it, and someone else is trying to boss me around.<p>This resonates with me a lot.<p>I started my first &quot;proper&quot; job this year, and the dev env we use is pretty run-off-the-mill: docker, TS, AWS...\nBut there is one big issue and that is that I had to switch to Windows a while back for driver reasons (looking at you, Dell and Intel) and this is the first time in over 9 year that I have used Windows proper. Not a fault of my employer I should add.<p>In academia, and at home, I have been running Linux for ~14 years by now, so I had skipped Windows 8 and this is my first contact with Windows 10. And while I appreciate how much more stable this system is than my XP from way back when, it feels <i>horrible</i>, and pretty much for the reasons described here.<p>It&#x27;s not that Linux was always smooth sailing, or that it was easy, or user friendly in the conventional sense. But there is a huge difference in my relationship to the system:<p>On Linux (and generally with FOSS software) whenever I hit a problem, if something didn&#x27;t work, I could be sure that it was not there because someone didn&#x27;t want me to be able to do it like that. It was always a lack of resources or insight, or both. And people and systems in FOSS are built to <i>enable</i> me to change things.<p>Working on windows, I tried setting up my PC in the way described in the article. Halfway through I realized that I was just fighting against the system, trying to make it do something it didn&#x27;t want.<p>Needless to say, MacOS is not an alternative to Windows for me. They&#x27;re both dead to me. Lesson learned, gonna vote with my money from now on. I started by ordering an MNT Reform for my personal use (not speedy enough for work) and I have been getting more into Rust and other tech that should allow me to get more and more of my daily activities out of the realm of &quot;will only run on top notch hardware because we couldn&#x27;t be arsed to think about performance.&quot;')
