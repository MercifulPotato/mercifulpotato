And I&#x27;m not even referring to the possible investment opportunity - rather just the opportunity to watch with open eyes as some of the foundational facets of human society are disrupted. I find the anti-BTC tone of the discussion here very disappointing but also very interesting (I can&#x27;t figure it out except through intellectual arrogance).<p>I offer the perspective: you hold a set of deeply held assumptions that are being actively questioned and poked at by this technology.
