Chapter 1 is titled &quot;Human Cognition&quot; and reads like notes to an introductory psychology textbook. This is not a bad thing (psychology is fun to read about), but I didn&#x27;t find any practical guidance about building software.<p>Chapter 2 is &quot;Cognitive Capitalism.&quot; Here, I find a lot of social and economic commentary, but again, no information that will actually assist me in writing software.<p>The same story plays out for basically every other chapter, until we hit the material about statistics in the second half.<p>Another way to say it is that the level of abstraction feels a bit off, resulting in the sense that the discussion is somewhat superficial and disconnected from practice. It&#x27;s like someone wrote a book on gardening that begins with a 200 page discussion of cell biology.')
