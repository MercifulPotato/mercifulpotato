Very interesting product and I&#x27;m really tempted to try it out. One suggestion to add to your documentation: you should mention drawbacks in your &quot;comparison&quot; pages.<p>For example, the page where you compare Plausible to Google Analytics lists only advantages and doesn&#x27;t indicate that Plausible could in any way be worse. But based on the description of how Plausible works, I&#x27;m fairly certain that people behind VPNs will not be properly counted (everyone with the same user-agent will be counted as if they were the same person). Use of VPNs is fairly widespread, so lack of fingerprinting will actually prevent you from accurately assessing how many visitors a site has.')
