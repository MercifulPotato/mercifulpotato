It&#x27;s fairly affordable (super cheap in USD), authentic, cool, there is more going on here in the summer than any American city except NY (even LA) and that&#x27;s saying a lot. Quebec speaks French and is protected from a lot of the US culture wars as there&#x27;s no hyper-scrutiny of some things here.<p>There are many interesting places in the US as well, but probably not so many big ones.')
