Item(by='mncharity', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603570444, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24880514, text='&gt; the lies we frequently tell our loved ones, our children, our coworkers, ourselves for the sake of genuine happiness. Are these lies morally problematic? [...] such half-truths are not only permissible but required in the living of a virtuous life.<p>One argument against lies, is they undermine people&#x27;s thoughtful engagement with the world.  To an uncontrollable extent.  Given the story, this paragraph on honesty for me has a flavor of &quot;here is one root cause my life&#x27;s difficulties... but I&#x27;m not yet ready to face that or change&quot;.  Though he does emphasize the topic (eg, &#x27;&quot;John, you with me?&quot; I think I nodded. It was a lie.&#x27;), so maybe WIP?')
