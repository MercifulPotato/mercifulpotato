There is a gap between average man vs woman attractiveness that has massively increased since the 80s.\nWhy? The natural gap is low but culturally and increasingly, women wear more and more sexier clothes while men do not.\nMoreover makeup has evolved and most &quot;ugly&quot; woman can appear sexy if they master the art of makeup, which again men culturally cannot. \nRegarding the first point I do believe men should wear sexier clothes to reduce the gap, even if that imply the need to shave. But it&#x27;s hard to change the accepted man aesthetics (e.g some people find Crop tops gays)\nRegarding makeup I mostly don&#x27;t believe men will use it before many decades or at best a subset of makeup.\nSo the gap will be reduced but still is and will remain high until a long time. Moreover it is increasing nowadays as tiktok and other social trends make heavy &quot;doll&quot; makeup mainstream.\nI imagine legalizing a safe (controlled) intake of testosterone could help men reduce the gap.')
