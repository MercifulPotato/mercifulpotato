Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25657023], score=None, time=1609934537, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25656680, text='&gt;&gt;Yes, the US has some extra administrative costs due to the billing nonsense of non taxpayer funded healthcare and overhead of health insurance companies, but bottom line is healthcare costs more in the US because everyone earns more top to bottom in the US, and supply of healthcare and medicine is constrained.<p>Right, but just like your healthcare professionals are paid an order of magnitude more than ours, you guys will be paying an order of magnitude more in taxes and healthcare costs. So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an excuse for the level of care provided in the US - yes, it&#x27;s more expensive, but you also pay more for it, so.....why is the experience worse?<p>And I mean, Polish supply of doctors and medicine is massively constrained too, that&#x27;s by no means a uniquely American problem to have.<p>&gt;&gt;I assume healthcare providers in Poland are also not subject to the legal liability they would be in the US.<p>I&#x27;m sure the deeper legal nouances of legal liabilities are of course not the same, but at least on the surface level it&#x27;s similar - of course you can sue a hospital for malpractice if it occurs, and you will be awarded damages.')
