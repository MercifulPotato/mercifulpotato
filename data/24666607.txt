Breaking into someone&#x27;s email account and exfiltrating their data - disgusting. Clicking &quot;OK&quot; on a 500 page ToS doesn&#x27;t get you out of this.<p>I&#x27;m so sick of this criminal behavior being brushed off as &quot;growth hacking&quot;, &quot;move fast and break things&quot;, or some other bullshit. The people creating this garbage should feel some shame and face real consequences.')
