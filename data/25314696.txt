It would be only ONE COMPANY that innovates from Photos to Messaging and Social. At least the Chinese and Russians have their own ecosystem otherwise the world will look like a very sad place with Big Brother Zuckerberg running Social, Messaging and Photos for the whole of humanity.<p>Please raise your voice as humanity we need each other to push. It&#x27;s not about voting for Democrats or Republican if humanity can&#x27;t exist with inclusive dignity online.')
