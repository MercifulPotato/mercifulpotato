It wasn&#x27;t the software that  mattered.. it was the solution to the problem...the software fetishists were hung up on the pedantry of the software while these people out here are writing anything that works and solving problems and making money and not giving a shit if the software looks pretty or has the latest language or framework.<p>Also, being in devops where you blend systems with development and you offload as much as possible to the SYSTEM instead of trying to emulate the system in software.<p>I think one of the best trends of software is it&#x27;s evolution as glue between already written systems that we&#x27;re seeing in cloud.<p>The writing is really beautiful. If the author is on this thread very nice work.')
