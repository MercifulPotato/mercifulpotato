In my experience, it&#x27;s most useful for unit tests - you identify a bug, write a unit test that triggers the bug, and run the unit test under gdb to poke around and understand what&#x27;s going on.<p>gdb and lldb don&#x27;t work great when run on the whole program, mainly because it&#x27;s hard to specify the actual behavior you want when debugging a system where multiple threads are executing concurrently. Almost all of our unit tests are single-threaded, so this isn&#x27;t a problem when debugging unit tests.<p>If you&#x27;re working on a C or C++ program and using a supported processor, I also highly recommend trying out rr[2], the record and replay debugger, which you mentioned in your comment. Unlike gdb, it&#x27;s reasonably easy to use and understand even if your program has lots of concurrency, and it pretty much eliminates the need to do &quot;printf&quot; debugging, since you can print variables from any line in your program without recompiling and re-running. You can still use the Emacs or TUI gdb interfaces when using &quot;rr replay&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourceware.org&#x2F;gdb&#x2F;current&#x2F;onlinedocs&#x2F;gdb&#x2F;TUI.html#TUI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourceware.org&#x2F;gdb&#x2F;current&#x2F;onlinedocs&#x2F;gdb&#x2F;TUI.html#T...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rr-project.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rr-project.org&#x2F;</a>')
