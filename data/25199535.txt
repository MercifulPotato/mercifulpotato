Channeling Clayton Christiansen, it&#x27;s a &quot;minimill&quot; that does a tiny part of the job, not well but adequately.<p>And it could be argued that most people don&#x27;t need the capabilities of MS Office.  Certainly no one person needs most of the features.  There are definitely small problems for which less is more.<p>Much as I hate using MS365 (back-compatible nightmare of poor UX decisions, too many features for <i>my</i> particular use case) my heart, and productivity, sinks when I have to use the gsuite tools.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that nobody has managed to really upend this market, not for lack of trying.  There must be huge institutional inertia.')
