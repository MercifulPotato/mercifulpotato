I find methodical comparisons quite scant. Anandtech has one page that includes the Ryzen 7 4800U and Ryzen 9 4900HS[0] for some synthetic integer&#x2F;floating point benchmarks. In many cases the Apple Silicon M1 outperforms the Ryzen 7 4800U and in several it outperforms the Ryzen 9 4900HS. It&#x27;s a bit difficult to extract from that how well they compete across all workloads, but it looks like they are quite comparable.<p>(And this is from someone who spends a lot of time trying to correct the misconception that the M1 outperforms <i>all</i> competitive processors.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested&#x2F;5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a>')
