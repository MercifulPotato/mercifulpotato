Preposterous. That&#x27;s not how businesses work. Businesses pay the lowest possible salaries regardless of how much money they make. If they are paying high salaries that&#x27;s because that&#x27;s what it takes to hire the top talent. The laws of supply and demand come into play here, not generosity.')
