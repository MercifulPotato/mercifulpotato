The public square analogy makes much more sense here. But even then, in a lot of places there are impartiality requirements on media outlets, as flawed as they may be.<p>Let me use your analogy, though.<p>Let&#x27;s say there are many newspapers in town. Is it fair for me to refuse to publish certain things? Sure.<p>What if I own the only newspaper in town? It gets more complicated. But hey, perhaps the town has a thriving samizdat culture, so maybe it&#x27;s fine.<p>But then what if I start buying out every printing press in town? And on top of that, what if I&#x27;m pressured by the mayor to not publish something? This is a big issue now, right?<p>How can that situation be addressed? People often suggest regulating that sole paper, but to me the answer is taking steps to ensure that we never end up with one newspaper in town. And we definitely don&#x27;t let that paper control all of the printing presses.')
