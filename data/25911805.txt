Which means, you are making an un-falsifiable statement and the burden of proof is on you.<p>As another person replied, the evidence for &quot;voter liberation&quot; has been evaluated in the court and found lacking.<p>PS: Which is another sad thing.. that the claims are fraud are really that they allowed more legal voters to vote. Such a pitiful state of democracy.')
