If marriage has a social purpose, to channel and direct human sexuality in a way that promotes social cohesion and provides for a man&#x27;s progeny, then gay marriage is nonsense.<p>This is patently false. Which is more conducive towards social cohesion? having 1&#x2F;25 of the population be entirely sexually repressed and unable to form a family, or having that 1&#x2F;25 form the family units that the author is so obsessed with like everyone else.')
