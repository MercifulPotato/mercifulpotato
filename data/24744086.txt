Dealers don&#x27;t want cars to last more than a month or so on their lot unsold.<p>I agree that this is common there, although I&#x27;m not sure how it actually compares with specific other places (curious for any data here), but I haven&#x27;t noticed a correlation between this and interesting colors on other continents. If anything, at least in the parts of the US I&#x27;ve lived in, bright car colors are culturally more accepted and seem less ostentatious than in many other countries.')
