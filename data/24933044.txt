When the BOE does happen we&#x27;ll start to see some pretty dramatic changes to our world fairly rapidly (and as a reminder, we are already seeing dramatic changes to our world).<p>We&#x27;re all in some form of climate denial right now. Even if you are able to acknowledge that climate change is happening, you likely aren&#x27;t being realistic about how unavoidable its impacts are, or the full magnitude of those impacts.<p>I still see people talking about life in 150 years as if it will be a simple continuation of the &quot;progress&quot; we&#x27;ve seen in the last 150, completely oblivious to the way that progress was achieved and the inevitably and unavoidable consequences of it.')
