Well, kinda. I started primarily on the frontend, then gradually took on more and more backend responsibilities (and interests), until I hadn’t done any frontend work for several years.<p>That transition began right around the time that React (and similar libraries) really started to take off. I came to <i>very much</i> like the general philosophy of React, but very seldom worked with it.<p>Until earlier this year, when I decided to build a documentation site for a library I had built. So I looked around to see what the state of the art was. I knew I wanted to build a static site.<p>After eliminating a variety of other options that didn’t suit my needs or preferences, the two technologies that stood out were Gatsby and Next.js. Gatsby, at the time, seemed to have a bit more momentum, so I tried it out first. It’s been several months, so I don’t recall many of the particulars, but the DX was awful. It took me very little time to determine that I would not enjoy working with Gatsby, particularly over the long term.<p>So I tried Next.js. And my experience was pretty much the opposite! The defaults were sane, I was able to get productive immediately, and overriding defaults to support a fairly unusual set of requirements and preferences was almost always trivial. Where I had to interact with some of the more complex underlying technologies (why even is webpack???), I was <i>always</i> able to find examples of what I wanted to achieve... and they were always clear and <i>correct</i>!<p>Since that time, I’ve followed Next.js releases, and while I haven’t yet had another web project this year, I’ve continually been impressed with its progress.<p>I likely have another web project coming up pretty soon, and I have no doubt that I can skip the “pick a technology” research phase.')
