After all, this is the reality for a lot of people long before the pandemic. Yes, fine, maybe it&#x27;s bad for your back or sleep schedule (I personally <i>hate</i> even reading in bed), but it&#x27;s up to the individual to figure out what works for them.<p>I really hope that one thing we get from this pandemic is not just that remote work is more accepted, but that there&#x27;s more understanding and flexibility over people&#x27;s individual situations (without them having to try and justify themselves). This would help so many people, whether they&#x27;re disabled, or juggling childcare, or whatever.')
