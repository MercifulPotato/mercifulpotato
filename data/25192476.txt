Old drawings were incredibly difficult to find, sometimes impossible, even if they were scanned in.<p>I tend to use existing data to build up the underlying drawing hierarchy and be able to find whatever I&#x27;m looking for without hunting for hours. Slowly patching together the functionality to automatically generate the database from scanned prints.<p>I have been using this software alone for quite a while before I decided to see if anyone else thought it was useful in the same way that I do.<p>Here to discuss any questions or comments anyone has.')
