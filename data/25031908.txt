I guess I&#x27;ll just have to give a shot at it sometime, get feedback, improve and repeat the process until there&#x27;s a good enough resource. That&#x27;ll likely give me good returns in terms of sales too.<p>For now, writing one yourself could help. Since you know sed&#x2F;awk, try writing equivalent ones with Perl with help of the book. For options, create a cheatsheet that you can refer quickly from the command line. Whenever you see something that isn&#x27;t easily possible with sed&#x2F;awk, put it under a special section so that you can build a list where perl would be better (I give some examples of this in the first section of introduction chapter). I also mention resources for getting started with Perl in the Preface chapter.<p>I often use my books as a reference guide, because I can&#x27;t remember all the syntax and gotchas. The situation is worse now compared to few years back because I have had to dive deeper to write these books. I&#x27;m old enough that learning new things has become difficult. I wish to create a cli lookup (something similar to the guide&#x2F;flowchart), but for now the web version created with mdbook serves as the best way for me to look up something.')
