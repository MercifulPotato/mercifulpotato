First, while the polls were skewed they actually weren&#x27;t that wrong, and many of the differences are magnified by the fact that the electoral college forces us to chop up one large poll (the national results) into lots of small ones (the states) where statistically you&#x27;re likely to see more variance no matter what. And as for the skew, the generally accepted explanation that it&#x27;s easier to poll urban, more highly educated people than rural, lower educated people makes much more sense than there being some coordinated conspiracy.')
