Item(by='LeifCarrotson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611601847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25904650, text='I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s quite right - it&#x27;s more that they&#x27;re a lab and not a product manufacturer, so they <i>can&#x27;t</i> decide to go mass-market.<p>Even if they decided that they want to go public with a virtual keyboard&#x2F;mouse&#x2F;controller and virtual heads-up display that you use by wearing an electrode net, the current team would not be able to make that pivot. End users won&#x27;t be debugging Labview sketches, spending weeks training a neural network to recognize virtual keystrokes, or shaving spots on their scalp.<p>Personally, I expect that the V1 product here is approximately just that: a game controller. A few buttons, a pointer, maybe a little haptic feedback. It would be great for me if it supported text input and output faster than a keyboard and terminal, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s likely to happen in an early version.<p>Even less likely is that we&#x27;re going to jump straight to The Matrix.  Valve needs to admit that, and be happy with a limited version, instead of letting it fizzle out in the lab.')
