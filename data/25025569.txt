BUT marine fuel is insanely dirty. Easily 10X worse than land transport fuels and engines, and with no emissions mitigation.<p>It might be simpler to require cleaner marine fuel, but marine fuel is currently a polluter at a large multiple of its share of greenhouse gas emissions.<p>Also, ammonia is a very good candidate for an economically viable energy storage and transport medium for renewable energy generation. Hydrogen is expensive to store and embrittles metal containers and pipelines.')
