If Senators and Representatives had not successfully escaped through tunnels before the rioters got to them, some of them would be dead. The fact that Trump is still in office after that shows that the US absolutely does not have a functioning legislative branch to check Trump&#x27;s executive power.<p>In the absence of that, we need <i>some</i> entity powerful enough to push back against rising fascism and authoritarianism. I don&#x27;t like that that power apparently has to be a handful of tech giant companies, but I&#x27;ll take that (temporarily at least) over the US becoming a right-wing dictatorship.')
