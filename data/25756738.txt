Item(by='jessaustin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610501041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25754480, text='That tweet isn&#x27;t Greenwald; it&#x27;s an ankle-biter wittily captioning &quot;LOL&quot; a non-linked picture that he apparently copy-pasted all by himself. The first half of the picture is a shot of Greenwald&#x27;s perfectly factual tweet. [0] The second half is another non-linked shot of another tweet, this one composed by a Twitter user somehow skilled enough to actually link to a gizmodo piece. Examining that, one discovers that the fancy satellite picture is actually an &quot;artist&#x27;s conception&quot;. (Another clue might have been the perfectly regular grid that the parler users were supposedly creating.) The only actual reference to actual locations is the caption &quot;<i>@donk_enby later shared a screenshot showing the GPS position of a particular video, with coordinates in latitude and longitude.</i>&quot; [1] Once again, this caption is on a picture without a link. However, if one actually types the pictured coordinates into a map app, one discovers that the hypothetical parler user was terrorizing a general store in Delaware. [2] Hey, they got the timezone right: the Delaware coast isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> far from DC!<p>In general, rabble-rousers on the internet don&#x27;t link to original data, because &quot;easily-fooled people&quot; like yourself will just believe your first impression. And helpfully share that with HN!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ggreenwald&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348322148704804864" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ggreenwald&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348322148704804864</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmodo.com&#x2F;every-deleted-parler-post-many-with-users-location-dat-1846032466" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gizmodo.com&#x2F;every-deleted-parler-post-many-with-user...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;jkTzy46xqPCmsmwn6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;jkTzy46xqPCmsmwn6</a>')
