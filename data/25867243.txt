There&#x27;s practically no engine braking at all. If you want to slow down you have to grab the brakes.<p>The Monster, in lower gears, will skid the back wheel if you chop the throttle from 75+% of peak rpm. You can pretty much get that bike down to walking pace in a fairly short distance without touching the brakes at all. (Thats a game I sometimes play on it, see if I can get home from work without touching the brakes, just slowing down using the throttle and gears.)')
