When you combine the natural immunity to coronaviruses (20-30%) plus the recent exposure (another 10-20%), the US is approaching herd immunity already.<p>In addition, Americans are averse to vaccinations, so that leaves herd immunity as the only option.<p>The countries that thought controlling corona transmission &quot;was science&quot; are in for a long and painful isolation until a working vaccine is available, which could be a decade from now if you look at HIV or other viruses.')
