Without pattern matching on datatypes via cons expression (x::xs matching) it is just another kind of switch or if&#x2F;else. Why do people promote this?\nhere a nice comment on this topic:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocaml.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;data_types_and_matching.html#Pattern-matching-on-datatypes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocaml.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;data_types_and_matching.ht...</a><p>&quot;So one Really Cool Feature of functional languages is the ability to break apart data structures and do pattern matching on the data. This is again not really a &quot;functional&quot; feature - you could imagine some variation of C appearing which would let you do this, but it&#x27;s a Cool Feature nonetheless&quot;')
