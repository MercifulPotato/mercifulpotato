Any time you see a much larger commercial entity insist you write a spec for your technology, especially one with much larger pockets, the writing is always on the cards.<p>The bit that absolutely fucking sickens me is how these transactions are often dressed up in language with free software intonations like &quot;community&quot;, &quot;collaboration&quot; etc. Institutionalized doublethink is so thick in the modern free software world that few people even recognize the difference any more. As an aside, can anyone remember not so long ago when Google wouldn&#x27;t shut up about &quot;the open web&quot;? Probably stopped saying that not long after Chrome ate the entire ecosystem and began dictating terms.<p>The one mea culpa for Docker is that the sales folk behind Kubernetes haven&#x27;t the slightest understanding of the usability story that made Docker such a raging success to begin with. The sheer size of the organizations they represent may not even allow them to recreate that experience if indeed they recognized the genius of it. It remains to be seen whether they&#x27;ll manage that before another orchestrator comes along and changes the wind once again. The trophy could still be stolen, there&#x27;s definitely room for it.')
