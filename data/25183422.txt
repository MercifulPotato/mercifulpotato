There are penalties for falsely filing a counternotice; there are no penalties to me if I send Alphabet a DMCA claim about Google.com (or if WhiteHatJr files notice to YouTube).<p>Edit: Ah, I see. It&#x27;s correct that there is no need to provide evidence at the counter-notice stage, but it introduces a sentence of up to five years in prison <i>just for lying in the counter-notice</i>, which does not exist for the filer. Also, even if the everything is filed and processed in a matter of hours from notice to counter-notice, there is a 14-day period during which your material remains offline regardless.<p>I stand by my point. The DMCA is a garbage law.')
