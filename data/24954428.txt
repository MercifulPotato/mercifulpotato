But what is the critical attribute of a swarm that would give rise to strong AI?<p>The argentine ant supercolony is an enormous swarm, but we don&#x27;t really expect to be able to have a conversation with it, or see it deal with abstract concepts, but they can solve lots of local approximate optimization problems.<p>Slime molds are single cells but you might think of them as a swarm of nuclei and organelles that can solve hard optimization problems when in the right form, but again they don&#x27;t seem like a general intelligence.<p>Is the missing piece that swarms must be of agents with certain properties? Or that the interactions between the members of a swarm need to have some specific properties?')
