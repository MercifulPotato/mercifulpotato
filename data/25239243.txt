We are DEEPLY entrenched in the Google ecosystem, but none of the &quot;cool stuff&quot; works with GSuite accounts.  We want out.  But it&#x27;s near impossible.  All I want is to turn my account into a &quot;normal&quot; google account.  Or have some level of GSuite subscription that allowed us to use things like Nest or Family Library.<p>&quot;Just start over&quot; they say.  But seems easier said than done.  Any tips&#x2F;ideas on making this suck less?')
