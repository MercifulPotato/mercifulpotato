Publishers of all kind - news companies, streaming companies, social media - will be more than happy to adopt technologies that take away control over the experience from end users. After all, most of the web already looks like glorified print posters and lifestyle magazines. With Flutter, they&#x27;ll have the ability to make it impossible for end-users to turn on Reader Mode or remove ads, or branding. The site will look exactly the way the UX experts designed them to, simplifying all kinds of data-driven user abuse.<p>Now of course, they could&#x27;ve done that already without Flutter. But they didn&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s too hard. Regular HTML+CSS+JS are the default. It&#x27;s what has the mindshare, it&#x27;s what the devs on the market do, it&#x27;s what works for everyone, ever since Flash died. It&#x27;s already good enough to control majority of end-users, so there&#x27;s no marginal benefit in trying to invent an even more restrictive form of content delivery. It&#x27;s not worth the time spent fixing bugs and cross-device inconsistencies. But now add a player like Google - with money, mass, and clout - pushing such new solution, and it may be enough. God knows, webdev community just embraces everything Google releases.')
