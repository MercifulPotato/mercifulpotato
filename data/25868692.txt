You just can&#x27;t do it on Amazon&#x27;s infrastructure. Plenty of companies that aren&#x27;t organizing mass shootings or insurrections manage just fine without AWS, for a variety of reasons --- some of which even include cost <i>savings.</i><p>The constant comparisons between Facebook and Parler are talking points, and insulting to our intelligence. We know better than to buy into this stuff.')
