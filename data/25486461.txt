A lot is marketing, but it&#x27;s not like traditional marketing you&#x27;d be taught at a university. They&#x27;re figuring a lot of it out by trial and error, which is some amount of risk of getting it wrong. And popularity can swing quickly and dramatically so you can get fired by the internet mobs (more risk).<p>Not sure why it&#x27;s a negative presence, either. Anyone who thinks it was a negative presence is not really someone you&#x27;d want a job from after making $10,000 - $100,000 a month.')
