It&#x27;s easy for me to promise Owl Mail will not shut down without significant advanced notice (hopefully that never happens, but if it does I will provide a clear transition plan for all users).<p>As a token of confidence, I&#x27;ve moved all ~150 of my online accounts (including all banking, financial, and healthcare accounts) to Owl Mail â€“ it needs to exist for my life to operate smoothly.')
