These models help Jane Street trade thousands of financial products each day across 200 trading venues around the world.<p>&gt;Admittedly, this challenge far oversimplifies the depth of the quantitative problems Jane Streeters work on daily, and Jane Street is happy with the performance of its existing trading model for this particular question.
