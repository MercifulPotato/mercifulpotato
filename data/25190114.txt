I make things all the time which create shared benefit.<p>I spent this Saturday morning working in my front yard. It looks nice for my benefit, but it also benefits my neighbors. It would be really strange for me to approach my neighbors and ask for financial remuneration because they&#x27;ve been enriched by my yardwork. Yardwork is enjoyable and I like making the world better in this fashion.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t join a yardwork company and work for free.<p>Software is similar. We can use OSS to share the benefit when we do something we want or need to do anyway.')
