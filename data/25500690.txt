Apple Pay is a logical extension of contactless, which has been available around the world for years.<p>The world moved to chip&amp;pin at least 5 years ago and moved to contactless for small money amounts (&lt;AUD100 &lt;GBP30) at least 3-4 years ago.<p>Apple &amp; Google&#x27;s changes for CC are mostly in the tokenization standard, building the backends for issuers.<p>The Apple Card is a US only need, because the US is stuck on chip&amp;sign and Visa&#x2F;MC have been unable to force the retailers to replace their ancient POS equipment.
