However the situation is a non-exclusive OR.  When either side does this, they become part of the cause.  The behavior is the source of the problem - <i>not a side</i>.<p>No ‘side’ can claim <i>not to be the cause</i> unless it can curb the behavior.  The left cannot curb the right behaving unreasonably, but it might be able to curb unreason on its own side.<p>However this: “demanding perfection from one side while absolving the other” seems like a straw man.  If <i>this</i> is being done, it’s clearly being done by the right and the left.<p>When the right say the left are causing the problem by doing this, <i>they are correct</i>.  You are also correct to say they aren’t the only ones causing it.<p>However the left cannot improve the situation by pointing fingers at the right and doubling down.<p>The left doesn’t have to be ‘flawless’, but if <i>it’s not better than the right</i>, then how does it expect to improve anything?')
