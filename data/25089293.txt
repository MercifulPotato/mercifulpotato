Sure, they don&#x27;t say that directly, but it is hard for me to see it as anything else.<p>Now, I fully grant that WSDL really faltered over what feels like a proxy battle between Sun and Microsoft now.  As I recall, you could make a WSDL that was easy to use from .NET, or from Java; but not both.  I don&#x27;t recall what the other languages were like.<p>Which is all to say I don&#x27;t really disagree.  But it is eye opening to think that this is all getting trodden again.')
