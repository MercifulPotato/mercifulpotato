That seems like an enormous achievement for such a small team as yours.<p>Then, I&#x27;m wondering do you guys have the notion of &quot;product brands&quot; or something like that?<p>For example, when I search for &quot;SaaSHub&quot; - a product (I work on) that has been online since 2014 and have quite a few mentions around the web, the first result is some &quot;random&quot; Wordpress theme. i.e. if I&#x27;m searching for a particular product, I&#x27;d expect the product homepage to be the first result.')
