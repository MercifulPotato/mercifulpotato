Just as an example, I rarely visit r&#x2F;all, but I do visit specific subreddits that I’m subscribed to like r&#x2F;privacy, r&#x2F;pihole, and r&#x2F;thinkpad. On Facebook, I never browse my newsfeed, but I am a member of a group for my apartment complex in the Stockholm area which lists local events and people selling stuff or giving away stuff in the community.<p>My point is that is that it’s possible to filter out a lot of the political garbage on those sites if one wishes, but it does appear to be getting more difficult since political stuff is appearing more and more often in places that I personally wouldn’t expect.')
