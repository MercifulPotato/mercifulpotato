It was utter chaos. I worked with him to try to find a solution, we tried various tools, but found nothing that worked across cable, DSL, WISP, and cellular connections.<p>Some tools could sync after the fact so the recording sounded good (if each musician keeps the same tempo), but the whole point is that the kids needed to be able to hear and follow each other, and just one student at 500ms latency totally ruins the tech.<p>So he teaches music to second graders by zoom, and they&#x27;re all on mute unless he unmutes them one by one.')
