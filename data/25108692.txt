Everything you are trying to do, you have someone else trying to stop you. They are as adaptive as you are.<p>Because of this dynamism, many players who were great in previous eras couldn&#x27;t survive in the modern era (and vice versa, really)... for example, most centers who played even 10 years ago would be abused in the modern game by opposing centers shooting threes. It simply wasn&#x27;t part of the game 10 years ago, and now everyone does it. There was literally a player (Roy Hibbert) during the transition who was a star before and suddenly became unplayable as teams adapted to the new environment. He was out of the league in 2 years.')
