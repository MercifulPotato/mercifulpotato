They use lots of elaborately animated transitions with bright colors, swooshing sound effects and musical cues to mesmerize viewers, just as slot machines in Vegas use such things to mesmerize gamblers.  It&#x27;s the same sort of graphical bullshit they pad out televized American football with.   And the talking head personalities emotively reading from teleprompters are there for viewers to form parasocial relationships with, to keep viewers coming back to that channel.  Before social media was invented, the term was created to describe the asymmetric relationships television viewers have with television personalities.  The whole industry has manipulation down to a science and I think anybody would be better off reading newspapers instead.  Public funded news channels may be better, I remember PBS&#x27;s News Hour was okay.  But is there <i>any</i> value in watching CNN instead of reading the NYTimes?  I don&#x27;t see any.')
