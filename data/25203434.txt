Doing things that look or sound <i>green</i>, while (voluntarily or not) ignoring the actual damage we&#x27;re doing.<p>For example, my country banned plastic bags on the supermarket and everyone rejoiced, but no one has any intention to talk seriously about environmental problems. It&#x27;s all a bunch of empty slogans and feel-good discourse.')
