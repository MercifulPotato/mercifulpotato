We write functional code, but we are not religious about &quot;purely functional&quot; code.<p>My understanding is that, currently, writing Kotlin means you are almost certainly writing Android apps. If a company chose Kotlin over Scala for a backend&#x2F;distributed application, I would be astonished. Maybe that is my bias, but Scala is proven and continuing to grow in the distributed space (Akka, ZIO, etc).<p>Regarding scala being &quot;too cryptic&quot;. I felt the same way about Django when I first learned it -- now everyone thinks Django is a breeze. I had the luxury of learning Scala on-the-job, and had great mentors who saw the power of the language and helped me realize it too. Scala can be &quot;fancy&quot;, but it can also be simple and elegant, if you learn it slowly.<p>Frankly, I think my biggest issue with Scala is that I live in North America, and the really interesting products built in Scala seem to be made by European teams.')
