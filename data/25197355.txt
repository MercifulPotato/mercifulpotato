That is, if you have a pointer to a struct, it&#x27;s the same as dereferencing the pointer and accessing the field: &quot;(*foo).bar&quot; corresponds to &quot;foo-&gt;bar&quot;.<p>I think the main driving logic is on line 228. It could definitely do with some more descriptive variable names, though - &quot;a&quot; for angle, and &quot;s&quot; for sense inputs seems a bit too short.')
