This article [1] says that the paper was submitted to &quot;ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency&quot;, which sends paper decisions (accept or reject) next week [2]. Of course, it might be accepted at that time, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be decided yet.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-12-03&#x2F;google-s-co-head-of-ethical-ai-says-she-was-fired-over-email" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-12-03&#x2F;google-s-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;facctconference.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;cfp.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;facctconference.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;cfp.html</a>')
