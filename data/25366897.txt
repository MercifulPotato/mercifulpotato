Long story short:<p>* The 6% number from 2016 comes from taking into account ballots that arrived late.<p>* The 0.02% number from 2020 is actually 0.2%, and only takes into account ballots that arrived on time.<p>The signature rejection rate in 2020 was actually very similar to the rates in 2018 and 2016.<p>So as usual, these claims are simply bogus. But even if there were problems with the signature matching system, the time to raise objections would have been before the election. Attempting to throw out millions of ballots after the election over these issues is absurd and anti-democratic.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;uk-factcheck-georgia-rejected-ballots-fo-idUSKBN2832CM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;uk-factcheck-georgia-rejecte...</a>')
