The situation described in the article in India was an unusual circumstance, and obviously the bidders overpaid for the spectrum given that the ultimate customers have very limited financial means.

I’ve personally been involved in Singapore, Belgium, Sweden and Mexico’s spectrum auctions and the results have been very successful. As further proof, if countries felt they weren’t successful we would see the number of auctions decreasing.
