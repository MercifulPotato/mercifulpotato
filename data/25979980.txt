To get training data, use regexps and then run through them by hand (20+ per minute per hour = 1200&#x2F;hour, or outsource to amazon mturk $0.25 per 10, incl verification = $30&#x2F;1200). Also, there&#x27;s probably easy ones you can classify 100% correctly with regexps, to increase the training set size.<p>I&#x27;m happy to help if you like.')
