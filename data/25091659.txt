This is bias is among the first things you learn to discern as an undergraduate. Historical research never starts from a premise &quot;We can observe X in current events, is it possible to find similar events and patterns in the past?&quot; Why? Because the trap here is to apply modern concepts, schools of thoughts and ideas in a past context where they absolutely did not exist.<p>&gt; Also the human nature isn&#x27;t changeable so political and social and personal dilemas of ancient Athens, Rome or China can resonate with us.<p>The resonate with us because the past can inspire us and helps us reflect on human nature. But that&#x27;s about all it does. Transposing societal structures, ideas, thinking and so on from Ancient Rome to the current day is a fallacy because it denies the 2.000 years of history and evolving societal, cultural, religious, economical, political thinking that happened in between.<p>Another fallacy is in this way of thinking is that history is teleological and ends with today being the end of human evolution and history; that today is the only logical outcome of everything that led up to today. Determinism really doesn&#x27;t work well when you want to narrate and explain history.<p>It&#x27;s also the reason why I&#x27;m skeptical of Yuval Harari&#x27;s work. His re-telling of human  history is thought provoking and prompts for reflection and debate. But in no way does it mean that his take on history is the definitive story.')
