Like it or not, they are the new public square. Just telling someone that&#x27;s banned from Twitter, Facebook, etc., &quot;but oh don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;re still free to go downtown and hold up a sign and spread your message!&quot;, while everyone else is able to reach millions of people instantly, is not a solution, and you all know it isn&#x27;t. Telling someone they can start their own website and not use Twitter, and then de-platforming the website they start, is not a solution, and you all know it isn&#x27;t.<p>Seriously, look at the state of things. The left has decided to censor the President of the United States. They routinely censor and de-platform anyone that has differing political opinion, and they use disgusting tactics to do so, by just calling anyone that disagrees with them racist, evil, inciting violence etc., no matter how remotely those labels actually apply. Not to mention that the words no longer have any meaning and have been constantly redefined to mean whatever they want it to mean.<p>Anyone with different politics are banned from their platforms. If they try to start their own platforms then DNS providers ban them, payment providers ban them, companies drop them, app stores ban them. Like someone mentioned elsewhere, what&#x27;s next? Does anyone not a leftist need to create their own mobile networks? Lay their own fiber? When the left puts an end to this too, what&#x27;s next? It&#x27;s already gone to an unacceptable level of censorship and destruction.<p>You really want to see how evil starts? This is it. A group of people so convinced that they&#x27;re morally just, better than everyone else, just like every evil regime that ever existed, that have justified to themselves that everyone else is evil, that it&#x27;s fine to do evil things to them, that&#x27;s it&#x27;s fine to literally burn books because the knowledge conflicts with their ideology, that it&#x27;s OK to do evil things to those that they&#x27;ve deemed to be evil, and that, conversely, nothing they do is evil. That everything they do is &quot;fighting for Democracy!&quot;, yet everything anyone else does is the literal death of Democracy. The supreme irony being that of course complete censorship and destruction of any opposing ideas is so obviously the death of democracy. Always getting your way is not democracy.<p>It&#x27;s evil, pure and simple, from top to bottom. If you ever wondered how an evil regime forms, how people support it and cheer it on and let it happen, you&#x27;re witnessing it right here and now.')
