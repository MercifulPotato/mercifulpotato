I doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s practical in real life, it just has to be not be in contradiction with the fictional world of the story.  Kind of like Star Trek allowing faster-than-light travel due to imagined discoveries in the fields of physics.<p>I like hard science fiction that&#x27;s based in known physics, but I can still enjoy science fiction that&#x27;s not totally realistic as long as it&#x27;s at least consistent with itself and doesn&#x27;t contradict known physics out of pure laziness or ignorance.<p>I think it&#x27;s a better solution than just saying &quot;Mars is at full gravity because of magic we won&#x27;t explain.&quot;')
