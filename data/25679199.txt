This would be more secure than just sending the hostname in plain text, because it would require active interception rather than passive surveillance, but active interception is not that much harder than passive surveillance.<p>b) signed key exchange, which is tricky, because the server may have certificates for many hostnames, and it doesn&#x27;t know which one you used<p>In order to have another option, you need to get a key through some other method. DNS is the more or less the most viable out of band method to get that information; after all, it&#x27;s what you used to turn a hostname into an IP address to contact the server in the first place.')
