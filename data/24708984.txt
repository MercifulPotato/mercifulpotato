The fact that less people can make a living doing something that doesn&#x27;t require any capital investment, just time and skill, doesn&#x27;t have any real direct impact on how many people get really good at it.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s just a hobby&quot; is a weak put-down, and really doesn&#x27;t apply to thousands of people who play instruments at incredibly high levels of skill, even though they do not do so for a living. Certainly, it&#x27;s going to help development if you play more (for whatever reason). But I don&#x27;t think that you can claim that only way to get to be &quot;that good&quot; is to be a paid professional. There are many musicians whose early work as a &quot;professional musician&quot; was just a side gig anyway, and they didn&#x27;t play significantly more than dedicated &quot;hobbyists&quot;.<p>The spread of music education (public and private) and the dramatic drop in the real cost of musical instruments has exposed way more people to the possibility of playing music.  Sure, most of them will be in the middle of the bell curve, but this process has (1) lifted the absolute height of the bell curve (more people) which (2) means more people over at the right-hand end of the curve.')
