It gives a promise: 1KW of DIY wind power for $30. And then it shows a bunch of pictures and some extremely basic instructions. From the page:<p>&quot;Attaching [the DC generator] is mostly just a matter of stripping everything off the motor, attaching a pulley to the shaft, running a toothed timing belt around the wheel rim (with a layer of nylon strapping bolted to the wheel to protect the belt and give it something to grab onto) and attaching the motor to the pole frame as shown, with long bolts so you can easily adjust the tension on the belt.&quot;<p>Strip motor, attach pulley, build a tensioner. The text makes it sound trivial, but those are <i>non-trivial</i> steps. Attaching a pulley to a scrap motor can be quite an ordeal. Building a tensioner that works requires fabrication.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s super complicated, I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s not &quot;oh by the way make a tensioner&quot; or &quot;attach a pulley- done!&quot; Glossing over details like that with a magic wand is what makes such projects appear even more unapproachable.')
