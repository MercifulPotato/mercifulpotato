Item(by='tekknik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607830099, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395688, text='&gt; I find it really disconcerting how many people on Hacker News want a corporate entity to decide what information is deemed acceptable to know. Do you even know where that word came from? The irony is almost overwhelming. But I digress...<p>Many on HN are the ones implementing these features, therefore have a bit of power over the rest of us. Further, judging from cancel culture, the left seems to want to force their opinions on others that have different ones. So this makes pretty clear sense to me.')
