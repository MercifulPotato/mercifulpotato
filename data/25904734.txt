This is also my problem when I see the recent &quot;hype&quot; around Roam Research, Obsidian, Foam etc. I constantly come across and read stuff, in newspapers, on HN, on reddit, etc. How can you find the time to keep notes about this and keep it organized? And how do you make sure you aren&#x27;t spending more time on organizing&#x2F;formatting&#x2F;maintaining your notes and making it look nice instead of actually reading doing productive stuff? (Honest questions, I&#x27;m interested in other peoples&#x27; approaches.)')
