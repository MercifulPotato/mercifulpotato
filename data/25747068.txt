Also, sometimes the execs leave a couple of years after they start&#x2F;initiate a new project (before it finishes) presumably using that as their achievement point (although the project they started isn&#x27;t even finished and eventually fizzles out once they move to the new company) in their CV to their new employer. After seeing that for 2-3 times, I realized that some of these upper management people only start these overly-ambitious (impossible) initiatives just to gear up for their eventual move.')
