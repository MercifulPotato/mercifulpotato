Item(by='Bakary', descendants=None, kids=[25627086], score=None, time=1609719241, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25623292, text='Those are not the arguments I am making though. I am not claiming that liberals and conservatives are the same. I am fully aware of the perspective you are describing, so allow me to clarify.<p>In the American context, parties are skewed to the right compared to the Western average. This means that center&#x2F;center-right parties like the Dems are perceived as left-wing whereas far-right parties like the Reps are perceived as right-wing. Sanders would be an example of a populist center-left politician by average Western standards, but he is qualified as far-left. His rise to prominence has led to clear tensions within the Democratic party structure.<p>Even among the far left, few parties today even question capitalism but rather advocate for a hybrid system, so it is not a question of being strictly anti-capitalist. Even taking this into account, there is a clear chasm between a typical liberal Dem voter and a center-left&#x2F;centrist voter in the Western average, and a clear sense from the modern left-wing that Dems and Reps are more similar to one another than to them. This debate is burdened by the fact that the word &quot;liberal&quot; tends to mean &quot;center left&quot; in the US and Canada but but is used in the classic sense elsewhere. Note that the OP you originally replied to did explicitly say that FAANG friends WERE liberal! But this got lost in translation as based on your American-inspired perspective an American liberal is supposed to be indistinguishable from the left-wing, whereas this would be seriously questioned elsewhere.<p>Essentially the point I&#x27;m trying to make before we got lost in the specifics is that not seeing the Dems as center&#x2F;center-right is indicative of a very specific American perspective. At the end of the day, tech workers overwhelmingly profit from inequality, a very free market, outsourcing, capital accumulation, and other classic neoliberal facets, while at the same time maintaining socially-liberal values other matters. They stand to lose greatly from a different partition of society, since by definition they are already among the chief beneficiaries.')
