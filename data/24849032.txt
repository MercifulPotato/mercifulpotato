I&#x27;ve imagined there must be a way to &quot;statically link dependencies so that import isn&#x27;t searching the disk but just loading from a fixed location&#x2F;file. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be many resources on the net. I&#x27;ve found this one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pythondev.readthedocs.io&#x2F;startup_time.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pythondev.readthedocs.io&#x2F;startup_time.html</a>. I tried using virtualenvs to limit my searchable import paths, and messed around with cython in effort to come up with a static linked binary. But I&#x27;ve yet to come up with anything that really improves the startup time. Clearly I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing.')
