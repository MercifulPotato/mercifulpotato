I&#x27;d seen the Beats Flex announcement a few months ago where they discontinued the Lightning version and made the new ones use USB-C, and figured that meant they were planning to phase out Lightning in favor of USB-C and MagSafe. With these using Lightning instead of USB-C, that&#x27;s obviously not the case.<p>So now if you&#x27;ve just bought an iPhone 12 and picked up a $40 MagSafe charging cable to go with it, you can go get the Lightning cable back out of the drawer because you&#x27;re going to need it again for at least the lifespan of these headphones.<p>With the Qi charging case for previous AirPods (the various earbuds versions) they can charge off the same MagSafe cable as the phone (though without a magnetic connection for now).<p>Maybe Apple wanted to put a MagSafe pad on one of the ears for these, but couldn&#x27;t make the magnets work without interfering with audio quality?<p>At the very least they could have gone USB-C, and then if you had an iPhone 12, AirPods Max, and an Apple Watch, you can charge everything using MagSafe Duo and a USB-C cable, which plugs into either the MagSafe Duo charger (for phone and watch) or directly into the headphones. But no, it&#x27;s a Lightning port.')
