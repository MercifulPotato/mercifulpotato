It will be the single most valuable object they own, and may be the result of saving for months and careful consideration of what to buy, intending it to use it for many years.<p>A spare good laptop &quot;just in case&quot; is not a realistic option for them.<p>Most of them could buy a second laptop if circumstances arise where it&#x27;s absolutely necessary, but it would be hardship.  So they wouldn&#x27;t get one just as a &quot;nice to have&quot;, a spare laptop lying around doing &quot;nothing&quot;.  Especially if it&#x27;s going to be outdated by the time you have some use for it.  Events where you need a spare device are quite rare after all.<p>That might be below &quot;the basic cost&quot; of running a sensible business, but for people on median and&#x2F;or sporadic incomes it&#x27;s a significant cost, only worth bearing if and when it becomes necessary.')
