(One day I&#x27;m going to keep track of the mistakes TS catchers early for me in a week.)<p>So yes: I think the typing lowers the correlation between lines of code and bug count, and that that outweighs the bugs introduced by the additional lines. (It is similar in that regard to many unit tests, I&#x27;d say.)<p>As for unit tests: it&#x27;s not that I write unit tests first and add types later. The types are written as I code, and they allow me to <i>not</i> write some of the unit tests I&#x27;d written otherwise. The upside is that they&#x27;re easier to write and easier to keep aligned with the code than unit tests.<p>So yes, I still have to spend time writing tests, but less of it than without types, and I save more time than the writing of types costs me.<p>&gt; TS types aren&#x27;t really documentation. For other devs to use your stuff, you need JS Docs to actually explain things. Why write all those types too?<p>I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by &quot;write all those types too&quot;? Yes, I still have to write documentation, but just iterating the types is not documentation?')
