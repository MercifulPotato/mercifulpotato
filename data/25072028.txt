She also isn&#x27;t allowed outside. So is she captive or not? What if I let her out? She&#x27;s still my pet and while I love her, she&#x27;s captive. I&#x27;m not sure it would be different if she was an outdoor cat except her life expectancy would drop. Would you not define my cat (a pet) as captive?')
