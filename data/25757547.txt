The terms are synonymous.<p>&gt;Obvious disclaimer: I donâ€™t hold a candle to this fight in either direction but can empathize with both sides<p>Why is that obvious?<p>And as to the idea that you can &quot;empathize with both sides,&quot; Who do you think those &quot;sides&quot; are?<p>They are most certainly not those of the two major political parties in the US.<p>They are not even those who consider themselves &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;liberal.&quot;<p>In reality, one side supports our constitutional form of government and the rule of law.  The other side despises the rule of law and seeks to use violence, intimidation and lies to destabilize my home in an attempt to seize power.<p>The former are 98%+ of my countrymen (many of us disagree about a great many things, but not about our constitutional republic and the rule of law), and the latter are a tiny minority who wishes to impose their will on everyone else.<p>If you see things differently, I&#x27;d love to hear your arguments.')
