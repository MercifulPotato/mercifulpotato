There might be two big CPUs, but if there are then (like this situation with Tesla) they&#x27;re so intertwined that you effectively need both of them to drive properly.  The &quot;entertainment CPU&quot; has become entwined with the &quot;powertrain CPU&quot;, so it&#x27;s really not appropriate to use those terms anymore.  You can&#x27;t remove the entertainment system without bricking the drivetrain.  If the entertainment system wants to spy on you, tough luck.<p>I don&#x27;t want a cell phone with wheels.  I want an EV that&#x27;s like my 2000s vehicles were: two microcontrollers (one for engine control, one for ABS), and no over-the-air firmware updates so software upgrades are painfully expensive for the manufacturer.  If there are any other CPUs in the vehicle it should still drive from point A to point B even if I physically rip those out.  This isn&#x27;t asking a lot: even 20-year-old internal combustion engine powertrains are way more complex than any EV powertrain.<p>The original Tesla Roadster worked like this.  I am seriously considering paying the insane price it costs to buy one that still runs.  I would love to buy a still-in-production highway-safe car (not a glorified go-kart) with this property.  Suggestions welcome, please.')
