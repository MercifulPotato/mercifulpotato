In the US&#x2F;CA, the turn signal can be either amber or red, <i>but must be of a certain area</i>. Other jurisdictions do not have an area regulation.<p>So OEMs simply make brake lights double as turn signals when they import vehicles.<p>If the non-US OEMs &#x27;just&#x27; made bigger turn signals they wouldn&#x27;t have to do this.')
