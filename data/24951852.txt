My impression is that the difference in sample rate between the formats was some sort of attempt to discourage lossless copying of published music. Recall that we couldn’t just throw it on a computer and resample it back then.<p>But regardless, you need to slightly over sample when doing A&#x2F;D conversion because you need to do a very strong low pass filter before you hit the sample rate to avoid harmonic distortion. So you need the filter to be some amount higher than the target maximum reproduced frequency, because the filter is in the analog domain and itself introduces audible artifacts.<p>So you must sample at a higher frequency than you intend target. 48k makes sense because you have more ‘extra’ frequencies to work with, so it’s easier to get the filtering out of the audible space.')
