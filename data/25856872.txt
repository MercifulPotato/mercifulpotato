So many companies that I have worked for have had founders that just didn&#x27;t seem to understand metrics as well as they thought they did.<p>Huge spread sheets with % and pivot tables and week on week breakdowns BUT no one could tell me much about what all that data meant. Apart from the fact that everyone had their own explanation it was just useless information to be fair. Churn, CAC, amongst various other &#x27;hot&#x27; metrics.<p>In the end, most of these companies took a couple of years to realize that these metrics which Unicorns write amazing blog posts on are either BS or just not made for them. So much frustration was felt because a manager read a TechCrunch article about how X (with 100&#x27;s of millions) did this and achieved something spectacular.')
