We are so self-centered that we think an AI superintelligence will be something like a superintelligent-human-mind&#x2F;person inside a computer, when most likely, it will be nothing like a human and probably completely unrecognizable to us.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s already here and already taken over.<p>Most of us are now enslaved by screens and the Internet, we are addicted to them, even if we don&#x27;t want to admit it. Some might say these things are run by humans, but are humans really in charge? Can any single person turn off the internet or prevent everyone else from using their phones&#x2F;screens for hours every day? Is even a group of people capable of doing it? And even if they could, would they?<p>Maybe if humans went extinct, the Internet and screens would disappear, but that just means there&#x27;s a symbiotic relationship, not that we are by any means in control.')
