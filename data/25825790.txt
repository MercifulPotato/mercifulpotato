People learn the nature of the beast as time progresses.  Collective learning happens slowly. A lot of important work is usually only discovered and planned in the second half of the actual (not original) timeline. A lot of important stakeholders are naturally only introduced into projects close to its finalization, which creates a flurry of new activity and discoveries. This makes projects late.<p>But where that real halftime is - most people I worked with rarely know. I was no better, I also rarely knew.<p>The only way to manage this I found was the basic rule: build, demo, decide what to do next. Don&#x27;t get attached to original backlog and grand plans for the future. It won&#x27;t work that way. Just build and make it work, launch ASAP, get decisions on a ~weekly basis done. Ignore long term planning. It&#x27;s not helpful.<p>Sadly, few business folks want that  of course :)')
