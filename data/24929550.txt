The &quot;Skeptical Eye&quot; column was dropped quite early on in favour of more controversial stuff that it used to be sceptical off, in hopes to drive up sales[1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Discover_(magazine)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Discover_(magazine)</a>')
