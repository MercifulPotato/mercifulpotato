Honestly, lots of hires (including myself for some places, I&#x27;m sure!) seemed great early on but then didn&#x27;t quite work. Does usually take 3-4 months to feel that part out. And then eh, this isn&#x27;t quite working, and I&#x27;ll see you later. Or, as often, eh, wasn&#x27;t sure how things would go but actually we work great together.')
