From the customer&#x27;s point of view, they probably wouldn&#x27;t even notice it was a different business, because in a real sense it wasn&#x27;t.<p>We decided this would lead to significant churn in customer subscriptions, and we couldn&#x27;t afford it.  It would be cheaper to maintain and administer the old business entity, for no business purpose whatsoever, just the <i>sole purpose</i> of continuing to receive the DD subscriptions, and pay them immediately in full to the new business entity.')
