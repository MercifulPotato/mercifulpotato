This is aided by the UI which allows you to hover over the listed ID and see parents or children. This results in being able to respond to multiple posts in a single post. This means that instead of tree structured threading, DAG style threading is possible. The second consequence is that by default posts are displayed linearly, like an IRC discussion. This linear display results in unlimited nesting depth. Nesting is not dependent on indentation.<p>(1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.4channel.org&#x2F;faq#quote" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.4channel.org&#x2F;faq#quote</a>')
