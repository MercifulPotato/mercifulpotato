Today, I plug in a computer and it works. I install an OS and it works. It detects all of my hardware and gets online right away. My computer hasn’t randomly crashed in years. When I save my work, I don’t even consider the possibility that the save might fail and I’ll lose all of my changes.

I installed Elementary OS on an old computer recently, and every app opened instantly. As in, I clicked it, and it was just there. No perceptible delay.
