That&#x27;s something you can tap into.<p>Not all senior engineers make huge salaries. Senior engs with decades of experience at many non-tech companies might make slightly more than a junior or mid level engineer at a mid to top tier tech company. For every elite senior engineer at a competitive elite SV tech company getting 300k+ before hitting the 10 year mark, you have many senior engineers at boring non-tech companies that might be lucky to hit 200k when they retire after decades of work.<p>(Although it could be argued that such senior engineers are not quite as skilled or &quot;senior&quot; as a senior engineer at a tech company - disclaimer - I speak as a &quot;senior engineer&quot; at a non-tech company myself)')
