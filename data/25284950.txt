They might not get an SV salary but they get an expense account, cars, vacation homes, and other perks all provided by the company. Meanwhile their employees get paid shit and work 10-12hr days and don&#x27;t get paid overtime.<p>I&#x27;d chose SV over that anytime. SV at least pays on average 6x what a similar employee makes in Japan and effectively treats their staff like royalty. Flex hours, lots of vacation, space, good equipment, breaks, gyms, meals, etc...')
