The woman got quality and timely medical attention, but one of the baby twins died during childbirth.<p>The mother lives in NSW close to the QLD border and wanted to go a Brisbane hospital (Brisbane = capital of QLD) for the birth, but flew to Sydney instead to avoid 14 days of hotel quarantine (probably at their expense) in QLD.<p>I&#x27;m sure the level of care was equally good in both hospitals. The outcome may have been the same regardless.')
