Then on top of that many of the companies that made these games went basically defunct years ago and some publisher is just selling them and cutting a check to some other company that is a shell corp for something else.  You are correct on what should happen to the game.  But some programs do need to react to lose focus.  So for it to &#x27;ignore&#x27; it there would need to be a setting for it (and per program).  Which could even cause side effects in that game because they just plain got it wrong.<p>I have had in the past month seen black screen on return.  No controls after return.  Does not tab out at all.  There are other variations.  Most games do work.  But some dont.  My wife plays dont starve quite a bit and that game is kind of flakey in its external behavior (once in game you are fine).  One bug she is dealing with is in some cases it takes 30+ mins to get in game with new settings on a fairly beefy new computer.')
