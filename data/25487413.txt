He argued that the internet’s removal of physical limitations (local audiences, scarce shelf space) would empower niche products and creators to flourish.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s what Anderson argued (though I would have to go back and read his original piece). Collectively, the long tail is large even while a power law distribution means that a relatively small amount of content captures an outsized amount of attention. But that doesn&#x27;t mean <i>individual</i> content creators in the long tail capture much attention (and compensation).<p>Otherwise, I guess the author is arguing that platforms should adopt strategies to create a gentler power law distribution so that more creators are in the knee of the curve because that would create a healthier environment for more people. I guess I don&#x27;t really disagree with that although I&#x27;ll note that <i>most</i> creators will still be in the long tail.<p>[ADDED: And ultimately it&#x27;s really the users that determine the distribution even if the platform can influence it.]')
