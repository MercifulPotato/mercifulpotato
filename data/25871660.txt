If you close the window, to copy the password, you have to re-search for the account to find the username.<p>Recently summarized the issue plus previous reports in here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.bitwarden.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;unsaved-changes-are-lost-when-move-to-another-item&#x2F;5470&#x2F;20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.bitwarden.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;unsaved-changes-are-lost-w...</a><p>I&#x27;d used LastPass before and believe their solution is plan obvious, it just works. So that&#x27;s what I suggested Bitwarden to do: opening up a new tab with all the extension UI for data entry, instead of depending on the volatile state of a pop-up window.<p>EDIT: I misread and thought the issue was with the data entry! but now I understand that parent meant manually copying username &amp; password from the extension to a website. While I never do that (autofill seems to work fine for me), the same proposed solution still applies, I guess.')
