It seems to be saying: Do a bit of breadth-first mixed with some depth-first. But whatever you do don&#x27;t do only depth-first.</i><p>It seems to be saying that to me too.<p>Given the tree and maze visualizations, I&#x27;m a bit surprised that there was no corresponding visualization of the recommended strategy of switching back and forth between depth-first and breadth-first search (at regular or perhaps random intervals).<p>Regarding the optimality of various strategies, there is a distinction to be made between the optimal strategy for an individual learner&#x2F;searcher, and the optimal individual strategy for searching collectively.<p>Also, there is a difference between strategies for acquiring <i>existing knowledge that is new to you</i>, vs. expanding the boundary of existing knowledge.<p>Regarding the &quot;expanding the boundary of knowledge collectively&quot; problem space specifically, it is worth noting that a pure depth-first approach isn&#x27;t really possible in practice. Even in fields that reward depth-first individual search strategies such as math, an individual searcher&#x27;s search is bounded by the length of their career, and each new searcher starts semi-randomly somewhere along the then-current boundary of collective knowledge.')
