I don’t know the exact logic, but it’s not new.<p>Whether or not such a bump gives the same benefits as slow ramping (and if it delivers then more quickly or not) is something I haven’t found any studies on - but I have found in the past studies indicating sun exposure is better than supplements for the same attained blood vitamin D levels (not surprising, as vitamin D is far from the only result of sun exposure)')
