Or a scientist who&#x27;s spent her whole life studying, and who believes that their depth of knowledge is superior to most people?<p>Not all claims of superiority are narcissistic. (Although I think society has rightly picked a convention where you&#x27;re not really supposed to say such things about yourself, but rather wait for someone else to nominate you as superior in some narrowly defined way.)<p>It is, in fact, possible to be truly superior in spiritual terms, but such people are usually identified by their demeanor and accomplishments more than their claims.')
