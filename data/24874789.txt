And if they determine incorrectly in a case, they’re open to damages in that case.<p>So, is it worth it? Or is it worth just letting the parties figure it out?<p>If the DMCA is truly invalid, a counter-claim can be filed. If the other party doesn’t want to file one, I guess GitHub wonders why it should keep the content up when the creator doesn’t have faith in it.<p>Obviously I note the possible flaw in the above logic, in that there’s a difference between an individual developer deciding it’s worth starting a legal faff with a big company by filing a counter-claim, verses GitHub doing it, but their service would go broke dealing with legal requests otherwise.<p>Correct way to deal with this is through your lawmakers, not saying Microsoft should foot the bill for a broken law.')
