In the natural world, living things die. Living things die because things never actually stay exactly the same, so nothing goes on forever, and to achieve something like forever, living things copy themselves before they die, bestowing their resources upon this copy. But, in the natural world these resources stop right there and don&#x27;t compound. Capital, because it exhibits no entropy outside of inflation, does compound and will always send us right back here again to societal collapse in eternal return. Our desire, birthed in hunting &amp; gathering, which was formed to stand in opposition to entropy, like entropy, has no limit. Thus our desires will always lead to excess capital accumulation, until such a time that our tokens and assets can become entropic or until we collapse. The lion will lay with the lamb, or we will be the hand of our own destruction, enabled by technology, or in the language of the Daodejing:<p>&quot;To understand others is to have knowledge;<p>To understand oneself is to be illumined.<p>To conquer others needs strength;<p>To conquer oneself is harder still.<p>To be content with what one has is to be rich.<p>He that works through violence may get his way;<p>But only what stays in its place<p>Can endure.<p>When one dies one is not lost; there is no other longevity.&quot;')
