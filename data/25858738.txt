This means that missing a deadline is recoverable as long as it doesn&#x27;t happen multiple times in a row. I&#x27;d also note that since Netflix probably only cares about synchronization and not latency during video play back they could have a buffer depth of nearly anything they wanted, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a knob Android exposes to applications.<p>2)  The deadline is probably not the end of the current frame but rather than end of the next frame (i.e. ~18ms away) or further. The application can specify this with the presentation time EGL extension[1] that&#x27;s required to be present on all Android devices.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.khronos.org&#x2F;registry&#x2F;EGL&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;ANDROID&#x2F;EGL_ANDROID_presentation_time.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.khronos.org&#x2F;registry&#x2F;EGL&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;ANDROID&#x2F;EGL_...</a>')
