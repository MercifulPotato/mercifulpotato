To cut right to the chase, John Hammond is a manipulative liar in the book.  This is explained to the reader and Alan Grant by Bob Morris, an EPA official, who explains that Hammond operates a secretive organization that is setting up an expensive bioengineering lab on a remote Costa Rican island specifically because it is far from the eyes of government regulators.  Shortly after receiving this information from Morris, Grant is contacted over the phone by Hammond, who confirms they have such a facility and expresses his hatred of government regulators.<p>The movie on the other hand never really explains why the facility is on such a remote island.  The audience is left to assume it&#x27;s for the tropical climate or to help contain the animals <i>(which in the book had already failed, with numerous children already attacked and at least one killed by chicken-sized procompsognathids.  John Hammond was aware the dinosaurs had already escaped containment, but denied it.)</i>  The use of the island to evade the law is not mentioned or even hinted at in the movie.<p>Then there is the matter of Hammond&#x27;s grandchildren.  Why were they brought to the island?  The movie doesn&#x27;t really explain this, except perhaps to say that Hammond wants to &#x27;show them something real.&#x27;  In the book, his motive for bringing his grandchildren is Machiavellian; it&#x27;s his attempt to emotionally manipulate his critical guests.  He brought his grandchildren to an island he had every reason to believe was dangerous because he wanted to hide behind them.  He puts the children in harms way, using them as shields against criticism.<p>What of Hammond&#x27;s motivation for the island?  In the movie, the lawyer Gennaro remarks that they could charge anything, selling tickets to the uber rich.  Perhaps they would have a &#x27;coupon day&#x27; for everybody else.  This angers Hammond who says that anybody should be able to see the dinosaurs.  Hammond is a dinosaur nut, naive, but motivated most of all by his child-like love of dinosaurs.  But in the book, Hammond is the one who wants to charge astronomical ticket prices, not Gennaro.  Negative aspects of Hammond&#x27;s character in the book are taken from Hammond and transplanted into Gennaro, who is then eaten by the T-Rex (in the book he acts heroically and survives.)<p>In popular media, people <i>generally</i> get what they deserve.   Greed that results in the death of a child is particularly heinous and demands karmic retribution.  In the movie, no children die, and Hammond lives.  But as mentioned early, procompsognathids kill at least one child in the beginning of the book and attack many more.  For this, Hammond&#x27;s fate is sealed.  At the end of the book, Hammond is attacked and killed by procompsognathids while everybody is is being rescued.  He never gets his <i>&quot;come to Jesus&quot;</i> redemption moment, as he does during his conversation with Ellie in the movie.  He dies a selfish asshole.')
