There is often a need for any separate migration process&#x2F;scripts to be synchronised with corresponding changes to the DB access code in the main application, so the models in the application code always match the actual schema in the database. For seed data, there may be some &quot;real&quot; data that should always be present but also some &quot;example&quot; data you want to include (and reset to a known state) for each test in an integration test suite. Etc.<p>It kind of amazes me that there doesn&#x27;t yet seem to be a way of handling this in the web development community that has become a de facto standard in the way most of us look at tools like Docker or Git these days.')
