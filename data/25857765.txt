Item(by='bambax', descendants=None, kids=[25857988, 25862822], score=None, time=1611228155, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25852783, text='I&#x27;m currently toying with making an &quot;air&quot; MIDI controller that uses ultrasonic distance sensors (HC SR04).<p>Those sensors work around 40kHz, well beyond normal human hearing (human range is 20Hz to 20kHz and narrows with age) and I certainly don&#x27;t hear anything. Yet my children, who are between 10-15, swear they can hear them (and I have at least verified they can tell by ear when they are on or off).<p>I wonder how an array of 256 of these would sound to them? (From the product image: 16x16=256).')
