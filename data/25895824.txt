(making the cost effectively infinite).<p>That logic makes a lot of cheap things cost an effectively infinite amount, like shopping centre security.<p>A waste storage facility doesn&#x27;t need armed guards if it isn&#x27;t being used any more than a shopping centre would. If the facility isn&#x27;t being used then it can be sealed with a big plug of concrete or something else that has a cost that is small vs. infinity.<p>Plus there is a decent chance that the dangerous stuff will be a valuable fuel source in 100 years.')
