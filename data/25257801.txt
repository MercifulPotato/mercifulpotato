Interact, yes. Store long term, no.<p>If you have problems with monetary policy vote in a new government, just taking your ball to the BVI isn’t a solution.<p>&gt; ...you don’t understand what Bitcoin is.<p>I understand full well, and I believe those are bad things. Deflation is bad, for the reason I stated, and an inability to print means an inability to respond to geopolitical shocks (like COVID, for instance Canada has been paying everyone $2000&#x2F;month this whole time). Not to mention an inability to grow supply with the entry of new market participants.<p>Bitcoin cannot and will not change the wealth gap when it’s overwhelmingly spoken for already. The best you can do is sentence your children to fight for scraps while the new moneyed class of criminals and lowlifes continues to grow in relative wealth as a fraction of economic activity by doing literally nothing with their money - backed on an inflation schedule created and managed not by economists or experts but a narcotics smuggler and a bunch of random GitHub contributors.<p>If you really want to change society for the better, run for office, don’t shill magic beans.')
