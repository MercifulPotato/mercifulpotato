I think few companies are out there &quot;hiring by race or gender&quot;. At most companies I know, affirmative action means hiring by skill, but making sure at least XX% of the hiring pool are women, black, etc. This really just means your resume is more likely to get seen and maybe you&#x27;re more likely to get a first round, but not that &quot;you&#x27;re being hired by race or gender&quot;.<p>2. You could argue this is still unfair (although as previously stated, you&#x27;re still hiring people who earned it based on skill). Unfortunately not doing anything would me more unfair, specifically by stagnating things in the problematic state they are now [1].<p>In the macro-historical context, white Americans brought African slaves to their country,  and actively deprived of wealth and knowledge, right? That was a societal, conscious commitment to push these people down.<p>Now that they&#x27;re free but seriously lacking wealth and behind on knowledge too, they&#x27;re expected just create that wealth and knowledge themselves. Thanks to &quot;unfair&quot; institutions like public education, this is going to happen regardless, but very slowly unless there&#x27;s a societal, conscious commitment to push these people up.<p>[1]: Having a huge chunk of your society be alienated not only socially but also economically leads to conflict, could worsen the gap instead of improving it, weakens social and cultural ties, etc.')
