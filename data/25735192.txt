Simple yet powerful app. You configure your habits and associate a frequency, and once done they disappear from the list. You can set up reminders&#x2F;alarms as well.<p>The only &quot;tip&quot; I would suggest to you is to open the app once a day. For that, I created a daily habit of &quot;checking my habits&quot;. A little bit meta, but it holds myself accountable.<p>Some of my tracked habits: calling mom&#x2F;grandma, reading, use Anki, gratitude journal, exercice, drink 1.5L or water a day, meditate, breathing exercices, no screen time after 20:00, etc.<p>Of course, not meant to disencourage you from doing your own app, just to show how I scratch my very same itch. May the code be with you ;)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=org.isoron.uha...</a><p>[2] It&#x27;s an OpenSource project! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iSoron&#x2F;uhabits" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iSoron&#x2F;uhabits</a>')
