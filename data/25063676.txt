Get the nursery set up as best you can, get the buggy&#x2F;stroller unpacked and assembled, get a stockpile of nappies&#x2F;diapers, fix that broken light switch or dripping tap etc, get the car serviced and the tyres changed etc.<p>If you have any side-projects (or even games you are playing through) on the go, get them to a good place where you can stop and leave it for a while. I had grand ideas of continuing to hack away at some projects - even if it was just 15-30 minutes at a time - but of course like everyone says there is no time for that. I should have tied things off before baby arrived so things were neat and tidy (i.e. not in the middle or some epic refactor or juggling a bunch of PRs that need to be merged etc), left myself some notes, and then come back to it in 6-9 months when you get a bit more time again.<p>There wont be time when baby arrives.  Good luck! :-)')
