Similar to when the Sectigo&#x2F;AddTrust root expired recently (but perhaps that was an issue because the cross-signed certificate expired).<p>If you support older systems, you really need to try to separate out clients to different hostnames (and sometimes different IPs, it they don&#x27;t have good SNI support), so that you can provide each segment with the certificate chain it needs. Trust root issues are a lot harder than the sha1 deprecation, because at least there&#x27;s a fairly well used TLS option exchanged for key support (it doesn&#x27;t exactly mean support for keys in certificates, but it worked pretty well). There is a TLS option to provide trusted CA information, but it has zero mainstream use (and it doesn&#x27;t seem terribly usable anyway, sending all your trusted root CAs is too much data, a digest&#x2F;id would be much more reasonable).<p>Thankfully, browsers usually have forgiving verifiers, but if you support applications, libraries for certificate verification are all over the place; and if you support 3rd party clients good luck. x.509 is too big a spec to want to bundle it with an app, but you can bundle in trusted roots if you&#x27;re targetting a sane platform.')
