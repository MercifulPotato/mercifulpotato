Item(by='Abishek_Muthian', descendants=None, kids=[25643701], score=None, time=1609837297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25641624, text='&gt;add more photos<p>How much does image actually weigh in the site&#x27;s score? What about the text only websites e.g. PG&#x27;s essays, not including forums like HN. I would presume PG&#x27;s blog has great backlink score but would a similar site with same number of backlinks but with several images rank more?(hoping for clarification from an anonymous Googler).<p>I&#x27;m asking this because my text only blog content titled &#x27;Startup ideas vs Problems&#x27;[1] was the featured snippet when the search term is &#x27;Startup ideas vs Problems&#x27;[2] until recently as the current featured snippet features another website with a featured image within the blog post.<p>Although my blog is still the first result, but google now suggests &#x27;Did you mean: Startup ideas and Problems&#x27; which buries my blog post effectively killing my traffic.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hitstartup.com&#x2F;startup-ideas-vs-problems&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hitstartup.com&#x2F;startup-ideas-vs-problems&#x2F;</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?hl=en&amp;q=Startup%20ideas%20vs%20Problems" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?hl=en&amp;q=Startup%20ideas%20vs%2...</a>')
