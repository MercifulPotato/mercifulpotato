I&#x27;ve since moved temporarily to Taiwan and switched to a Taiwanese SIM. Recently, my Google Voice prompted me to re-verify my US-based number (which I no longer have access to) and eventually disassociated it with my account when I didn&#x27;t do so. So now I do not have a &quot;real&quot; US mobile phone number associated with my account. I cannot associate my Taiwanese number because the country code must match my Google Voice number.<p>The Google Voice app does not let you make phone calls if you do not have a real phone number registered in your account. I&#x27;ve been using the Hangouts Dialer app to make calls, which doesn&#x27;t have this requirement. But, per this announcement, it is going away. So after this I&#x27;ll have no economical way to make calls to the US on my phone (calling via the Taiwanese SIM is expensive). I think I&#x27;ll work around the problem by associating one of my parents&#x27; numbers with my account (any number will do, it&#x27;s mainly an anti-fraud measure), but it would be great if I didn&#x27;t have to jump through that hoop.')
