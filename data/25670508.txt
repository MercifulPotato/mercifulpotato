No cost savings, no preventative care, and only the most sensational and dramatic ailments receive GoFundMe support from peers.<p>For proof of the cost savings, look at the cost of X given procedure in any developed country with socialized care (Australia, Sweden, Germany, etc.) and then compare it to the US.<p>In the US it will cost anywhere from 2X-10X more to do X given procedure. It&#x27;s not even worth citing any research since there&#x27;s mountains of studies proving this.')
