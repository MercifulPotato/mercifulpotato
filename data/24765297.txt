It&#x27;s gotten worse than Microsoft in the nineties.<p>And with critical mass, Google will hopefully make a similar turn. Microsoft is now the world&#x27;s largest open source contributor by some metrics. I don&#x27;t know if I buy those metrics, but it&#x27;s big. Same thing will happen to Google, hopefully.')
