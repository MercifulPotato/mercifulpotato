Psychopathy is prevalent in about 1 in 100. If 1&#x2F;100 people were serial killers, we&#x27;d have a big problem on our hands.<p>In reality, psychopaths blend into society very well. You likely know a few and wouldn&#x27;t even suspect them unless you know what to look for. They find their way into positions that are highly competitive, where their lack of empathy serves them well. Psychopaths are overrepresented as surgeons, lawyers, bankers, law enforcement (you&#x27;ll find a lot of psychopaths behind bars, but you&#x27;ll also find a lot keeping them there), politicians, and yes CEOs.')
