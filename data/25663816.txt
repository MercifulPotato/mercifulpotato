If the same amount of help gets there then the value is potentially the same, or more (or less).<p>&gt; Even if the total is the same, the fact that it just trickled in and it lacked coordination can only hurt.<p>This is not true, the individual nature allows for more flexibility in meeting everyone&#x27;s actual needs. &quot;one size fits all&quot; usually doesn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; And you won&#x27;t effectively put out a big fire no matter how many cups of water you individually dump on it.<p>This is an inapt metaphor, probably because its physically false.<p>&gt; Fittingly even the example you chose is bad simply because &quot;malaria relief&quot; still involves quite the coordinated effort, not the least financial, not individual people independently sending small help to a single other person.<p>Actually there are people sending malaria nets over there, the coordination problems you speak of are already solved.')
