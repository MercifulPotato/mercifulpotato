However I don&#x27;t expect it to provide real security for email transport, since SMTP traffic could go through any amount of plaintext hops outside of my control on either side of an mx to mx communication session.<p>And my mx also needs to be backwards compatible to exchange email with older systems out there on the internet that speak no TLS at all.<p>I don&#x27;t dispute the merits of tls1.3 in any way, or that it functions as designed.<p>Aside from email, the entire centrally hierarchical root CA system is a hack job. Why does your browser trust certificate authorities from turkey and mainland China?<p>CA cert issuance transparency and public logs are a further hack job piled on top.')
