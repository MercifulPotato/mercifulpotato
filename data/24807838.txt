For example a while back I had to implement a https get and post request and it was a total nightmare. Something that takes only a few lines in python took a few days to figure out. Maybe it&#x27;s lack fo experience but I tried wrestling with libraries like pocco which I couldn&#x27;t figure out for the life of me but in the end ended up writing a monster of a program implementing the winhttp api directly.<p>I made a similar comment earlier and someone suggested I should have just used libcurl. How to people normally wrestle with these things without going crazy?')
