Unlike the standard model of particle physics, it&#x27;s a classical theory, i.e. a set of equations which tell you deterministically, without any of the inherent uncertainty of QM, how a given initial configuration will evolve.<p>This becomes a problem when you try to include GR in even simple experimental setups which expose QM&#x27;s non-classical behavior, like the Stern-Gerlach experiment [1]. What does gravity do before the path chosen by the particle (which is gravitationally attractive) is measured?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experime...</a>')
