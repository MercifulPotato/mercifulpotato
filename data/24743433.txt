Intel took it, implemented it in broken ways to win benchmark comparisons and win IT buying managers&#x27; hearts and minds, locking everyone into their chipsets.  Finally, all those broken implementations were exposed, and AMD finally had the capital to do things right at scale.<p>RISC or MIPS or any other CPU in that &quot;minimized&quot; class doesn&#x27;t really have the room to scale as fast.')
