The world has responded with &quot;lockdowns&quot;, &quot;masks&quot;, and more, which is the result of an unprecedented, 100 year class event, that being a pandemic.<p>Your comment isn&#x27;t really about normality, but instead about an extreme edge case scenario.  The only thing worse than a pandemic, might be nuclear war, a massive nuclear accident, or large-scale disaster.<p>Normality need not be conflated with actions during emergency scenarios.<p>Lastly -- imagine if people DID engage in more, &quot;only affected themselves&#x27; risky behaviour.  It would mean more hospital visits, therefore <i>more</i> hospital capacity, more doctors&#x2F;nurses&#x2F;etc etc, which would mean more ability to absorb and deal with large scale emergency issues.')
