The vote should have been for a realistic deal, with article 50 notification contingent on having agreed said deal in principle. People had _no_ idea what they were voting for, and that&#x27;s entirely Cameron&#x27;s government&#x27;s fault.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that referendums are necessarily bad in principle, though.<p>In Ireland we have quite a few of these, but generally the government will say what it intends to do with a Yes result. When people voted yes on the abortion referendum, say, they weren&#x27;t just voting for &quot;more abortions, please&quot; in the abstract, they were told ahead of time what would happen if they did vote yes.')
