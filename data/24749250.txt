Not have office?<p>Why doesn&#x27;t my small ISV get the same tax advantages?<p>Corporations like Amazon effectively don&#x27;t pay taxes and YOU&#x27;RE subsidizing them.  We should be outraged.<p>Instead. Just change the law. Make it retroactive (ex post factor legislation only applies to criminal law) and demand that these companies immediately bring in their money into the US and pay taxes.<p>Everything else is just a hack.')
