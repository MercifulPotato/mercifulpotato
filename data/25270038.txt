We now know that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic&#x2F;mild, and those infections are only really identified due to RT-PCR testing. The vast majority of asymptomatic Spanish Flu cases would have been impossible to identify in 1918. We also have access to much faster&#x2F;more aggressive treatment options than would have been available in 1918&#x2F;1919. As a global community we were also more tuned into breaking events in Wuhan &amp; prepared more swiftly accordingly (not enough - but that&#x27;s a different discussion). Comparing oranges to oranges, if SARS-CoV-2 had spread in 1918, it&#x27;s likely COVID would have been a bigger killer than the Spanish Flu.<p>It&#x27;s probably more apt to state that the 1918 Pandemic was worse than the 2019&#x2F;2020&#x2F;2021 Pandemic - probably true. Virus to virus? Probably not.')
