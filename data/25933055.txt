Item(by='interestica', descendants=None, kids=[25934214, 25937538], score=None, time=1611777225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25930171, text='&gt; I think it&#x27;s obvious that the calves and some of the cows are eventually sent for slaughter. A small dairy like the one above can only maintain so many animals at a time.<p>Why is that obvious? Who handles the slaughter? It raises the question about this particular place demonstrating their ethics (they went with the name ethical dairy!) but also leaving out valid questions about the animals. In terms of ethics, is it better if the slaughter was handled by the same farm that raised the animals? Because, is it still &#x27;ethical&#x27; if after highlighting how well you treat the animals, and after the utility of the animals has ceased, you pass them on to another system that may not treat them as well? On a linked page[1] they say: &quot;Eventually the cows and the bull calves will enter the food chain for meat.&quot; and it just seems like such a weird way of phrasing to distance the reader from the realities. (They mention they send them for slaughter but do some in-house: &quot;Around half of our bull calves are finished on our farm&quot; -- again, using the phrasing &#x27;finished&#x27; to distance the reader from the realities of it.)<p>&gt; This is a dairy farm, so it should not be expected to abide by the ethics of vegan people.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone has suggested that. The initial critique was just for what was <i>not</i> said.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theethicaldairy.co.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;ethical-dairy-system" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theethicaldairy.co.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;ethical-dairy-system</a><p>edit: corrected &#x27;may not&#x27; and added sentence on &#x27;finished&#x27;')
