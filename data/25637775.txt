Especially given Julian has already paid dearly for exposing what we should have known. The war criminals themselves haven&#x27;t spent a day behind bars.<p>&gt; Names of people in other countries with oppressive regimes, who passed on information on the understanding that their names would be kept confidential, no.<p>WikiLeaks asked for these names so they can redact them.
