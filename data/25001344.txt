Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604606053, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24999365, text='True, there are a couple of different senses in which “gold standard” has come to be used. I was treating it as “the benchmark by which all else is compared”.<p>But even so, I’d strongly disagree with any claim that a default practice exists for icons on the web. Images PNG, images SVG, background images PNG, background images SVG, inline SVG of a couple of varieties, icon fonts: all of these are extremely widely used, and none is in any way “standard” (let alone a reference paragon).<p>Funny you should mention FontAwesome. I don’t know what direction they’re taking it in, but I look at how they’ve deployed the icons on their site, and… I’m seeing a lot of inline SVG.')
