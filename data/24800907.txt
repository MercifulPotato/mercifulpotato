Network equipment that fools with every packet can get backed up if the traffic packet count exceeds a limit. By Nagling (or doing something similar in your transmit code) you can increase your message rate through such bottlenecks.<p>Used to have a server cluster that used some &#x27;hologram&#x27; style router on the receiving end, to spread load. It had a hard limit on # packets per second it could handle. I changed our app to combine sends (2ms timer, not 40ms!) and halved our total traffic packet count. Put off the day they had to buy more server-side hardware to handle the load.<p>Btw if the clients are on wifi networks, then there&#x27;s no point in aggregating sends past a pretty small size (512 bytes?) because wifi fragments (used to fragment?) packets to that smaller size over the air, and never reassembles them, leaving that to the target server.')
