Because according to physics, why should we?<p>But again from (1) there is no such thing as &#x27;value&#x27; or &#x27;emotion&#x27; or even &#x27;choice&#x27; in random noise - you can see they hypocrisy of the statement.<p>You&#x27;re caught in a &#x27;Chinese Finger Trap&#x27; of Scientific Materialism.<p>You cannot on one hand talk about &#x27;choice&#x27; &#x27;values&#x27; because physics says those would be &#x27;emotional&#x27; choices, when at the same time, materialist physics also tells us that there is no choice, emotion, intelligence, consciousness to begin with.<p>Physics is telling us that you and I are just rocks rolling down a hill. We hit a bump, we go one way or another. That&#x27;s it. No choice, no intelligence, no science, no discoveries, nothing is &#x27;evolving&#x27; - just pure random noise like the fuzzy screen on the old TV sets.<p>Remember that physics has not <i>proven</i> that the universe exists according to a certain set of rules.<p>Physics is <i>postulating</i> that. We <i>assume</i> the Universe can be described as a set of equations, so we go about trying to describe things using equations.<p>Because these equations have been very objectively helpful to us over the last few hundred years, and using them we can get rid of a bunch of fairy tales and ridiculous ideas ... we&#x27;ve come to believe that Physics itself is the search for truth.<p>But it&#x27;s not - Physics is only the search for material truth within the constraints that it&#x27;s set for itself.<p>By definition, physics may not be able to help us understand the meaning of life because they&#x27;ve resigned themselves to studying the lego blocks of life.<p>Now consider an alternative: the perspective of &#x27;the observer&#x27; and that Science is merely a tool for understanding the Universe around is - that Science is not a &#x27;Truth&#x27; but a &#x27;Tool&#x27;.<p>That &#x27;life&#x27; is the basis of our existence, and that it expresses itself via materialism, but is not entirely constructed of that materialism.<p>The only reason we take any real interest in Materialist Science, ironically, is because of our creative impulses.<p>Obviously - it&#x27;s abstract, and not prone to equations, and can easily devolve into &#x27;magical thinking&#x27; but that doesn&#x27;t invalidate the ultimate premise of non-materialist thinking.<p>Below the &#x27;tree trunk&#x27; of Physics is &#x27;Metaphysics&#x27; and it&#x27;s worth remember that physics at any given time is only one way of interpreting the universe.')
