There was a utility called Conflict Catcher (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Conflict_Catcher" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Conflict_Catcher</a>) that would identify the culprit by doing basically a binary search and turning off half the extensions and rebooting (many times) and noting if there was a crash, and deducing the problem extension that way.<p>It was kind of like &quot;git bisect&quot; before that was a thing.<p>This craziness is no longer necessary.<p>I mean... when you DID get like 20 extensions all running together stably though, it was AWESOME.')
