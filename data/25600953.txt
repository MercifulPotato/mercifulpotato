The weather is the main reason I&#x27;ll eventually leave Singapore, there&#x27;s simply nothing you can do to escape the heat&#x2F;humidity. I work from home and literally run the A&#x2F;C 24&#x2F;7, and even then I still never feel &quot;comfortable&quot; (because it&#x27;s too cold when it&#x27;s too low, and when it&#x27;s too high it doesn&#x27;t evaporate enough sweat).')
