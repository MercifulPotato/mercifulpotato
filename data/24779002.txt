They encounter hardware issues way more frequently compared to Japanese cars. For a typical Japanese car like Honda &#x2F; Toyota &#x2F; Mazda, you typically don&#x27;t need to do anything other than regular maintenance (oil changes, tire rotations, break and tire replacements) for the first 5â€“6 years or 60000 miles. These are simple enough to be done very easily at any regular mechanic. Many Japanese cars run 100K+ miles without encountering any issue.<p>BMWs, otoh, you would be lucky if you went a few years without encountering any mechanical issue. And when you do, you are more likely to have to take it to their dealership, and my friends&#x27; experience of visiting those hasn&#x27;t been great either.')
