(Your second and arguably more important paragraph I’m sympathetic to.) People state their feelings toward things all the time and none of it should ever be considered permanent. I’ve told my boss many times something of similar ilk, “if you’re going to have me and my team do this last minute demo when it was fully in your capacity to plan better, I’m going to be pretty unhappy.” Even to that I demand things change. Yet, for some reason, I’m not fired afterward as a “disgruntled employee” or “somebody who can’t be happy working”. I take time to understand my boss’s disposition and I strongly seek my boss to understand mine, and hopefully we end up in a better place afterward.<p>What’s wrong with Google saying, “we refuse to comply with your demands, and we understand you may feel blablabla. We are trying to streamline our submission process and we would like you to help us do that.”? Maybe it’s because Google doesn’t <i>actually</i> have a desire to work with her, in which case, the ultimatum (or whatever it truly was) is just a convenient out.')
