This reasoning is applied to arguments about other things as well, such as taxes.<p>The problems with it become apparent when you realize that the standard isn&#x27;t applied everywhere and is really impossible to evaluate fairly, so the conclusions are derived from personal ethics and concepts of &quot;fairness&quot; instead.<p>As an example, &quot;they can afford it&quot; is often used as an argument in favor of higher taxes on &quot;the wealthy&quot; (whatever that means), yet nobody says &quot;you can afford to pay starbucks more for your coffee&quot;. You could have certainly afforded to pay more for your car or house or macbook, so why didn&#x27;t you if &quot;you can afford it&quot; is the bar? Likewise many SV tech workers could &quot;afford&quot; to take pay <i>cuts</i>, but nobody&#x27;s arguing that - why not, if &quot;you can afford it&quot; is the measure?')
