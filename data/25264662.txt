There was Wordpress, with all its glorious WYSIWYGiness that FB and Twitter lacked, which, according to Wikipedia, was first released in 2003. There was LiveJournal that got released even earlier. And yet, it is Jack and Zuck, not Matt (Mullenweg) or Brad (Fitzpatrick), who somehow caught the zeitgeist and attracted the crowds.')
