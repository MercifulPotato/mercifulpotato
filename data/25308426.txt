Just curious, the US is almost completely an at will employment.<p>Even with a contract?  I know little enough about US labour laws, although I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not at-will all over.  Where I am (not the US) you can sue for unfair dismissal.<p>&gt; Fighting to get your name dirted that you didn&#x27;t resign but were fired, seems odd.<p>Yeah, I agree if there&#x27;s a good chance if the resignation stands.  However if she could get a court to say she was unfairly dismissed it might be a different case, as it would help her case that Google have acted unfairly towards her.  None of this publicity is going to help her future employment potential generally but may help in niche circles that she might be aiming for.')
