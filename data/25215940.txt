The difficulty isnâ€™t knowing what society wants, it is knowing the path to get there.<p>&gt; What do we want from our technology?<p>&gt;    We want the right to change providers.<p>&gt;    We want the right to protect personal data.<p>&gt;    We want the right to verify.<p>&gt;    We want the right to not be tracked.<p>&gt;    We want the right to access.<p>It is well documented that this is not at all what people desire from technology. What people buy directly contradicts this.<p>People _could_ use PGP. They _could_ use strong passwords. They _could_ move to defederated social networks. They _could_ lobby their congressional representatives to break up Apple because their walled garden is a vertical monopoly that harms consumers.*<p>They could do all sorts of things, but they do not. The trade-offs are not worth it to &quot;people&quot;.<p>* I don&#x27;t believe this argument, but it is one.')
