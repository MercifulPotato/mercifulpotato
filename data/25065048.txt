I think I could have worked out your question about syncing an mp3 within the first hour of using it. Warp is on by default for any audio you bring in.<p>If you&#x27;re not prepared to spend some time learning how to use it, then maybe the whole thing is not for you. Most people enjoy the whole process.<p>You are being unrealistic if you think that just because Ableton runs on a computer means everything about it should be automatic.  Ableton is a professional level DAW and as such has a lot of complexity under the hood.<p>Ordinary musical instruments only have a few knobs and take a lifetime to master. I don&#x27;t know why you would suppose it should be any easier to master Ableton which has literally thousands of knobs?')
