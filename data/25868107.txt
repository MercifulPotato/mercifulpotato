We use WinRT almost exclusively to refer to the new COM-based API surface that “modern” applications use. I see now that I’ve misunderstood you :)<p>Back when VT parsing was implemented, it was an entirely new output stream parser built into a console that hadn’t been updated in a rather long time. We were careful commensurate with its age, and opt-in made sense. Language runtimes or compatibility layers like Cygwin could handle the decision for all of their hosted applications(1) and everything else would generally continue working properly. Now that we’re working on conhost’s replacement, we get to revisit some of those decisions!<p>Cases like this are especially acceptable because a user can always fall back to conhost. That escape hatch isn’t one we intend to get rid of.<p>1) this doesn’t do anything for manual or direct ports, and Cygwin is far from the only provider here. Representative example, etc.')
