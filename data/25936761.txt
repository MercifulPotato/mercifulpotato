No speculators? Please.<p>And these guys aren’t even taking money from those late to the party, so much as from the short sellers (vultures) who were happy to see the company go into the ground.<p>Elon Musk hates short sellers with a passion. They try to sabotage a business.<p>When trading is halted on a stock that is in freefall, I can understand that. But here they are halting a stock that is rising based on short squeezing! Honestly 148% naked shorting by private hedge funds should be illegal, and you’re gonna tell me that the government should side with the short sellers against a crowd of everyday people who are INVESTING INTO A COMPANY THEY LIKE?<p>How exactly is wall street the little guy? They snap their fingers and get trillion dollar bailouts instantly. Regular people barely get a $1200 check. And now even speculative SHORT POSITIONS are supposed to be protected??<p>This sounds like how a casino finds out that a game has a loophole and then tells people they can’t actually keep their winnings. And the fourth wall is broken. Apparently hedge funds can short any stock and if regular people notice and beat them back, then it’s the speculative hedge fund that’s trying to kill the company, that should just go ahead eh. How dare regular folks threaten the tried and true methods of speculation?')
