I would love to upgrade, but I have no idea what&#x27;s the best way to figure out if call recording works on a particular phone without having to buy it. My plan B is to replace the battery and the screen in my current phone and maybe squeeze another year or two out of it and it will be fun to learn how to do it. It&#x27;s old, but is still better than e.g. Librem 5.')
