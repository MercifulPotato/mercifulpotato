If they don&#x27;t build very effective antibodies, they shouldn&#x27;t be putting much selective pressure on the virus, because if they did, they&#x27;d be more effective in the first place.<p>If a normal person generates a dozen types of antibodies to the vaccine&#x27;s spike protein, and a couple types are strongly sterilizing...<p>And you happen to have an immune response where you generate 8&#x2F;12 of these, and only one of the strongly sterilizing variant, and you are more prone to become infected as a result...<p>Then, once infected, the virus will be under selective pressure during your illness to escape some of those 8 antibodies.  In turn, whomever you spread it to will have a harder time.<p>&gt; Maybe multiple vaccines mitigates this a bit...<p>Maybe.  But the portion of the spike protein they&#x27;re expressing and the resulting antibody profiles look very similar.<p>&gt; Given Jan-Mar 2019, I have little faith that the US would ever be in a position to fully eradicate even a small remaining bit, and it would instead fester and mutate in this scenario until exploding again.<p>Yes, but one silver lining is that there would still be some immunity &#x2F; cross-reactivity &#x2F; t cell mediated immunity, etc.  People would still be less likely to have severe illness, I believe.')
