There&#x27;s no autocracy in Nepal (at least not yet). The Maoists won a free and fair election (Socialism is just that popular here). At most the country is super-duper and insanely socialistic, with government owning multiple large monopolies. Unless you call yourself a &quot;socialist&quot; you won&#x27;t be winning any elections here. Unfortunately there is no pro-business&#x2F;capitalistic political party in Nepal and that is what I sincerely believe is lacking here.')
