It is an excellent ISA for student implementation projects, but not for real work.<p>RISC-V is praised only by people who have very little or no experience with different CPU ISAs and with the history of their evolution.<p>RISC-V sucks more than even the ugliest ISA, x86. At least from the huge x86 ISA it is possible to extract a subset composed mostly of more recently introduced instructions, which can be considered as a decent ISA, except for the weird encoding, with many prefix bytes, which is needed for backward compatibility.<p>The 64-bit ARMv8 ISA is an example of a good ISA, but its future is clouded by the NVIDIA acquisition.')
