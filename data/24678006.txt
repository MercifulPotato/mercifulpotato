By readable I mean that even someone who is not familiar with the framework should be able to understand what the code does and how things work together.<p>Since it targets beginners and intermediate game dev, I want it to be as much accessible as possible by exposing only the &quot;high level&quot; aspects and taking care of the &quot;boilerplate&quot; code.<p>For example, rendering is &quot;hidden&quot; from the user by using a Scene&#x2F;Layer system that you can find in other game fw or engines aswell. This way, in just a few line of code you can create prototypes and games quite easily.<p>Finaly, the project is in its early life, and I plan on continuing developping it with new features !')
