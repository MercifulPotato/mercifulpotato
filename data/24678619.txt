But moving on.<p>It&#x27;s always interesting to see that, when actually probing deeper, almost no-one believes in truly unrestricted free speech, even people who proclaim themselves as free speech champions (such as yourself). For example, can I slander you? If I own a newspaper, can I try to convince my readers that you&#x27;re a pedophile? Can I tell someone to commit murder for me (after all, it&#x27;s just speech, it was the other guy who pulled the trigger)? Can I tell a suicidal person that they&#x27;re worthless, nobody will ever like them, and they should just kill themselves? Can I lie under oath? Can I psychologically abuse my children? If you responded &quot;no&quot; to any of these questions, you also don&#x27;t believe in absolute free speech, now it&#x27;s just a matter of arguing where to draw the line.')
