No banning of end user services as long as they&#x27;re legal, I don&#x27;t want a phone maker controlling what I do on the internet. It&#x27;s ridiculous. Microsoft in the 90s doesn&#x27;t even compare to this, it&#x27;s on an entirely different level. If competition regulation would actually still exist we&#x27;d tear apple a new one.')
