You might have noticed them: they&#x27;ve been hard at work forming mobs firing people for expressing opinions, and lately tearing down statues (literal iconoclasm: a la Calvinism in the 16th century, or Taliban now) and burning down American cities. They&#x27;d all be extremely low in RWA score, which is why I assert that this &quot;measurement&quot; is simply a republican (aka classical liberal) detector.<p>Classical liberals are not meaningfully authoritarian in any sense of the word; though of course there have been historical aberrations (pre-Salazar Portugal could have been considered both Authoritarian and classical liberal, as I suppose were some post-war governments).<p>I agree that the book doesn&#x27;t use a meaningful definition of &quot;authoritarian.&quot; That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m trying to say here. The author is some kind of nut attempting to demonize the half of America that doesn&#x27;t vote his way as being &quot;authoritarians.&quot; He also wants to &quot;cure&quot; them. That seems .... kind of authoritarian.<p>On those details: Evola ... I mean, the man is about as influential as Miguel Serrano or any other fascist crank who persisted too long into the 20th century. Who cares what he says? It&#x27;s burbling nonsense. Toole&#x27;s character was a farce designed to make fun of Evolan types (pretty sure anyway; maybe it had an element of self mockery). And Dreher is a hipster ding dong whose hipsterness consists in having read &quot;Confederacy of Dunces.&quot;<p>I know actually right wing and actually religious people who would score high on this &quot;RWA&quot; scale. They&#x27;re not authoritarian at all! Much more accepting of divergences from their beliefs than even modern American <i>centrists.</i>')
