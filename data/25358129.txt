Or on festivals or while skiing with friends. Not in everyday life.<p>&gt; Would you pay for it?<p>Yes, but I would prefer a solution where I host a server myself to be honest. I would more gladly pay for a license here instead of a service with monthly costs. In reality I have some dev friends and if it was a feature we really wanted, we might hack something ugly together ourselves. But for commercial use I would do pay for it.<p>&gt; Would you or your company sponsor it?<p>No. I am in a position where I could influence such decisions in the company I work for, but I think it would just lead to employee surveillance, which I don&#x27;t support. My boss might, but I would recommend to refrain from doing so and would gather arguments against it.<p>I know it is common in logistics, but that shouldn&#x27;t mean everyone has to accept such tracking. Poor souls...')
