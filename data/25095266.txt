How would we establish that? Well, we&#x27;d have to have some understanding of what the purpose of the corporation is. I don&#x27;t claim to have any special insight into that, I&#x27;m just pointing out that claiming that its purpose is maximising shareholder revenue is historically revisionist and inaccurate.')
