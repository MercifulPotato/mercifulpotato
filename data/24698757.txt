There is a lot of things we miss when thinking about that: soil depletion, which recent research shows is a huge factor for climate change. And there is so much more.<p>One general thing I want to add:\nAny large scale industry can theoretically be the most efficient and optimal for the environment but these days none of them is. Why is that? I think because there is no incentive to do that and there is no price on environmental costs.<p>Happy to hear your thoughts!')
