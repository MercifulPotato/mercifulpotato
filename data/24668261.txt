The point is recognizing the relationship to more familiar forms of combustion and oxidation in day-to-day life; that&#x27;s how you orient yourself when you come to the question for the first time.<p>I would guess that there are two familiar forms of combustion in day-to-day life: burning wood, and burning gasoline. Only the second is referred to as &quot;combustion&quot; in the vernacular. (Since it happens in an &quot;internal combustion engine&quot;.)<p>Neither involves burning pure carbon; one burns carbohydrates and one burns petroleum. The definition of &quot;combustion&quot; that I was taught in chemistry class was &quot;any reaction that produces carbon dioxide <i>and water</i>&quot;.<p>But you might have a very different day-to-day life and chemistry education, I guess.')
