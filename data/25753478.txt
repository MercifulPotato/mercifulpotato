You pay for room service for two weeks to get food.  This is what Singapore does.<p>- If you don&#x27;t want to stay at the government hotel, you agree to let the government track your cell phone for two weeks to make sure you stay in your home, and randomly call you twice a day to make sure you didn&#x27;t ditch your phone.  This is what Taiwan does.<p>As a plus, all the hotels near airports would be so thankful for all the forced business to make up for the loss of travel business.<p>They should have been doing this for the last nine months.<p>Edit: And obviously combine these rules with a relief bill that helps the industries that are hurt by these rules, or you know, everyone.')
