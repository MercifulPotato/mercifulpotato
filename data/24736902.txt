Cold, flu, anything.<p>My beginning D3 levels were 39 ng&#x2F;ml, so just under the ideal range of 40-60, and not really deficient. I have not tested recently, though I believe my numbers would be higher now. I also try to get at least 30 minutes of sun exposure over most of my body 3-4 times per week. Fortunately I live where I can get good sun exposure year-round. Point is, test your serum D3 level and do whatever you need to get into the desired range, and don&#x27;t take more than that level of supplementation. I do believe that sun exposure is a better choice than supplements, if practicable.')
