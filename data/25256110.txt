Item(by='renewiltord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606756352, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25255978, text='Quite simply I&#x27;d like to internalize all externalities so that market forces can determine equilibria. So yes, I think if we could effectively determine provenance, I would like very much to enable that for all things - diseases being the obvious ones, but certainly anything else where externalities exist to some trackable degree (carbon emissions are an obvious one).<p>My rationale for this case is quite simple. I have very effective protocol around this disease, high risk tolerance, and I want to retain the life I had before (going out, restaurants, clubs, etc.). In exchange, I&#x27;m willing to allow you to sue me if I get you sick. I think this will create a freer society, and allow people to find their own position on the risk-benefit curve. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to subject me to the conditions less-risk-tolerant people want. However, it doesn&#x27;t make sense for me to subject them non-consensually to conditions I want. A good mechanism to balance these things is a near-continuous universal value measure. A good near-continuous universal value measure is money.<p>FWIW I&#x27;ve rewritten your question from &quot;why do you feel you are entitled to sue...&quot; to &quot;why do you think it is a good idea for society to permit people to sue...&quot; since I think that&#x27;s more interesting. The answer to &quot;what gives you the idea that you are entitled to sue&quot; is &quot;nothing, since I do not believe I can right now&quot; which is sort of a boring (though correct) response.<p>Of course the whole thing is moot. Hard to prove who really caused an infection when community transmission is rampant.')
