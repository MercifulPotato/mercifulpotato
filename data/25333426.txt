If i&#x27;ve put in some effort to point out issues, and you don&#x27;t even spend the effort to address each comment individually, then you are not respecting the reviewers time.<p>Maybe there are some cases you are right, but as a general rule i&#x27;ll just always follow (1) as an author, as it honestly doesn&#x27;t cost me much time, and makes my reviewers life easier.')
