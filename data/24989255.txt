They take a job at Walmart or driving a school bus, it doesn&#x27;t pay very well, so they get off work and pick up some rides to supplement their income before going home.<p>&gt; They don&#x27;t need health insurance because they got it through their first job or their spouse, and imposing that cost on the second job only requires them to get paid less or have less flexibility etc. as the trade off the company has to make to justify paying the additional cost of mandatory benefits.<p>Interesting to follow your thinking and your strategies, thanks for open sourcing it. From a European perspective all this sounds absurd though. Having medicare for all and a social safety net is standard in all European countries and other Global North countries.')
