If you can charge at home, at work, at the grocery store, and at restaurants then why do you need a filling station?  If you start your day at 100% because you charge at home then you don&#x27;t need any of the other infrastructure unless you go on a road-trip.<p>The amount of charging infrastructure need is also based on both demand and use case.  A grocery store or restaurant might opt for DC fast chargers because they know customers won&#x27;t be around for more than 30 minutes, but an office park can use 3-6kw chargers because users are there for 8 hours a day.  The EVSEs are smart too so you can balance output based on demand.  Have two EVs plugged in, they both get 3kw.  Just one can pull 6kw.')
