However, a largely unrealized ~fact is that people from these professions (well, ones who hold the &quot;right&quot; ideas) are regularly portrayed by politicians and the media as flawless, omniscient, beyond reproach (which is <i>increasingly</i> being physically enforced on the internet, with a net that grows ever larger).  The downstream consequences of this likely well-intended behavior are extremely complex - sure, censorship will provide a setback to conspiracy theorists&#x27; ability to speak their ideas freely, but how much fuel does this provide to their resolve, and how many mainstream people will see what is clearly happening and dip their toes into the pool, and have their eyes opened even further when they discover the <i>vast</i> amount of <i>actually truthful</i> information that doesn&#x27;t make it into the &quot;trustworthy mainstream news&quot; (even further reinforcing the idea in their mind that the public is lied to, and illustrating that this is done <i>regularly</i>)?<p>A meme war approach to governance seems like not the best approach for the sole (for now) superpower on the planet, and they have a very delicate balancing act to truth-proof the internet without the mainstream masses noticing and starting to ask questions.<p>We&#x27;ve been warned about this behavior many times throughout history by people wiser than ourselves, perhaps as a species it might be an opportune time to pause for a moment and consider where the path we are currently heading down at stop speed eventually leads.<p>&quot;A liar should have a good memory.&quot; - Quintilian<p>&quot;If you tell the truth, you donâ€™t have to remember anything.&quot; - Mark Twain<p>&quot;The least initial deviation from the truth is multiplied later thousandfold.&quot; - Aristotle')
