But it&#x27;s true that walking with a child (or a dog) generally makes people more open to conversation, so YMMV.<p>I don&#x27;t feel like I have a large tight-knit friend group, but the neighborhood feels plenty like a &quot;community&quot; to me, even though a substantial proportion of the people around are likely to only stay for a few yars. Maybe you have a different idea of what a community is.<p>Obviously the pandemic has radically changed everything; few people spend lots of time chatting with neighbors in close proximity anymore. There are also a lot of small businesses which have turned over or are likely to in the next year or two, based substantially on the lack of Federal financial support during this pandemic. We&#x27;ll see how the neighborhood looks once things have settled down in a few years.')
