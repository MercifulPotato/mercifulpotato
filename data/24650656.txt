I probably could write some code to do it myself, but it&#x27;s much faster so for things that aren&#x27;t super important to me, I might not do them at all if I didn&#x27;t have IFTTT. Now that they allow multiple triggers and filter code, it does most of what I want without having to run anything myself.')
