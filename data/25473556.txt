App-based is not necessarily a good thing (apps can leak data too).\nBest approach would be: disconnect LAN -&gt; boot you computer from a live-CD -&gt; don&#x27;t connect the computer to the internet -&gt; get the browser or app based generator via usb-stick -&gt; generate the paper wallet and print it -&gt; shut down the computer, don&#x27;t save anything.\nHere you go, not even this is safe if the app generate predictable addresses (this already happend by accident).\nMaybe put 0,0001btc on the wallet and wait a few weeks and look if they vanish?  \nI think at some point you have to read and inform yourself. Maybe you find someone you can trust.\nA 15 second internet search and a quick printout of a paperwallet is not the best way to deal with your money.')
