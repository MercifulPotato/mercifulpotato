Things were far clearer prior to this year -- I can no longer really see the point of the project and I&#x27;m just a bit sad about how it&#x27;s all evolved. I&#x27;ve been following it since just before FB came in with ReasonML. I&#x27;d just started playing around with OCaml, found Bucklescript (which I still think is a marvel). Reason seemed like a way [albeit via <i>that</i> syntax] to get some traction for a very good language that imo seriously lacks in community, libraries and documentation. It felt slightly like Elixir, filling in a few holes in the underlying language and adding a layer of consistency. And it seeed a very good alternative to TS. But instead of coalescing into something, it seems to have just fragmented things further<p>I hope something good does coalesce, but it&#x27;s currently very confusing. Maybe just me but the opportunity feels like it&#x27;s slipping away. As say, been following things very closely so I fully appreciate some the issues &amp; understand some hidden things are based on internal needs of that part of FB')
