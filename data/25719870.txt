It’s disingenuous , because “First amendment” is so essential to American culture, that it means both the literal First Amendment to the constitution AND more importantly, the American principle of free expression.<p>Ether you are aware that people are appealing to free expression as a principle, or you are unaware that free expression is more American than apple pie.  That’s why I say this retort is disingenuous.<p>So the legal scope of the literal first amendment doesn’t help the discussion on what people and companies should be doing.<p>The discussion is about American values and if people, companies and the government should be living up to them. And that’s what people are trying to debate when they say “first amendment”.')
