Then once they feel basic competence, they can continue to improve very rapidly, while having a better and better time.<p>Just before the pandemic we had gathered 4 3-year-olds together. Kid A was embarrassed at being a beginner riding a balance bike and refused to even try because kid B was already skilled at it (kid A is now also a pro 1 year later), neither of kids A and B wanted to try going across the monkey bars while kid C had no problem (because his dad had been encouraging him with candy placed further and further away along the monkey bars for a few months), kid C who didn&#x27;t do much daily running compared to the others felt bad that he was much slower at running.<p>And the same can be seen for drawing, throwing a ball, reading, playing a musical instrument, speaking a second language, solving simple logic puzzles, building with construction toys ....<p>At this level, none of these differences are primarily due to &quot;innate talent&quot;. There are multiple orders of magnitude difference in skill to gain in a very short time, with fast returns to small amount of spaced practice.')
