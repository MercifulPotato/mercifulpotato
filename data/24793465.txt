It&#x27;s easy to demand freedoms when others have them and you are fighting to gain them. Once that freedom or power has been achieved, some simply turn out to have not been concerned about gaining it for everyone but just for themselves and their group. Talk of fairness wasn&#x27;t genuine, it was a means to a end for them to gain what they wanted with no concern for everyone else.<p>The real folly in all of this is the assumption that these tools will always be in their hands and will never end up turned against them. History shows that this is almost always a poor assumption and that the reversal of power often happens both sooner and faster than ever imagined.')
