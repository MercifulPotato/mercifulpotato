Just make sure you find a good Team.<p>And yes all those things they do it for 2 reasons: 1. keeping employees 2. getting new employees. Being a little bit of edgy might just be cheaper than paying head hunters and if you can take unlimited good people but you just don&#x27;t get them, every person going through your door because of all this hipness, is one person more earning money for you.')
