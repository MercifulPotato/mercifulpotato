Item(by='rstuart4133', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611225942, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25855662, text='&gt; Why does anyone really care about non-free firmware blobs?<p>I&#x27;ll have a stab at this.<p>I suspect it&#x27;s an argument about simplicity.  Debian has drawn a very simple and clear line in the sand: everything in its main archive is truly open source.  Simple lines are easy to reason about, easy to defend and easy to explain.  Bright simple lines are a wonderful defence against slippery slopes and weaselly pragmatic arguments for weakening them.  They should not be given up likely.<p>It didn&#x27;t help that the original posts in this Debian discussion boiled down to making all non-free software easily available on install media.  In other words initially, it wasn&#x27;t just non-free firmware blobs, it was all non-free software being allowed to cross that line in the sand.   Doing that would almost be an admission Debian&#x27;s core moral compass wasn&#x27;t workable in the real world.<p>That would be dismal if it was true (for me at least).  Happily it&#x27;s not true, as it turns out it&#x27;s only the binary firmware blobs that are indispensable for the install.  It took a while for that to be uncovered and acknowledged in the thread.<p>Once that was recognised the point you make here, that firmware blobs are a special case, was made even more strongly in the Debian thread and repeated in the LWN article.  Extending the point you make here, I reckon Debian could draw a pretty bright line around firmware blobs that kept them firmly separated from other non-free software.  If most DD&#x27;s were convinced that line will hold, I&#x27;d say there is a reasonable chance they&#x27;d allow such blobs alongside the true open source software on their install media.<p>But that is a long road to hoe.  It would involve expanding the current 3 categories of software, &quot;free, contrib and non-free&quot; to four - perhaps with the addition of &quot;foreign&quot;.  The political battles it would involve aside, they are hardwired into god knows how many places.  non-free firmware blobs creating that amount of work is itself a good reason to care about them.')
