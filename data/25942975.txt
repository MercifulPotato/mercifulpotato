I&#x27;ve been on way too many projects where ORM-using code would pull some stuff from the database, do some application logic to filter or process the results, then loop and do another query for each result. Instead of doing it in the database query itself using joins (and possibly being able to use indexes for the filtering).<p>Even when people are very disciplined about this, I find that once you get to non-trivial queries, they become a lot harder to read in ORM code. I tend to have to think in terms of SQL, then translate between that and the ORM code on the fly. Its not so easy.<p>Sure, you could say all the teams I&#x27;ve ever worked on that did stuff like this are just bad at using ORM&#x27;s, but after a few experiences like this on different teams, in different companies, with different developers, its time to stop blaming the people and maybe take another look at the tools.')
