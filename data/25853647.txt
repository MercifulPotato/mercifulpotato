And no platform has an absolute legal right to be hosted by an infra provider.  Both the platform and the provider are private sector actors with almost unlimited control&#x2F;freedom over what they choose to allow on their property.<p>You&#x27;re on firmer ground if you argue a moral (rather than legal) right to these things.
