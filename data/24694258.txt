I used to worked at a company with 35000 employees. Their payroll reports were generated using a MS Access database and reported using Excel. It was a massive manual job every week as they&#x27;d weekly, fortnightly and monthly payroll cycles! It&#x27;s very easy to lose files and&#x2F;or make an error in the calculations.
