I haven&#x27;t re-installed them in the 4-years we&#x27;ve been at our new home simply because the &quot;failure rate&quot; was so frustrating to me.<p>I don&#x27;t mean hardware failure, I mean &quot;intermittent, rare command failure&quot; -- I&#x27;ve never experienced quite the same level of annoyance&#x2F;rage from anything else, versus hitting a switch and having it either <i>not</i> turn on&#x2F;off or having it be delayed by 1-second.<p>Granted, that was relatively rare, but having a wall switch <i>not work</i> even just 2-in-100 is enough to give me serious pause.  I did love &amp; do miss the ability to turn all lights off from a bedside switch, to run scenes, etc. -- but I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s worth the trade-off.')
