Even the UI to these things still feel clumsy and outdated, made by &#x27;book&#x27; people.<p>The UK gov. uses BBC as a Foreign Policy tool of sorts, I&#x27;m surprised they haven&#x27;t done a similar with with their encyclopedia companies. Socializing them and having some kind of quasi-public editing by &#x27;sanctioned&#x27; individuals (i.e. professionals in a field) may yield something usable on the relatively cheap.')
