Since then, having started an immunosuppressive for something else and it seemed to help with the pain- now the doctors think it is psoriatic arthritis.<p>I am in constant, mild pain. Some days it is nearly, but not quite debilitating. Some people think I am making it up, exaggerating, or that it is all in my head.<p>There is no certain test for either condition- in particular, fibromyalgia is basically a bucket you get tossed into if nothing else makes sense.<p>I am definitely sympathetic to people with chronic pain, because i know first-hand the extent to which it changes your personality, stress and anxiety tolerance, cognitive ability and focus.<p>You are not alone. It sucks, big time, but you are not alone.')
