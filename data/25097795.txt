But in my case, Iâ€™ve never owned and now avoid AKC purebreds like the plague. Currently I have a long-coat non-AKC GS with 25% Malamute mix. AKC and their sire syndrome has destroyed the breed with Hip dysplasia and other issues. Their obsession with artificial looks and willful ignorance of genetics has completely turned me off.<p>Also can&#x27;t compare a 50lbs dog to 80-100 lbs GSD. Smaller breeds on average live longer. We had a 10 lbs coton de teuer live to 20 which is not that uncommon for the breed.')
