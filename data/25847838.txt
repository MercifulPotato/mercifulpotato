So most of them are now only worth their scrap value, which isn&#x27;t trivial but from which you also need to subtract scrapping cost.  It&#x27;s not surprising to me that a $300M piece of machinery has &lt;$10M of metal scrap value, and you loose half in the scrapping process.  Your $30,000 dollar car is only worth about $200 as scrap.')
