The hard part about distributed systems is performance in our crappy real world environment with unreliable poorly performing and faulty public internet, unreliable hardware, OSes, etc. Which is directly at odds with needing TLA+, because if you do need it, it means the complexity of the algorithms is so great, that you won&#x27;t be able to keep them in your head and understand every aspect of their performance to make something work well. It&#x27;s similar how people think they can just peek a random consensus algorithm they&#x27;ve heard is correct and easy and make a decently working distributed storage, which is silly of course, it&#x27;s only good for educational purposes.<p>EDIT: (Ah, I see you are a TLA+ promoter, that&#x27;s why you made a comment like that)')
