These days, the news is on Twitter, and that is the real problem.<p>Actually, the problem isn&#x27;t Twitter per se, is that we&#x27;ve found out it&#x27;s easier to digest (and regurgigate, and fabricate upon) 140 characters at a time. Twitter has inadvertently found an incredible exploit and vulnerability of the human mind, and now it&#x27;s out there and we&#x27;re fucked, excuse the French.<p>Even if Twitter were to die tomorrow, my conjecture is that most of the news and media will move to some other form of short-and-easy-and-dumb social network. 140 characters is what the TV was to the radio.')
