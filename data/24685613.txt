You&#x27;d need to convince Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault to build obsolete engines and put down a big bag of money.<p>And besides, you won&#x27;t be able to fit a big V8 engine under the bodywork of a current-gen F1 car with the narrow coke bottle shape at the rear.<p>The engines are also pretty damn impressive, running at 50%+ thermal efficiency. Ye olde pushrod V8 would run out of fuel at half race distance with current fuel regulations.')
