It&#x27;s a business&#x2F;people problem. You won&#x27;t have consistent UIs as long as software vendors consider look&amp;feel as something to exploit for branding or competitive advantage. Since user feedback is rarely sought and routinely ignored in computing, you&#x27;d need the OS vendor to either disallow UIs not conforming to system theme, or make them impossible (by taking away the API for per-pixel drawing). Neither of those options is likely to happen.')
