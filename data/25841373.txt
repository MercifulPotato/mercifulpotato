The high speed Intel chips see an advantage when there&#x27;s a single CPU bound process maxing out a core. Office and Slack don&#x27;t tend to do that (well maybe Slack...). Also if you&#x27;ve got multiple processes running full tilt Intel&#x27;s clock speed advantage goes away because the chip clocks down so as to not melt.<p>So with a heavy desktop workload with multiple processes or threads the Intel chips aren&#x27;t doing any better than AMD. It&#x27;s only in the single heavy worker process situation where Intel&#x27;s got the advantage and that advantage is only tens of percentage points better than AMD.<p>So Intel&#x27;s maximum clock speed isn&#x27;t the huge advantage it might seem.')
