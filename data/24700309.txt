These collectively made up &quot;PEG access&quot;, and may have been a single organization or multiple depending on the municipality.  Cable companies tended to view these as pure cost centers, and have tried to get rid of them through legislation.<p>Source: I used to work at a public access station.  These were hit hard by the internet, when YouTube made it easy to put whatever video you wanted online, which was much more difficult to do with any sort of quality before the early 2000&#x27;s.  The public access channels that have survived&#x2F;thrived embraced teaching the public videography, lighting, sound, editing, etc.')
