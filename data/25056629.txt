And as far as natural gas usage patterns, I believe most natural gas is used for heat and hot water, with the amount used for cooking being relatively small.<p>About 51% of California electricity consumption is from hydro, nuclear, and renewable sources (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.ca.gov&#x2F;data-reports&#x2F;energy-almanac&#x2F;california-electricity-data&#x2F;2019-total-system-electric-generation&#x2F;2018" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.ca.gov&#x2F;data-reports&#x2F;energy-almanac&#x2F;califo...</a>). On top of that, many new electric heating systems would probably use heat pumps, which bring in 2-4 times as much heat into the house relative the the amount of electric energy consumed. In combination, that means that even accounting for transmission and generation losses, using electric instead of gas heat in new construction should result in significant savings in carbon emissions.')
