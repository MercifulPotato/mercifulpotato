I don&#x27;t know?<p>But I do know that the Charleston church shooter sat down with a bunch of little old ladies for the duration of a bible study engaging in, what I can only assume was, a calm in-person discussion. Then he blew their heads off.<p>Point is that, for some reason, the internet has a much stronger hold over people than do in person connections. People deeply believe they are more connected to people in their virtual spaces than they are to their neighbors or even physical friends. That sense of connection is real to those people. To some of those people, it&#x27;s real enough to kill for.')
