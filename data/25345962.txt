What you can do in an interactive WYSISYG editor like a word processor and what you can do with batch typesetting program are two different things.<p>When you edit in a word processor, you have different expectations about the interaction speed, and the locality of changes. A typesetting program can spend two seconds optimizing word spacing when you &quot;render&quot; the document. Word can&#x27;t. It could spend those 2 seconds when you hit print - but then it&#x27;s no longer WYSIWYG! It could also apply &quot;TeX-like&quot; typesetting changes (jumbling the spacing around in the whole document on every keystroke) but that <i>also</i> breaks the user&#x27;s expectation.')
