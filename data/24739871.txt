Apple has more yearly profits than the GDP of Belarus. Why does Apple play by the rules of Belarus. Honestly, if I had the power and influence of Apple I&#x27;d run my business in these third world sections of the world just like I run them in America. Arguably Apple has more weight on people in these regions than local governments do.<p>Stand up and do what&#x27;s right.
