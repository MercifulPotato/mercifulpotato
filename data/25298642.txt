Item(by='wizeman', descendants=None, kids=[25298814], score=None, time=1607053502, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298491, text='I think you would agree that the intrinsic value of dollars as backed by the metal in USD coins is negligible compared to how many USD exist, because nobody has them in substantial amounts (due to being impractical). The value of the paper that the dollars are printed on is also negligible compared to the value of the bills themselves, let alone all the USD that exist (as you probably know, the vast majority of which don&#x27;t actually exist as bills or coins).<p>Besides, everything you said, including tax payment and keeping out of jail, also applies to the Venezuelan bolivar and quite a few other fiat currencies that completely crashed in value due to hyper-inflation.<p>So I don&#x27;t think those are good arguments for the USD being valuable or having substantial intrinsic value.')
