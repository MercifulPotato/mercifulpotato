The reason I only suspected a 5-10% increase though is even if it’s able to achieve a massive increase in compression ratio (compressing 3GB to 1GB instead of 2GB, say), that’s still only saving 1GB total. Which I guess isn’t nothing and is more than 10% on an 8GB machine.<p>[0]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LZFSE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LZFSE</a>')
