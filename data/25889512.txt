You get a plain baguette and a ham-on-baguette sandwich. When you return, you remove two identically wrapped items of similar size and weight from the grocery bag. I point to one of them and ask &quot;what&#x27;s that?&quot;. You, thinking that it&#x27;s the plain baguette, answer &quot;it&#x27;s the bread&quot;.<p>When I discover that it&#x27;s a ham sandwich, I could be gracious and say that you made an error of omission. After all, it does have bread. And despite believing it to be just bread, you technically didn&#x27;t say it wasn&#x27;t also the meat.<p>Or I could be ungracious and belabor how wrong I think you were.')
