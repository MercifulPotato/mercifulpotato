What is most important for road safety, IMO is <i>predictability</i>. Everyone sharing a common expectation of what will happen next. The crazy-chaotic driving in a lot of countries actually has a lot of patterns which emerge at the level that you experience from the driving seat. And a lot of accidents, sure, but fewer than someone used to highly regulated driving would expect.<p>And fewer than they would probably cause themselves if transplanted directly in to the other system because of their mismatched expectations!')
