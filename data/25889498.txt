There&#x27;s quite a lot of literature on it; even my basic macro textbook in university noted a correlation between government debt above a certain level and reduced GDP growth.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercatus.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;government-spending&#x2F;debt-and-growth-decade-studies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mercatus.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;government-spending&#x2F;de...</a> describes it: &quot;A large majority of studies on the debt-growth relationship find a threshold somewhere between 75 and 100 percent of GDP. More importantly, every study except two finds a negative relationship between high levels of government debt and economic growth. This is true even for studies that find no common threshold. The empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports the view that a large amount of government debt has a negative impact on economic growth potential, and in many cases that impact gets more pronounced as debt increases.&quot;')
