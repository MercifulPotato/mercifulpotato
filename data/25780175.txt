Where is the data to back up those claims? Does &quot;concentrated&quot; mean 20% or 90%? Which economists said that and why did they say it? How many job cuts did the leasure and hospitality sector see? Without any summarized data to back up the claims, they amount to little more than unsourced opinions. I am asking for the opposite of a headline. I want a well source, data backed economic analysis for people who are interested in the deals but who are not economists, updated weekly or monthly in a consistent format.')
