When you look at official datasets, you find ways to screw up you never thought were possible<p>People in USA still complain about the botched TIGER import [1].<p>It may sound flippant, but I&#x27;d rather not have such end-to-end tutorial geared towards imports be made. It&#x27;d lower the barrier too much. People who self-taught GIS (it&#x27;s possible) can be trusted to be <i>marginally</i> more responsible (not fully, though).<p>[1] TL;DR the OSM road networks in USA was initially imported from TIGER dataset. However the importing mappers didn&#x27;t know TIGER was being updated, state by state. Hence, the quality of imported data is not great in many places.')
