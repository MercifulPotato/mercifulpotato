If it&#x27;s re-mapped into anything else than 0 then you&#x27;ll potentially end up with an infinite sequence of digits, i.e. not an integer. And of course it has to be re-mapped into something else than itself. This would fail on the following list:<p><pre><code>   1: 1\n   2: 2\n   3: 3\n   4: 4\n   5: 5\n   ...\n</code></pre>\nIn other words - after getting the re-mapped diagonal you end up with an object that&#x27;s potentially no longer an integer - it can be infinitely long.')
