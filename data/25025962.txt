Imagine a well-produced show with deep participant profiles - a cross between a reality TV show and a binge-watchable Netflix&#x2F;HBO series.<p>It would humanize the participants first, then after viewers care about them, their lives, and their families, the actors would gradually explain their backgrounds and opinions - some of which a viewer will disagree with. This uses TV to scale up the &quot;Contact hypothesis&quot;[2]: viewers would &quot;meet&quot; and hear from people they may not interact with regularly. Just like all TV, the producers would have an agenda. (Sarah Silverman&#x27;s &quot;I Love You, America&quot;[3] is the closest I&#x27;ve seen to this, and it&#x27;s not all that close.)<p>I&#x27;m only giving this as an example. What approaches do you think would be worth testing?<p>Assume you have decades plus unlimited philanthropic and&#x2F;or public funds. For the sake of argument, imagine Mark Zuckerberg decided that a divided America is bad for Facebook&#x27;s valuation and seeded this project with a $1 billion donation. It took over 20 years to get here and it&#x27;ll take decades to undo it.<p>[1]: Braver Angels: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;braverangels.org&#x2F;what-we-do&#x2F;red-blue-workshops&#x2F;<p>[2]: Contact hypothesis AKA intergroup contact theory: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Contact_hypothesis<p>[3]: I Love You, America: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xmQpf-B94mc<p>(This question came out of a thread comment yesterday: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25021438)')
