It has fostered some good discussion on HN on a very difficult topic that usually goes poorly, so you must have done something right.<p>I hope you get well soon, even if it takes some kind of miracle (in the sense of &quot;wondrous happening,&quot; not necessarily in the sense of &quot;intervention from god&quot; if that second thing isn&#x27;t your cup of tea). Sometimes people do get medical&#x2F;health miracles.<p>All my best,<p>Some Random Internet Stranger named <i>Doreen</i>.')
