Or whether cars have to support thousands of third party engineers adding arbitrary add-on components. Or whether automakers worry about hardening their security against nation state actors.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but do you honestly believe that automobiles are more complex from an engineering standpoint than microelectronics? How could you possibly explain why the microchip was invented 100 years after the automobile?<p>Every domain has its own engineering challenges. Apples has consistently shown execution excellence across a wide range of disparate areas though. And more importantly an ability to quickly and effectively spin up expertise in new areas. From silicon to machine learning to acoustics to compilers to optics. Read this HBS case study[1] to be amazed at its ability to leverage cross-functional expertise across disparate domains. No large org in the world operates like it. There&#x27;s a reason AAPL has a 50 times the market cap as GM. There&#x27;s zero doubt in my mind that if Apple pursues autos, within a decade they&#x27;ll acquire 5%+ global marketshare.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;how-apple-is-organized-for-innovation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;how-apple-is-organized-for-innovatio...</a>')
