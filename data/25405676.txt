In particular OSv can run many managed language runtimes including JVM, Python 2 and 3, Node.JS, Ruby, Erlang, and applications built on top of those runtimes. It can also run applications written in languages compiling directly to native machine code like C, C++, Golang and Rust as well as native images produced by GraalVM and WebAssembly&#x2F;Wasmer.<p>OSv can boot as fast as ~5 ms on Firecracker using as low as 15 MB of memory.<p>OSv can run on many hypervisors including QEMU&#x2F;KVM, Firecracker, Xen, VMWare, VirtualBox and Hyperkit as well as open clouds like AWS EC2, GCE and OpenStack.&quot;<p>Related: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;seastar.io&#x2F;futures-promises" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;seastar.io&#x2F;futures-promises</a><p>&gt;&quot;Paradigms for parallellization<p>Solutions for coordinating work across multiple cores are many. Some are highly programmer-friendly and enable development of software that works exactly if it were running on a single core. For example the classic Unix process model is designed to keep each process in total isolation and relies on kernel code to maintain a separate virtual memory space per process. Unfortunately this increases the overhead at the OS level.<p>Software development challenges<p>[...]<p>Hardware has changed to the point where the assumptions originally made on small numbers of CPU cores are no longer valid.<p>Processes are extremely self-contained but have high overhead.<p>Threads impose additional coordination costs on both the programmer and the application infrastructure, and are notoriously difficult to debug.<p>Pure event-driven programming can result in codebases that are difficult to test and extend.&quot;')
