Realize that the process is basically to create something and then write about it to advance knowledge, thus sharing it with all. What&#x27;s left at the end of that process is to recognize those who have done a lot of positive sharing. Those who are so recognized get the best jobs, the most funding, the best students, etc. As such, if an idea slips out of your lab and into some other lab, you might not get credit, and hence, all the craziness. It&#x27;s one of those cases where it&#x27;s not a great system, but it&#x27;s also hard to figure out a better one.')
