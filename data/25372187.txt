It carries a passenger seating&#x2F;baggage module. People get themselves strapped in on the way out. At the launch site the module is hoisted and locked into the vehicle. On arrival, the module is extracted and lowered to the boat deck. People come down to the deck during the boat ride.<p>Probably their &quot;pressure suits&quot; are the same as the seats, just clamshells with room to scratch, and (often enough) barf.<p>But scheduled passenger service is 15-20 years off, if ever. They only talk about it now to make the whole enterprise seem inclusive, and not just billionaire playtime. It&#x27;s even money that civilization will collapse, first.')
