I want this to be sustainable, and you want the services you rely on to be sustainable.<p>In truth, I&#x27;m trying to determine a pricing model right now via this Show HN. I don&#x27;t intend to &quot;yank the free version&quot; from anyone. Maybe I&#x27;ll be able to find a freemium model, maybe I&#x27;ll be able to acquire sponsorships, maybe there will be a way to simply charge for it... I don&#x27;t know. But folks that start using it now will be grandfathered in, so you don&#x27;t have to worry if you don&#x27;t want to pay.<p>I don&#x27;t (and won&#x27;t) have any investors that I need to satisfy. So there&#x27;s no VC breathing down my neck, pressuring me to squeeze users.<p>I hope that&#x27;s a satisfactory answer to your question and that it allays your fears. :-)')
