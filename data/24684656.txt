The debris is named and catalogued, it’s that tangible.<p>I love seeing children go wide eyed at the mention of Ceres.  It’s like the Azores of the planets — <i>there’s another place&#x2F;planet in the middle of nowhere that no one talks about?!</i><p>The final step in this is to recognize that, out of the full spectrum of Trojans to TNOs to moons to planets, the planets really are in a class of their own in terms of long term effect on other bodies in their orbit.<p>Pluto isn’t a planet.  But that doesn’t mean we exclude it.  It means we <i>include Ceres and a whole lot more</i> whenever we talk about our local system.<p>(Or at least the inner parts of our local system that we’ve found, so far.)')
