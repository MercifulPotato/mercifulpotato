It’s not that you want to make four separate requests, it’s that you want the backend to give you more than a tiny amount of data. If you’re going to induce you the 400 results of loading on the backend, backend implementators may as well give you all the results in one go (assuming the output fits in whatever request&#x2F;response limits you have).<p>I definitely agree that just having opaque page tokens without the ability to say “I want up to 100” leads to needless pain for clients and overall system inefficiency.')
