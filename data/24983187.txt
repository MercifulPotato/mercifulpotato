When you chop up and melt a plastic bottle the resulting material is no longer suitable for making bottles for example.<p>We could figure out some plastic waste scheme that works like carbon credits, and that might lead to better outcomes. You could get credits for turning waste PET into insulation or fabric, and have to buy said credits to produce bottles. Though this is sort of off the top of my head and half baked.<p>This is kind of a side show though in my opinion the overwhelming majority of plastic in the ocean is fishing relater (e.g. abandoned nets) and shipping material that blows off of cargo vessels.<p>Better monitoring and policing of fishing in international waters could kill a lot of birds with 1 stone.')
