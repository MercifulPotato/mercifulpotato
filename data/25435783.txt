After the first page, their comment history is mostly sarcastic and demeaning remarks, so it was clear to me that they simply didn&#x27;t like what I said for personal reasons. I realize it doesn&#x27;t make a difference and perhaps you reached your conclusion independently of their remark, but I was understandably a little miffed and felt like I got played.<p>Regardless, I&#x27;ll remain conscious of what you said.')
