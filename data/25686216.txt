Electric grid is like chain in a bike. Generator producing power leads a little. Loads follow little behind. They are not exactly matched. Like bike chain is tighter to one direction and looser to other under load.<p>Mass of rotating generators provide kinetic inertia into the grid so it reacts very little to small variations in the load. But if the load becomes  too high and turbines can&#x27;t speed up, frequency of the grid slows down.')
