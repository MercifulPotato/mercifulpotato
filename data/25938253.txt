Any time you find correlation, <i>something</i> goes along with it.  Maybe A causes B.  Maybe B causes A.  Maybe A and B have a common cause C.  Each of those is interesting, even if you don&#x27;t know which is which from just the correlation.<p>Consider if the data had fallen out the other way: if there was <i>no</i> correlation between these measures of harm and cannabis use, that <i>would</i> have been evidence of a lack of harm from cannabis use.<p>So even if you can&#x27;t draw any strong conclusions from this study, it&#x27;s still an interesting data point.')
