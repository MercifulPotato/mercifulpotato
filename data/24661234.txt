Everyone who lives consumes, and could easily consume more. The economy is generally limited by the ability to produce, and is generally limited by the number of working-age people to do the producing. Unemployment can be result of production being bottlenecked by something else:<p><pre><code>  * raw materials - but Japan never had an abundance of those even when their economy looked like it would dominate the world in the 80s\n  * education - but the people the article talks about have university degrees\n  * capital - again not something Japan lacks\n</code></pre>\nSo it&#x27;s not one of those. I submit that it&#x27;s <i>organization</i> - the Japanese society and economy is extremely rigid and maintains some egregious inefficiencies in the labor market, simply because it&#x27;s always been done that way.<p>Companies would rather hire a new 22 year old graduate at full pay than give a 30 year old with an even better degree a chance at a 30% discount, not out of concerns over the 30 year old&#x27;s skills being outdated but simply because hiring new graduates is what you do. They&#x27;ll hire non-graduates only on temporary contracts when short of workers, but never in a million years consider promoting them and converting them to regular employees, no matter how good they are.')
