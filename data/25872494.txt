People don&#x27;t automatically adopt new better things.  I don&#x27;t know why though.<p>In my teens and twenties I collected ideas the way some folk collect stamps.  The simple fact of the matter is that there are amazing things out there that you&#x27;ve never heard of, and no one really seems to care.<p>(As an aside, I <i>hate</i> the question, &quot;If FOO is so great why doesn&#x27;t everyone use it?&quot;  I do not know.  That&#x27;s not my department.)<p>These days some of these things are better known and some even have Wikipedia pages and stuff ( E.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vaneless_ion_wind_generator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vaneless_ion_wind_generator</a> ) but a lot of others are still obscure (trawl through Rex Research if you want to look for weird tech.)<p>Like, there&#x27;s a mechanism that can absorb kinetic energy.  The demo has a little car on rails with a ramp at one end and a wall at the other.  They put a wineglass at the wall and they put the car on the ramp and let it go: the glass shatters.  They activate the device and repeat: car hits glass and halts, glass does not shatter.  Messed up, right?  They&#x27;re from Poland IIRC, they&#x27;ve been doing demos at trade shows.  I bet you&#x27;ve never heard of them.  (Bug me and I&#x27;ll try to dig up a link;  They&#x27;re in Rex Research.)<p>I already mentioned the &quot;Vaneless&quot; ion wind generator, an efficient solid-state device for converting wind into electric power without e.g. killing birds with spinning vanes.  Cheap, simple, easy, durable, been around for decades, and you just now heard about it, eh?  :)<p>There&#x27;s a battery that desalinizes salt water.  A nuclear reactor made of molten salt.  Balloons stronger than steel.  There&#x27;s a guy in Michigan, Wally Wallington, who figured out how to move monoliths single-handedly, <i>they walk</i> just like the old stories say!<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m getting ranty here.  To veer back on topic: yeah, it&#x27;s a bummer, you build an awesome mousetrap and even the people with lots of mice ignore it.  I wish I knew what to tell you.  Maybe paint it mauve?')
