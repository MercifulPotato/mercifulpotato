A broken clock which coincides with the current time.<p>No.  It really is.  Look at the example.<p>Nobody can convince you if you are already set up against that idea, but look at what happens when you multiply two polyomials P(z)Q(z).  You obtain a polynomial whose coefficients are the convolution of those of P and Q.  Now, a decimal number is &quot;just&quot; a polynomial evaluated on z=10.  And a vibrating string is &quot;just&quot; a polynomial evaluated at z=exp(it).  The algebra of convolutions and products is exactly the same in all three cases.')
