WSB is to stick it to the man but the other market participants?<p>The stock is shorted above 100%. If the price goes up enough, maybe the shorters will be have to exit their position and then will be the one left bagholding?<p>It really depends at which price they started the short. $8, $20 $350 $450?<p>But the puzzle is that &quot;retail&quot; is only a third of the market. a lot of the after hour kept it above 300 on Thursday and on Friday, and that is not the John Q Public doing those trades, so the big fish seem to be in agreement that it might be worth a try to go for the squeeze?')
