Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610417320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25740805, text='<i>&gt; Speech is not gasoline</i><p>It&#x27;s a metaphor. Let me extend it a bit: Speech is the drought of repeated lies about the illegitimacy of an unwelcome outcome drying out the underbrush of widespread discontent.<p>Speech gathers the tinder of a crowd committed to &quot;stop the steal&quot;.<p>Speech is the accelerant convincing those so predisposed that violence or the threat of violence is acceptable and even to be admired.<p>And speech is the match tossed offhandedly aiming the mob you primed and egged on at the target you want to intimidate (and that&#x27;s the most charitable interpretation).<p><i>&gt; you&#x27;ve placed the cause of this on algorithmic ranking as much as speech itself.</i><p>To be clear, I find algorithmic ranking to largely be the cause of mostly the &#x27;widespread discontent based on repeated lies&#x27; part, although there are clearly also various &#x27;automated radicalization&#x27; effects happening as well.<p><i>&gt; Great, let&#x27;s stop interfering with speech, it leads to bad things.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think we get to unring that particular bell (especially since such ranking efforts predate both Twitter and Facebook). Applying ranking techniques to the prioritization and selection of a subset of items from a variety of sources is one of those ideas that was inevitable because it was obvious to a sufficiently large number of people, whether the result is a live feed, an automatically arranged &#x27;front page&#x27;, a playlist, or some other format. It doesn&#x27;t even matter which specific techniques happened to be used, they were all going to be tried by a lot of folks until somebody got the results they wanted (more engagement &#x2F; time on screen). Tech companies like Twitter and Facebook are going to continue to try to mitigate the toxic side effects on public discourse, but I don&#x27;t think there is a way for them to back away from algorithmic ranking unless government regulation simply forbids it outright (which isn&#x27;t too likely). For that matter, I&#x27;m not sure how useful HN itself would be if the front page wasn&#x27;t being automatically ranked based on engagement+recency with editorial decisions being made to nuke certain types of posts&#x2F;topics for being attractive nuisances.')
