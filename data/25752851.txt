It mixes up URLs and URNs.<p>If your git repositories aren&#x27;t tagged <i>just so</i>, then go mod throws its hands up and simply invents a whacky snapshot version. Because it can&#x27;t itself properly determine &quot;earlier version&quot; from &quot;later version&quot; on that snapshot, you often wind up with multiple snapshots from the same repo, not infrequently transmitted through other dependencies.<p>This is just jolly good fun when it turns out that your dependencies are pulling in incompatible versions of things. Since the official Kubernetes policy for downstream consumers is &quot;we don&#x27;t care about downstream consumers&quot;, it happens more quickly than one would expect.<p>As much as I have hated playing whack-a-mole with Maven or Bundler, I hate even more playing whack-an-adamantium-and-invisible-with-xray-eyes-mole against go mod.')
