As someone living in the US, it’s quite obvious our system has a lot to be desired in this area, especially when comparing outcomes amongst different ethnicities or wealth classes. But there is an ideal we reach for that our rules should treat every individual equally regardless of their place in life. Giving judges and juries even more latitude than they have already would completely shatter that.<p>I’d also point out that, given historical context for such methods, anyone giving strong support to this sort of “justice” system really does need to hear the quote that didn’t really come from Einstein :) “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”')
