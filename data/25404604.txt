The rate is increasing, and there&#x27;s only one way to stop it.<p>Its still such a low number. There is no conclusive evidence that mask will reduce the death and even if wearing mask will avoid those 978 death, it still not worth it.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, reducing death is good and I will support it but not if it require forced mask&#x2F;lockdown.<p>That being said, I can support voluntary mask recommendation though.')
