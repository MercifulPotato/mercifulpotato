I would imagine it records the last known GPS location before you disconnected from Bluetooth. But it would be great if it did something smarter, like using accelerometer data to dead reckon the location. It could even try to use data from both your incoming trip to the underground parking spot and your exit from the parking spot to wherever you’re going. Probably too optimistic to think this is what’s happening through.')
