If there is legitimate data that shows that girls in peer groups are all deciding to transition together or even mostly deciding to regardless of the size of the group then I would think that would be an important topic to explore.  The desire to transition was very rare as far as I understand.<p>I feel that teenagers and young adults like to explore subjects that are known taboos.  It seems reasonable to me that for every good there is a bad so we have to decide as a society to what degree making transitioning mainstream should outweigh the number of individuals who are harmfully transitioning.')
