The light rail line goes nowhere near the majority of the city.<p>If we&#x27;re doing any sort of event downtown or ACL or whatever, I rent a condo nearby instead of dealing with taxis or busses despite only living 15 minutes from the city center and very much &quot;in Austin.&quot;<p>Nobody deals with publix transit if they can afford not to.')
