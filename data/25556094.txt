I&#x27;ve test driven a Bolt. A Bolt to a Tesla like Salieri to Mozart.<p>Where to even begin? Thin seats. Smaller car. No charging network. No self-driving. No remote software updates... It&#x27;s a long list.<p>Does GM even know how to make a car these days? TSLA has massive growth problems. I&#x27;ve had my own issues with my Tesla cars. But how could we even talk about Bolt and Tesla in the same paragraph?<p>We should be talking about BMW. My past BMW service experiences were far better than Tesla. That&#x27;s comparable to my Teslas. Who cares about GM?<p>If, one day, the Mach-E ships, and anyone buys it, and it has anything near AutoPilot then maybe we can talk about it. But right now the Mach-E is about as useful as a NKLA truck. With no charging network. Or AutoPilot. So it&#x27;s basically a bigger LEAF.')
