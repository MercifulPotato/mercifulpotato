Item(by='SifJar', descendants=None, kids=[25119571], score=None, time=1605519854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25109389, text='I think another factor that may come into play here is distinguishing between &quot;products that serve the same purpose&quot; and &quot;related products&quot; e.g. between &quot;vacuum cleaners&quot; and &quot;vacuum cleaner accessories&quot; (filters, bags, additional attachements...), the later likely being purchased in addition to the former. In this case it seems like there&#x27;s probably a clear line but could certainly get blurry in some cases. If two products have some overlapping features, but also some unique ones, how different do they have to be for people to be likely to buy both?')
