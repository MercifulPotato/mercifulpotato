And the job of lossy compression is to remove everything that you can&#x27;t hear in order to save bytes, and limiting the bandwidth to what you can hear is the most basic step.<p>Instead, DRM systems typically encode data over a wide range of frequencies (spread spectrum), well within the audible range. It is designed in such a way that you could hear it in theory, but don&#x27;t notice it because it blends with background noise. It is very robust, resisting compression, recording and even deliberate attacks. In fact, it is one of the techniques used by the military radios to resist jamming.')
