Item(by='rStar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607242717, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25321188, text='further, apple no longer get’s to portray themselves as a privacy focused company. if I don’t have control over whether or not I can turn my computer on, I have no right to privacy on an apple computer and I have no data security on an apple computer. It’s one thing if it were a feature a user could opt in or even out of, it’s another to be a consequence of sale. apple used to be a computer company, but they got used to the power they have over ios users and decided to downgrade all of their customers to that level of personal determination, freedom. but hey, at least the RIAA and various nation states that have enough sway to boss apple around will be happy with it.')
