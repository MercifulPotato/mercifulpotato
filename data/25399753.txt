It’s not any more of a problem ethically than cosmetic micro transactions. The only things that should be 18+ are loot boxes regardless if they cosmetic or result in pay to win. Both are gambling for a random chance at rewards. Inserting the ability to buy those boxes with money rather than earn them is what makes the gambling detrimental to people. Of course that assumes gambling is bad when in reality only addiction to gambling is bad. By 18 adults should be taught about addiction in schools and so loot boxes should be available by then. Credit cards used to limit how much kids could spend online because you had to be 18, but now kids can easily go into every store and by a prepaid Visa card or gift card for just about any online service for cash, including formerly at toys r us.')
