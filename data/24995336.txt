You potentially also lose your safe harbor restrictions in the process.<p>Let&#x27;s pretend for the moment that the original youtube-dl DMCA had been valid, or that you removed youtube-dl due to an innocuous mistake. If I post youtube-dl to MY account, you have NO reason to take it down until you receive another takedown request from the RIAA for my repo. You certainly have no reason to ban users. There is nothing in your ToS which this violates.<p>I work on education projects which use youtube-dl in legal, non-infringing ways. I don&#x27;t think the RIAA has a legal leg to stand on for reasons I&#x27;m not going to get to in this post.<p>Until github starts following DMCA processes properly, I CANNOT respond to the existing takedown request, since I have no standing. It&#x27;s not my repo.<p>The right course of action for me would be to:<p>(1) Consult my lawyer and figure out if this is a fight I want to pick. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;d win in court if this went all the way, but I might go bankrupt first.<p>(2) Post youtube-dl to my repo.<p>(3) Wait for a DMCA takedown notice.<p>(4) Respond to it with a counternotice, and litigate with the RIAA.<p>Because github has decided to act as an arbiter on behalf of the RIAA, rather than a neutral third party, I cannot follow this process. github short-circuits this process at #2 by threatening to remove the repo and ban my account.<p>I&#x27;m sorry that you&#x27;ve chosen to side with the RIAA against the Internet. I&#x27;m gradually moving my business to gitlab. This is approximately what people thought would happen as a result of the Microsoft purchase.')
