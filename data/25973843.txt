The agriculture industry in India is dominated by minorities, mainly Sikhs, and mainly Punjabis. The aggrieved parties here see this as an act of economic oppression, and if you want to make sense of the controversy, you have to view it in the broader context of Indian history, especially wrt everything thatâ€™s happened in the post-partition period. Tanks rolling up to the golden temple is still a very fresh memory for a lot of these protestors.')
