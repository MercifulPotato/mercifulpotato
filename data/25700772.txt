They aren&#x27;t interested in talking about this honestly.<p>Seriously, where is the legitimate debate about the events of this week?<p>Is anyone compelled by the idea that this seditious event was comparable to the women&#x27;s march?<p>I don&#x27;t know what tools we have to bring these people back. I wish I could point to something and say &quot;here&quot;, this is how we can find common ground. But they are proving every day that they are more interested in this dishonest babble than engaging in serious discussion.<p>Again, for anyone whose made it this far. The fact that they are pretending that there is no difference between the women&#x27;s march and the events this week are all you need to see to dismiss the rest of the justifications they put forth.<p>Don&#x27;t fall for the trap. They wont argue &quot;the point&quot;. They will deflect, lie and twist every issue to fit their narrative.')
