Item(by='jsperson', descendants=None, kids=[25365527], score=None, time=1607547983, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363618, text='&gt; we&#x27;ve reached &quot;peak fake news&quot; in the USA<p>Who cares?! As you said, Fox is crappy news so they don&#x27;t get my business. Same thing with (generally) MSNBC and others. To answer the next question: The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, Shepard Smith<p>&gt; it&#x27;s one of those &quot;least worst&quot; choices\nI respectfully and completely disagree. This is policing thought. Things are not worse than they have been before. The communist witch hunts of the 50s is one example. A lot of the things FDR did were marginal (turned out alright though). Once you start controlling freedom of expression, you own all expression. No one is smart enough. The free market may suck in the short run, but in the long run it will work out.<p>One perfect example of this:\n&gt; The POTUS is lying on an hourly basis\nYep, and HE LOST! His lying was a significant factor in this loss. Come January he won&#x27;t be the POTUS.')
