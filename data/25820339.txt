The derision with which it speaks about managers, like they are either evil or incompetent, is unfair in my experience.<p>(my) Managers are just people. They have a task, they do their best to get that task done. Sometimes they decisions that seem bad to me. Often that is because I misunderstand their goals. Sometimes, it is because I know something they don&#x27;t, and something they couldn&#x27;t verify if I told them. And other times, they just made a mistake, or weren&#x27;t told the relevant information by me or others.<p>Indeed, sometimes their goals are somewhat self serving. But often it just has to do with wider business goals than what I am working at. I am grateful for them keeping an eye on those. Leaving me to worry less about the biggest of pictures. That however, doesn&#x27;t mean I should just bog down on the small picture of my work, and deem everything that seems bad in that context as stupid.')
