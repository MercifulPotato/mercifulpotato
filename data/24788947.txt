The problem is Codespaces is ridiculously overpriced and Cloud9 is growing increasingly outdated compared to VS Code. No extensions, limited language support, doesn’t support Amazon Linux 2 or Graviton EC2 instances, etc.<p>Also even though they’re browser based, many features still don’t work on an iPad. Amazon really needs to put more effort into this space or Microsoft will wildly outcompete them. I still use Cloud9 quite heavily but as soon as Codespaces allows for scrolling with a mouse wheel on an iPad, it’s going to be hard to keep me on AWS.')
