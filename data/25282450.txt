As a silly example, an IT Union could mandate that we all use tabs for indentation. In general the idea of unionising is appealing, but I don&#x27;t want to end up in such a degenerate situation. I want an organisation that will protect my rights as a human being while on the job, while also giving me some amount of power to steer the corporation that profits from my labour. It would be nice if this could be done as one generic overarching union that all workers are a part of and that guarantees basic rights for everyone, which could perhaps then be further refined by profession if strictly needed. My thought is that a generic union will not have a desire to meddle in the actual work process, but keep their activity on the political level.')
