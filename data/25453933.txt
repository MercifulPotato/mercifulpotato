Nor will you be featured in certain content carousels on Google search. This can amount to shutting off 30% or more of your traffic.<p>If Google wanted to make the web faster, they could have just tweaked the search algorithm to more heavily favor faster sites. Problem solved.<p>Google can only force the adoption of AMP because of their monopoly power. They claim it is an “open source” project but this is questionable. 90%+ of commits are Google employees. It’s not like “the community” designed it or has any power to change it.<p>I always cite AMP as the most cut and dry piece of evidence that Google is a harmful monopoly. I continue to be astonished that higher ups at Google ever greenlit the idea in the first place.<p>I love Google and what they’ve done for the internet, but it’s clear they need to be reigned in.')
