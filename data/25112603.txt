Just thought I&#x27;d share my experience with you:<p>Couple days of the cold, followed by a fever and increasing difficulty breathing for 3 days. Just getting up from the couch felt like having just run a marathon and having to &#x27;make&#x27; my body breathe. Actually having to force the air into my lungs. To the point where I called the hospital and was told there wasn&#x27;t anything they could do ATM.<p>Then, one moment I will never forget. I went to sleep with the biggest worries I&#x27;ve ever had about how the next day would look. If there was even a next day. I woke up at 3:00 AM. And I could just breathe normally. All symptoms were just gone. No fever, nothing. The biggest relieve of my life.<p>Followed by 3 months of weird pains and discomforts. One of which was a stabbing pain that would travel from my lungs down to my side during the course of 4 days. Something that my SO also experienced.<p>Also, most of the issues I experienced in the months after the whole ordeal where psychological in nature. I could make myself short of breath by just thinking about it and I would have to go lie down. I also experienced chest pains 4 months after. All of that went away when I started to breath differently. I had been taking very short breath right from my upper chest area. This was actually causing me pain. I learned to breath by expanding my abdomen and after forcefully breathing very slowly like that for 2 days, everything went back to normal. So there&#x27;s a big tip for anybody reading this. I think it&#x27;s called diaphragmatic breathing, Google it.<p>Anyway, good luck to you and anybody else that needs it! When all of this is over and we&#x27;re back at the bars, first round is on me! &lt;3')
