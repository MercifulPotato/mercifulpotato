I have experienced unusual body temperature fluctuations and really unusual heart quirks on a weekend some months ago. My boss got tested (out of curiosity) positive for the antibodies. The numbers are huge and I meet a huge lot of people every day (nobody I&#x27;ve met in person reported any symptoms though). It seems logical to me all of us (people I know) have already had light&#x2F;asymptomatic covid. I never meet old or fat people, I miss some but prefer not to risk.')
