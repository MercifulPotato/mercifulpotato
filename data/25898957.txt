Is that what you meant? Though we&#x27;d obviously still need vaccinations as much of the world will not have herd immunity for a long time, if ever.<p>And certainly the percentage needed will differ whether we assume social distancing and travel restrictions are continued or not. Personally I hope we keep a lot of it, at least a long while more. I really hate catching flu&#x27;s and colds.')
