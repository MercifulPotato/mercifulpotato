Not only is the internet a centralising technology but virtually <i>all</i> technology is centralising. Ted Kaczynski was a little bit crazy but not wrong, technology with its facilitation of scale, interdependence, relationships across space and time and creation of division of labour and complexity creates hierarchies and the need for organisation. The places on earth that are distinctly free of centralisation are places that are in the literal sense of the word primitive.<p>However unlike Ted and like the author I don&#x27;t think this is a negative thing. I never understood the sentiment by Barlow mentioned in the article, I just thought it&#x27;s juvenile. Most people when faced with the decision of living in the frontier town with a gunfight next to your house or suburb where the garbage truck comes every morning chose the latter and I don&#x27;t blame them')
