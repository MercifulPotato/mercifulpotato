Consolidation of remote collab tools, more WFH days from old school companies:<p>I work in management consulting for a big four. So far I&#x27;ve seen all clients adopted MS Teams super quickly in a very standardized way during the year. They were all already with the typical Jira suite, CI&#x2F;CD tools and such for development work, but non-developers are all about Teams&#x2F;Outlook, no other collab tools. Never liked Slack anyways, so good. MS has gotten quick to adapt and copy features from other startups, then make an enterprise-friendly version of it that still looks like a new toy, so no FOMO anymore. Long gone are the days of the Outlook suite lagging in features compared to anything consumers were using. So far I only see Google competing well in this space, thanks to the cheap per-seat price and superior solution for some case scenarios.<p>2. High profile cybersecurity fiascos:<p>I&#x27;ve seen a huge growth in demand for these kind of professionals in the consulting space, and even with all big push, because of bureaucracy and the usual mediocrity regarding data handling, high profile incidents will continue for years to come. I for one, still prefer doctors that keep pen and paper files.<p>3. Active Noise cancelling now a staple:<p>I like to try chinese earphones, sometimes it&#x27;s a massive deal and some brands have really perfected a signature. I do own a pair of QC35s that I use daily, but I&#x27;m more interested in what can be achieved for less and each year I&#x27;m more surprised. Now you can get in-ears with good sound, battery and ANC for about 50 bucks. I can see these being adopted as the standard or at least a trend during 2021 even in emerging markets.<p>4. Return to value stocks:<p>As more people get the vaccine and everything returns to normal, currently bargain value stocks will get a new push while tech may remain a bit flat after the bull run this year. With Biden elected, a lower dollar, China getting back to previous manufacture numbers, I&#x27;m expecting metals like copper and lithium to keep going up.<p>5. Intel:<p>If Microsoft realizes good savings in the cloud space using ARM, and Amazon&#x2F;Google jump the gun too, Intel is so screwed.')
