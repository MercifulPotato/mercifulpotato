The early games had creepy vibes at many different parts of the game. If you disagree to each his own.<p>&gt; you&#x27;re an unkillable demigod that&#x27;s basically dunking on armies of demons<p>&gt; That is the 100% the core idea of Doom lore.<p>&gt; But Doom 2016 is quite literally a modernised version of Doom 1.<p>Not really, here&#x27;s the final paragraphs to the introduction to Doom 1 from the original manual:<p>&gt; Things aren&#x27;t looking too good. You&#x27;ll never navigate off the planet on your own. Plus, all the heavy weapons have been taken by the assault team leaving you only with a pistol. If only you could get your hands around a plasma rifle or even a shotgun you could take a few down on your way out. Whatever killed your buddies deserves a couple pellets in the forehead. Securing your helmet, you exit the landing pod. Hopefully you can find more substantial firepower somewhere within the station. As you walk through the main entrance of the base, you hear animal-like growls echoing throughout the distant corridors. They know you&#x27;re here. There&#x27;s no turning back now.<p>Yes, he&#x27;s a highly trained badass, but he&#x27;s just a Marine. He ends up killing all of the monsters if you finish the game, but the setup and the aesthetic and lore of the entire game makes it seem like an insurmountable challenge ahead of you, just a guy, fighting through hell and later on repelling the hordes of hell from earth.<p>The art team did a great job replicating doom, the composer did a great job of renewing classic Doom music and merging it with modern takes on the Doom aesthetic, although it is ridiculous that the music is intended to overpower the other sounds in the game.<p>The gameplay is where they really screwed up IMO. Its a great game but its not authentic old school Doom gameplay. You could modernize it properly, I&#x27;m just saying that in my opinion they haven&#x27;t for the reasons I explained elsewhere. They instead created a new thing that uses the Doom franchise and it just happens to be fantastic. As great as it is though I would rather have had a well executed modern take that also feels authentic.')
