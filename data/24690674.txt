The giant LCD puts out some light. There are reflections from your headlights (bouncing off what&#x27;s in front of you). There are street lights. There are other vehicle headlights. Your eyes have to see stuff for you to drive, so there must be photons hitting your face, and some of those get reflected.<p>The external cameras have excellent low light sensitivity. If the internal camera is anything like those, I think it&#x27;ll work fine at night.')
