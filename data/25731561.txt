Puts warnings on political issues, like statements that Biden&#x27;s crime bill contributed to mass incarceration</i><p>I assume that point was an extension of OP&#x27;s comment of: &quot;that they use to ensure ideological conformity in their posts.&quot;<p>For those interested, here is a link to the USA Today article from the screenshot evaluating whether &quot;the crime bill brought mass incarceration to Black Americans&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;factcheck&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;03&#x2F;fact-check-1994-crime-bill-didnt-bring-mass-incarceration-black-people&#x2F;3250210001&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;factcheck&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;03&#x2F;fac...</a><p>&gt; <i>Stephen Ross Johnson, of Knoxville, Tennessee, a board member of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and past president of the Tennessee Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, told USA TODAY that it is &quot;over simplistic&quot; to say the 1994 crime bill led to mass incarceration.</i><p>&gt; <i>Asked if the bill caused or largely contributed to it, Johnson says: “The bottom line answer to that is no. Was it a link in the chain? Yes. Is it the beginning of the chain? No.”</i><p>&gt; <i>Johnson argues that the roots of mass incarceration can be found in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with legislation that created, among other things, the RICO statute, which broadened the scope of federal law as the war on drugs began to take shape.</i><p>I&#x27;d say I agree with the points in the article over the non-contextual, anonyomous, blanket statement that the crime bill brought (&quot;caused&quot;) mass incarceration of Black Americans.')
