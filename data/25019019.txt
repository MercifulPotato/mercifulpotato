Like Sun Tzu teaches:<p>&quot;If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.&quot;<p>Sadly, humans seem allergic to this kind of thinking. As Orwell writes in &quot;Notes on Nationalism&quot;:<p>&quot;The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest, and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him. Nationalism is power hunger tempered by self-deception. Every nationalist is capable of the most flagrant dishonesty, but he is also – since he is conscious of serving something bigger than himself – unshakeably certain of being in the right.&quot;<p>The smart (if mistaken) reasons to vote Trump were always trade and the Democratic Party&#x27;s abandonment of Labor.<p>And Republicans, on the other hand, who think Biden is a socialist are delusional.<p>It&#x27;s possible, though, that people aren&#x27;t as dumb as they seem. For an individual, pretending not to empathize with the opposition is probably safer in a tribalized society. So perhaps that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re really witnessing.')
