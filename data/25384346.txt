You barely have multiple windows. You can&#x27;t really plug peripherals in. RAM is really limited. Etc.<p>_______________________________________<p>Also, HA HA. I&#x27;ve checked and I was right. As far as I can see the cheapest one is $329, BUT with 32GB of storage, which is absolutely ridiculous in 2020. 128GB costs $449, and even that&#x27;s barely enough storage. The keyboard is $159 (!). So the minimum usable laptop replacement from them costs $610, and I&#x27;m probably missing some accesories you need and which probably increase the price even further.<p>Let alone the fact that for the rest of the world Apple products are 10-20-30% more expensive. So this combo probably costs â‚¬700 ($800+) in Europe.<p>Bait and switch.')
