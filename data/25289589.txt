After all you can get all the flagship MS Office apps on the Mac in very good iterations, plenty of Windows first vendors do support the Mac with version of their software, there are virtualisation and emulation solutions, and a lot of Linux software compiles and runs fine on the Mac as it&#x27;s also a flavour of Unix.<p>In contrast, if you take the vast majority of MacOS first apps, there is no way you are ever running the vast majority of that stuff on other platforms. A wide variety of games even run on MacOS either natively or through compatibility layers like Porting Kit. In this respect out of Windows, Linux&#x2F;Unix and MacOS, I think it&#x27;s clear that MacOS wins hands down. It&#x27;s not even close.<p>So given that this is pretty obvious, and I have a hard time believing you aren&#x27;t perfectly well aware of this, why on earth are you trying to make this argument. Is running other platform&#x27;s software really a primary criterion for you? In which case, the Mac should be right up your street.')
