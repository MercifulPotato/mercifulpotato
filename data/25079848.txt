Whether it is an android device, an iPhone, a Dell laptop or a new M1 macbook you are beholden to a corporation that doesn&#x27;t care about privacy. I would argue that Apple cares a bit more, and I really hope they respond to the most recent shit show with some changes, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.<p>And before &quot;have you tried this *nix distro??&quot; comments appear, they are still too hard to setup and nowhere near as user-friendly for most people on an everyday basis. And hell, if you setup Chrome and Gsuite as your default tools of choice, as many do (or are forced to because their job) how much are you really breaking free anyways?<p>I don&#x27;t know the solution, but its clear that in the war between privacy and convenience and usability that privacy is on the ropes and its the last round of the fight.')
