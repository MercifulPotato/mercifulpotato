But there are some important distinctions here — three in my observation — that give this a generational dimension.</i><p>...<p><i>&quot;The first (and this is based in data) is that younger generations are less likely to dose themselves daily with the poison of cable news, so that&#x27;s one less source of content blasting. For those who consume cable news on a regular basis, the immersion becomes nigh impossible to break.&quot;</i><p>...<p><i>&quot;And that brings me to the second generational distinction: the degree of innate understanding of the medium. I do not think my older family members understand the extent to which the content they encounter is tailored by algorithms to set their lizard brains on fire. Like the majority of their peers, as a 2019 survey showed, they probably don&#x27;t understand an algorithm is involved at all. They insist they do understand, but their behavior tells me they do not.&quot;</i><p>...<p><i>&quot;I thought my own parents would be safe from all this because — thank God — they are not on any of the big three social media sites; they don&#x27;t have cable; and their tech skills are limited. As it turns out, that&#x27;s irrelevant. The internet is so user-friendly now it can break anyone&#x27;s brain! YouTube and a few political email lists are all it takes. And now that this content history is established, my mom&#x27;s search results are tailored accordingly. The brokenness is self-reinforcing.&quot;</i><p>...<p><i>&quot;[Third:]  Our parents have generally not managed that pandemic-time connectivity to their [real life] friends — if indeed they had close friends in the first place. A common thread in my discussions of broken boomer brains is a lack of intimate friendships and hobbyist communities. In the absence of that emotional connection and healthy recreational time use, this media engagement can become a bad substitute. The memes become the hobby. The Facebook bickering supplants the relationships. And it&#x27;s all moving so fast — tweet, video, meme, Tucker, tweet, video, meme, Maddow — the change goes unnoticed. The brain breaks.</i>&quot;')
