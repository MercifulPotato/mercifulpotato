Or, if you have enough savings&#x2F;confidence to just take a year off and fuck around, why not? I might suggest riding out your current job&#x2F;role until you have the ability to travel without the concern of covid, but also recognize that might be quite a while.<p>My #1 rule is, if you&#x27;re so miserable that you&#x27;re struggling to get out of bed in the morning, quit pretty much instantly. Your wellbeing is worth more. If you&#x27;re not at that point, though, it might be worthwhile to play around with your way of thinking and finding any cognitive traps you have lying around.')
