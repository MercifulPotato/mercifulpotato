We need to bring skilled workers and we need to give them freedom to operate on their own vocation. This automatically raises wages as they will not accept lower wage jobs.<p>Patchwork slavery-mentality laws and rules just make us worse as a country, especially when the competition is millions of engineers producing amazing stuff in other countries.')
