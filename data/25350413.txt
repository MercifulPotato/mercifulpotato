They always worked. You plugged them in and they reliably made sound, everywhere, with high-quality audio. This comment is surreal.<p>And yes, I get that a lot of people do want to use wireless headphones. I&#x27;m not here to argue about that, there are legitimate reasons why people want to get rid of wires. And I also get that these headphones are filled with other features like auto-pausing, noise cancelation. There are reasons someone might look at those features and think they&#x27;re worth the price. But still -- but to see the primary reaction be that the important part is &quot;just working&quot; still feels kind of validating to all of the people who originally called out Bluetooth headphones as a step backwards from where we were.<p>I remember getting a lot of pushback from people who were all telling me that wireless headphones were going to get really cheap, and most of the growing pains were already over, and we were all just being ludites. But what am I supposed to think when I look at your high-tech future world, and the most popular comment is someone saying that they&#x27;ll drop 550 dollars on a pair of headphones before they&#x27;ve even heard them, even though they&#x27;ll only last 3-5 years before the battery dies -- just because it&#x27;s worth that much money to have a device that reliably plays sound? How am I supposed to look at that and not come to the conclusion that the wireless market is still wildly inferior to the cheap, reliable, high-quality audio devices that came before?<p>It&#x27;s been however many years since Apple&#x27;s removal of the headphone jack and practically every high-end Android manufacturer has since copied them. And what we see is headphones that are specifically designed to work with one brand of phone&#x2F;computer, that are outrageously expensive, and apparently that expense is justified to some people because the entire rest of the market is filled with options that have minor-to-major irritations during daily use.')
