You have a policy of what is acceptable content or not and apply it uniformly.<p>If one &quot;side&quot; is breaking rules about promoting violence, and the other is not, they are not being censored or repressed- they are just breaking rules and their content will be removed.<p>In the US we seem to feel its ingrained that there has to be two (and only two) binary &quot;sides&quot; in opposition to one another. This is the minority case around the world. Things get a lot thornier when you have a whole bunch of different sides that tend to be focused around a narrow view of issues.')
