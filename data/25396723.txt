Or, alternatively, why do we think we&#x27;ll get a different result by doing the same thing over again?<p>I mean, it seems to me like we already <i>have</i> scepticism in spades. There&#x27;s two sides, and if one of them said the sky was blue the other would be sure it were green.<p>It looks to me like what is needed is detached, discerning thinking, which is not the same thing. What reason do we have to think that people will start to do better about it and it will take care of itself?<p>I&#x27;m not opposed to your view, I just don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m on the same page as you and it I&#x27;d like to hear more.')
