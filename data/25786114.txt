There&#x27;s decades worth of large&#x2F;serious&#x2F;complex open source projects that have totally been monetised by other companies without the founders&#x2F;maintainers feeling ripped off and butthurt about it.<p>Linux, GNU, Apache, Perl, Python, PHP, Rails, WordPress, and many many more projects at least as important and complex as Elasticsearch. We don&#x27;t hear Linus or Stallman, or Larry or Guido or Rasmus or DHH or Mullenweg complaining about hosting companies profiting off their work.<p>I get that newer projects are structured differently, and that companies like Redis Labs and Mongo and Elastic are paying salaries to engineers to develop their software - which is _way_ different to the examples I cited above. But just because they&#x27;ve chosen that, doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re &quot;right&quot; or entitled to succeed working that way. The optimist in me hopes some of them will, and perhaps this will be a route to the world getting &quot;open source&quot; software written that the old Apache project&#x27;s model perhaps could never have achieved. I certainly don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a given though.<p>The pessimist in me feels bait-n-switched, and is wondering how to plan on staying on 7.10 safely and keeping an eye out to see who&#x27;s gonna fork it and at least keep up security work on it under Apache 2.0 moving forward. We don&#x27;t &quot;sell Elasticsearch as a service&quot;, but we use it enough that I don&#x27;t want to ask for legal budget to mitigate the risk of upgrading away from the Apache 2.0 licensed version. I don&#x27;t trust SSPL enough to want use anything licensed that way, and I doubt I&#x27;ll be very happy with Elastic License either if I spend enough time to read&#x2F;understand it properly...')
