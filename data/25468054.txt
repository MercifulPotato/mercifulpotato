Burnout to the max from the sound of it.<p>The only way I&#x27;ve managed to solve any of these qualms is to just tell my boss, more senior engineer, director, etc, &quot;No&quot;. Work is a relationship just like any other and your job will treat you exactly as you let it, and if you never say no or stick up for yourself and say I don&#x27;t like this or that, of course it&#x27;s going to grind on you.<p>Just like everything else with life, there&#x27;s going to be some bad with the good, just be sure to draw a clear line in the sand as to what you&#x27;re willing to put up with and when it gets crossed, stand your ground.')
