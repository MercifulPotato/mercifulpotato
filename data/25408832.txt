Have as your goal <i>at least</i> to produce domestically as much as possible to satisfy domestic consumption demands, as well as having some minimal threshold of employed domestic workers.<p>As it stands, US has a massive trade deficit, and a decades long decline in working age male population, especially in &quot;flyover&quot; US regions where manufacturing has declined the most while not being replaced by equivalent jobs. These regions also have declining population, rising suicide &amp; opiate death rates, declining family formation &#x2F; birthrates.<p>The &quot;telos&quot; of our society should not put as its &quot;end&quot; an economy, especially one which pursues profit above all.<p>The economy should be a <i>tool</i> in service to outcomes we actually desire.<p>Like software built to do a job, not simply designed for the production of specific features.<p>This is where global financial capitalism (as the US has a giant capital surplus which balances its trade deficit) needs to be called into question.<p><i>Internal</i> free markets is one thing. But not having a national industrial policy which prioritizes the well being of domestic workers and their families over well being of multinational corporations and banks makes our system quite degenerate over time.<p>People should really take a few minutes and watch these 2 videos explaining the current account[0] and capital account[1] relationship, and understand that how we operate now is a <i>political choice</i>, which has massive consequences on who benefits of this system accrue to, and who pays the costs of this system.<p>This system is maintained by having the reserve currency and the state using strong efforts over many years to not only maintain this GRC but strengthen it, not allowing the natural devaluation of the $ that would close these 2 imbalances and more closely balance capital and labor.<p>Also, it is not a requirement to have a well developed economy and run massive trade deficits or not have a thriving industrial sector. Germany and Japan are 2 examples that do not run giant trade deficits like the US [3]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dirBYVjDk7A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dirBYVjDk7A</a> [0]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;AimYG1jYD0A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;AimYG1jYD0A</a> [1]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.conradbastable.com&#x2F;essays&#x2F;the-germany-shock-the-largest-economy-nobody-understands" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.conradbastable.com&#x2F;essays&#x2F;the-germany-shock-the-...</a> [3]')
