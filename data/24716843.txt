It&#x27;s been improving recently as well. Circle K (the petrol station chain formerly known as Statoil) has started installing chargers near where I live, so I would assume they are rolling this out nation wide. A lot of people have individual charging stations at their homes as well. I&#x27;m not sure of the state of charging stations in the smaller towns though.')
