If you think they do, I&#x27;d rather change syntax highlighting to recognize !== and others as <i>a single token</i>.<p>It&#x27;s like multi-select in text editors. When you think about it, it&#x27;s actually an inferior form of search&amp;replace. Inferior because it interacts badly with off-screen matches. I find arguments of kakoune users unconvincing.<p>My personal opinion is - and I&#x27;m fine taking negative karma for this - that ligatures mostly appeal to the front-end developers among us. To the people who abuse the words &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;gorgeous&quot;, and admire web pages which have a single text column using up 1&#x2F;3 of screen width.')
