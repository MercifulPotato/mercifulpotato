Waymo is 10 billion in the hole. Tesla spent maybe around that much developing autopilot. This is also not public money being spent.<p>A typical public transit system costs orders of magnitude more than that. Example: California&#x27;s High Speed Rail project started at 40 billion and projections have already ballooned to 98 billion.')
