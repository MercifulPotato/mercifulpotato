Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604085244, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944520, text='&gt; If platform published their content rules and publicly demonstrated how they apply them equally I doubt we would be having any of these discussions.<p>They do (or at least the publishing part). Who decides whether or not they apply them &quot;equally&quot;? The government? Like you want the Trump administration to have decision making power over whether or not Twitter is fairly moderating content?<p>&gt; Instead we have &quot;moderation&quot; that always favors one political line of thought.<p>This is certainly a claim made. I view things differently: right-wing media and pundits have been treated with kid gloves for decades now. The shift to treating them &quot;fairly&quot; is viewed as discrimination, much the same way as certain groups on the far right have viewed every other example of &quot;objective&quot; fair treatment as discrimination, since they ultimately feel as though they&#x27;ve lost some privilege.<p>You may view things differently, but you&#x27;re clearly biased (and perhaps, so am I). So why should I trust you to make objective decisions here?')
