Indeed it even has benefits in terms of interactivity&#x2F; turn around&#x2F;accessibility.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s also a lot of problems with Excel and reasons not to use it like a database or anything which fundamentally relies on maintaining data integrity,  and it&#x27;s liable to be the first tool reached for by the non-experienced, who will generally make a mess of things large and complex as a rule.')
