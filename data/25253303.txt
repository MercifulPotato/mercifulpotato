Every village has their own accent&#x2F;dialect and every region often has their own words or even sub-language. I live 50km from Fryslan, but I cannot make any sense of Frysian language. The same for Limburg or Flanders when people have a deep accent.<p>Sometimes people with such a strong accent get on tv, and they provide subtitles, otherwise it is just incomprehensible to most Dutch people. It is often a culture of relating to someone, like &quot;We are from the same background&quot;. At my chess club there are 3 persons that know Frysian, when they decide to talk Frysian, it is better to just walk away :)')
