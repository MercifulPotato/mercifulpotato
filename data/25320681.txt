Some Brazilians are unaware of the nut. I met at least a couple Brazilians (in Sao Paulo and another region that don&#x27;t have cashew trees) who&#x27;ve eaten the fruit but have never had cashew nuts and didn&#x27;t even know about the nut!<p>- All this tasty fruit exists above the nut, but--as far as I can tell--no effort is make to export the fruit.
