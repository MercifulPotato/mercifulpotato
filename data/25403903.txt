It had the ability to tune to the higher UHF channels 70-83 [0] which while planned for use, never ended up used for tv broadcast, but they didn&#x27;t know that at the time of the construction of the tv set. Those frequency covered by those channels were reallocated in 1982 by the CCIR worldwide convention, and covered approximately 806 to 890mhz. What was most interesting to me as a child, was in the early 90s I found out I could hear an occasional phone call, even more so when I used the fine tuning nob.  On a side note, the tv set also allowed me to view scrambled channels on the cable system which I could unscramble to various degrees by turning the tuning nob at certain rates.  I suppose modern 90s systems were not designed with my old tv set in mind.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Television_channel_frequencies#Americas_(most_countries),_South_Korea,_Taiwan_,_Burma_(Myanmar)_and_the_Philippines_2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Television_channel_frequencies...</a>')
