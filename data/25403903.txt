The frequency covered by those channels were reallocated in 1982 by the CCIR worldwide convention, and covered approximately 806 to 890mhz.<p>What was most interesting to me as a young teenager in the early 90s about this particular tv set, was that I found out I could hear an occasional phone call when tuned to those UHF channels, even more so when I used the fine tuning nob.<p>On a side note, the tv set also allowed me to view scrambled channels on the cable system which I could unscramble to various degrees by turning the tuning nob at certain rates back and forth.  I suppose modern 90s systems were not designed with my old tv set in mind.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Television_channel_frequencies#Americas_(most_countries),_South_Korea,_Taiwan_,_Burma_(Myanmar)_and_the_Philippines_2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Television_channel_frequencies...</a>')
