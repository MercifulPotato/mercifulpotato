Item(by='eigenket', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607350222, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25329601, text='As someone who works in the quantum info &#x2F; computation &#x2F; foundations field I prefer &quot;advantage&quot; to &quot;supremacy&quot; not just because of all the racists using the word &quot;supremacy&quot; but also because advantage is more accurate. For me &quot;supremacy&quot; would indicate that quantum computers are convincingly beating classical ones for all or most problems at sufficiently large scale. I.e. if you&#x27;re google or whatever you&#x27;re buying quantum computers and using them for a big chunk of you computing needs.<p>This scenario is (in my opinion) overwhelmingly unlikely to occur during my lifetime (or ever). Classical computers aren&#x27;t going anywhere. Quantum advantage conveys the reality that there are some problems that using quantum computers gives you advantages for, but others for which you should be using classical computation.')
