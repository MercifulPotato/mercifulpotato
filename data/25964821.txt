A savings account will cost you money in the long term - ie. your purchase power will decrease every year because the interest paid on savings accounts does not even keep up with inflation.<p>The longer and more money you have in a savings account, the less purchase power you actually have. Think of this like putting $100 into the account but only being able to spend $90 of it. Multiply that by your life&#x27;s savings... and this becomes a horrible way to save for retirement.<p>A Money Market account would be better, and nearly as safe as a savings account.<p>IRA&#x27;s and 401(k) where <i>you</i> control you money is ideal. If you don&#x27;t want to be bothered to pay attention to the markets... get yourself a managed IRA (yes, a fund would then be in control of your future). With a managed portfolio, you generally get some say over how your money is invested - so you could direct them to invest in industrializing economies (which would help lift people out of poverty over time). Just because you make money on the stock market doesn&#x27;t mean someone is getting screwed over...<p>Bottom line is, a savings account will lose you money over time (and that doesn&#x27;t even touch on the maximum amount you can have per account to be insured, which is far less than you&#x27;ll need for retirement).')
