My guess is no one can tell the difference, and in fact hydroponic probably tastes better. So yes, genetics only define a potential in a pedantic definition but those genes only need light, CO2, nitrogen, phosphorus, and trace metals to affect life.<p>As for the wine argument, I really can&#x27;t tell the difference between two buck chuck and a $250 bottle of wine and I&#x27;d venture a guess that neither can most people (ok, maybe two buck chuck is a little too low on the quality pole). As for molecular content, I&#x27;m sure the grapes that go into a choice pinot noir would sustain life just as efficiently as the red grapes in my grocery store.')
