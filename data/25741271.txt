Password managers are very niche uses.<p>&quot;secret servers&quot; or key-management systems are just fine using TLS imo. I helped draw up the design for what is now the aws secrets manager. At the point you&#x27;re reasoning about TLS being broken you might as well be focusing on detection, monitoring and key rotation because the whole internet is coming down with you.<p>&gt; I attended a talk at QCon SF 2019 where the speaker advocated use of application-level encryption (even in web apps) by default as a form of defense-in-depth. I was skeptical, especially since client code itself has to be delivered using TLS only (and thus a successful TLS attack renders further defenses worthless).<p>defense-in-depth is a weasel word. security isnt a bunch of layers that can be reinforced as such; often things that are referred to as &#x27;defense-in-depth&#x27; cover <i>specific</i> characteristics of one protocol over another.<p>For example, in password managers as you mention you end up with application level encryption. But this is because TLS doesn&#x27;t provide the guarantees they want of server blindness, and some resistance to bad TLS certs installed at the OS level (a dubious security boundary, but regardless...).<p>&gt; But it does seem that application-level crypto allows a lot of networked devices (besides the application servers themselves) to be rendered zero-knowledge concerning most application and user data. This allows us to trust those devices less.<p>This may well be true in niche cases. In reality, there&#x27;s not a lot of businesses out there who will overengineer their systems to know less about their users. zero-knowledge applications are unbelievably subtle to make <i>really</i> work, and it&#x27;s very easy to fool even experts in adjacent security fields that an application is zero-knowledge in some respect when it isn&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m digressing. Application-level encryption in 2021 is very rarely what&#x27;s wanted, and the existence of niche security cases in entirely security-focussed products doesn&#x27;t discount that.')
