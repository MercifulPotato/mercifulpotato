It can be very hard to not perceive criticism of the thing as criticism of oneself. Especially if the thing is something we&#x27;ve worked hard at and are proud of.<p>I use the &quot;feedback bucket&quot; mental trick: all feedback is shit (whether supportive or critical). All the feedback goes in the bucket, where it nourishes the growth of the beautiful roses of customer insight.<p>The point is to remove the immediacy of the feedback, detach it from the thing (and my feelings about the thing). But still allow it to inform my thinking about the thing. Instead of taking a criticism to heart, I can mentally &quot;put it in the bucket&quot;. If it&#x27;s useful, thoughtful, considered, constructive criticism then it will produce some insight later. If it&#x27;s just spite, then it&#x27;ll produce nothing.')
