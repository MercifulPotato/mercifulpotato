Namely, I wanted to send an SMS when an event occurred.<p>Termux-api used to offer this [0], but apparently some time ago google decided to make it impossible:<p>&gt; Usage of this API is no longer allowed by Google and we had to disable it to prevent delisting of Termux:API application from the Google Play.<p>It&#x27;s my device, my SMS plan over a (supposedly) open source system. But it&#x27;s the vendor&#x27;s platform, and a huge part of it is proprietary (the play services).<p>This is the windows monopoly all over again, but in our pockets and with deep analytics backed in.<p>OK sorry, this ended being a rant.
