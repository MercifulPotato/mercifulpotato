It sounds like a lot.<p>I don’t have any advice to give except, if you are able, find and speak to a professional therapist. I thought I was <i>above that sort of thing</i> until my own mental health got so bad it was basically one of my only options.<p>One thing I wish someone had told me in my mental health journey - If you don’t connect with the first (or second, or third) therapist you meet with, fire them and look for a new one. You won’t offend the first (or second, or third) therapist because they have the same goal you do, which is to get you into a better place. It took me three tries to make the right connection with someone I spent about six months working with and it has made a big improvement in my well being.<p>Sending positive vibes!')
