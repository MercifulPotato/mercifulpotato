I have no idea what happened, but I was really using youtube just to host my videos, not as a career.<p>I want to get my videos back.<p>If I go to google takeout, the download section doesn&#x27;t show youtube. On internet it says you need to go to youtube to download all youtube data. Which can&#x27;t happen because if I go to youtube page it redirects to your account was suspended page.<p>I know my data is there, in Google account it shows how many videos ive there, I know GDPR says I should be able to request my data.<p>But I&#x27;m not sure how do I do that?')
