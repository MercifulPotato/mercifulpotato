It is too complex.<p>I interpret this assertion with a high dose of incredulity and skepticism.<p>You&#x27;re specifically referring to a single class that&#x27;s a part of C++&#x27;s standard library.<p>C++&#x27;s standard library is extremely spartan when compared with other programming languages, such as Java.<p>It&#x27;s unbelievable that C++&#x27;s inclusion of stuff such as std::visit in its standard library renders it &quot;too complex&quot; when the extend and arcane nature of other standard libraries are incomparably higher.<p>Hell, some toolkits and frameworks are incomparably far more complex and we don&#x27;t see them accused of being unusable.')
