I have a habit to archive my system updates in case of network failure or other non connected scenario. In my mind this is mandatory. Good thing is that I have stored everything Catalina related and plan not to update any of my current computers with next version of Apple software. \nOn other hand I am profoundly thankful for this reality. Apple finally has shown their true colours and no form of hardware or software advancement will push me to use their products. Can you imagine the world without Linux or BSD alternatives? What a nightmare.\nThankfully the Little Snitch and VPN fiasco was the final point for me and migration to Debian&#x2F;KDE is flawless.')
