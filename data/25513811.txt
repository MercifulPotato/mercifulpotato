They can become very shy of conflicts, and start lying about the smallest things - stuff that regular people wouldn&#x27;t think twice about lying.<p>Basically - anything that could lead to some sort of conflict, they can lie about, just to avoid.<p>Which is kind of ironic - as people often cite or view strict upbringing as something which will build character and &quot;mature&quot; kids for adult life. But then you see a lot of these kids end up becoming master liars.')
