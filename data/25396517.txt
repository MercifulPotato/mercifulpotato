They support YouTube through their advertisers, and their advertisers don&#x27;t want to be affiliated with guns. It makes sense that they won&#x27;t pay you for videos that they can&#x27;t monetize -- they&#x27;re just passing on the loss to the video producer.<p>Beyond demonetization, YouTube did categorically ban videos demonstrating how to install and&#x2F;or fabricate an autosear. In practice, this also extends to purely educational videos explaining how an autosear works.')
