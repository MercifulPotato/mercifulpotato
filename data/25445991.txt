I can see this pushing some projects to pay for Red Hat for dev machines versus take the risk of having a separate dev environment.<p>Where that isn&#x27;t a concern though, it will push devs over to Ubuntu (the only other Linux flavor I&#x27;ve seen around here) probably, and quickly the friction in government against non-Red Hat Linux flavors will drop. As an example of that friction, last I looked Red Hat published themselves guides and scripts to get CentOS stig&#x27;ed to the level we need here, while neither Ubuntu nor anyone else had automated it.')
