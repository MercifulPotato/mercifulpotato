I&#x27;ve entered a second degree (in CS) program at the University of British Columbia while working full time. My first degree is a BSc in Econ. Basically I&#x27;m wondering if I should continue with it, or instead focus on self teaching and contributing to open source&#x2F;building a portfolio.<p>I quite like my job at the moment (public sector data analysis, with experience programming in R &amp; SQL) and am not willing to quit to study full time, but would like to move into a software development role. Although I&#x27;m doing well enough in the one 4 credit course I&#x27;m taking, my mental health is not at its best and I&#x27;m finding it very difficult to manage work, school, and life. The program I&#x27;m taking is great, UBC has a top notch CS department, but it must be completed in 4 yrs.<p>The concerns I have are 1) getting burnt out, and 2) finishing the degree without having relevant work experience&#x2F;a portfolio due to only having time for coursework. Another bachelor&#x27;s degree takes a long time, especially part time, and I&#x27;m wondering if, given I (think) I have some aptitude for programming, my time would be better spent putting a dent into that 10 yrs of learning by doing that Norvig talked about. I would do this by working on large open source projects, reading lots of code, and studying (at a more manageable pace, from good sources like those on teachyourselfcs.com) CS theory. The thing holding me back from forging my own path is the worry that I would never be taken seriously without a formal education in the subject.<p>Any advice&#x2F;thoughts would be greatly appreciated!')
