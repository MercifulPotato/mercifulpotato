Chiropractors here have a protected title (like doctors, lawyers), and a 5 year regulated training that isn’t exactly homeopathy. I rarely notice any difference between the surgeon general-approved naprapathy practitioners, and chiropractors. They do mostly similar treatment and charge similar money for it.<p>I have never seen any new-agy or pseudoscience-like stuff come up in treatments. They just snap my spine into place and some times rough up a muscle just to prevent it snapping back out of location again.<p>I too have heard people say it’s pseudoscience and humbug (usually e.g in the US) but could this vary? What are the pseudoscience parts? Could loose regulation in some countries have led to it becoming a market for pseudoscience whereas in other places it hasn’t?')
