Most 1920s SF houses aren&#x27;t worth what it would cost to dismantle them, or at least they wouldn&#x27;t be if there wasn&#x27;t a land use and planning crisis in that city.<p>A modern house would have a tiny fraction of the energy demanded by 1920s SF tract housing, and 100% less interior mold.')
