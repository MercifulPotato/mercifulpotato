But I&#x27;m casually curious about all of this, and have looked at US media.<p>You are absolutely right that CNN is biased. They clearly are not trying to make it seem as though they aren&#x27;t. The same with Fox, who are equally biased. However, only only of those outlets lets their reporters outright lie.<p>Now, it may be that I&#x27;m looking in the wrong places, but if I were to see lies on CNN in the same way as I see it on Fox, I&#x27;ll be happy to change my mind, but right now I think it&#x27;s pretty clear which one needs to be curbed.<p>Fox also allows comments on their stories. A lot of the real hateful stuff can be found there, and section 230 allows Fox to wash their hands of that. Perhaps Trump was on to something when he was campaigning to have it revoked? (the last part is sarcasm, of course).')
