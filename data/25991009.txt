It’s literally the exact thing that’s repeatedly warned about. Trying to be the next-to-last out in a Ponzi scheme is a dangerous game, and one that many “smart” people have lost.<p>That’s not to say that some people won’t succeed at trying to time the market. It’s just essentially roulette: you can do well for yourself or you can lose money, but on the whole it’s a losing proposition and winning isn’t particularly correlated with skill. And—perhaps more like poker—even repeated bad plays can be rewarding in the short or even medium run.<p>Also like poker, taking big gambles can be profitable in the short term, but any time you put your bankroll on the table you’re risking going bust. Even a 10% chance is going to send you back to square one eventually.<p>Other than exceedingly rare cases, people who perform well in the markets don’t seem to be the same year-over-year, except at the rate you’d expect from random chance. Smart plays can turn catastrophic, bad plays can be profitable, and it takes a lot of honest introspection to assess whether or not a play was smart or simply bad but lucky.<p>I bought into AAPL early in my investing career. It was right around when Rails was taking off. I saw a UNIX system with great interface design and better stability than popular Linux distros, and developers flocking to the platform for tools like TextMate. I knew AAPL would take off in the end if they were grabbing such developer mindset.<p>I was right, but for all the wrong reasons. AAPL took off, but it was pretty much just because of the iPhone. It had nothing to do with what I thought it was, and in the end I was just lucky. That’s a lesson that stuck with me.')
