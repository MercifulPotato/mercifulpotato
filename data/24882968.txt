Nobody has to know anything about Steve Klabnik to be able to parse Rust or a syntax guide to Rust.<p>Feminism is different when you consider that each of us experiences the world through a gender lens, particularly when you consider that many of us are unaware that the lens exists and occludes our vision as well as forms it.<p>How do people of a gender you don&#x27;t share experience the world?  I&#x27;m not sure how you&#x27;d know until you listened to them describe their lived experience.<p>In the case of Beauvoir, you are fortunate.  Her life bridges a gap between pre-feminism and post-feminist worlds.  If you love talking about gender and sexuality, Beauvoir&#x27;s life is fertile grounds for many interesting conversations you may enjoy with other people of all genders for the rest of your life.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OTdTNr1-y-c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OTdTNr1-y-c</a>')
