And then Uber and Lyft went crying to the state government to override Austin because Austin started generating alternatives and we found out that Uber&#x2F;Lyft don&#x27;t really have an unassailable position but they have <i>LOTS of VC cash</i> to spend on lobbying and advertising.<p>Unfortunately, making the kind of adjustments that people in Austin did borders on impossible right now, so this kind of threat was quite effective.')
