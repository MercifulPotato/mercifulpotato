Most of the things in the show are things that actually happened in real life, just with the serial numbers filed off.  For instance, Cardiff Electric is basically fake Compaq, Comet is basically fake Yahoo!, and Rover is like fake Google.  There&#x27;s even a reference to the Morris worm.<p>Sure, fake Google comes a little early in the timeline, and Mutiny doesn&#x27;t exactly map to anything that&#x27;s familiar to me, but it all feels like it could have happened.  Verisimilitude is really what matters here, and they pull it all off to an absolute T.<p>On the technical aspects, I loved when Donna got to do her thing those couple of times and do data recovery on disks.  I wish they had been able to give her a bigger role in the early part of the series, because her character really shines when allowed to.<p>And, we have to mention the set design.  It&#x27;s perfect, right down to the little touches, like Donna and Gordon&#x27;s J.C. Penney TV, or the Yars&#x27; Revenge poster hanging up in the Mutiny frat house.  Sometimes I literally watch the show just to look at the sets.')
