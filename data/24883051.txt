Also, the whole handoff period is under 20 minutes, so the transporter only has access to the cars for 20 minutes (with many others around), before a timestamp is required.<p>&gt; <i>Who was taking the picture?</i><p>We&#x27;ve never run into this as a problem, but we can require a continuous video including a selfie of the transporter.<p>&gt; <i>What is the picture of? The car to be protected? Or someone else&#x27;s car.</i><p>This we verify by checking the VIN in the frame (frame number check).')
