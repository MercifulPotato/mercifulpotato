I used the &#x27;gameboy programming manual&#x27; which was sort of the magnum opus of gameboy documentation at the time that was available to the fan community.<p>I am googling it now, and there are some forum posters saying &#x27; don&#x27;t use that, it&#x27;s old and not completely accurate&#x27; but it was all that I could find at the time.<p>I&#x27;m aware that it&#x27;s not official documentation, but you have to remember this was over 10 years ago--there might be better resources now.')
