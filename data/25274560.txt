After working on .NET Core codebases for several years (which rarely have more than 4-5 calls within the framework itself) I was shocked to see stack dumps from a Spring application I&#x27;ve been working on. Three to four nested exceptions, with up to 100 nested calls (and sometimes more) within each one. If you don&#x27;t have a smart IDE folding the less interesting parts (and copious amounts of amphetamine), it&#x27;s simply unreadable.')
