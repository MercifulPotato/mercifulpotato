The Tom Cruise bits were poking fun at the fact that all of these deepfakes are every bit as obvious as the puppet. And they didn&#x27;t even try deepfaking the voices because it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Just listen to the latest state of the art voice mimicking samples. They&#x27;re terrible! It says a lot that the only actually convincing fake in the entire video was a human impersonator&#x27;s voice.<p>That said, this stuff will improve over time. But before you label it the end of the world you really have to think about how much has always been possible with impersonators and makeup&#x2F;prosthetics.')
