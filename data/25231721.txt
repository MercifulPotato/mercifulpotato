It tokenizes the effort and provides gratification. I build my badges and feel good about them. I&#x27;ll take a good cert prep book on vacation with my family because it relaxes and energizes me (my current actual work is 90% managerial and problems are far tougher and less certain&#x2F;rewarding than technical ones... To me at least; so this both unwind and keeps me somewhat current). Basically I&#x27;m an addict - I have certs in things I&#x27;m unlikely ever to use.<p>But... I fully realize I&#x27;m doing this for fun. I wouldn&#x27;t claim to anybody it actually makes me good at <i>doing</i> any of the things I&#x27;m &quot;certified&quot; in. So while I&#x27;m confident the author&#x27;s approach is efficient and effective if your sole goal is &quot;pass exam, obtain cert&quot; - if there&#x27;s any practical goal after that (e.g. &quot;get employed and be good at doing this stuff&quot;), I doubt this is a good approach. Maybe a good starter, maybe even not.<p>I&#x27;d be curious what&#x27;s HN perspective?')
