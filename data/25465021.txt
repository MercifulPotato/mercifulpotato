Sure, it has some obvious benefits: it forces users to always provide a valid email and logging in confirms that the email address is valid, without any additional logic.<p>But moving auth logic to email links has increased my customer support work significantly: &quot;I can&#x27;t log in&quot;, &quot;I didn&#x27;t get the link&quot; complaints are quite common now. People use email they didn&#x27;t sign up with, messages go to spam, arrive with a delay - or recently, gmail outage caused messages to hard-bounce. These are only some of the issues I&#x27;ve had to deal with in the last few weeks, that never came up when I had password auth.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve found that some email clients automatically follow links included in the message and that meant login link was invalidated before user got a chance to click it. I&#x27;ve solved it by adding a button on the page, but it&#x27;s not ideal.<p>Magic links were supposed to be convenient, but they cause a lot of frustrations for some users. Keep that in mind.')
