I was suspicious of why an app this small in function would require such a large download, and looked inside, but the actual contents was only 1.4Mb, half of which was icons etc., which seems much more reasonable. If I right click on Unclack.app and choose &quot;compress&quot;, I get a file under 1Mb in size.<p>Does this always happen with DMG files, or is there something weird going on here? This file is 10Ã— bigger than it could be.')
