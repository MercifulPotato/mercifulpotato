Tons of contradictions, everybody is guilty of something, nobody except computer program can hold it in their memory to know when and what should apply. It&#x27;s madness.<p>Yes I know it&#x27;s only tangentially related, but I believe most regulations against big tech only establish their domination. These companies can likely invest more resources in legal analysis than the goverment, so they will use most of it to their advantage.<p>Laws should be as general as possible. We have robots.txt, you can even add some new marker, if some news site doesn&#x27;t want to have it content fetched in an automated way, let it have that but it&#x27;s already a slippery slope because why should a human be able to read it and write an article citing source if a program cannot do that.')
