Would it actually be terrible if we had to allow people space to say what they want on a digital platform?<p>What would the side effects be of not being able to remove people from your store because they&#x27;re behaving in a way you don&#x27;t like?  What if YouTube <i>could not</i>, legally, remove content that was &quot;abusive&quot; or &quot;hateful&quot;?<p>(Again, not saying I think this is how things should be, just trying to entertain the idea a bit.)')
