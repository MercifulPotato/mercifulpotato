Security-minded people would have set it to true and dealt with the fallout, whereas others could have set it to false and shipped their update still.<p>But by defaulting to false, this security tool is hidden from both existing and new users. Old code will not even have the chance to get fixed and new code will be written in an insecure state.<p>I’m sure the release notes talked about this feature, but who reads release notes? Especially not past release notes (when starting fresh today).<p>The backwards compatibility cost of throwing and in the message even suggesting setting to false as an emergency out would have been minimal compared to the fallout this is causing.')
