The economy objectively gets poorer in that area, and the ramifications are widespread as areas start to become &#x27;food deserts&#x27; and so forth.<p>The investors didn&#x27;t get screwed; they made a bad investment, and the short sellers didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the malls failing.

The vultures are swine like Bain who levered up viable companies on debt to &quot;increase shareholder value,&quot; looted pensions on bankruptcy and moved manufacturing abroad. Meanwhile McKinsey advising giving pharmacies &quot;rebates&quot; every time someone ODs.... but it&#x27;s the guys shorting dying shopping malls who are the problem....')
