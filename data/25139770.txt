Like I said, if enough people don&#x27;t like this change, they can start their own fork called originalgit or something. It would be fairly easy to backport changes to it. Let the market decide whether the default branch should be called &quot;master&quot; or &quot;main&quot;. Or, you could start a twitter campaign about how &quot;main&quot; reminds you of the Spanish colonization of the Americas and all the attendant horrors of that. Worse than the Atlantic slave trade? Maybe! If you can convince enough people that &quot;main&quot; is bad, maybe they&#x27;ll switch it back.')
