Those of you who are upset by this action should reflect on why this is different than any other content policy or removal they perform. Just like those of you who are upset with private businesses requiring you to wear a mask have never been upset with a &quot;no shoes, no shirt&quot; policy. Stop hiding behind some supposed principles here. Just admit what is really bothering you here.')
