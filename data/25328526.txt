Complaining about the &quot;colonization&quot; of education is a waste of time when &quot;education&quot; itself is a farcical treadmill of wasted time and indoctrination.<p>A friend and I were chatting about the argument about whether or not &quot;Under God&quot; should be in the pledge, and he made the following point:<p>Mandatory education? Sure.\nMandatory attendance? Sure.\nGovernnment-approved curriculums? Sure.\nMandatory taxes to pay for the mandatory, government-approved curriculum? Sure.\nInclude &quot;God&quot; in the pledge of allegiance? Whoa there, Adolf, we don&#x27;t want the government indoctrinating our kids!')
