So it&#x27;s not horrible. By biggest issue is that when I first started using Lightroom I didn&#x27;t really have a good orderly ingestion workflow so there&#x27;s a duplication of raw scans, PSDs, JPGs, different versions of edits, etc. It&#x27;s hard to automate and what to save and what to toss from the catalog is somewhat a matter of judgement.<p>&gt;I ran all my family photos through a script that renamed them based on the year, month, and date.<p>I actually don&#x27;t care about the filename, although maybe once things are cleaned up I&#x27;ll do an export of everything. It&#x27;s all in a Lightroom catalog now. It&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; a matter of adding more primarily location-based metadata and making sure everything I especially care about is in appropriate Collections.')
