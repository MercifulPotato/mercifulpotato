So they&#x27;re not attacking just everything in a non-discriminatory fashion - but cells with similar growth as cancer cells, become collateral damage, so to speak.<p>This is why some chemo will result in for example hairloss; Because the cancer you&#x27;re being treated for, has the same growth rate as the cells in your hair - and thus the chemo will also kill those cells.')
