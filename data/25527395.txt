Item(by='marcan_42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608817728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25526237, text='This bug log was painful to read. People are mixing together TERM settings, LANG (I have no idea why UTF-8 keeps popping up, that&#x27;s <i>obviously</i> not going to work on a vt220), customizations and options, the actual terminal attached, running within virtual terminals (&#x27;script&#x27; is one, not just tmux)... It&#x27;s almost impossible to root cause a bug efficiently like this. You need to be much more methodical and first reduce the bug to the simplest reproducer, then document the exact setup. Instead of running under `script` to try to get logs, using `strace` would&#x27;ve been much more transparent and informative (showing you also the tty related syscalls while not interfering with the actual tty).<p>From the &#x27;no output on a vt220&#x27; part I was already thinking &#x27;I bet it&#x27;s the serial port, not the TERM&#x27;. And indeed, misconfigured terminal size is something anyone who has ever connected to an embedded system over serial has experienced, though I didn&#x27;t know the default setting was 0,0 (other shells interpret that as 80x25 or something like that by default).<p>It&#x27;s good that they figured it out, but bugs like these show why solid troubleshooting skills are rare and very valuable. This could&#x27;ve been solved in 30 minutes with a strace log and some digging through the code.')
