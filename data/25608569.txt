At my high school in Chicago (2003-2007, ~2,000 students) we were free to leave the campus at any time and often spent lunch at a nearby hot dog stand or sitting in the park and hanging out. The only restriction was that you had to re-enter through specific entries so they could check school IDs. I think it&#x27;s because the school is in the middle of the city and very pedestrian friendly. One kid I knew even lived across the street from the school and would go home to make himself some lunch. I know from friends and family that suburban high schools in the Chicagoland area were more strict with their off-campus policies as there wasn&#x27;t any pedestrian access to the schools. I just think suburban schools don&#x27;t want traffic jams in the parking lot during every lunch period.')
