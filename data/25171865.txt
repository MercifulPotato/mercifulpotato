QA is to validate that what worked locally also works for other internal employees. In our organization, we have strong discipline regarding locally validating changes before pushing up PRs. Iterating through QA usually means you don&#x27;t know how to manage local development environments. We have written mocks &amp; simulators to ensure that the local development experience very closely matches a live environment. Also, there are multiple individuals who are able to manage the build process, so we have appropriate redundancies in place.<p>BTW, I don&#x27;t think you would have to worry about working in my organization. We prefer to work with individuals who take a charitable approach to unfamiliar ideas.')
