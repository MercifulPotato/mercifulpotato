The M1 is replacing integrated graphics in these machines.  Integrated graphics also trail discrete graphics by years so it isn&#x27;t really a knock on the M1 that it does too.<p>That leaves two primary questions. Does the integrated graphics of the M1 beat integrated graphics of Intel and AMD?  What does Apple plan to do to compete with discrete graphics in their higher end hardware and will that be a more powerful SOC, discrete graphics hardware from Apple, or something more traditional from AMD?')
