Does WhatsApp have a better UI? Why?<p>To me signal is the best UI, and WhatsApp looks like a child designed it. Especially with the horrid default colors and backgrounds.<p>But I don&#x27;t really see a difference in UIs in most chat programs. There are only two types of UIs. Point-to-point (signal, WhatsApp, imessage, etc) and room based (irc, matrix, slack).<p>Their all so similar, I don&#x27;t understand what is better or worse in Signal compared to WhatsApp.')
