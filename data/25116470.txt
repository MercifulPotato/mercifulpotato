So restaurant owners are agreeing to a big fee to get customers from the GrubHub website and app.<p>But it sounds like they often don&#x27;t know that they are also being made to pay a fee for their own customers who are simply looking up the phone number.<p>GrubHub isn&#x27;t obviously adding any value there, these customers could just as well have pulled the phone number from Google Maps of the restaurant&#x27;s own website.<p>I think GrubHub could be acting incorrectly in few ways:\n1. Restaurants don&#x27;t appear to be well informed of the cost. Deceiving your customer (eg by sneaking clauses into the contract) doesn&#x27;t feel right.\n2. GrubHub could be deceiving the restaurant&#x27;s customers, who may be making a sincere effort to order from the restaurant directly.\n3. In some local markets; GrubHub might have a kind of monopoly power. I think  are a lot more constraints on how these kinds of businesses can dictate terms to other business: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vertical_restraints" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vertical_restraints</a>')
