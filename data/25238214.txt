Item(by='JamisonM', descendants=None, kids=[25243029], score=None, time=1606578309, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25237357, text='Some thoughts on the composition:<p>* &quot;I wrote the case arguing that frequentist interpretations don&#x27;t work, but algorithmic information theory does&quot;: if that&#x27;s what you are up to here then I think it would be for readers if you stated that up front in some way. And hit me with some kind of summary at the end that makes the concise version of your argument at the end, it&#x27;s a long article.<p>* Shorter might be better: There&#x27;s a lot of stuff in here that I think you can pare out in the probability discussion that maybe isn&#x27;t adding that much to your argument. I think there is a lot to be gained by assuming a generous reader.<p>* Betting might be a distraction to your point: This might be confusing the imperfect knowledge of participants in a market with the imperfect knowledge of all the physical forces involved in a physical phenomenon and how that related to the seeming &quot;randomness&quot; of a coin flip for your reader. (The liquidity and stuff.. this is just not related to your point.)<p>* Don&#x27;t undermine your point with unrelated assumptions: &quot;I imagine they wouldnâ€™t consider their world unlikely at all: they would just add a new law to their description of physics: all dice, as if by divine intervention, are deemed to exhibit this strange behaviour&quot; this lead me to think that you were just sort of shooing away the whole last X decades of high vs. low energy physics, we collectively certainly don&#x27;t think that we have the rules correct precisely because of this complication, we find the idea that we need 2 sets of rules improbable and believe that there must be a way to explain everything with a single set of rules. So your mythical dice society probably <i>would</i> consider their dice exception a very unlikely world.. they would be confident they have the world wrong!<p>A dubious assertion (or at least one that would need a whole lot of explanation) can be an off-ramp for a subset of readers.')
