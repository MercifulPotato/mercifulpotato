The last thing <i>I</i> want is dropbox to &#x27;innovate&#x27;.  They are already trying too hard by <i>forcing</i> you to have windows explorer integration which slows the crap out of my machine.<p>I am overall very happy with Dropbox and we use them because of what they are- a file syncing company.  If they become more, it will surely be at the expense of simple file syncing which is all I want from them.')
