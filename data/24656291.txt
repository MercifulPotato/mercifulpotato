Here, according to the findings of the Hamburg data protection officer, since at least 2014 private life circumstances of some of the employees have been comprehensively recorded and this information stored on a network drive. For example, the company conducted a &quot;Welcome Back Talk&quot; after employees returned to work after vacation or illness. The information that became known in this context - including information on the symptoms of illness and diagnoses of the employees - was recorded and stored. In addition, according to the Hamburg data protection authority, some supervisors also used the &quot;Flurfunk&quot; [meaning to hear something through the grapevine] to acquire a broad knowledge of individual employees, for example about family problems and religious beliefs. The information stored on the network drive was accessible to up to 50 managers of the company and was used, among other things, to evaluate the work performance of the employees and to make employment decisions.The data collection became known due to a technical configuration error in October 2019, according to which the data stored on the network drive was accessible company-wide for several hours. After the violation became known, the management apologized to the employees and offered monetary compensation. In addition, also further protective measures were introduced together with the data protection authority.
