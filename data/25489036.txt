Item(by='tw25485966', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608494243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25486314, text='&gt;Instead of saying &quot;anyone is allowed to dig up the road, bury cables and let the customers choose the provider with the best service&quot; we often allow only one or two cable providers and add some special rules to make them treat their hostage customers better.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t installing conduit be a still-better option for consumers? Also, the government-granted ISP monopoly approach prohibits would-be providers that don&#x27;t need to use cable.<p>Anyway, your dichotomy ignores the historical reality: local politicians subsidized builds by promising providers they didn&#x27;t have to worry about competition, subsidies extracted from the future captured customers, subsidies that are in fact the very things people complain about now.')
