There are estimated to be around 10.5-12 million undocumented migrants in the US.<p>It&#x27;s not a coincidence that there is a rotating crew of Russian speaking janitors who clean my office building and Spanish speaking landscapers outside my apartment. I&#x27;m not discounting that many of them are legal immigrants, just lower skilled and working their way on up. More power to them.<p>I can also see though how this situation is easily taken advantage of. Contracting firm hires undocumented workers for below market rates and is able to under bid for contracts. Big company fires their in house workers to save money and hires the contracting firm. Big company then gets the advantage of undocumented labor wages without the liability.')
