Item(by='notahacker', descendants=None, kids=[25907870], score=None, time=1611599678, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25904003, text='tbf I&#x27;m assuming that what the article calls &quot;passenger flight hours&quot; is more accurately described as &quot;flight hours by a passenger airliner&quot;, based on the figure looking very wrong otherwise. Looking at ICAO&#x27;s figures for that year there were 0.03 fatalities per 100m passenger km from airliners, so dividing through by a sensible average kph figure gives something in the region of 0.2 fatalities per passenger hour, or 30x safer than the car with sober driver. (You get to 100x quite easily by avoiding using airlines based in regions that contribute disproportionately to aviation accidents)<p>This is of course abstracting away from details like the aircraft travelling 10x further and walking to the airport, but the real problem is aircraft not serving the routes you want to drive. General Aviation is a lot more dangerous than commercial flights, especially when it involves clumsy pilots ;-)')
