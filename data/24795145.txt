If it fails it means that something got broken. It doesn&#x27;t stop the build pipeline, but it warns you that garbage is about to come out the other end.<p>There&#x27;s a general dynamic between people where peer pressure does not work when the delay between action and consequence grows too long. Nobody truly internalizes how upset other people are when they are found out for something bad they did a year ago, a month ago, or in some cases days ago (hence why roommates fight so often about chores). But getting called out for something you did two hours ago has sorted out an awful lot of bad behavior.<p>And the nice thing about the Canary Build is that in many CI tools you can set it up and not give him any permissions.')
