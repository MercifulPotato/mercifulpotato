I think its contraproductive.<p>This narrative of &#x27;is a doctor&#x27; doesn&#x27;t make that person an expert.<p>In a global pandemic like this, i think, you need an expert group of people with a min and max size. Those people need to be in the right position to have access the most amount of data and they need to make suggestions and predictions as accurate as possible. This then needs to be taken by the current government to decide what to do.<p>Your type of &#x27;doctors&#x27; shouldn&#x27;t comment on it like they are experts; They should start doing research with proper tools and statistics to support the expert group at the top.<p>It is easy to say something doesn&#x27;t work after a few days or weeks. Its just not helping. If experts are trying this, the chance, that your opinion was a fluke and now matches your expected outcome, doesn&#x27;t make you an expert.<p>All those shitty people thinking wearing a mask is a absolut no go and strips them of their rights are a real problem.<p>In germany on the &#x27;querdenker&#x27; people brought up and compared themselfs with anne frank and sophie scholl because of this. She was 22 when she was killed by the nazis through a guillotine in munich as a student because of distributing anti-war flyers.<p>Seeing this is one of my most frustrating experiences with our society so far. While there are a lot of people following those simple requests, its astounding how irrational people are in the usa.')
