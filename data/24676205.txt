This usually means that they distribute evenly on the surface of objects.<p>Humans are a bit more complicated in structure than say a metal ball, but my guess would be that there would be a similar situation where all the free electrons would just build up on the skin. Therefore, I don&#x27;t think the particles one would cough up would be negatively charged.')
