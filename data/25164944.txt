Fuel costs are a tiny fraction of the costs for a nuclear powerplant: less than 10%.  Breeders save a bit of money on fuel in exchange for a higher capital cost (cost of construction).  For reactors, capital costs are a huge factor because reactors are extremely expensive already ($8-10Bn per reactor in the US&#x2F;Europe).  Increasing that further more than balances the savings on fuel.<p><i></i>Thus, breeders generally end up being more expensive than a conventional BWR or PWR.<i></i><p>Here I should mention that I spent some time in nuclear physics research.  There&#x27;s a lot of misinformation floating around about nuclear energy. Most of the &quot;miracle solutions&quot; don&#x27;t live up to their promises (especially thorium tech and breeders).  If they did, we&#x27;d already be using them -- nuclear engineers are not fools, and most of these reactor concepts have been kicked around for literally decades.<p>One other point: the physics behind breeders and conventional slow-neutron reactors isn&#x27;t fundamentally different. Both neutron capture (&quot;breeding&quot;) and fission (&quot;burning&quot;) reactions happen in both, the ratios in a breeder are just optimized to favor the first process more.  In fact in conventional light water reactors, around a third of the energy released comes from fissile isotope bred from fertile isotopes such as U-238.')
