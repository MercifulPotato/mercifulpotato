Less so but still ditto for AutoPilot, as it is not a piece of hardware but rather software that is constantly being updated and honestly dangerous to deploy&#x2F;use if Tesla cannot guarantee the integrity of sensors&#x2F;drive-by-wire mechanisms&#x2F;etc.<p>Extended mileage does seem weird though â€“ they&#x27;ve <i>revoked</i> software updates that have extended mileage? That would be shitty if true (if not for a good reason), but I honestly haven&#x27;t heard about that one. And I&#x27;d still argue in favor of this being ownership, as <i>updates</i> are not your right as an owner of the vehicle (and with every other car you&#x27;ve ever owned don&#x27;t come with the vehicle at all). At the very least you always have whatever features you had when you bought the car from Tesla, which is exactly what you expect from any other car you purchase.')
