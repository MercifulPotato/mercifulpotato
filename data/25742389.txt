Item(by='astrophysician', descendants=None, kids=[25742541], score=None, time=1610426691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25742051, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t think you can say that life is built on computational processes unless you use a definition of &quot;computation&quot; that is so vague and all-encompassing that it becomes effectively meaningless.<p>I mean, there&#x27;s nothing physically stopping us from simulating a brain, right? It&#x27;s a finite object with a finite amount of physical ingredients, and therefore with a finite amount of computing power we can simulate what it does. To me personally, that&#x27;s a computational process. Maybe that&#x27;s an overly broad definition of computation, but I think these debates tend to be about whether there is something fundamentally different about &quot;life&quot; (by which I assume you include consciousness). But maybe that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re saying.<p>&gt; He points out that &quot;if we are to suppose that the brain is a digital computer, we are still faced with the question &#x27;And who is the user?&#x27;&quot;<p>What does that question even mean? I think it seems deep because we humans have a tendency to ascribe some sort of supernatural aura to our lived experience. Life is something incredible but that (at least to my knowledge) is not uncomputable...<p>&gt; There is no computational process that will produce the sensations of colour or sound or touch.<p>Got one: the brain!<p>&gt; At best you will have some representation that requires having actually experienced those sensations to understand it.<p>Why does a computer not &quot;experience&quot; something?')
