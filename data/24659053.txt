I’ve worked on a good number of open source projects big and small, and spent significant time working with at least one Indian in the process. While a certain subset of people like to force identity politics down everyone else’s throat (mostly by claiming nonexistent discrimination), the vast majority of people don’t give a rat’s ass about whether you’re Indian, or black, or female, or gay, or whatever, and only judge your contributions by what you’re actually contributing. You’re not welcome if you spam, that’s for sure, but even then you’re just a spammer, not an Indian spammer.')
