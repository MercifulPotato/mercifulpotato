If rights can be stripped with a simple declaration of emergency, on which there is no power to challenge that declaration then we have no rights at all<p>To believe the government will not use this unprecedented event for which they have usurped a wide range of never used before power in ever increasing ways is naive and ignores all of human history.<p>It will not be long before the seasonal flu or cold will be enough to warrant draconian measure and limited on personal freedoms, or be used for privacy invading policies like contact tracing all the time (which will then be used for Law Enforcement like in Singapore)<p>it amazes me out people can not see what is next,  or maybe than can but simply believe the promise (false promise) of safety is more important than liberty')
