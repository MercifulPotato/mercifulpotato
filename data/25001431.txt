Where is this recurring erroneous assertion coming from? Is your moral framework that all evil comes from wealth and therefore these people must be wealthy?<p>We all get bees in our bonnet about different things and you’re entitled to whatever preoccupation suits you.<p>I believe the world would be a far safer, less irritating place if traffic policing focused on people who don’t yield the left lane when traffic approaches from behind. The people who do this cause accidents by encouraging people driving quickly to pass on the right. Such lane hogs present a far greater danger to my personal safety than people who are simply driving fast, and leftmost lane slowpokes are far more likely to possess the sort of righteous attitude that your comment embodies. Righteousness and more specifically righteous anger get people killed.')
