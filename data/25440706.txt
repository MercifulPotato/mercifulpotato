Just skimmed it?&lt;p&gt;Not trying to piss on the OP here, but the idea with the Knuth books is that you spend time with them. Not just reading the table of contents and then going to Stackoverflow.&lt;p&gt;In fact, the reason for having books by authorities in the field like Knuth is so you become less dependent on places like Stackoverflow that replace factual validation by popularity validation. If you really did read Knuth you should be able to produce content on Stackoverflow instead of consuming it.')
