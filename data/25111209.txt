Let&#x27;s call one complete orbital cycle of one thing around another thing a &quot;year&quot;, and one spin a &quot;day&quot;. For example, one orbital cycle of the Sun around the center of our galaxy is &quot;galaxy year&quot;.<p>If we measure a human body at the scale of seconds, then we can measure position of the human with precision to single digit meters. It will behave like a particle.<p>If we measure it at the scale of days, then it will start to blur, like a quantum particle: 30% at home, 30% at work, 30% everywhere else, including the Moon. We can use probabilistic math at this scale, to describe this weird behavior.<p>If we measure human at the scale of years, then the human body will demonstrate dynamics and predictable trajectory: home -&gt; school -&gt; work -&gt; home. We can even invent a math formula, which will correctly predicts trajectory for a human at average.<p>If we try to measure a human at the scale of galactic year, then our detector will fail completely, because humans are short living objects.<p>When you measure your particles, you measure it at particle seconds, particle days, particle years, or at much higher scale?')
