Many of them treat acting white or being around white people as something akin to treason. This is just another piece of evidence that they cannot hold themselves to the standards of everyone else and so they must be given special treatment since their culture is so intolerance. Corporations are too happy to oblige since they don&#x27;t want to kick Black people off their platforms.')
