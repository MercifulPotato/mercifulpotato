Item(by='JohnBooty', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604881991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25027682, text='<p><pre><code>    Personally my brain does not work well with remembering\n    specific facts, I always admire people who can recall so\n    easily.\n</code></pre>\nWell, aside from Alex&#x27;s masterful job of hosting, that&#x27;s the brilliance of Jeopardy.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;trivia&quot;, but it does not thrive on facts that may be memorized by rote, such as &quot;in what year was Napolean born?&quot; or some such thing.<p>Notice that the &quot;answers&quot; are referred to as clues; it is really a game of inference and connection-making.<p>Here&#x27;s how you play: you think about the clue, and think about the fact that nearly all of the correct responses are <i>things you have heard of.</i><p>For example, if the clue is, &quot;This New York Yankee once said: [insert amusingly mangled malapropism here]&quot; you can think: well, there are perhaps ten New York Yankees who might be considered household names to the average middle-aged American. But only one of them is known for malapropisms: Yogi Berra. So, it&#x27;s probably him, even if you&#x27;ve never heard that particular quote. And the show stays honest to this unspoken conceit: they will generally not try to &quot;trick&quot; the player.<p>It&#x27;s not a test of whether or not you memorized quotations by baseball players, or read a book about Yogi Berra. It&#x27;s a test to see if you can make that connection.<p>You can see the contestants on the show making educated guesses like this, frequently, usually multiple times per game. Again, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s also a game of wagering. You are not stating <i>unequivocally</i> that you know the correct response; you are essentially assessing your confidence level in your response.')
