They are highly-lossfully-compressed, and there&#x27;s some evidence that the act of recalling them is destructive, so every time a memory is recalled it is destroyed, processed, and re-written.<p>It isn&#x27;t surprising that when a very out-of-the-usual event occurs, and the memory goes through this lossy compression and lossy storage, that when it is later reconstructed with the lossy decompression schema generated by a lifetime of &quot;usual&quot; experiences that it would result in phantom &quot;usual experiences&quot; being generated. It is very similar in process to those &quot;deep learning&quot; pictures that turn everything picture you feed it into bizarre mixes of dogs and sea creatures, because that&#x27;s all that decompression schema understands.')
