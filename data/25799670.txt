Don&#x27;t be snarky. Have curious conversation; don&#x27;t cross-examine. Please don&#x27;t fulminate. Please don&#x27;t sneer, including at the rest of the community.&quot;<p>&quot;Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.&quot;<p>&quot;Eschew flamebait. Don&#x27;t introduce flamewar topics unless you have something genuinely new to say. Avoid unrelated controversies and generic tangents.&quot;<p>&quot;Please don&#x27;t post shallow dismissals, especially of other people&#x27;s work. A good critical comment teaches us something.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
