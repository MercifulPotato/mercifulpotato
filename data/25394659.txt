Take the following for example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;Yb8WvJY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;Yb8WvJY</a><p>Over 150 days, this developer&#x27;s churn really fluctuates and that&#x27;s because they work on different things, that requires different amounts of code.  And if you look at the following:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;oNmsMSV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;oNmsMSV</a><p>you can see they still commit regularly, but as the Reviewability section shows, their changes are mainly small ones, which sort of aligns with what Sid (sytse) mentioned, which is mainly focusing on small changes.<p>If you look at the bigger picture:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;vmiOtgU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;vmiOtgU</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;5vf3kWj" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;5vf3kWj</a><p>The churn for the project microsoft&#x2F;vscode fluctuates quite a bit as well.<p>Based on what I&#x27;ve learned so far, you really need a good baseline (that can vary greatly from one developer to another) to be able to determine if somebody is more&#x2F;less productive.')
