On the search result page I noticed lots of random german websites with a sub-page about the topic I was searching for - but they all redirected to bestvpn1.com. All these websites do not have any correlation with VPN, internet, privacy, or whatever. For example: Search for &quot;vpn dnscrypt&quot;. Few other search keywords lead to such result pages. Whats going on here? It&#x27;s also interesting that all these websites do not work at the moment, except their sub-pages that redirect to bestvpn1.')
