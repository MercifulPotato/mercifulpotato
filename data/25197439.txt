True<p>But ignoring the balance of power for, what appears to be, a reason to hate on Apple is just daft. Shockingly so.<p>A police offer demanding a bribe is not the same as a police officer accepting one. Just ignores the entire social dynamic of humans. Power dynamics are the central theme of human relationships. This is just a weird form of victim blaming, though not for a moment am I suggesting anyone is innocent here.<p>The Undersheriff should be crucified as a means of deterrence. You can&#x27;t have positions of power occupied by those seeking to corrupt them. Which, I think, is not far off your argument, you just want to seem to needlessly drag Apple into this.<p>They weren&#x27;t involved, beyond their employee basically stealing their stock. Is that somehow their fault? Should we charge them with criminal negligence for trusting someone? That&#x27;s not going to have long term consequences for whistleblowers at all')
