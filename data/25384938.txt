Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607689264, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25382766, text='I&#x27;m not an electrical engineer but I ran into the I^2R heat loss problem with a simple mosfet circuit. If I drive the mosfets at 48V (voltage is actually irrelevant) and 70A and the RDS of the mosfet is 0.002 Ohm then the mosfet will lose 9.8W of power to heat. For a small compact SMD mosfet that&#x27;s a lot of heat and requires a heatsink. Once you scale up to 500A you are basically losing 500A x 500A x 0.002 Ohm = 250W of power just on a single mosfet. I&#x27;m not very experienced in this subject but I noticed that mosfets with lower voltage ratings tend to also have lower drain source resistance (RDS) which means doing this at 1000V can only get harder.')
