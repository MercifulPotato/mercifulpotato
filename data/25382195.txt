CISC has certain advantages these days because they are compact at encoding memory operations. Intel and AMD crack instructions into operations called micro-ops. There is no meaningful difference between how easy it is to reorder the micro-ops versus RISC ops. CISC or RISC, the internal structures of the processor operate on something quite different than the instruction the instruction as written in memory. (A decoded form.)<p>2) Reordering is different than pipelining, and CPUs have done both for decades. The difference between the M1 and Intel&#x2F;AMD is that the M1 is wider in spots and can do much more extensive reordering. The M1 can decode and issue 8 instructions at a time. AMD can do 4 or 8 depending on whether the instruction is coming from memory or a special cache for pre-decoded instructions. The M1 has a reorder buffer of over 600 instructions—meaning it can have 600 instructions waiting for completion at a time (e.g. some executing while others are waiting for data to come back from memory). Intel and AMD’s reorder buffers are half the size.<p>3) Special instructions and controlling the software interface has little to do with performance on general purpose code.')
