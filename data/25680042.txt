In the sense of &quot;do I have the full story&quot;, &quot;is there another side to this I am not hearing&quot;, etc. I think its absolutely reasonable.<p>But if you&#x27;re skeptical about whether they completely made it up, published a rumour without any confirmation or are deliberately substantially altering it in how they portray it - that&#x27;s an extremely serious allegation for a reputable news organisation. For example, I think that would stretch beyond &quot;reasonable&quot; in most cases for NYT based on my observation of their practices over time.')
