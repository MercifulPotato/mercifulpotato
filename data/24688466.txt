There is also with the creation of the first high quality diffraction gratings (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Henry_Joseph_Grayson" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Henry_Joseph_Grayson</a> and Rowland at JHU).<p>The Michelson interferometer was incredibly sensitive for its day but required heroic efforts to use: it was deep in a subbasement, floating on a pool of mercury, and was routinely unusable during the day due to horse and carriage deliveries a few buildings over.  My friend who was a physics major at Princeton said they built one in a day for their physics lab (these days, vibration isolation tables and alignable optics are far, far easier).')
