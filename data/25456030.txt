Music is important to a lot of people, particularly at difficult times in their lives, so I often find I can empathise with these moments.<p>I watched Birds of Prey a few days after seeing the finale opera house scene at the end of Season 1 of Umbrella, and I&#x27;m a big fan or Heart but both used Barracuda and I&#x27;m sure I came across it somewhere else recently as well. Oh well, great song.')
