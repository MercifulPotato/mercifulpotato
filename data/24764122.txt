Considering the various other &quot;mini&quot; computers and consoles, including Retro Games&#x27; previous such project, THEC64, the idea here probably isn&#x27;t to revive the platform as a competitor to a modern OS, or even what AmigaOS offers at all, but to create a toy for retro computer&#x2F;retro gaming enthusiasts.')
