Most of the American (which I am not) federal press releases I read about have a maximum $250,000 fine per count.<p>Here is a random press release from justice.gov <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;six-additional-individuals-indicted-antitrust-charges-ongoing-broiler-chicken-investigation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;six-additional-individuals-in...</a><p>&gt;The Sherman Act offense charged carries a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine for individuals.  The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by victims if either amount is greater than $1 million.  The false statements offense charged carries a statutory maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.  The obstruction of justice offense charged carries a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.<p>These fines are on top of the forfeiture so if the person in this article earned $1 million gross, $100k net they would have to repay on a guilty finding $1 million + say $500k in fines = $1.5m when they only &quot;earned&quot; $100k.')
