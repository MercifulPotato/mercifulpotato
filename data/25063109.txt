Create a minimal test case by creating a copy of the code and then deleting large portions of it until you have a dozen or so lines and no dependencies that reproduce it and are all needed to reproduce it.<p>2.5. If using an old version of rustc, `rustup override set nightly` to use a recent nightly on this directory and see if the bug is gone&#x2F;changed. This takes about 30 seconds (compilation is instantaneous since I&#x27;ve already deleted all but a dozen lines of code).<p>3. Search the bug tracker again now that we have a better idea what is going on.<p>4. If there really is nothing, report it.<p>The time savings by bailing out early at 1. greatly exceed the time cost introduced by 2.5.<p>If you&#x27;re using nightly you should be using rustup... but since rustup is so easy to use that&#x27;s a very very low cost.')
