Just out of curiosity, I drove the old bus route I used to take to school.  (It took an hour by bus, ours was the first stop to get on in the morning and the last to get off in the afternoon.  Our old house was on 20 acres, and that&#x27;s about a typical lot size in the area.)<p>Now there&#x27;s expensive houses everywhere.  A lot of the older, more humble houses are still there, but I get the impression they&#x27;re gradually getting replaced and the whole area is gentrifying.  I don&#x27;t know why; we&#x27;re far enough away from big cities to make commuting inconvenient, and there isn&#x27;t any big industry, just farms and vineyards.  Maybe those are more profitable than I thought.  Or maybe people are just moving out of tech hubs and working remote.')
