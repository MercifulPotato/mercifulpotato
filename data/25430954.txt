Specially if VLC for iOS did this would be great.<p>My current flow is copy the video URL, use terminal on my laptop to download the video&#x2F;audio with youtube-dl, open iphone.local in my browser while VLC is open on my phone and upload the file there. This could be simplified a lot specially for playlists.<p>Maybe a more generic question is why aren&#x27;t there more integrations of the form x in y while both are open source and would clearly improve the user experience?')
