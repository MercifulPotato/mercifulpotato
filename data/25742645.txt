The goal of the modelling is to simplify things, makes them less complex then they are in the reality. So model is wrong. QED.<p>So to say &quot;the model is wrong&quot; is to say nothing. No new information transferred. While to say &quot;the model is not valid&quot; is to state that the model doesn&#x27;t deliver it&#x27;s promises. It is a non-null information about the model.<p>I mean, yes, it could be seen as an another way to say &quot;all models are wrong, but some are useful&quot;. But I&#x27;d prefer not to say that, because I see &quot;wrongness&quot; to be a notion inapplicable to a model. It is ok though to apply it nevertheless to make a nice catchphrase.<p><i>&gt; it only has truth within the bounds of it&#x27;s own system, or it would break one of Godel&#x27;s incompletness theorems, right?</i><p>I&#x27;d prefer not to say this either. I&#x27;m not so sure that there is no way to create The Mathematics, which would go beyond arithmetic so Godel theorems would be inapplicable to it. Godel theorems more then just a regular model, they are a model within a model modelling a model about a model. What do they say us about the reality I&#x27;m not sure. How to apply them to the reality without losing validity?')
