Ad fraud is when you have something other than a real user loading or clicking on ads.  For example, I could stand up a headless browser to click on the ads on my site. This would get me more of a payout from my advertisers, but would also be fraud.<p>A stable identifier makes identifying this sort of behavior <i>much</i> easier.<p>(Disclosure: I work on ads at Google, speaking only for myself)')
