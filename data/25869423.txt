It would be very interesting to get a description of what their hardware is actually doing.<p>Considering how StackeOverflow ran on a small handful of machines to a pretty large scale (and still isn&#x27;t excessive), I can&#x27;t see how more than a few machines should be necessary to run a site that serves small texts, even among millions of users.<p>There is one caveat though and that&#x27;s media. If media is transcoded, and&#x2F;or if more than a small fraction of messages contain video - then the service might face using most of its resources towards that. But in that case , if I was running their ops I&#x27;d just disable media  attachments while figuring out how to run the full service.')
