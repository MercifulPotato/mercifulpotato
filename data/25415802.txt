Item(by='rayrag', descendants=None, kids=[25420278], score=None, time=1607945087, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25414389, text='I&#x27;ve searched for &#x27;Lovecraft&#x27; and then opened first 15 results - no book was in library. Then I went to the openlibrary.org and again searched for &#x27;Lovecraft&#x27; and among first 20 results I could only borrow one book for an hour. What is the point of showing books that aren&#x27;t in library, or I am missing something?')
