I&#x27;ve found it easier than expected (once I&#x27;d got Jack set up and happy &#x2F; understood). On Windows &#x2F; MacOS it&#x27;s actually easier as there are are clear, well-trodden install guides (and no Jack &#x2F; low-latency kernels to explain).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vicwomg&#x2F;jamtrip" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vicwomg&#x2F;jamtrip</a>')
