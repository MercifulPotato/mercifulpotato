Incidentally the Phenom 300 uses the G3000 as well.<p>If you can fly a G1000 in a Cirrus piston or Cessna, the G3000 is an easy transition.<p>The avionics and FMS of a typical airliner is positively COBOL by comparison. To get type rated in modern GA jets is pretty easy because the avionics are generally what you are already used to. However, the G1000&#x2F;G3000 aren’t part 25 certified, however there is now a G5000 that is Part 25 legal, so I expect there to be some considerable improvements trickling up into the bigger jets. (Part 25 is basically “transport category” aircraft.)')
