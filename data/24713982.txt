If you mean trying to find the right keywords while driving a vehicle at 65 mph, no thanks. I&#x27;m a native english speaker with a california accent and none of the systems I&#x27;ve used have been much help.<p>It&#x27;s like playing an old text adventure without the manual, so you don&#x27;t know the verbs.
