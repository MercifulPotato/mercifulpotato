But, you see, this is an anecdotal proof (like the whole article, anyway).<p>Learning infra is not the case all the time. Some companies choose AWS (or any other) for speed.<p>We can, again, argue but the argument is my PoV vs yours, or any other new commenter. Although I know how to maintain small infra: bunch of vms, reverse proxy and an rdbms, I&#x27;m not really into hosting HA Rabbitmq or Postgres myself. There is a ton of problems and configuration options coming from replication and consistency I would rather pay premium to people who have done it in the past.<p>I want my team to build solutions solving customers problems instead of fixing bugs in our replication code. It&#x27;s all about perspective, I guess we can&#x27;t reach a definitive answer for one or the other.')
