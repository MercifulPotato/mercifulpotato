Doing that sort of thing would require a bunch of infrastructure that I don&#x27;t own. Instead, I pay monthly to have both electricity and water available on demand, and the cost is based on how much I use. Long-term storage like that also would introduce additional problems, like the passive discharge of batteries or the need to store water in special containers that won&#x27;t leach chemicals into it and won&#x27;t allow the growth of naturally occurring algae.<p>For water I could certainly buy a bunch of bottled water and keep it in the kitchen, but how am I going to run that through my faucets to wash my hands or run it through my showerhead? You can certainly do all that - and people in areas with limited access to tap water have to - but it&#x27;s not something the average person is going to do.<p>Where your tap water comes from is also a factor here. When I lived in a rural area growing up, our water was well water - there was literally no way for us to stock up a month worth of that in advance, because we relied on the natural return of water into the soil to ensure we had a supply to draw from in the well. Things like desalination also have limited throughput, so if you max that out the only way to get more water is to take it from someone else.')
