Doctor gave me 2x Mitformin and other meds and said I should probably start insulin within 6months.<p>I never took the meds they gave me. I started a keto diet righ away and  never looked back. Now my tests have been all showing I&#x27;m in pre-diabetes range.<p>I eat healthy and walk everyday. I don&#x27;t miss sugar anymore and I do have fast food once in a while.<p>What I eat:\n - Chicken, fish and some meat\n - eggs, salad, cheese, milk, tea, coffee\n - sugar free biscuits and sometimes sugar free Ice Cream\n - a lot of water\n - vegetables, and a special bread, no rice<p>I also found out that my insulin get released during lunch and later dinner, but not much during breakfast or after lunch. So I time how much I eat accordingly.<p>The nurse didn&#x27;t believe her eyes when she saw my results and asked me about what diet I used.<p>I did prick my finger a LOT in the first 3 months but it was worth it, as I now know exactly what to eat and what to avoid.<p>I used a forum extensively (UK oriented) to follow my diet  [1]. Hope this helps.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diabetes.co.uk&#x2F;forum&#x2F;#diabetes-discussion.12" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.diabetes.co.uk&#x2F;forum&#x2F;#diabetes-discussion.12</a><p>Edit: above is not a medical advice nor should you follow it to beat diabetes, it&#x27;s only my personal experience.')
