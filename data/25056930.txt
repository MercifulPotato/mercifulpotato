It took me a while to wrap my head around it, but my code has improved so much once I did. Very small classes that each do one easy to understand thing. All the structure stuff is in one part of the code, ready to be understood and modified, instead of scattered across tens of modules. Most of the time all I need for a new feature is a class that implements a specific interface, announces to the world what it needs to do its job by declaring its dependencies in the constructor (as intended by the language and OOP in general) and then only implements its core logic instead of meddling with creation and disposal that has nothing to do with its actual job.')
