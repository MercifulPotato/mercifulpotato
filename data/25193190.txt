The authors occupation is relevant because it can help you determine the perspective from which the article is written.  A tort lawyer is interested in the culpability for a wrong.  And in the case of someone being injured by chemicals, they&#x27;d want to establish that the substance was harmful.  Certainly, if the byproduct of battery fires was bubblegum and gumdrops, training might not be as important.  The point of the sentence you&#x27;re referring to is to establish that this is not the case, and therefore, the situation merits training.')
