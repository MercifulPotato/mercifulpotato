Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=[25660099], score=None, time=1609926862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25655218, text='&gt; This fascinates me, as I have wondered how some sellers on Amazon (or eBay but no thanks) become so large just by reselling other people&#x27;s things on Amazon -- at the same time Amazon is the one who really wants to be that middle man.<p>All the evidence I see indicates Amazon does not want to be this middle man.  Amazon wants to be the payment and platform middleman, that’s where all the profits lie due to infinite scale-ability and near zero marginal costs.  They removed the ability to let you filter search results for items sold by Anazon.com years ago.<p>Amazon does not want to be in the 2% profit margin retail business where they are liable for inventory risk and other liabilities like product safety, etc.<p>They want to be like Visa and take a cut of each transaction.  I would too, considering Visa’s profit margins versus Walmart’s.')
