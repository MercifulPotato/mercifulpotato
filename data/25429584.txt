Whether wristwatch, pocket watch, wall clock or alarm clock. Even large church clocks fascinated him immensely. It was the artistry of the mechanics that made his heart beat faster.<p>I could not understand this for a long time. Could not understand why one spends several thousand euros on watchmaking seminars to learn the craft as a hobby.<p>At some point I learned that as a child he wanted to become a watchmaker, but this did not work out and so he had to take another profession (which he nevertheless loved very much). Only late he has fulfilled his childhood dream.<p>And actually, it is only today, after he has passed away and I have occupied myself with the watches he had collected in the course of his life, that I can really begin to appreciate the little bits of knowledge he gave me every now and then.<p>Today, I wear few watches myself. They are the ones that were especially precious to him. And I appreciate them very much. Both in their external and mechanical aesthetics.')
