Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610430955, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25741636, text='&gt; If you must hide your nakedness with logos, then it may be better to stick with ones that can be construed as relatively politically neutral fashion statements (e.g. sports teams).<p>You can actually get some idea of politics from what sports a person likes. I realized this might be the case when I turned on the TV a month ago and found that the program I had wanted to watch had been preempted for the 2020 MLS Cup final game.<p>I watched that for a while. The game was played in Columbus, Ohio, in front of a live reduce capacity audience. There were 1500 fans allowed in the stadium, and the coverage included quite a few crowd shots. I didn&#x27;t see anybody without a mask. That led me to wonder if I was looking at a left-leaning crowd, since left-leaning crowds seem much better at wearing masks than right-learning crowds.<p>A bit of Googling then turned up this interesting article: &quot;Which Sport Has Most Politically Liberal Fans?&quot; [1]. According to it, MLS fans do skew significantly left.<p>Farthest left is WNBA, which is <i>way</i> left. Next is NBA, Women&#x27;s tennis, European soccer, pro wrestling, then at about the same place MLS, extreme sports, and Men&#x27;s tennis.<p>Farthest right, about as far right as Women&#x27;s tennis is left, is PGA, then college football and NASCAR, then LPGA, NHL, drag racing, then pro rodeo.<p>Near the center includes college basketball, MLB, NFL, horse racing, monster trucks, and the Olympics.<p>Some of those I found surprising. I would have guessed pro wrestling to be on the right, not the left, and monster trucks to be right, not center.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thepostgame.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;dish&#x2F;201303&#x2F;how-politics-correlate-sports-interests" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thepostgame.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;dish&#x2F;201303&#x2F;how-politics-co...</a>')
