That keyboard has a similar shape to the Kinesis keyboard I got a while ago. Could never really get into it though. It was nice for typing with two hands once I got familiar with it, but I think it made one-hand typing too difficult and there were actually a number of times where I&#x27;d have one hand on the mouse and the other on the keyboard and just need to do minimal typing. I should give that keyboard another shot though.<p>Which key switches the layer&#x2F;function of the keys? I think something like that is possible with the keyboard I have as well but I haven&#x27;t explored it at all')
