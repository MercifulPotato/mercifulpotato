I realize that sucks if you need an income, but if you write open-source software, <i>that is what you are supporting.</i> (And I say that as an open source dev.)<p>When you license a piece of code under the GPL, you are saying &quot;people who write opensource code should not have to put effort into remaking this.&quot; When you license a piece of code under BSD, you are saying &quot;<i>Nobody</i> should have to put <i>either</i> effort or money into remaking this.&quot; Like it or not, that&#x27;s what the license means.<p>ยน Yes yes, distribution fee, I know. And you know damn well that&#x27;s not a workable commercialization strategy.')
