Not only people around the world carry a device with a mic and a gps tracker, they voluntarily and with enthusiasm report all their whereabouts. They in fact compete with each other about who can provide a better and more detailed timeline of their life. This is better than if everyone had a gps chip implanted in them. If anything, the US will be super careful to not disrupt Google and Facebook too much.')
