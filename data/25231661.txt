I also don&#x27;t know of any dairies there specifically; I&#x27;m sure there were some once but that would have been before my time!<p>I moved my company into the Landings complex (just off Rengstorff) in the early 90s (SETI was also there!).  SGI and then Alza built their HQs on what was a bean field a few years later.  Building 42 is where the old SGI complex was; the only remaining SGI building that still looks something like its original form is the Computer History Museum.<p>Yep, a lot of the valley land is contaminated thanks to semiconductor production and military use.  (in the case of the wheat field next to Intel -- I remember thinking &quot;I hope I never eat something made with <i>that</i> wheat!&quot;  That particular map won&#x27;t display in my browser but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Ames&#x2F;Moffet leachate perfused the area, including where the googolplex is now.  I worked at Ames for a while when it was a military base and the disposition of chemicals in those days was pretty scary.  Where the OSH is now (previously, and briefly Sun Headquarters) was the FMC plant making the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and their chem waste could have leaked across 101 and contaminated that area as well.<p>When I worked in (the city of) Santa Clara about 10 years ago I worried about the water supply because of all the former semiconductor plants.  Luckily the city had a map showing the water system.  The residential areas were on Hetch Hetchy water but the industrial areas were on well water.  Scary!  That was the only time I was willing to pay for bottled water.')
