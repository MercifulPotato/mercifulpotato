Countries like the UK and France are still riding what&#x27;s left of centuries of influence and prestige on world affairs, but the last 7 decades quite clearly show that single countries can&#x27;t defend themselves and their democracies from foreign interests without cooperation. It&#x27;s also quite clear to me that the European economy is so integrated that&#x27;s almost ridiculous to think that every country could be free to do as it pleases, because if for instance Italy fails, then all of Europe fails.<p>That&#x27;s why I think we need more integration; to me, the freedom and security of European citizens is synonymous with European cooperation and integration. Together, we&#x27;ve one of the biggest armies and economies of the world, and we stand a chance to mean something on the world stage. This doesn&#x27;t mean that the current EU is necessarily the right way to achieve this; ironically, I think most of its issues arise from the fact it is not powerful enough, and single states have too much sway in how the union operates, similar to how the USA were when the first Articles of Confederation were written in the XVIII century.')
