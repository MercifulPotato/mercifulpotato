There are many repos on github that are just somebody&#x27;s pet project they did for fun or because it filled a need for them, and they aren&#x27;t inviting criticism because they just shared code in case anyone else could use it or learn something from it.<p>However, <i>many</i> FOSS projects are very much like the band analogy above in that they aren&#x27;t content to upload videos of their jam session to youtube but actively seek to attract an audience. They make project announcements on places like HN, they show up in forums and tell people how <i>blazing fast</i> their project is and it&#x27;s a good fit for someone&#x27;s use case, they have fancy websites, etc. They ask for your attention, and in so doing invite criticism.')
