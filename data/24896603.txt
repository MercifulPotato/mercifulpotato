The Island ECN, later absorbed into NASDAQ&#x27;s ECN, originally ran its matching engine as one of these low-latency Java processes, writing everything using explicit object pools to avoid doing any GC on the critical path, as this was long before Zing was around.<p>This was a pretty reasonable choice at the time, as this was long before C++11 was around, and Java just offered a lot of advantages for developer ergonomics.<p>A natural consequence of this is that a number of HFT shops that were seeded by ex-ISLD devs just fell into using something like the ISLD tech stack, which at least at first involved a lot of GC-free Java.')
