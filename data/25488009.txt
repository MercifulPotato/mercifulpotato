I&#x27;m probably going to spend about the same time (and money) watching video somewhat independently of the quality of content available (within reason). Preferences may shift over time--I spend more time reading things online relative to reading books than I did 20 years ago. But broadly, more or better entertainment options won&#x27;t really shift my total time and money budget.')
