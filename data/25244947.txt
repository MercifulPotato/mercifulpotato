If you pick a suitable f, many useful properties of the mean are respected.<p>(2) In general, for an arbitrary choice of f the resulting mean won&#x27;t be homogenous, which is disqualifying for most practical applications (because, for example, the mean would not be guaranteed to have the same dimensions as the elements). Restricting ourselves to functions in the form $f(x) = x^a$ for $a \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus 0$ yields a well-behaved collection of means (Holder means), guaranteed to be homogenous.\nAs a bonus, for any set $S$ of positive real numbers, if we let $GM(S)$ be the geometric mean of $S$ and $M_{a}(S)$ be the mean of $S$ for some $a$, you can prove that $\\lim_{a \\rightarrow 0} M_{a}(S) = GM(S)$.')
