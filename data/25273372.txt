I will forget my friend&#x27;s birthdays, their kids names, their wife&#x27;s names, things they&#x27;ve talked about recently, etc, etc. I have a terrible memory for this stuff. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me being stubborn, but all of these things just feel very slippery to my mind. On the other end, I will remember in vibrant detail very trivial facts that have no real function for me. Does that mean I care about trivial facts more than my friends? I hope not.<p>I think of it like this. I don&#x27;t pay attention to lyrics in most music, I pay attention to the feel&#x2F;tune. With friends, it&#x27;s all about emotional connection, not my ability to recall facts. I honestly don&#x27;t think one or the other is better or worse, it&#x27;s just different. People show care differently.<p>For me, who has trouble with things that people often associate with caring (like yourself maybe), this acts as a crutch to help me show caring in a way that other people recognize but that isn&#x27;t natural to me. I would actually argue that me investing into a program like this actually shows just <i>how much</i> I care that I want to make up for my natural capability with a pretty involved program.<p>Another side benefit, it&#x27;s also really nice for acquaintances that you really want to keep up with, but because of irregular correspondence they are very easy to slip from memory.')
