Sharrows are often to the left of where people seem to think cyclists should ride.<p>It can be a bad thing, if cyclists and drivers take it to mean that&#x27;s the only acceptable position. Depending on conditions and where the cyclist is headed, they may need to ride on either side of the sharrow, and it&#x27;s presence may be limiting (like bike lanes can be).<p>Sharrows at intersections can be pretty useful to indicate the position of traffic detectors that are tuned for bicycles. It&#x27;s usually possible to notice the patterns of pavement cuts for the loop sensors, but a little paint to highlight it is nice.')
