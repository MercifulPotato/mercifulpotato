That&#x27;s going to draw all the hype, especially when Apple announces the Arm v9-based M2 next year.<p>And then I&#x27;m sure most sheep-like OEMs will say &quot;Oh, we want THAT, too. Where is it - we want it yesterday!&quot; But AMD won&#x27;t be able to provide one too soon, because they would&#x27;ve gone all in on Arm v8, and they&#x27;d want to squeeze at least a couple of generations out of that microarchitecture.<p>Something similar happened when Apple announced the first Armv8 processor and it took Qualcomm and all the rest 2 years to catch-up.')
