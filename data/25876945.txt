But in our case, a key interaction was on Facebook. So we pretended to be doing market research on social media and brought a lot of people in for user tests. Eventually we&#x27;d have them log in to Facebook on our test computer, asking them what they though of various posts.<p>What they didn&#x27;t know was that we used Greasemonkey to alter the Facebook page, inserting fake feed items using their real friends.
