When I look at iOS users on Safari, or Chrome, I feel like I&#x27;m using Windows 3.1.<p>Here&#x27;s what I do on FF:<p>- When visiting a site, on the hamburger menu, there is a &quot;add to main sites&quot; icon, which adds the site to the home screen of Firefox.<p>- In the global prefs, I changed back to always displaying the location bar at the top, and always present (the scrolling was annoying me).<p>- We can long-press the tab icon, to open a new tab.<p>So if I&#x27;m on a site, and want to open HN:<p>- Long press &quot;New Tab&quot;<p>- Tap &quot;HN&quot; icon on the screen.<p>It&#x27;s still annoying that it opens the keyboard by default.
