This one took very specific pens. I was writing a fortran printer driver for it, I had reasons to use it but the overall sense was &quot;stop wasting ink&quot;<p>When the wet process laser came along, we got a lot of love using it at first, but then it went to the same place. it was a continuous roll feed (bit like a fax in some ways) and consumed some kind of chemical. I can relate to them rationing it. (it also had NROFF&#x2F;TBL cut marks to show where to slice it to make the effective page size)<p>The colour printers they got on trial from textronix we got to keep the demo sheets doing various DECUS tape 3D graphic drawings, but it was way too expensive to buy. I have no idea who bought those things then. probably big physics, not compsci schools.<p>The giant LPT up front which took 132 column papper? go for your life, but you had to be in the freemasons to break the feed sheet, and if you printed the &#x27;Star Trek&#x27; overhit ascii art you were banned for months. (it burned through the ribbon)<p>Ops duty cycle included walking out front, breaking the feed, tearing various peoples printouts into discrete chunks, putting it into the pigeon hole.<p>Those stories about accidental form-feed shooting paper ribbons across the room? They are true.')
