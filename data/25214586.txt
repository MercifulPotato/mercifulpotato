Those people usually have valid credentials, e.g. when they are the people that developed the first PCR test for the new Coronavirus. I trust such people much more than random people on the street (or on the internet).<p>&gt; The people you&#x27;re disagreeing with also disagree about this. I&#x27;ve read a lot of epidemiology papers this year.<p>Forgive me if I don&#x27;t find it terribly convincing that someone over the internet is trying to sell me something like this. Many fields of study are really hard to understand without a lot of context. There might be implicit things you might not be aware of. The internet is full of people who think they have found &quot;flaws&quot; in mathematical proofs or have discovered why FLT is true.<p>But you&#x27;re also claiming that all the &quot;experts&quot; and all the relevant papers are from epidemiology whereas we also have a lot of contributions from other fields, such as virology or vaccinology.')
