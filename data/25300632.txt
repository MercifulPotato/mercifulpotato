You don&#x27;t need to quote Wikipedia at me ;)<p>Rosetta absolutely is an emulator, which has traditionally referred to taking code from one CPU architecture and making it run on another (in contrast with taking a binary of the same architecture but running it in another environment, which is often called a &quot;compatibility layer&quot; or in Apple&#x27;s terms a &quot;simulator&quot;, or the hardware-assisted version of this which is virtualization). There are many ways to write the part of an emulator that mimics another CPU; the simplest is an interpreter loop, but there&#x27;s ahead-of-time and just-in-time code generation techniques as well. Dynamic binary translation is quite simple, as your quote mentions; Rosetta 2 instead achieves its performance through a combination of static binary translation to a form amenable to its runtime. Things that it cannot translate go through a fairly advanced optimizing JIT that goes way beyond what a dynarec would typically do.')
