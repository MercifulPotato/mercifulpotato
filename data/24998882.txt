Item(by='SpicyLemonZest', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604589057, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998468, text='&gt; There’s no doubt that we’re further along that curve: The United States hardly feels like a confident empire on the rise these days.<p>I always hate to just swipe random lines from an article to dispute them, but this seems pretty core to the article&#x27;s thesis and I just don&#x27;t agree it&#x27;s true. The article&#x27;s comparison point is the Spanish Flu and its aftermath, but people at the time did not believe that everything was going well - the steel industry shut down for months in 1919, terrorists bombed Wall Street killing 30 in 1920, and Harding took office in 1921 off the strength of his promise of a return to normalcy.')
