As it soley focuses on a single racial profile and has created such an air of protests that lead to anything from property destruction to death. Which produces such an odd fixation against anyone else, and even at times of those of African decent.<p>There are large issues to be discussed with regards to BLM and its role. Ultimately however, there do exist &quot;extremes&quot; of all flavours. And those extremes can easily be against any form of race by any form of race.<p>My two cents are that there is a larger issue in societal class structure, and it is incredibly easy to sweep that aside and play it off as a racial issue.')
