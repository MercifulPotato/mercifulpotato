Activist hackers are everywhere today and have no qualms attacking Parler or others they disagree with. Culturally, many in the younger generation of hackers are anti free speech, or at least against it for their political adversaries. Twitter still hasn’t banned the one archiving locations of Parler users from EXIF data in photos. And with utilities like AWS deplatforming paying customers now, I imagine Cloudflare can’t be relied on either.')
