Even in this framing of &quot;consequential&quot;, one can argue about the narrow range of consequences on offer by Democrats and Republicans, and the broad potential consequences of social movements, but I tend to agree with you.<p>However, Chomsky&#x27;s argument is that this &quot;perfect experiment&quot; of history, Watergate vs. COINTELPRO, reveals that &quot;on the question of principles&quot;, Watergate shows that the press &quot;think[s] that powerful people ought to be able to defend themselves&quot;, whereas &quot;one tiny part of the COINTELPRO program was itself far more significant in terms of principle than all of Watergate, and if you look at the whole program, it&#x27;s not even a discussion&quot;.<p>This is to help dispel the notion that the press are adversarial, truth-seekers, thumbing their nose at authority. And the purpose of this argument isn&#x27;t just to deflate the pompous self-esteem of the press, but also helps explain the press&#x27; _lack_ of adversarial, truth-seeking reporting on other matters of _extreme_ consequence, such as the Vietnam War and the first Gulf War, NAFTA, etc.')
