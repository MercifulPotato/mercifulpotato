As others mentioned, TBP was written in Chinese by a Chinese author. I imagine most people here read the translation, as did I. After just a few pages it becomes immediately clear that you’re reading a work written from the perspective of a different culture. This gave it a genuine ring to me, and once I adjusted my perspective I really enjoyed it. The storytelling, historical setting, and assumed knowledge of world history all reinforce this. It would not have been possible to translate this book and turn it into something that appears to have been written by a western writer. I’m happy the translator didn’t even try and went for authentic instead.<p>Edit: be more concise')
