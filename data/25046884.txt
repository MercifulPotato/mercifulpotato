Not only does Josh divulge information that most founders are legally forbidden from ever revealing, he also was always extremely open about the journey of the business, even facilitating the [Open Startups](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baremetrics.com&#x2F;open-startups" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baremetrics.com&#x2F;open-startups</a>) page, where Baremetrics itself is listed.<p>What surprises me most is the lack of understanding of founder risk. Most negative comments are related to employees not walking away from this exit. It feels to me that many here seem to conflate the inner workings of heavily VC-backed businesses with a slowly and sustainably growing company like Baremetrics. I see a lot of assumptions all over the comments.<p>I appreciate the discussion, though. It&#x27;s nice to see people sticking up for employees. But a sub-10-people SaaS that&#x27;s ALMOST self-funded is not the same as a prospective unicorn.')
