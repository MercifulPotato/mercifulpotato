The reason I got into physics was because it felt fulfilling and my opinion of industry was shaped by a high-school internship at a defense contractor which was a total slog.<p>During my PhD, I got the full experience, drumming up new ideas, grant&#x2F;proposal writing, managing and setting project goals, maintaining collaborations and doing the actual work. It was fulfilling and fun especially working with great group of people that are 100% dedicated but, boy, was really, really hard.<p>The long hours, terrible pay, and watching people stuck in the post-doc treadmill got to me. Plus, I saw quite a few 2-body problems fall apart (mine included). I also watched my advisor go through the tenure process, it seemed like he never slept.<p>It&#x27;s been challenging getting into industry (I&#x27;m still looking :) ), but, if I make it, I&#x27;ll write a blog post to see if there are any regrets in 5 years. But, like the author, I&#x27;m already missing the culture, going to seminars (the terrible seminar coffee), and nerding out with friends in other disciplines.')
