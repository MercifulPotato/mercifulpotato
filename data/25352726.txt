The facilities are all designed to unload, sort, and load parcels as efficiently as possible.<p>Oftentimes the lines run in alternating inbound &#x2F; outbound directions. The same conveyor belt that carries packages from an inbound regional trailer to a local delivery vehicle at 4am, might run in reverse at 8pm to carry local business pickups to the outbound regional trailer at 8pm.<p>If the packages from one flow can&#x27;t clear the lines, the system could grind to a halt.<p>I worked at UPS during an unprecedented winter storm in the Pacific Northwest during the holiday season, and the only way to store packages in the system was inside the limited number of spare trailers that could be parked at the facility.')
