Especially if you are hanging it up in a bright, sunlit room, it is a world of difference from LCD. In fact, the sunnier it is, the better your e-Ink displays look, while the worse your LCD displays will look.<p>Also, e-Ink displays don&#x27;t emit light so they are extremely pleasing to the eye, and don&#x27;t light up your bedroom at night, if you want it in your bedroom. They also can maintain an image with zero power, which is great if you&#x27;re conscious about energy usage.<p>The 2300 euro price of this display is a bit beyond my personal budget for projects, but if you&#x27;re happy with 13.3 inches you can try this Waveshare display:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waveshare.com&#x2F;13.3inch-e-paper-hat.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waveshare.com&#x2F;13.3inch-e-paper-hat.htm</a><p>Or this 10 inch version for less than half the price of the 13.3 inch one, which I have:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waveshare.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;displays&#x2F;e-paper&#x2F;epaper-1&#x2F;10.3inch-e-paper-hat.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.waveshare.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;displays&#x2F;e-paper&#x2F;epaper-1&#x2F;...</a><p>If you want a clean construction with all the electronics in one piece, another option you might consider is to hunt for used, 13.3 inch older Boox tablets, which run Android, and just write an Android app for them to do whatever you want them to do.')
