Even without the referral I&#x27;m sure you can get a test like this privately for reasonable price.<p>These medications are serious and side effects can include thoughts of suicide so I&#x27;m always shocked when doctors try to wing it and just prescribe whatever and see how it goes. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t know about the genetic tests yet but some are likely willfully ignorant.')
