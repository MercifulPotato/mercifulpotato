It’s difficult to change it, and you see it even persist in popular culture with the likes of Tim Ferriss glorifying this culture with books like “The four hour work week” asking people to outsource the trivial stuff to countries like India. Accuse them of it and they will evasively mollify the situation by talking about the rich culture(while thinking derisive thoughts about the ever-growing population) and yoga&#x2F;meditation(while mentally smirking about how insignificant a contribution it is compared to their own). Nothing will change until we change fundamentally in our approach to viewing people.')
