It&#x27;s luckily rare-ish to actually happen nowadays, and expectations have become stricter, but many vendors do have policies that state that some amount of pixel defects are tolerable, this is not out of the ordinary. Although they do typically distinguish between pixels that stay lit and pixels that are dead, the former being more annoying and thus less acceptable.
