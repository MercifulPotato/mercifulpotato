If you are working in a mission-critical space where every bit of static analysis saves hours or days of testing, then yeah, the more static analysis the better. If you’re building web systems software (things like Kubernetes) or even ordinary application software, then you get benefit from a little static analysis, but returns quickly diminish beyond a certain point. I think Go hits the sweet spot and Rust is generally excessive (development is slowed down much more than necessary). Swift might also hit that same sweet spot; I haven’t used it much. I have heard that it has some maturing to do before it’s ready for more than Apple GUI apps, but that might be dated information.')
