Of all the metaprogramming choices, the preprocessor (C or erlang) is the worst, since it operates on lexical forms, and is sort of its own DSL.  Not only do you have to learn two languages for the benefit of one, but you&#x27;re gonna have bugs and it&#x27;s much harder to automated tools to do code analysis.<p>You could have lispish ast transforms (rust, julia, elixir)\nYou could have comptime (zig, elixir)<p>both of these are far nicer than preprocessor.')
