Item(by='stolee', descendants=None, kids=[25465576, 25459074], score=None, time=1608231768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25458943, text='If I have a 100-line file and on &#x27;main&#x27; it changes near the top, but in my &#x27;topic&#x27; branch it changes near the bottom, then I can cherry-pick &#x27;topic&#x27; onto &#x27;main&#x27; and Git will resolve the diff correctly. The resulting diff or patch would only change in the line numbers for the context of the diff.<p>This is of course a very simple example. You might hit a conflict in your &quot;git cherry-pick&quot; command which gives you an opportunity to resolve the unexpected diff issue in an appropriate way, which ends up with a different diff than before.')
