One common problem I encounter is that after a page loads I might want to search for something in the search box. I&#x27;ll click it and start typing ... then at some point the <i>rest</i> of the page has loaded including the stupid key bindings which do various random actions on different keystrokes. I don&#x27;t know why they have this, it&#x27;s infuriating.<p>Oh and they keep updating the UI which involves shuffling things around and <i>every</i> new version is slower than the last. If you&#x27;re running on-prem you at least get to decide when to update and notify everyone accordingly. We&#x27;d just find out one day that everything has been moved around and learn the new locations of different features.<p>Sorry I&#x27;m really just generally ranting about Jira now but honestly I find it so infuriating to use. Confluence as well, how did they manage to make wikis suck so bad?')
