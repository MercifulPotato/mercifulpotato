No way does it ever happen.  Old people aren&#x27;t going to trade a $1500 a month average SS payout plus Medicare for a $1000 a month UBI plus a single payer system with longer wait times.  Single moms on welfare aren&#x27;t going to trade their various benefits (housing, food stamps, transportation, cell phone, Medicaid etc. for both her and the children) for a $1000&#x2F;mo. UBI plus single payer healthcare (most UBI programs I&#x27;ve seen have reduced or no payouts for children).')
