A couple of holes in the lid, some creative testing for holes in the cloth (made it a tube that is cut to the height of the bucket) and presto... industrial strength humidifier for about $25 with 3 gallon capacity.<p>I am never going to buy another commercial humidifier ever again. I will tweak this design until it&#x27;s perfect.')
