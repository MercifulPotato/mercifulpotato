It’s more aptly described as a search engine frontend. They do handle features like bangs and instant answers internally, but their actual search results come from third-parties like Bing. They don’t operate a crawler for their search results, and are not independent.<p>I didn&#x27;t know this. I tried to use DDG for a while after I switched to Brave, but the results were just not very good and completely missing results I was looking for at times. This would explain it if it was coming from Bing.')
