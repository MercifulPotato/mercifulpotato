I had given a few examples of quite successful long-running permaculture &#x2F; regenerative agriculture  operations here - people like Gabe Brown (Brown&#x27;s Ranch, ND, US, ~5000 acres), Richard Perkins (Ridgedale Permaculture, Varmland, Sweden, 25 hectares?), Geoff Lawton (NSW, AU, well-known permaculture pioneer, 66 hectares&#x2F;acres - countries consult him, even):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24827234" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24827234</a><p>Most of them have YouTube channels with a number of videos each, so you can see that they are actually walking (or plowing or no-tilling :) the talk. They also do invited talks and run internships. Gabe, Richard, Geoff and many others also use conventional or adapted machines (traditional heavy machinery or lower-cost appropriate technology), too, so it can be a hybrid what-makes-sense-as-well-as-is-sustainable approach; it is not a totally back-to-nature hippie kind of thing. In fact all those I mentioned are highly educated (whether college- or self-taught), and well aware of critical modern scientific discoveries and development in ag-related sciences (plural) and use them as appropriate in their operations. One big such example is Elaine Ingham&#x27;s work (a Ph.D. soil biology scientist, founder of Soil Food Web, Inc.), which I also commented on in the same thread as the one I linked to above (it is very significant, and they all quote her and apply her results):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24828524" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24828524</a><p>There are many more, doing their thing successfully and quietly, although there  certainly are talks, books, videos, conferences, associations, courses, etc.<p>And some of them claim that their approach is  lower effort and &#x2F; or lower cost than so-called &quot;conventional&quot; farming. In fact, Gabe says that it is their approach (permaculture &#x2F; regen ag) which is closer to &quot;conventional&quot;, since it mimics nature, as much as feasible, and nature has been at it for millenia before we even walked the earth. And in a holistic sense, it is actually more efficient.<p>Edited for typos.')
