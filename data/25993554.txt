I miss taking Adderall daily but the effect from coffee is almost the same. I don&#x27;t drink it that often mostly because I don&#x27;t want a tolerance. Drinking coffee on my less busy mornings just leads me to getting dragged into some low priority task and spending all morning on it when I could be working other things. Sometimes I&#x27;ll just grab a 300mg energy drink at the store or take a couple Excedrin on an empty stomach if that&#x27;s all I got.')
