Item(by='emilst', descendants=4, kids=[24968963, 24969197], score=2, time=1604329381, title='Launched on HN and PH and the results are surprising', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi everyone!<p>We are making IoT devices for car owners which provide tracking, diagnostics, maintenance and enhanced security features.<p>Ultimately, the goal is to save money, time and trouble for our customers.<p>This is our website: www.cargenta.com<p>We launched about a month ago on Hacker News and Product Hunt and it didn’t go at all as expected. We did not ask for any upvotes in advance, just wanted to see the spontaneous people reaction. Here are the results:<p>- Hacker News: 6 upvotes and 0 comments<p>- Product Hunt: 1 upvote and 0 comments<p>- Website hits: 40 direct and 4 from Product Hunt<p>When we present the product to friends, occasional acquaintances and even to other founders on the group sessions in SUS, most are excited about it. Some people already asked to buy one.<p>But…on the internet the things look quite different. So, need your advice, what are we doing wrong?<p>Are people uncomfortable to tell us in person the product is useless or we cannot clearly transmit the value to the users on the internet? Are the posts headlines not catchy enough or maybe people just don’t care that much about the problem we are trying to solve? Are the upvotes for other products on HN and PH real or people just reach out to their entire network asking for upvotes (some do admit doing so). Do people on PH and HN even have their own cars?<p>What do you think from your standpoint? Constructive feedback is most welcome!<p>HN Post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24656165<p>PH Post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;cargenta-brain<p>Thank you!')
