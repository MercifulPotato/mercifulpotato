If your email address was ever in a contacts list uploaded to them, they have a handle on you. They are tracking you on every website (apart maybe from this one) and have constructed a shadow profile for you.<p>It&#x27;s the same problem with Google, you can try to avoid them but if anyone you know has a GMail address, you&#x27;re in their system and they couldn&#x27;t care less about your consent.')
