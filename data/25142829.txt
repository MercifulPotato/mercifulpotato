They had to take my first born twin in the next room while the second was coming, and I was so angry and mad, I barely contained myself and stayed bedside with my suffering wife. To this day I&#x27;m still so angry about this, and I beat myself I wasn&#x27;t more of an advocate for my first-born girl...<p>And then when they wanted to take one or the other away for exams, and I wouldn&#x27;t leave them alone for a second. No fucking way. Yeah no, you&#x27;re not taking them away to the nursery, I&#x27;ll watch and console my girls while my wife gets some sleep.<p>I know it&#x27;ll seem strange but there&#x27;s probably only 2 people in the world I&#x27;d leave my girls alone at home with, even though they&#x27;re 4 now. And none of them are our parents. Some friendly neighbors for acute emergencies, maybe, but the list is short.<p>And boy, having twins is a sure way to get attention, especially from nosy old people, that will put their face so close to the kids&#x27; or will remove the fucking stroller covers to see the baby&#x27;s face (WTF!) and be angry when you say &#x27;please don&#x27;t&#x27;... I was humouring the old ladies, but my wife was dragon-like.')
