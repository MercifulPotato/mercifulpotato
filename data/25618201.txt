I feel like a lot of these companies will continue having problems mostly because the people that are attracted to smaller&#x2F;early-early companies are the same kinds of people that don&#x27;t want to work in structured (more corporate&#x2F;deliberate) environments.<p>My experience is a bit more on the agency side where technical debt is caused by developers&#x2F;project managers not really caring about the longevity of an application. The idea of going back and fixing anything that isn&#x27;t specifically called out and invoiced for is so far away from the priorities of these businesses.')
