They basically triple the number of LED &quot;filaments&quot; you&#x27;d find in a similarly-rated bulb, allowing them to run everything well below &quot;max&quot; spec, reducing heat (increasing longevity) and allowing the LEDs to operate at a much more efficient point (less lumens per individual LED, but drastically lower consumption).')
