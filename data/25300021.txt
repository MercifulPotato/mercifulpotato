When I used it I thought it was <i>fine</i> but not great. The keyboard was usable but didn&#x27;t feel especially great. Not up there with the likes of a ThinkPad, HP or even the new MacBook keyboards.<p>The thing that puts me off buying them is that they get quite expensive when you start speccing them up but the quality does not match the $1500+ price tag. On the plus side you can save money doing some after purchase upgrades but that doesn&#x27;t address the overall build quality issues.')
