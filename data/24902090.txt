Doesn&#x27;t seem to be a large disadvantage.<p>- We&#x27;ve proven that we change faster culturally than biologically. If this weren&#x27;t true most Americans still wouldn&#x27;t be okay with gay people, black people, or pot. Beliefs seem more related to local tribalism than to age. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of older and younger people radically shift (for good or bad) their positions based on who they consider arbiters of truth.<p>- We&#x27;ve heard this finite resource in the past. It has been solved many times. Fertilizer was the most recent one if you want to go back to 19th century history. We have hydroponics, aeroponics, etc on the way. We can also go into space.<p>- Every first world country has a population growth below 1 (and are decreasing). The average EU is 0.15% and the US is at 0.5%[0]. There&#x27;s no sign of it turning around and I imagine immortality would just accelerate this. (People will still kill themselves btw. Accidents will still happen. Bad health. Etc)<p>- IDK about you, but I&#x27;m fine waiting till I&#x27;m 100 to have kids if I can live forever. Maybe even 200. I&#x27;m unsure, all I know is that if we make such a change that we&#x27;ll completely reconsider things like adulthood and what we do with our life (how long does it take to live off of passive income?). It will be a radical change no matter what, but also one that seems inevitable. If your argument is that it is going to be bumpy, well if history has taught us anything it is that we don&#x27;t confront problems until they are problems, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll become any less bumpy. But hey, maybe things like Climate Change won&#x27;t be existential threats because then &quot;50 years&quot; isn&#x27;t a long time. Unfortunately we won&#x27;t know how this changes us until it happens, be that for the better or worse.<p>I&#x27;ll leave you with the Fable of the Dragon Tyrant: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cZYNADOHhVY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cZYNADOHhVY</a><p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.worldbank.org&#x2F;indicator&#x2F;SP.POP.GROW?end=2018&amp;locations=EU-US-GB&amp;start=1960&amp;type=shaded&amp;view=chart" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.worldbank.org&#x2F;indicator&#x2F;SP.POP.GROW?end=2018&amp;lo...</a>')
