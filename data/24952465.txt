IIRC usual treatment is to immobilize the arm and eventually, after a year (or two) the shoulder will &quot;unfreeze&quot;. When I read about frozen shoulder I was astonished: no good  underlying diagnosis, little knowledge of what caused it, but clearly knowledge gained in the hardest way - experience over generations.<p>And in this case, rather than wait a year, someone decided to perform &quot;adhesive capsular release&quot; surgery not once, but twice! What happened to &quot;Primum non nocere&quot;: &quot;First, do no harm&quot;?<p>My hat is off to the person(s) who first understood that doing nothing to the shoulder was the correct therapy. And woe to those who prolong suffering by &quot;fixing&quot; what they do not understand.')
