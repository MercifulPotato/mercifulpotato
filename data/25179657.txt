Cataloging inventory by hand is so discouraging. Ps. I didn’t check but I assume I can just upload some CSV with what parts I have etc? The issue is that doing it by hand sounds like a nightmare. Any ideas of attempts to auto scan parts on the floor and giving some estimate at least using open CV etc?
