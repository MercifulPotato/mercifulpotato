Price is nominal (e.g. $1&#x2F;year).<p>2) Increasing price with number of domains held. If I hold myname.com, it&#x27;s $1. If I hold a thousand domain, the last 500 are at $1000&#x2F;year.<p>3) Oversight for transfers. If sold, resale value is capped. Historic domains shouldn&#x27;t be used for spam but perhaps go to archive.org or similar entities.<p>4) Managed by a government institution or not-for-profit with open meetings, salary caps, public records requests, and other (legally-enforceable) checks-and-balances.<p>5) Several TLDs, but you can&#x27;t register in all of them. You can have mybusiness.com or mybusiness.mobi, but not all of the above. If I have the same business name as you (Apple records v. Apple computer), I go to a different TLD.<p>6) Rules for new TLDs. You can&#x27;t pull the Coursera.org &quot;We&#x27;re a not-for-profit&quot; shtick. Old domains grandfathered in.<p>7) Oversight&#x2F;governing board with members from the EFF, FSF, OSF, and so on.')
