In fact, in Twitter&#x27;s case, they explictly altered their policies so that the failure to take action against this very same POTUS would no longer be a blatant failure to enforce it&#x27;s generally-applicable policies.<p>Twitter has apparently had something of a change of heart about that blatant favoritism, and adopted completely new rules to reign in the monster their own rule change created on their platform, but it is not at all the case that the rules that were in place until recently were not crafted with this kind of Presidential action in mind; not only was it generally in minf, the rules were, in fact, created to license this kind of action for the benefit of this specific President, without allowing a level playing field for his opponents.')
