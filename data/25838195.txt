It might be more generic if done right, but having X11&#x2F;Wayland support arbitrary virtual outputs directly seems much simpler and probably performs better. On X11 you can do this if you have an intel GPU by adding stuff to your xorg.conf. That makes it inconvenient and more of a hack than anything, but if this were to exist a layer above and you could simply add and remove them dynamically via xrandr it would be perfect. It had to be duplicated for Wayland though.')
